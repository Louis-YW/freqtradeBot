During this time, you can order a key, once the last of the 210 blocks ticks by, the window closes forever.At the end of the 210 blocks, the number of keys in this set will be finalized, and each key will come numbered on a plaque and ready for you to hang. The number of your order will correspond to the number of the key you get. The first person to buy will get #1, and the last person to buy will get the last one in the series. Whether you pay by lightning or on main chain, your number will be saved the moment you click ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (as long as your transaction confirms within 2 hours of sale end).This will be the only release of the Public Keys, and this set is strictly limited. The numbering of the edition will be determined by bitcoin block height and bitcoiners. Once the 210th block is mined, the edition will be closed forever.The keys are inspired by the meme created by Knut Svanholm,‚ÄúBitcoin: Everything there is, divided by 21 million‚Äù(Video Link) and the original article, released 8/21/20 ‚ÄúDeeper Down the Rabbit Hole‚ÄùMaterials: Acrylic Mirror, Gold Acrylic Mirror, Black Acrylic Mirror, Clear Acrylic, Muosou Black Pigment PaintDimensions: 7.25‚Äù x 7.25‚ÄùWeight: 12ozSTARTING BID: 0.0100BTCMINIMUM BID INCREMENT: 0.0005BTC**Please limit bids to ONLY 4 decimal places**END TIME: OCTOBER 22nd, 2023, 14:00:00 PDT**Payment due within 24 hours of auction end!!**SNIPE: Any bid made in last 5 minutes will extend the auction 5 minutes beyond the ending time.If within those 5 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 5 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid.PAYMENT: bc1q0mj9njt50045qfuzewc4rut7su7cvg8nt89j3cSHIPPING: Based on location and preferenceOWNER: Anonymous",

And does the public key come written in digital form being that the font they used on the plaque is difficult to read, also, does it come loaded with anything? Thank you so much for helping me understand üò¨",
