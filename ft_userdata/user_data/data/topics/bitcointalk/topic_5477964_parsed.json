They'll learn to post here and I'm sure they'll quickly adjust because most of them are really good at posting so no problem there. Casino campaigns will be something that we have to look out for or maybe even have the existing campaigns beef up their funds to accommodate other users or do what Bitvest does, having tiers so they can recruit more at a lower pay. Hopefully we get to see more casinos doing signature campaigns but that's not for me to decide to happen, if they don't see doing a campaign helping them then so be it.",

Not to mention that casinos could reduce minimum posts required on gambling boards, that way there will be no issue, besides, I personally don't give credit to any advertisements I see on profiles, only when I see the ads on the best quality posters, I'd consider the service somewhat worthy. This is a psychological scientific fact, I mean would any of you care to use a casino promoted by a bounty(scam) garbage poster? Of course not, so it's not all about just the exposure, but who is doing the exposing.😉Why it sounds like people who did that are wrong?Yeah they can start become a gambler, they can start to learn about gambling and it's completely fine. You're agree to promote the project, so you should try to learn about the project you're promoting. Of course the casino or manager can ask them to reduce nor delete the minimum requirement in gambling boards, but that's their choice right?The last sentence, you're definitely correct.",

Casinos or other gambling sites are not the same or similar to mixers, they are also still gambling sites. If the sites are not gambling site and see this forum signature campaign to be profitable for them, that is different and that is when what your said is valid.",

And it is also possible that the owners of the mixer campaigns will shift to the casino business here in the crypto space. But this is just my assessment; I'm not sure yet; it may or may not happen.I did read something in the campaign held by @julerz12 that I'm not sure if the coinomize campaign owner intends to continue their project on another platform, and I think I read it in their bounty section on the altcointalk forum that they want to continue.",

I am sure not only casino hires or make promotions here in the forum,  aside from mixer,  we have exchanges carrying out their promotions here in the forum and even also other cryptocurrency-related projects,  so there is no need for any casino both new and old being under pressure to perform in any particular ways.",

I don't see a space to \"fill\" like you mentioned; if you're talking about signature campaigns, then that's a different story. The forum was never limited to mixer promotion; if there are not available campaigns now, I'm sure that a new service will eventually come up to enroll said users. Even if some services migrate to other forums, they'll soon realize that the competitive forums receive nowhere near the traffic we're receiving, which is the main reason why some services that are being advertised are paying peanuts compared to their budget on Bitcointalk.",

Maybe new projects that have something to do with cryptocurrencies will come out. Some of them are in the bounty section but maybe it's time to step up their method of getting more support. The forum is wide and many members are lurking everywhere, not just the altcoins. Perhaps, they could try to target the gamblers too if they want investors and prioritize gambling posts so that it could be seen here. Something else will come up, I can feel it. It's not a casino or a sports bookie but another project that will run for years here in our lovely forum. I just don't know it yet. Well, Bitcoin was not known before but here we are. Gambling sites are also not that big before, but here they are. I am optimistic that this forum has always been the best platform to be advertised widely especially if it's about cryptocurrencies.",

If we think from the point of view of how the market works, then the average payment should fall rather than rise.But regarding the situation that happened, I had other ideas: mixers (and those who stand behind them) are interested in making their business work. It is quite possible that new casinos/bookmakers with the most favorable odds will soon appear, the purpose of which will only be to accept your clean crypto, mix it within themselves and issue it already mixed. To get their market share, these new “gambling” projects will conduct advertising campaigns and they will probably pay a lot - at the level of the outgoing mixers. I don’t know how all this will end - maybe they will be banned over time, since again some state official will declare them a criminal business and the forum will ban their advertising. Or, by analogy with mixers, all casinos (which can also be used for laundering) will be banned. It will be interesting to see all this.As for Satoshi and his legacy, I would not overestimate his importance - yes, he is a historical figure and this is a historical forum, but those who are interested in communication (especially free communication) can easily communicate on forums where this historical heritage does not exist, since the purpose of communication is the exchange of relevant information rather than “reverence” for history.",
