Review can be found belowhttps://sourceforge.net/software/product/Atomswap/#reviewsNo active team, no social pages and site ks just created to scam the people. I appreciate your work as you have checked the full procedure , Just don't trust his appearance. Although you lost 5$ but save many people from big scam.

This reminded me of the recent case with the Whirlwind.money mixer, which also worked exclusively to receive cryptocurrency, but did not withdraw anything back to anyone.Never trust unknown services with full amounts; it is better to first test its work with a small amount, as I did. This saves me once again, it’s better to pay 5-10 dollars and find out the truth than 100-1000 dollars.Yes, their service is fake and does not provide anything. They registered the domain on Tucows. I will report and file a complaint against their scam domain now through: https://tucowsdomains.com/report-abuse/+ Everyone can also avoid platforms that do not have reviews from customers who have tried them and written their feedback. This Atom Swap platform is almost dead and is not known in the search engine or on YouTube.",

This Atom Swap platform is almost dead and is not known in the search engine or on YouTube.People are just too lazy to do their own proper research before dealing with most of these vendors and online scammers. Reviews are there that could help one make a sound decision towards website that seems not too clear with their services and activities. Sometimes review leads to unravel lots of hidden facts about a product which would avail the opportunity for further findings about a product which would either motivate one to continue with them or stop further engagement to avert any future occurrences which would not yield any positive result.",

I am sure they change these because blockchain explorer information shows only one transaction to the address that you posted, and it's the 0.0002 BTC one that you made. https://mempool.space/address/bc1qvx44y5l68gveyg0xa2s669feglyzplx2t6gm8h.No one else ever sent BTC to that address. Since we have other claims on the internet that people have lost money using the service, that's the only conclusion I can make. I don't want to open the website on my own computer to check for safety reasons.",
