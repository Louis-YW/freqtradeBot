Are you just too lazy to do a very basic search in this forum and study existing threads about quantum blabla, threat to Bitcoin blabla, ad infinitum.I understand if you think, wtf dude, piss off. Yeah, I will, I'm just bored by reading your question for likely the thousandth time.If you're not happy or incapable of using the forum search, you can still have a better search experience at https://ninjastic.space which allows an even more fun and fast search experience.Oh and to stay at least a little bit on-topic: as far as I know about quantum computers and their properties, they are still far from a threat to Bitcoin's cryptography. Way too short coherence times for qubits, trouble and need for even more qubits for error correction and simply way way too few stable enough qubits for long enough time to even do some serious problem solving.I don't deny progress in this hot field of research, but frankly I see no real threat for Bitcoin now, in some years or even one or two decades. I could be wrong, I could be right. Who knows? There's also a lot of hot air and buzz in this research field, too, but that's somewhat normal.Quote from: Reatim on April 02, 2024, 09:07:23 PMAddresses who use p2pk are the most in danger, they say. With quantum computers, millions of bitcoin can be stolen but I don’t see any reason right now why we should panic. Isn't it good we have a lot of Satoshi's blocks with so far nearly all unspent P2PK coinbase transactions waiting to be stolen by quantum computing. They are there for the purpose of a canary flag... Clever, isn't it!?Quote from: Reatim on April 02, 2024, 09:07:23 PMBefore quantum computing reach bitcoin, it will most likely find the altcoins first which will give us time to come up with a resistant system to quantum computing.Seriously, why should someone attack a shit altcoin and not Bitcoin first if quantum computers were capable enough? I'd really like to hear a reasonable explanation.",

Quantum computing technology is still a long way off. These computers would be really smart, but they haven't even been made yet. While they could be a threat to the security of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it's going to be years before they become a reality. But in today's world, anything is possible, so I'm sure that  developers are already working on creating cryptographic algorithms that can resist quantum computing power. Quote from: Cricktor on April 02, 2024, 09:12:34 PM Seriously, why should someone attack a shit altcoin and not Bitcoin first if quantum computers were capable enough? I'd really like to hear a reasonable explanation.Lol, seriously he should tell us why he thinks that altcoins would be the first to be attacked by quantum computers ones they are designed. Bitcoins value is beyond compare and so if such computers were to be used, they will go for the bigger fish first before considering altcoins.",

I suspect that these rumors are just nonsense and the purpose behind them is to keep people away from bitcoin, nothing more and nothing less. Stories about quantum computers have been discussed for so many years that they have become boring and only newbies are scared by this nonsense news. Personally, I never believed that quantum computers could affect bitcoin like the news is spreading.",

And what if quantum computing surpasses blockchains, breaking their security before quantum-resistant measures are fully implemented?",

This question has been raised so many times, and my thoughts on this question are always the same, but one thing is, whenever it is asked, I get another thought from another angle. Well, my thoughts are if the existence of quantum computing would be a threat to BTC or any other blockchain technology then why till now any of the companies owning quantum computers do something bad to it? I know if a person has enough hash power that it can create disturbance in the blockchain network. But besides that, I don't think such technology can really break the security of the BTC blockchain or of any other similar protected token.The strategies that can be employed to mitigate this risk (which I don't think is even exists, at least for the next 5 years) can only be made by developers, new encryption methods would be employed otherwise, the technical knowledge I have, is not giving me any other idea.",
