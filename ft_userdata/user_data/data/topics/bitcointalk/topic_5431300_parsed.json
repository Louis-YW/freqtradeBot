But to qualify for that credit, the car needs to be assembled in North America and contain a battery with a certain percentage of the metals mined or recycled in the U.S., Canada or Mexico. Those rules become more strict over time, giving American producers time to preparQuote from: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/biden-administration-awards-2point8-billion-in-grants-for-electric-vehicle-battery-manufacturing.htmlPresident Joe Biden announced $2.8 billion in grants for 20 companies to produce batteries for electric vehicles in the United States.The grants are being allocated through the Department of Energy with funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to companies in 12 states. The funding will go toward the creation of battery-grade materials including lithium, graphite and nickel.Zimbabwe also decided to take advantage and try to boost its economy with some protectionismQuote from: https://www.news18.com/news/world/develop-batteries-for-electric-vehicles-here-zimbabwe-bans-export-of-raw-lithium-6679645.htmlZimbabwe earlier this week stopped the export of raw lithium from its mines and said that it wants cash in on the value addition and also stop losing billions to foreign companies via mineral proceeds, news agencies reported.On December 20, Zimbabwe’s ministry of Mines and Mining Development in a directive published under the nation’s Base Minerals Export Control Act said that the move was made to “ensure that the vision of the president to see the country becoming an upper-middle income economy has been realized.”",

Given the circumstances export bans aren't that unreasonable, I think there'll be a better battery that comes out that can be mass produced better than lithium can (and I think that's the hope as some cars are said to have to travel 250,000 miles to have the same emissions of an electric car battery, but once the lithium is extracted and made into a battery, it can likely be well recycled - with renewables too).I think there should be a crackdown on countries using third countries to avoid taxes too to send from one to another (I think this is done a lot with electronics and pharmaceuticals at least).",

The tech is certainly there, but it's way cheaper to slap lithium into a battery pack and expect it to run as flawless as it can be because the process and the design is already established. For sure, EV manufacturers are actively setting their R&D team on fire pressuring them to find a better alternative than lithium, but for now that will be the case and I think people should embrace it whether they like it or not.But what I don't understand is, why are car manufacturers angry with companies and governments coming up with some solutions to a long-standing problem about vehicle emission and waste? Governments supporting the cause of EV may be concerning to petrol powered cars but not the environment in the long run—if they find a solution to replacing lithium with other minerals that is.",

Sometimes I wonder how my continent would cope with electric vehicles due to the diverse economic and political challenges it is battling. My prediction is that petrol vehicles would still be available for more decades at least in developing nations.Nations trying to protect their industries hurt other nations' economies because of the interconnectedness and interdependence created by globalization. Most nations depend on exports to other nations for economic survival. That is why it is important for trade ministers to always discuss and negotiate trade deals with other nations so that there should be a balanced trade relationship. This is because strict enforcement of economic nationalism policies might give rise to unhealthy competition and reckless trade embargoes between nations.",

Even with smaller cars like the Chevy Bolt a battery replacement can be almost 5 figures or so.This pretty will make many models disposable cars pretty much when they reach a certain mileage because without a proper battery they are worthless. With ice it’s different because you can almost buy an engine from another vehicle at a salvage auction, with batteries it doesn’t work like that.",

I think electric cars will move farther if they use an electric generator to charge the battery from motion energy.such as electrical energy - motion energy, motion energy - electrical energy, and can rotate continuously. the position here must be two batteries to be used as a backup, but yes this must be tried first and be careful so that it is easier and automatic. So you can charge the battery while your car wheels are still rattling and your journey will be farther.Indeed it becomes very problematic if we are far from refueling, especially if we are in the middle of a desert road, certainly not a good thing, because refueling for electric cars is not as easily accessible as other common refueling that many retailers have. in public.Regarding the financing of making, electricity in a country, and its impact is the thing that gets the most attention, considering that the consumption of electricity and batteries is certainly far from what was imagined.",
