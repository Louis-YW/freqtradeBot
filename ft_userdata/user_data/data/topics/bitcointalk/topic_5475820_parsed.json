Williams deserved to win, while Wright got eliminated early like last year.Currently Scott Williams leading vs Danny Noppert (7th World Ranking), so we may have another big surprise.Agree that there is no clear favorite to win this year",

He was 2-0 up in sets, Hempel was in bad shape and not throwing good and even the commentators thought this would be a walkover. Suddenly Hempel scored better and Van Den Bergh missed way too many doubles and eventually even lost. Also watched the match of van Barneveld, one of my favorite players.

Does the scoring goes higher the closer you are to the bullseye or the farther you are?okay, let me explain the rules to you so that you can have a lot of fun with your buddies on new year's eve  each player has three darts, which he throws at the target in immediate succession. depending on the tournament mode, the score is counted backwards from 501 or 301. the points of the fields hit by the player are subtracted, then it is the next player's turn to throw their three darts. only darts that remain in the board are scored. only the first player to reach exactly 0 wins: if the player scores more points than necessary, he has overthrown. it is then the opponent's turn again and they can try to win the game. if it is now the turn of the player who 'busted' (overthrew) the board, he starts again with the score he had before his last throw.the 'double out' mode is the most popular. to finish and win a round of darts, the double ring must be hit and 0 points scored.in 'straight out' mode, any field can be thrown to end the round as long as the player reaches 0 points. beginners are recommended to start with this variant first.",
