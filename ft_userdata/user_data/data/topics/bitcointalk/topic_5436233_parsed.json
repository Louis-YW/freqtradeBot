  "content": "I was able to make some inquiry as to why, we buy fuel at exorbitant amount and still yet the product is not available to buy.There has been some lingering issue between the independent marketers, NNPC, NUPENG AND PENGASSAN.on the side of government it is said that, government makes this product available on a subsidized rate, that is government, takes our crude oil overseas, refines it and sell it at a given price, which is officially 140 naira per litre to independent product marketers which in turn sell it at 150 to retailers, and retailers sell it 165 and. (official government rate). Now here is the intriguing partOn a normal scenario, NNPC upon bringing this refined product to Nigeria, they are supposed to take it to the government owned depot, so that the government scheduled price will be implemented. But rather, NNPC takes this product to private depot and sell it at 180 naira, those private depot sell this product at 190 naira And above to retailers, that is why some retailers are selling around 200 and something Naira and above.As at today, there is a memo by NNPC, that is going round, that the price of the product has increased to 185, it then means some of us will continue to buy this product at 200 and something Naira and above.",
