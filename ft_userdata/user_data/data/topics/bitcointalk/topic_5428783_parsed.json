  "content": "BACKGROUND FUD stands for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. In the context of cryptocurrency, FUD refers to negative or false information that is spread with the intent of causing doubt or fear in the minds of investors, with the goal of lowering the price of a particular cryptocurrency.What the FUD you're spreading on social media accomplishes;There has been a lot of Binance fuds on social media in recent weeks, and it is becoming daily news on Twitter. Binance is without a doubt the largest crypto exchange and must be protected at all costs, while FTX investors and influencers are playing a dangerous game right now, attempting to take everyone down with them following the FTX disasters. True, if Binance fails, thousands of coins will fail as well, and the price of bitcoin would suffer in the long term.Some potential disadvantages of FUD in the cryptocurrency market include:Loss of investor confidence: If investors believe the negative information that is being spread, they may become less confident in their investment and decide to sell, which can lead to a decline in the value of the affected cryptocurrency.Loss of potential investors: FUD can also scare away potential investors who may be considering investing in a particular cryptocurrency. This can limit the potential growth of the cryptocurrency and reduce its overall market value.Damage to the reputation of the cryptocurrency: FUD can damage the reputation of a cryptocurrency, which can make it less attractive to investors and users. This can lead to a decline in its popularity and use, which can in turn reduce its value.Loss of trust in the cryptocurrency market: FUD can also create a general sense of distrust and skepticism among investors, which can make them less willing to invest in any cryptocurrency. This can lead to a decline in the overall value of the cryptocurrency market.BitcoinCleanup.comfor those of you who have free sig and avatar space you can dedicate it to this beautiful initiative by NotATether . we need to protect bitcoin NOW and stop the fud",

There will always be FUD, but we must try not to contribute to it.Unfortunately some of us who know and use crypto-currency already, also contribute in our own way to this fear, uncertainty and doubts (FUD) that can affect usage and adoption of cryptocurrency. We do so when we share negative reports with people who have no knowledge at all, or no concrete understanding about cryptocurrency and can be easily swayed into believing anything they hear, or easily misunderstand what they hear. We must be careful with what we say around people with no knowledge at all, or no concrete understanding about cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "I agree with the main subject that the current circulating FUD about exchanges being insolvent is a negative thing specially since the only thing it is achieving is to force a lot of newbies to panic withdraw from their exchange accounts! This doesn't help anybody or anything considering that these same newbies would re-deposit their funds to the same exchanges after a while! As I said they are panic withdrawing, they have no understanding of \"not your keys, not your coins\" thing.However I disagree with some parts:Quote from: borovichok on December 14, 2022, 11:25:15 PMBinance is without a doubt the largest crypto exchange and must be protected at all costs,Not at all. If anything we should do something that Binance is no longer the \"largest\" crypto exchange. Go back to 2013 and see what MtGox being the largest bitcoin exchange did to bitcoin price. Binance is to altcoins as MtGox used to be to bitcoin. Back then MtGox controlled >85% of the volume and single-handedly screwed up the market, today no bitcoin exchange controls a volume bigger than 10%. But when it comes to altcoin exchanges like Binance they suddenly control a huge percentage of altcoin volumes and it has to change.Quoteif Binance fails, [..], and the price of bitcoin would suffer in the long term.Wrong. Some people will panic sell bitcoin and we may see a drop but it will never be long term. As I said we've already reached a good balance between bitcoin exchanges where nobody controls a large percentage of the volume to have a significant effect on the price.QuoteDamage to the reputation of the cryptocurrency: FUD can damage the reputation of a cryptocurrency, which can make it less attractive to investors and users. This can lead to a decline in its popularity and use, which can in turn reduce its value.I disagree. The only thing damaging reputation of cryptocurrency is the cryptocurrency itself. There hasn't been more FUD about anything apart from bitcoin and we know its reputation hasn't been damaged.Altcoins on the other hand already have a bad reputation for being useless and only used for pump and dumps.",

That of course doesn't mean Binance should be \"protected at all cost\" and similar nonsense, but it is reality as they are that big.",

If you are thinking about investing, get your fund out of the exchange and get really safe storage. Exchanges offer their services, so use them only when you need them and do not make the exchange a long-term repository for your fund.Asking people to take their funds out of a centralized exchange is not FUD when these people are using the exchange as storage. Warning and recommend them are good, but they can decide anything on their own. In fact each of us is responsible for our own funds, but for good advice it is clear we need to consider a safe wallet for long term assets.",

You created a discussion about the need to stop the FUD regarding Binance being insolvent because you think it's harmful to the industry as a whole.
