      "body": "Both are good and can be profitable but the risks of both are high and the loss can be very similar to gambling. You can choose any that you like but know that both are risky. I have been into crypto trading for years and I know someone that have been into forex for a long time too, just that you need to read very well about how to trade. But as for me I prefer crypto trading while forex traders will choose forex.These is very important to take note of:use the money that is lower than the amount you can afford to lose to startuse the money that you can afford to lose to trade when you have known about trading already",

      "body": "I've tried both, so I can speak from my own experience.I lost a lot of money in forex, because things change very quickly and you need to analyze market movements a lot and make quick decisions, and you also need to have enough money to invest to cover your open positions. It is purely about trading.Of course, you can join the crypto as a trader, which is also very risky, but you can also join as a long-term holder, and it is a much safer way to invest.History has shown that anyone who invested in bitcoin and didn't sell it long enough ended up making money. Of course, someone will say that this long-term trend of bitcoin growth will end once and for all, but at the moment it seems to me that there are more optimists about the further growth of the value of bitcoin. Of course, you should still be aware that it is a risky investment, whatever you decide.",

Why should anyone choose Crypto over Forex?Crypto and forex can be both profitable. The only difference that I have seen between for forex and crypto is the \"volatility\". Crypto has the higher volatility than Forex.They're also both have manipulation. However, we have different perspective and experiences in trading forex and crypto. Because of the combined manipulation and high volatility in crypto, it has big chance to hit the stop loss. Unlike forex, you can easily spot the manipulation. That's why most of the profitable traders uses forex. Some cases why anyone choose crypto because they don't know how forex works, others are got hype by their mentors just by showing winning trades not the PNL and WinRate.",

As much as it seems like some kind of old news, I keep reading that only about 5% of those who try to trade in these ways are successful in the long term.The best chance most people have is to buy something cheap, wait a certain period and then try to sell it at a higher price. Of course, everyone can try to be in the 5% that will be successful in the long term. Your money, your risk.",

They are both profitable if that is your point of reference,  what you decide to do will depend on your interest mostly. You can get basic knowledge about trading both cryptocurrency and forex if trading is your interest, and then decide which to stick with. Since you are in this forum, I take it already that you have a solid interest in cryptocurrency, crypto trading should be your interest.",

I'm not disputing that cryptocurrency can offer profits, but one must deal with a knowledgeable person. I'm good at timing the forex market because I'm so calm, especially when news starts to come in around midweek. NFP news is my favorite because huge profits are always made from these news. With the exception of cryptocurrency, which is banned in some countries and has severe consequences, there are no limits or restrictions on the forex market because it was approved by the government.",

This happens to be an advantage for cryptocurrency because you can hodl it but not trade it and after a long time you can still declare profit if price goes higher from what you bought it. Forex trading is not that way sadly, you don't have the opportunity to hodl but only trading for profit or loss.Quote from: ethereumhunter on March 12, 2023, 05:02:50 AMI don't know if Forex can also be like that because I have never used Forex to trade.
