  "content": "Hello people,I currently face a issue on Rollbit.. I accidently made 2 deposits in MATIC on polygon mainnet (~400$) even though they do not accept the mainnet, they only accept matic erc-20 tokens (I saw that too late)So I went to the live-support and asked for their help.They told me I had to deposit another 200$ in order for them to recover the funds, so I did.They took the 200$ the same day (Saturday, 15.07) and still to this day I have not received my recovered funds.I got 2 big questions:1. When will I finnaly receive my recovered funds2. How come a 10 million dollar casino can't implement a cross-chain dapp (like sideshift) to accept literally any crypto on any chain?Support is not answering since 2 days anymore, I really don't know what to do. I even just got banned in the chat asking for my money.EDIT:I finnaly received my recovered funds.Thanks everyone for their take.",

Im just wondering if it takes 5 days to recover a deposit, why not implementing sideshift for deposits. I am sure it wont take 5 days, meaning devs would save a lot of time in the future.I simply don't get it.",

They are using a private key that controls multiple wallet address while they currently don’t have a native polygon network available. They probably finding same wallet to import their private key for your fund’s recovery.I agree that this can be done within few hours but remember that they have other customer and they don’t have specific support that handling this case that’s why they ask you for fee. They are hiring someone that will do your specific. I understand now why they ask you 200$ from their balance since they don’t have supported wallet available for the mainnet of polygon.",

I trust them since as you said I am a very small fish. I also advertise for Rollbit quite a while.People are gambling with hundred thousands there and have no issue, I never had a issue prior to this incident.

The time frame on this kind of issue is indefinite since only few case like this here in the forum and typically user that resolves their issue doesn't update their thread so we don't know what exactly happened. Wait for a week until you update. Rollbit has a signature campaign here. You can assure that they will fixed your case. Afaik, Are you already ban on using chat? What's your current communication?",
