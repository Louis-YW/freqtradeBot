Thank you, SFR10, for mentioning this. I had never heard about it, and I had never known something like this existed. I didn't pay attention at first, but then I decided to search what Punycode/homograph is and got the answer. In case someone else doesn't know what it is,Quote from: https://socradar.io/dont-be-blinded-by-what-you-see-demystifying-homograph-attacks/So, Punycode is a neutral technology designed to represent non-ASCII characters in domain names, while a homograph attack is a malicious activity that exploits the visuPunycode'sities between characters of different scripts, often taking advantage of Punycode’s ability to render internationalized domain names.SFR10, I believe this needs a topic in the Beginner and help section.
