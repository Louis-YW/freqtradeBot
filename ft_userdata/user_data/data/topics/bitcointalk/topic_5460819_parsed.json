  "content": "I saw many AI posters in Combo subscription campaign and one day decided to go through all its participants. And I found several users who have the same pattern of posting: usually one sentence split into three rows. It looked like they are all the parts of one big low quality posting alt account farm. Combo campaign prohibits alt account participation. So this is a violation.Same writing style makes it nearly obvious that it is a farm, but it is not a proof by itself. So I decided to go through their blockchain addresses. If to look at their bitcoin addresses, then many of accounts which have any transactions have an interconnection through using the same Fixed Float exchange, but they have different addresses for this exchange, so I don't think this proof is good enough.But there are interconnections through Ethereum addresses for 5 of 8 campaign participants and one more account not from campaign.I marked accounts for which I don't yet see good proofs with grey.If any hints on how to find other accounts of this farm or how to find proofs for accounts that I didn't find interconnections except writing style yet, it would be good.↔️lunnatic — Combo — archive.org↔️Desscount — Combo —archive.org↔️Inspiron14 — Combo —archive.orgjudaspriest — Combo —archive.org↔️Smitty Werben Man Jensen — Combo —archive.orgSaveOurSea — Combo —archive.orgwaONE — Combo —archive.org↔️CapGelatik — Combo —archive.org-----↔️GelatikKembarlunnatic↔️0x2873F28e551F270338EA4de73189f7F18e3d141A — proof — archive.orghas transactions to 0x53625aff45021d961900dadbeb1535b92f2cd00d, interconnected with:1. 0x2087500147d070dec3187ad84426cb16858d9e6e, Desscount2. 0x873A6dE20E76a7C55E0c6e3241553977158deB81, Inspiron14Desscount↔️0x2087500147d070dec3187ad84426cb16858d9e6e — proof —archive.orghas transactions to 0x53625aff45021d961900dadbeb1535b92f2cd00d, interconnected with:1. 0x2873F28e551F270338EA4de73189f7F18e3d141A, lunnatic2. 0x873A6dE20E76a7C55E0c6e3241553977158deB81, Inspiron14Inspiron14↔️0x446bF788446B40Ca07e42fb1986c4366e46302A2 — proof —archive.orgused by GelatikKembar also↔️0x6e50e0Cf3A42180F497d44113D7F897313573FB3 — proof —archive.orgused by CapGelatik also↔️0x873A6dE20E76a7C55E0c6e3241553977158deB81 — proof —archive.orghas transactions to 0x53625aff45021d961900dadbeb1535b92f2cd00d, interconnected with:1. 0x2873F28e551F270338EA4de73189f7F18e3d141A, lunnatic2. 0x2087500147d070dec3187ad84426cb16858d9e6e, DesscountSmitty Werben Man Jensen↔️0xf7d2836418B055567c9F34e45080baa50955a638 — proof —archive.orghas transactions to 0x4d97326518a5fabf299dac021ea1101e4b9be318, interconnected with:1. 0x618E9257d2eeaAbc98B7137e91751F334Abd8911, CapGelatikCapGelatik↔️0x618E9257d2eeaAbc98B7137e91751F334Abd8911 — proof —archive.orghas transactions to 0x4d97326518a5fabf299dac021ea1101e4b9be318, interconnected with:1. 0xf7d2836418B055567c9F34e45080baa50955a638, Smitty Werben Man Jensen↔️0x6e50e0Cf3A42180F497d44113D7F897313573FB3 — proof —archive.orgused by Inspiron14 alsoGelatikKembar↔️0x446bF788446B40Ca07e42fb1986c4366e46302A2 — proof —archive.orgused by Inspiron14 alsoI'm doing such a big for me investigation with several interconnections through blockchain for first time so if there are any mistakes, then please name them.

Desscount's account has a tag from icopress about interconnection with now inactive Arcas. And Arcas has multiple tags about that account is bought or hacked. lunnatic has the same couple of tags. So it is possibly a farm of bought or hacked accounts and there could be much more of not found yet.",

There's no how they would have exhausted the combination of 26 alphabets and 10 numbers.Basically those accounts are not created to cheat the same campaign - most likely as an alternative to joining another campaign especially about accounts with similar names. However, over time - this mindset can change, especially if no one is aware of the activity and returns to find no connection between the two. Yesterday I found 3 different accounts created around 2015 [2 Legendary and 1 Hero] - but all 3 didn't join the same campaign or maybe I missed something. The three of them collect a number of bounty campaign results in the form of ETH and BNB in ​​the same wallet - but I don't think that's ever a problem as long as they don't cheat.Of course some cheaters are too stupid or don't realize that the account names they created are too similar to be suspected of being an alt. They can argue - but who wants to believe them after there is a connection between accounts?",

And that's right, it takes lot of time both catching and then drawing up a reference post. Dozens of addresses and accounts, many have connections to other accounts, which have further connections. As you can see there are connections with some other investigations which caught some of accounts of this huge farm.Of course there is a probability that there are several farms with account trading between them, but as to me it doesn't matter too much. One farm or several farms but we see cheating, low quality posting, bounty abusing, and even probably scam. If they didn't trash the topics with nonsense I'd hardly start searching, but lots of rubbish instead of discussion makes me a bit disappointed.There probably be more parts in this investigation. Maybe someone will see some idea for own investigation of some interconnections of this farm. But mentioned accounts are surely not the entire list of all accounts of this farm.",

But mentioned accounts are surely not the entire list of all accounts of this farm.Here we have a farm of accounts which got their ranks prior merit system implementation. So when we catch them, this farmer has less opportunity to take part in signature campaign. So there probably will be less trash in the topics. Of course he has more accounts, but sooner or later he'll face with a situation when he'll need to buy more accounts or to try to make new and to get ranks for them, but it's not as easy. So this still has sense.If we'd talked about newbies and social media bounty participants then it was less practical to waste time on alt accounts as it is easy to make as many new ones as an abuser will like. But signature campaigns is IMO not the same.",

But luckily it depends on if I want to do something at the time or not. It's not a job. If I'll feel that I don't want to do something like that I can do what I want, if I will have some time and interest in investigation I can make new part. I'm free to do or not to do. But if there will be less nonsense in topics it is good.As for interest of the farm holder, he probably doesn't want to attract additional attention not to risk too many of his accounts to be revealed additionally.",
