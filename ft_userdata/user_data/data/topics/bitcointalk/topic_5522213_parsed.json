  "content": "& see how such a robust unit of account in the hands of an ever-growing and using-it population can pave the way for vast ('tangible') changes in society - and for the better.Putting our greed aside and looking at what the next applications of P2P digital coin (yes, The og BTC one) can be.. What should not be acceptable or perhaps not possible with money? Debasement is addressed with pre-planned issuance and a cap. What about the other methods of manipulating economic forces to one's advantage.. like excessive taxation..? Obscure money-flowing-ways: corruption at worst / waste of the 'could be resource' that is cash, at best..?These 'things' are being countered the more we use Bitcoin *natively*, really integrated in regular day to day fiscality (unsure if even a word). An excellent opt-out of certain facets of trad-society-syst'economics BUT at a cost and the danger of turmoil (i.e. worse economic 'grounds') for all if we don't go all the way with this 'cost' (to our own conveniences at first, one could say an opportunity cost). With each day going by where two opposing alternative systems coexist (parasitically driving each other more 'down' in debauchery), we are eroded of what Bitcoin is here to do: set one stage of monetary policy atop which the whole world might just have to change their entire economic/money routine to survive (no class spared of change) and in doing so, improve our stance as a species.I could see BTC and another digital currency both having their place, but to have the sheer numbers of projects/tokens we have now instead of concentrating our efforts at specific points in these still early days of true financial freedom.. to me.. is just too bad.. Just some thought here  I wonder if satoshi / other veterans still come on here from time to time, still, and try advocate for an always bettering way; one that BTC has been, is (or should be, for the more pessimist), paving since.. let's say a 'solid' 10 years now! Time for facing reality; long gone are its days of infancy.. will the community align sooner or later 'ala revolution?!'.. because this tech isn't out of the jungle just yet.. We need a joyous concerted effort to establish something here even before rebuilding-of-the-world work can actually begin right..?",

      "body": "bitcoin has changed alot in its near 16years,  however mainly since 2017 onwards not for the goodbitcoin was measured in 2010 to have the possibility of 1mb of data allowing for over 4000tx, and yet with the changes since 2017 we have not seen a average of 1mb=4000tx, heck we are at a possible 4mb allowance with not even 16000tx average, not even 8000tx averageinfact the main reference client(core) does not even do its job properly. it doesnt count every byte, it doesnt even validate every byte, its not even coded to ensure every byte serves a lean purpose to allow efficient transfer of sats from source address to destination address..  it has moved away from its purpose and instead has become something that allows junk bytes to be added at a cheaper fee rate than transactional data. the politics governed by core devs have allowed bitcoin to be less efficient, purely because those governing cores development are sponsored by corporations that want to promote other networks as the solutions to where users need to move to.. and its a shamewe should be actually petitioning, scrutinising, reviewing and criticising the core devs when they made and make plans that dont help bitcoin become better.",
