It's more than just a joke; it's a movement.I don't know what you mean by serious business?! These meme coins are launched on a primitive domain that only contains a roadmap and promises by its teams, the token contract, and the method of purchasing it. But if you look at the memecoin team, the whitepaper, or the use cases of the token, you will not find anything.As for real communities, I assume that these communities that you see were provided with devious methods. These memes were and still were created for jokes and specifically for investors who dream of getting rich quickly, and many of them were turned into shitcoins and scams, as Xal0lex mentioned. I believe that these meme coins may trend if one of them is lucky enough to have one of the major influencers mention it, or it is possible after the owners of its project carry out massive promotional campaigns for it on social media and its logo is widely used. Therefore, choosing the most promising legit meme coin and getting rich from it depends on luck, given that there are so many currently existing meme coins on the market, and some of them impersonated the names of the official projects. In addition, I have not heard of the $Opium token before, which you mentioned, and perhaps many are like me.",

Memes are famous because it's all over the internet, almost anyone can relate, understand, and enjoy the meaning behind it. Meme coins may take on almost the same meaning as these memes, but they're an absolute joke(at least nowadays) when you consider the context of what cryptocurrency is. It takes the fun out of what makes memes fun when you continuously have scams and whatnot associated with it.",

If we're considering bitcoin as the father of this market, the crypto market and considered as the king. Then there is Dogecoin as the king of all memes and where it all started. Followed by the other popular meme coins like Shiba, Pepe, etc. Too many to mention and their success can't be denied and how many of the folks here have cashed out a lot of money from these meme coins are uncontested.Quote from: NFTflow8545 on October 16, 2023, 03:18:11 PMbut they are turning into serious business with real communities behind them. It's true about having backed by real communities that the founders of it have built. Many have leaned towards these meme coins because they've seen the love from its communities and it has been left there. It's just so hard to believe that before they were like nothing and impossible to be seen as projects that would have that much volume but then we saw during the last bull run that many of them became the apple of the eye. Even with that, I'll still not going to be serious with them and I am able to get some profits through it, I'll not reinvest on them and likely just going to let everything on my pockets empty until I sold most of them that are remaining on me.",

What are those coins, and what are the use cases of that shitcoin?Well, I don't want to say that this OPIUM token is a scam, but just looking at the name of the token alone, and the fact that it's a meme coin is already a red flag for me, and I just hope that newbies will not try to invest money into this type of project.Quote from: NFTflow8545 on October 16, 2023, 03:18:11 PMMeme tokens started as funny internet stuff, but they are turning into serious business with real communities behind them. $Opium, with its cool idea and excited supporters, seems like it's going to be a standout meme token.
