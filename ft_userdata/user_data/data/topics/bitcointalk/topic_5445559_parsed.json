But it will take so much time, and you will still miss out many data that are lost or cryptocurrency being decentralized would make it hard to find. Even in you can find all the data, it will take ages to calculate the whole thing and come up with a result. Even that wouldn't be 100% accurate. So there's a way, but it's nearly impossible but not totally. It is also said that,( ''Past performance does not indicate present and future performance\" )So you need to focus on the present and not worry about the past, how much has been invested in this. You could just look at the present on how good it is doing and make your plan based on it.",

Only difference is it's not the amount invest at its cost but it's current value. Imagine a small market. If you see it in a way that a person A has 2 Bitcoins which he purchased at $2000 each from C and a person B has 3 Bitcoin which he purchased at $3000 each from C. Now the Last traded price is $3000 therefore market cap is 5 bitcoins x 3k = 15k, now if A buys 1 more bitcoin from B at $4000, the new market cap is now 5 x 4k = 20k. Now technically new money in the market is 4k but the value increase of market is 5k. So market cap is not the money invested at it's cost but at it's current value.",

For instance, CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko (CG) will show their respective data, which will not be identical. Additionally, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization does not necessarily equate to the total amount of money invested. In fact, only Bitcoin's market capitalization would be considered accurate due to the absence of pre-mining, and its circulation is real. Therefore, there is no genuine data available for total market capitalization that can be deemed 100% accurate. Google only displays sources of the data.",

Some crypto assets are designed and engineered with privacy and anonymity in mind. These so called privacy coins might obscure transactions and market cap to some degree. Although given recent regulatory crackdowns these assets and design methodology appear to be on a decline.",

And that's just an estimate where we do not know the exact amount.Meanwhile, Google is sometimes irrelevant in giving the answers we want. For example, if we want to search for something through Google, we will be given a list of sites that Google thinks are the answers. But after we explore one by one, we don't find the answer we want. So I don't think you can simply get the total money invested in crypto.",
