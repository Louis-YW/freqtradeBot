  "content": "This na health matter naim I carry come oo, because Oyibo say \"your health is your number 1 wealth\" meaning your health even important pass money wey dey ur aza Lol, above all we nor go fit neglect our health for anything because if we nor dey healthy to even carry our laptop or phone write for this forum go tire us,and no way for us to go work wen we take dey get money sef, so today I come to talk about some food dem wey we dey eat for naija wey get nutritional benefit but in one way or the other e dey hammer our system and organs, and if we no take care e fit make us sick and we go spend better money take treat am.True fact about food na be say, the way your body dey na because of the kind food wey you dey consume and some of these food dem if you no fit stop am I go recommend make you reduce the way you take dey consume am.1. Ice fish and frozen chicken: this one dey very popular for the world at large and some persons dey consume am almost every day either fried, dried or steamed, even some public occasions na this food dem dey serve, the chemical wey dem take dey preserve this product na formalin and this formalin na very  poisonous chemical wey severe exposure or only two table spoon fit cause death to human being, and this na still watin dem take dey embalm dead body for mortuary. So just imaging if only two spoon fit kill person that means the some percentage wey we dey take in through these food dey do small small unnoticed damage for our body system wey na long term effect.Another alternative to take substitute this ice fish and frozen chicken na to buy fresh fish from our local surrounding like market eg na point and kill, river fish etc then for the fowl side na to buy alive fowl oo if e hungry you to chop.2. Red meat (aka beef): this one go burst your head, red meat wey we fit get from cow, goat, ram, bush meat, etc research say if you eat am too often in large quantity say e go cause heart disease.And for Nigeria we dey hardly hear of cancer but the most common among us naim be breast cancer]https://www.facingourrisk.org/XRAY/does-eating-meat-affect-breast-cancer-risk#:~:text=Among%20women%20who%20ate%20red,red%20meat%20(lowest%2020%25).]breast cancer and this red meat sef dey cause am. So any female wey u no wey dey eat red meat well well abeg, advise her to reduce the way she dey eat am oo. Those people wey be vegetarian na one of the best decision for life wey dem take be that o because the vitamin for the leaf wey dem dey eat well well go help dem build their immune system, and also leaf na one thing wey dey help the body to create enough blood.Alternative for red meat na White meat, all poultry birds na white meat and you go fit use am replace red meat3. Soda(aka soft drink): these soft drinks eg fanta, coke, sprit, Pepsi, etc are all soda and dey are know to containing sugar in large quantity, no mind the one way dem title zero sugar naim worst pass, soda get potential to cause  type 2 diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, and an increase risk of heart disease and cancer. No be only soda fit do this damage including fruit juice, all these drinks dem dey contain artificial sugar and that one nor dey good for the body, e fit cause bladder cancer.4. Akpoo (aka fufu): for this modern day people nor dey get patients to do something well, I day I over hear person been dey say dem don dey use hypo to make cassava ferment sharparly, so e no ho con reach the exact 3 days again na just few hours, and if you observe well for those of us wey dey buy am well well some of dem nor dey smell like den days, before if you eat akpoo person wet near you go no but now no way because of artificial process involved by large producers.Then the one wey con pain me pass na the one wey I see korokoro when dem dey use kerosene for fresh akpu wey dem never pound say na for preservation, omor when I see this one my spirit first week I been just dey short of words. Finally truth of the matter be say food wey dey last well well for our belle when nor dey make us hungry quick when we eat am, na because our liver dey struggle to digest am, to us we fit see am as economical food but to our health we dey over work the liver and this nor good for am eg akpoo, beans, red meat, fatty food etc. Even if e dey difficult to stop dem make we just minimize the wey we dey consume dem.Sound in case you still no any other food wey dey harmful to our health you fit voice am oo.",

They're the easiest and most affordable food for the common man and no wonder dem say, rubbish food dey cheap. Red meat wey we dey manage, wey be say with the least 1k you dun buy meat to use chop eat. How dem expect poor man to avoid them. I know e no easy but make we try too dey follow this instructions dem because e good for us. White meat get less cholesterol than red meat and na one of the reasons wey dem say make we avoid red meat (e get very bad cholesterol but many of us no go sabi dat one).Quote from: Obari on October 08, 2023, 11:52:42 PMMake all this dieticians get out with their rubbish advice because e be like na almost everything we go stop to dey chop if we dey listen to all of this things Little one to add @op, try make you edit your post and make it shorter if you want engagement because nobody go reason your matter or this thread with this length.Aswr like now everything dun bad, I remember when dem been dey advise us to eat red meat but now na white meat be the next agenda. Abeg the cow dun stop to dey chop grass wey their meat no good again but Las Las we need to listen to them because them get point for everything wey dem dey talk but normally you no go listen finish as you go do stop where your money reach. Na dem went us to dey buy online fowl and turkey wey dey cost like wetin I no know. PS: This post no long chairman, this is okay for an informative post like this, there's nothing wrong with the OP been big, some post are for informative purpose and if the OP been add more information e no go still bad. Na reply wey supposed dey short and straight to the point although e no bad when you have meaningful things to say to always express yourself. OP you try wella and I go revisit this thread in future.",

Na why doctors go talk say make you day chop vegetables and more of fruit, they no say make you no chop oo but to reduce the intake. Everything way we day chop get their different proportion, cause too much of everything na disease. Fish good for body, make we no forget that one, all this thing way them day try stop us from eating, still day do something for body, for instance that red meat they give better protein, iron, zinc and B vitamins. You see all these nutrients the body need am, but still we gats know the level how we day take am. Na why exercise day very important with am you fit day burn up the fat for body.  Anything way day enter our body suppose be fresh, but no be so no be every body get that kind privilege. But still more of veggies no bad at all, all this plants get more nutrients pass all this meat we day chop. If you wan try am start one month smoothie challenge then see the out come way go follow. Me !! I day chop anything way I see but as long say I day take am at the exact proportion, and I day exercise too so I day make sure my system and body day feel the burn. Health is wealth, get better health so that you go fit enjoy you money.",

One set of people wey I cherish most naim be vegetarians, especially the ones wey know the value and wattin Dem dey do. Red meat normally no too good when you eat am in excessive quantity, especially for adults wey don grow all the necessary growth for live, wey be say na ageing just remain, that red meat go fit give Dem very bad heart disease or even liver problem due to tough digestion. Na why protein dey much recommend for children and less for adults. We fit feel say we dey enjoy ourselves but unknown to us say na kill we dey kill ourselves.",
