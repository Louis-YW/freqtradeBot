  "content": "I know this is a totally stupid question, but is it possible to send sMerit to myself? I got curious because I was recently messing around checking options, buttons, etc. on my BTT account. After a while, I found a post that I had posted previously. Beside the post, I noticed the +Merit button, which we use to merit others. Out of curiosity, I clicked the button, and it took me to the merit-sending page. I'll attach an image for better understanding. So if anyone knows anything, can you please elaborate?P.S. I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know if it works or not.",

In the first place, meriting oneself is not possible, so something that is not possible can't break a rule as there will be no rule for something that can't even be done.Meriting one's alt account is merit abuse, for which the abuser might get the punishment of getting their account tagged, but I don't think there is anywhere in the forum rules that states that they will be banned unless I miss those parts, and I will be glad if you can share the link to those and let me correct my path.",

Well, you have the answer now and it would be great if you lock this thread. Once again, the answer to your question is, NO. It is not possible to send merits to yourself. You can only send merits to other forum members as .any times as you want as long as you still have smerits.",

It was just a simple question. You can't just tell from first sight he is greedy he is bad etc. As for your information I shared my sMerits to other users whom I saw fit. You can check it yourself.
