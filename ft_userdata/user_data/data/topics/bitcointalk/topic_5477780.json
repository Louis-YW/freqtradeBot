  "content": "Some weeks ago i started my Cryptonews site called Cryptotalk.tech, the idea wasn't to collect the news from the main News sources and pot them in 1 site, and i did it with RSS Feed. On the end of each post, i add the Autor and the Source to make it fair for all. While i was working in the project i asked to the community what would they change in the site, and you can see all the implemented ideas on this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466125.0And some users asked me if i could create a post about their services, that's why yesterday i finished the new section called Community Projects. Where the idea is to have an area where users can find project made by the cripto community on this forum.How it works?1.- Go to https://cryptotalk.tech/community/2.- Fill all the data:Code:-Your name-Your email-Your Website-Article Title-Author-Image Link -Article Boddy-Your Social Networks / comments3.- SubmitSimple right? i will verify the data, and if the project looks legit i will make the post and let the user know after this get's done.This is a free service, and if you have any questions please let me know.News Site: https://cryptotalk.tech/Telegram bot: https://t.me/cryptotalktech",
