I've said this before but it'd be great if casinos would offer an alternative where they can credit your deposit instantly but only if you follow their required miner fees.",

I hope your gambling platform does very well and gains the trust of our community by active engagement and good moral conduct. As far as my thoughts on your gambling platform go:The slogan \"bet your beans\" seems like an extremely dangerous betting experience (for a man). Are you sure thats the marketing approach you want to take with advertising gambling? I might be wrong, I would love to know the reason behind the slogan.As to the things I cannot stand in betting apps: Delays, bugs, and bad user experience design.",

It's really hard to play on that kind of platform, specially if you win big and let's say you did in the right way and you are just lucky to win. And suddenly the site ask you for KYC and then the withdrawal process took days to the point that you feel that the site is trying not to give you your winnings, in short trying to scam you, that will be the worst experience ever.",

Itâ€™s the reality that a lot of gamblers have experienced especially when they fail to verify their identification for big payment rewards. Maybe this is one thing that should be given quick response from casino operators as no gambler would want to stay in casino if there are issues like this.",

Being active here in the forum is a must. That messy layout and the related thing is already a basic problem and obviously, once you start the service, you should also have a good layout. If you can't even work on a good layout, how much more to the service?Payouts - of course as much as possible, should be processed as fast as they can. Doesn't need to be instant but if that's possible, then good.KYC - as long as the site is not heavily pressured by the regulators, try to maintain a no-KYC policy on the site.",

Users don't want to be hung up and wait for several days waiting for their tickets to be responded to regardless of the volume the site is receiving every day. Aside from quick payouts, also the deposit amount should be reflected right away once it was fully confirmed on the blockchain.Enhanced also the security and ensure that funds are safe from those who will attempt to make such bad attacks on the site.",

Many of the casinos decide to ask the member for verification and ask for it when the member wants to withdraw big money.But maybe you can give us your site so we can see how it looks and maybe we can give you some useful advice.
