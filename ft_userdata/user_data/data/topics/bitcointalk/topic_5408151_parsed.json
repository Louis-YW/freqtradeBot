  "content": "Our world is filled with so many myths, superstitions, and legends of one form or another. And gambling is no exception.Â  So many people hold fast to them because they believe in their potency. For example, in my culture, though it is not related to gambling, one of the superstitions I find quite funny is that, whistling or playing any sort of wind instrument after 9pm is forbidden because it is believed to attract evil spirits. I have never played cards at a casino before but as a kid growing up, I played a lot of card games with family and friends. I was shocked to find out that there are myths, superstitions, and legends about playing cards. Below I have compiled some of popular myths, superstitions and legends about playing cards. After reading it, I would like to know what you have heard about playing cards.1. Walk three times around the playing table for good luckQuoteSometimes luck is just not on your side when playing a card game which can result in a losing streak. It is believed that your luck can change when you walk around the table three times before continuing the game.2. It is bad to sing, whistle, or drop cards while playingQuoteThis belief largely comes from Chinese superstition. Singing, whistling, or dropping cards when playing is considered disrespectful and a sign of rudeness.3. Avoid crossing your legs when playingQuoteOne of the older myths when playing cards is the belief that players should not cross their legs when playing. It is said that doing so would destroy any chances of winning a game.4. Donâ€™t buy a deck for yourselfQuoteThis belief is rooted in using cards for a tarot reading. It is considered bad luck to buy it for yourself. Additionally, you canâ€™t use the same deck for both tarot reading and playing cards.5. 52 is a lucky numberQuoteAccording to Asian tradition, 52 is a lucky number in card games. In numerology, the number means good fortune and positive change. The most common belief, however, is that the 52 cards are meant to represent the 52 weeks that pass in a year. Additionally, the four card suits represent the four seasons and the 13 cards within it represent the 13 weeks within each season.6. Getting a dark hand has a dark meaningQuoteIt is commonly believed that when you have a hand consisting of an all-black card suit, that means that someone will die.7. The Joker and December 31QuoteWhile December 31st is popularly celebrated for the coming of New Year, it is also known as the Jokerâ€™s birthday. In the olden days, it was considered a day for merriment. On this day, court jesters can showcase their best performance and impersonate royalties such as the King.8. Cards were used to send secret maps by POWs during WWIIQuoteThe most fascinating legend about playing cards comes during the time of World War II. Allied Prisoners of War held across Germany and occupied Europe were allowed to receive packages from the Red Cross thanks to the Geneva Convention. Seeing this as an opportunity, the Allies smuggled several disguised items to POWs to avoid detection from the enemy captors. With the help of the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC) and their brand, Bicycle, they produced a deck of cards that had a hidden map within it. The map hidden on the card was revealed once submerged in water and soft enough to peel off the outer layers. Each card contained a piece of the map and was assembled once all the pieces were revealed. The map, once assembled, contained valuable information within it, including escape route directions, to help POWs to escape and reach safety. These cards were distributed during Christmas, as part of Red Crossâ€™ Christmas parcels. 32 POWs managed to escape captivity with help from the map. This unique collaboration between the Allied Intelligence and USPCC was commemorated by the reproduction of the decks. 9. The Left Hand CurseQuoteWhen sitting at the poker table or playing any other card or table game, itâ€™s believed (according to Chinese superstition) that using the left hand is rude and doing so will see the player being punished by the gods. As such, all players must use their right hand (even left-handed players).10. Striking a needle into fabric worn by a particular person would help them win at cardsQuoteIn old fables and tales, it is believed that striking a pin or a needle into the fabric (clothing) of the person you wish would win the card game would cause them to win. It could only work if the person didnâ€™t see you sticking the needle into their clothing.11. Card playing on Friday before six is a big NO!QuoteA typical old superstition says that playing cards on Friday before 6 pm is considered to be a bad omen. Waiting until after 6 pm was the norm.12. You shouldnâ€™t play cards after midnightQuotePlaying card games after midnight, especially at 3 am, is considered bad luck. Some legends say that playing cards at 3 am could leave you open to demons.13. You need mathematics skills to play BlackjackQuotePeople believed that Blackjack required considerable mathematical skills, but thatâ€™s not true! To be able to play the game, you simply have to learn the rules and practice.14. The kings on the cards are depictions of real kingsQuoteSome people believe that the four Kings of a playing card deck represent four real-life kings through history: Charlemagne, David, Caesar and Alexander. There was a time in the history of cards when French card designs were the most commonly used throughout Europe and French card designers liked to assign identities to the royals pictured on their cards.15. Players of the Ander Bahar card game have a 50% chance of winningQuoteAnder Bahar, a card game that originated in India, and they say that players have a 50-50 chance of winning.What myths, superstitions, and legends have you heard about playing cards.Sources:https://livecasino.io/blog/casino-tips/the-joker-playing-cardhttps://giftsforcardplayers.com/card-games-myths-and-superstitions-you-want-to-know/http://greatbridgelinks.com/myths-about-cards/https://www.gamesver.com/card-games-superstitions-myths-legends-about-playing-cards/",

Walk three times around the playing table for good luckI will try this the next time I play cards with my friends ðŸ˜‚ although I think they will have the impression that I am just trying to see the cards they have.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 30, 2022, 02:09:27 PM2. It is bad to sing, whistle, or drop cards while playing3. Avoid crossing your legs when playingI think this superstition was fashioned to ensure that people stay serious while playing and not take a relaxed position.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 30, 2022, 02:09:27 PM9. The Left Hand CurseA lot has been said about left-handed people in many cultures I think they are all superstitious and unfounded. People say these things probably because the be left-handed is a deviation from the norm and regular which is right handedness.Generally all these things just like any other superstition work only when you believe them if you don't believe them they won't work with you.",

They often borrow cards from our neighbor to play their games and they usually confront players that crosses their legs during their whole time playing cards. I don't know the exact reason why they do this but I think it's kinda weird. Also, the card dealer on their games often has to use their right hand when tossing the cards over. There was this one incident wherein my uncle accidentally tossed one card with his left hand and he was immediately replaced by my aunt after my grandfather commented that it brings bad luck.",

To be honest, it's only true to those who believe in it and by destiny's chance it happen on him/her will just have to support that fact. I don't think superstitions still exist on players nowadays or if ever they still believe in it, likely acceptable to the older generations.",

I knew some gamblers who hated me for doing it since it welcomes bad luck however there are a lot of gamblers who do so but still on a winning streak. I don't think that most of this are that common at all based from the replies above as well. Anyways, thanks for sharing and I'll try to do and avoid these once I'll be able to go back on the casino.",

I wonder today if they still think like that, as I haven't played cards for years, so I don't know if they still have that funny belief.",

I just can't find any logic on some superstitions that's why I don't believe most of the superstitions. I honestly don't know almost all of the superstition, myth and legends that OP put in the list. I'm always doing #3. Every time I gamble It's my habit to do cross legs, I'm sure that I am doing it involuntarily and don't find it unlucky since I've been doing it for a very long time now. I'm also doing #2 which is whistling. It seems my luck isn't going opposite because I violate some superstition without knowing it.",

But, they in effect, provide something that gives the gambler the feeling of peace and comfort before they gamble. You can associate this like doing a pep-talk; it gives this certain boost of confidence and fearlessness to the gambler before he/she attempts to gamble on his own pace.Though this may be the case, people should not fully rely on these beliefs. But if these activities help them in reducing the stress, anxiety, and their doubt, then I see no reason for them to stop practicing such myths.",

In Nigeria and the local where I am, I think there are some similarities to the list made out there like number 5 and 9 but for number 5 , it is not about 52 which comes as even number but about numbers ending in odd form and so picking such numbers that are odd is not really a popular choice, people will select or call for odd numbers or numbers ending in odd forms , they see such as negative. And number 9, using of the left hand to play games or the use of it for anything is linked to the reason for misfortune if it happens so. And some playing with left is looked as dangerous.",

Superstitions do not make sense to me because of this reason.",
