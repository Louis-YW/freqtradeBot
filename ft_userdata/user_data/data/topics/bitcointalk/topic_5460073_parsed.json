He cannot campaign against what will cause him loose users, even though he himself knows about the risk a centralized exchange like him has.This discussion is not best fit here, move it to exchanges or maybe service discussion board.",

Very misleading indeed. Binance have yield plans too but their returns are doable for long term, they don't provide any high yield investment plans and CZ is probably warning people against the patronizing of such HYIP offers, they are dangerous and unsafe. Binance exchange is fine for now but we don't know what the future might bring, do not leave your asset on any crypto exchanges, either popular or not, loss of assets can still happen.",

While, sometimes I use them but I don't trust any exchange to have my fund so, they're just being used as is by me.What I have noticed with those APYs that they've is that it changes over time and I think it's all due to the demand, the more people goes into it, the lesser the APY becomes.At the end of these discussions, never trust an exchange whether you're there for APY or trades and mostly, never ever use them as a cold storage.",

If assuming Binance is doing business practices with high APY as their own CEO warned, I think slashing expenses to the equivalent of 1k employees salary I don't think will be enough, however binance is a juggernaut in the exchange industry which you can imagine the number of users.",

Over the years, the more it gains popularity and the more competitive the business becomes, the more it's forced to adopt things that he thinks might help the exchange gain more customers. From the beginning, he might have seen APY as a means of a platform attracting customers to defraud them, but right now he has discovered that there are ways he can also be rewarding its customers and at the same time gaining profit from the staked coins or tokens. Because they expect rewards, the exchange is also making some profits.Quote from: dimonstration on July 17, 2023, 04:14:09 PMQuote from: Ever-young on July 17, 2023, 10:33:03 AMYour information sounding misleading to me, to proper content to prove all your statements, neither are their reference/source link.

On November 13, Binance's CEO confirmed that at least three users faced unexpected transactions on their accounts after sharing their API Keys with third-party platforms Skyrex and 3Commas.He then recommends the user delete the associated API key. CoinMamba claims to have been a client of Binance for over five years, and he is still opening futures positions on the platform.As far as I know that's what actually happened, the CZ tweet that you mentioned was not true, what actually happened was as below.QuoteThe upload was later deleted but is still available as a screenshot on a thread. CoinMamba user accounts are then closed for three days to withdraw funds. According to CoinMamba's tweet, According to CoinMamba's tweet, 3Commas denies any exploitation of its protocol and database. Therefore, there is no liability for stolen API keys.",

But then again we shouldn't even be taking everything seriously. CZ was just trying to push his competitors down hoping it could end them when they were at their most difficult times. CZ has this monopolistic tendency. He's this shrewd dirty businessman. When Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Huobi, Crypto.com, Bittrex, BitMEX, and other competitors of his laid off hundreds or even thousands of workers, he quickly took the opportunity to warn the public against using platforms that lay off workers. Binance didn't lay off a single staff at that time, so those others are risky platforms and traders should avoid them. Common sense tells us that CZ was simply telling people to leave their exchange and use Binance instead.",

Binance has been accused of insider trading often without numbers and trust me, any organization that involves money that is not televised is most often than not into some shady stuff in the background, but will come out publicly to deny it that they don't do it but in fact, they do it. I know that even Sec has been a d!ck these days but they have also accused them of this behaviour and CZ now wants to tell the public how to be purified with the platform they choose to trade, he should redeem his exchange organization first.People should know that when something is too real, they should avoid it especially when it has to do with money; High Apy or APR are most of the time scams and platforms that make promises on an empty pocket, they do that just to siphon money from the public and then go into hidden, so even if Binance and CZ are crooks, avoid high APY platforms because as soon as your money goes into their exchange, it is never coming back again.",
