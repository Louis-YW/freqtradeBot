The first is the extremely high APY. How will such high payouts be maintained? When I see hundreds of thousands of percent, I immediately have a bad association with some kind of scam. I just do not remember any well-known project to offer such high rates. And second, I went to your website, tried to buy tokens, clicked the Buy Token button and nothing happens. I understand that this feature is not yet available and tokens can only be bought on the Gamepad?",
