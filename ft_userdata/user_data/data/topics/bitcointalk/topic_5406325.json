Bitcoin is just a payment method. It can only fix problems that are related to payment methods - like getting money from Person A to Person B with minimal friction and no obstructions from the government or other third parties. Clearly the problems with drug industry has nothing to do with financial transactions, so Bitcoin can't offer anything here.",

While some die-hard Bitcoin fans like to portray Bitcoin as the cure-all technology, it doesn't need a genius to realize its absurdity. It's all exaggeration. Bitcoin is no silver bullet. As a matter of fact, quite frankly, if Bitcoin suddenly dies today, the world would go on as usual as if nothing has changed. That's how insignificant Bitcoin actually is to the world. Although to a few of us, it's a great loss.",

I find it funny when people try to reason or solve literally all problems with bitcoin. Don't know what made you think that bitcoin can help fix the \"big pharma\" problem. It can't. But maybe yeah, that \"lone doctor\" could share his wallet address publicly and tell people to donate so he can continue with his research?",

Who the hell told you that?The current patent system has to be replaced by a rewards system, so the inventors get paid a big prize by the government, when they invent something new(of course their invention has to be really useful for the human kind).The patent system makes all new inventions more expensive, because the inventors get paid royalties for every product that has been sold.This is one of the reasons why newly invented remedies are so expensive. The other reason is big pharma companies investing millions of dollars in research and testing. How do you think that Bitcoin(or the BTC blockchain) can solve a problem like this?Viewing Bitcoin as a panacea to every problem has always been really annoying to me.",

It seems, as has been commented, that it is more economically in the interest of pharmaceutical companies to have chronic patients than to cure them.

Of course Bitcoin cannot solve problems its just code but its people who solveproblems and especially people with the finances and will to do so.Everyone knows what Bitcoin was designed for but everyone knows too that there is a speculative nature to it too. We all believe to some degree or anotherthat Bitcoin is going to go up.So the OP is essentially asking that if Bitcoin does what everyone expects will itto will it facilitate someone to fund this doctors claims?",

I see no way for bitcoin to fix this situation. It's not even related to finance or financial inclusion whatsoever. I don't see how bitcoin can jump into it and fix the issue to be honest.
