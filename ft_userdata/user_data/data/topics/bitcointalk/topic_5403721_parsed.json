Suppoman said its his 2nd best buy after Moonbeam It has been hyped heavily and dumped heavily.  From $542.58 it was dumped to the $30+ and now at $58.  Is Suppoman starting to hype these coins again?  This statement[1] that appeared from google search seems interesting.QuoteWalletInvestor describes the cryptocurrency as a “bad” long-term investment. It forecasts a continual climb for EGLD, which, it said, should drop to $4.25 by the end of 2022. Its Elrond price prediction for 2025 is for the coin to fluctuate around $1. That prediction looks scary but the following prediction after that all states a positive climb in price and an unrealistic projection of 5 digits per piece. Well just do your own research, you can use the reply on this thread as a reference but do not follow them until you have done your digging.[1] https://currency.com/elrond-price-prediction",

The price has been dipping so hard. Thinking about this to go up again may still possible but as long as bitcoin will be bullish as well. Quote from: Loco1887 on June 23, 2022, 06:53:27 AM Is it a good buy?It's good to buy if you wanna gamble your money onit. Quote from: Loco1887 on June 23, 2022, 06:53:27 AM Suppoman said its his 2nd best buy after Moonbeam I don't even trust this guy. This guy was getting paid to promote. That guy already bought at the dip and if you are following him and you are only buying at the higher rate than what he has bought. Being smart and think again.",
