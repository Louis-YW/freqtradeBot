  "content": "Most of us are born in a normal family. By normal, I mean we are nurtured and raised by healthy parents and they are still active when we graduate from college and start working. In many countries where economy has been hit by the COVID and affliated incidents, life has been harder than before and many have to choose to live with or at least ask help from their parents. From parents pespective, I believe as long as they are able to help, most likely they will be willing to help, because they love you. From children's perspective, I think this may solve some realistic problems in the short term, but in the long run, this will damage the creativity and motivation to face life challenges and harm the ability to manage finances, especially if you are a man. I say this because a lot of the friends from my generation are struggling financially now because they have been dependent on their parents and even after getting married and establishing a new family, they took a regular amount of money from their parents to pay off mortgages or cover other expenses. They've never thought about having another stream of income or one day their parents may not be making money and instead need money and care from them. A lof of hidden problems are there but just ignored. In my opinion, the earlier you become independent financially, the more likely you will be living a comfortable life with your finances. Better to know this and be prepared, if you are young.",

      "body": "In economics, we really have to be independent since we graduated from school, whether it's school or college education. we are forced to have to work and save in preparation for our mature future, especially at the age of 25-27. Not a few also start their own business with the hope of success at the age of 30-40.But that's all just theory, in practice in the real world it sometimes doesn't work out like that because sometimes there are boy who are already independent at the age of 20 or even 17 years, sometimes there are also those who are late by the age of 30 and are only independent. And our parents also don't force us to do it all, even though we are already successful, our parents will still want to give us because it is instinct.",

Let me explain. \"Very tunnel vision...in a boarding\", put my topic aside and let me try to explain your point in another way. Your point is exactly like saying\" it is incorrect and biased to believe people who exercise on a daily basis are physically healthier than those who never take a walk\". See what your problem is ? You are simply trying to disagree with some common sense by not providing any evidence.\"Taking mortgages in such young age would...\" OMG, late thirties and early forties is such young age ? Where does it come from for saying that ?  In your comment, you are sending a message very strongly: that a child(actually an adult) is not doing fine is because his/her parents are not teaching them well. Yet, when you say \"Parents often teach children on how to face problems and challenges\", then later you also mention that \"Also setting up a family....it will differ how they face it individually.\" Execuse me, they are contradictory.\"Truly financial independence is a myth though...out of question.\" This is even worse. How come you cut all reaons and logic and say \"truly financial independence is a myth\"?  Whether this is a generalized or an individual expression, it is inappropriate. I feel like you are trying to dismiss something that can be concrete while trying to judge something that is supposed to be subject and personal.",

However, it is unfortunate here in my country because the setup is more or less cultural. It is even very much acceptable for a young couple to have the grandparents take care of their children while they do their thing.

This scenario happens all over the world and not just in some African countries where the government cannot be relied upon. I know the government should at least provide the environment in which economic growth and development would grow and thrive and that in turn would increase the number of jobs. While the bulk of the problem rests on the government, we should note that there are individuals that, having been born with a silver spoon, haven’t had to work a day in their lives. When starting out on their own, they would be forced to rely on grants from their parents to survive. The government isn’t to blame for that. Right? There are also real lazy folks out there that hate the idea of working and can’t hold a job for long. Those folks most times also fall back to their family and friends for bailout money.",
