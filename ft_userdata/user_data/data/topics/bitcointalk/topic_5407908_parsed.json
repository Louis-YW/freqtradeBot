We'll see.. PS. This topic is more suitable for Speculation than B&H.",

I also expect bitcoin to close this year no higher than 35k-30k, no new ATH this year to even talk about, because these are rosy dreams.I would support that assumption because I think $40K is still quite high as a closing price at the end of 2022 and instead, $30K or $35K is possible. At the moment we are still in the range of a 66% decline from ath, so it must be hard to expect a 70% to 80% increase from the current price of \"$23K\". It might be good to keep looking optimistic about $100K this year as a wish, but I don't expect it to come true because in reality a lot of dreams don't come true.$100K is the highest price that cannot be reached in the next 5 months, so this is a dream. But maybe we will see it become something true in the next 3-4 years \"if\" the demand for bitcoin continues to increase and adoption is everywhere.",

They are telling people to buy bitcoin now but expect it to fall to 13k? What kind of advice is this? Buy now because we think it will be cheaper later? Also, these guys predict the typical 85% drop from ATH followed by a new ATH after the halving. This is all their prediction depends on. They think we'll go to 13k because that's where the last bear market went and then they expect the rise above 100k because bitcoin used to reach a new high a year after the halving. They are too predictable and their predictions aren't going to come true because everybody knows about this pattern now and it's not going to happen again like in 2018.",

This gives to holders hope for \"tomorrow\". The $100.000 figure is beautiful and noticeable, which the crypto community wants to see. Although I am not an expert, I assume that in 2025 we will be able to see a price of $100.000. If there are no bad events, then there will be a bull run, which will push bitcoin to this value. At the last bull run, bitcoin managed to almost reach the $70.000 mark, from which about 30% remains to $100.000. So, it's quite achievable.",

For this to happen, the closing price, on December 31st, must be less than $46,000. In light of current events, this is real. As for $100,000, sooner or later it will happen. Bitcoin never stands still and is constantly evolving in terms of adoption and price range. It is important to understand that bitcoin cannot grow forever, like any other asset, the market needs corrections.The evolution of bitcoin which will be much more developed in the future can actually be considered as a guarantee that this network is very strong to never die. I expect $100K to be reached in the next few years following the development of adoption and use cases. Obviously I personally feel pretty optimistic about that too, but going back to the end of the year that the close will probably be in the red candle for the monthly TF.Quotethe closing price, on December 31st, must be less than $46,000.I agree.",

Anybody know that bitcoin is not something that you rely on because it it does not have a flux or constant price so because of it is a decentralized currency and it cannot be regulated by any means or any conduct I think prediction of a Bitcoin in next 3 years and 4 years going up it's not fixed and is not guaranteed.
