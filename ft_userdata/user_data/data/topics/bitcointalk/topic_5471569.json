  "content": "What happened: BC.Game casino is withholding my balance of 7.97 BTC. During my play there I've deposited about 7.1 BTC and I've withdrawn 2.5 BTC. I was playing blackjack and participating in the daily tournaments which I won several times.I tried another withdrawal on the 8th of October, got a popup saying \"Permission denied\". I've been told to submit the KYC documents which I promptly did. In the following days, whenever I inquired about the status of my account the support would reply with the same simple answer \"check back in X days\" or write an email (to which I did not receive a response).I submitted a complaint to askgamblers as it appears their rep is active there. The rep claimed the following: We recently placed a temporary restriction on your account while conducting a comprehensive investigation into your blackjack betting activities on BC Originals Blackjack. Following a thorough review, I can inform you that we will be returning the funds you initially deposited into your account only. All bonuses and other funds will be removed.They failed to provide any evidence to askgamblers and the complaint remained unresolved. Obviously, there's no foul play involved, they are making up excuses to not pay.I've just contacted support again, now they're giving me the run-around as it seems this info is clearly available to them:To begin the verification process, please send us an email to support@bc.game , together with the following information.Subject: Withdrawal Permission Off1. BCGame Username2. Registered Email Address3. One Deposit Transaction (TXID)4. Commonly used IP Address5. Commonly used deviceNote - the email must be sent from the email address registered to your BCGame accountPlease be patient, it can take up to a week for the email team to revert.

One is a response to the AskGamblers complaint, the other is a response to an email.Nov 10th update: It appears they have reopened the complaint at AG and have posted the following:This was my response:",

      "body": "The main problem here is BC rarely address any relevant complaints here that involved huge amount. They still have some pending cases that acknowledge but failed to answer back just like yours.It’s funny how they are accusing for something that involves their house blackjack while it’s their product and have a total control on it so the result of investigation should be done instantly. I highly suggest to still pursue your case on AG and don’t expect much here since they are acting strangely quiet recently. They also pause their signature campaigns at the same time when many issue hits them. BTW do you contact their support after their last message on the AG. Their last reply in there shows that they want you to reach them out through the casino support. Also do you get already your initial deposit refund?",

I don't know why you guys are not playing smart, any money in a custodial arrangement is technically not your money as they can do and undo. The lack of regulations and sanctions has also emboldened them.Next time, you might want to have 5 different casinos to split your money and divide the risk.",

Their reply on AG seems like they allow you to withdraw the refund yet they are still holding it until the investigation. It’s really to be on your situation considering that Bitcoin price is pumping right now while you can’t get out your funds out of the casinoCan you specify how much is your initial bankroll out of the total amount you are holding in there right now?",

How they even come up with this is beyond me.Also, when casinos refuse to show evidence of their accusation, even to a 3rd party mediator, that is always a bad sign in my opinion. When you have a solid case you can show your cards and the case is solved and your reputation is good.Of course we never see the full truth but when they take deposits and bets of players they should honour their winnings as well, and not come up with some strange excuses not to pay.",

This is a very wise idea, which was what I was referring to, not entirely blaming you but the undeserved trust you had in BC.Game.",

You encounter this kind of problem if you will only use trusted casino brand that runs for a long time without any major concern like Duelbits. Bc.game recently slow down with their bonus program that result for their security to be extra tighten when regards to bonus. Bc.game is already in communication with OP so everything might be fine soon. It’s important to don’t deposit what you can’t afford to in a casino to aboid being on this kind of chaotic situation.",

If there was any foul play involved the casino rep would've addressed it in the AG complaint and they would simply confiscate the money.Also, as I mentioned earlier, I've lost money playing blackjack, I'm only in profit there due to winning the tournaments and getting the VIP stuff. That's why I think their claim that they're investigating anything is just a play to prolong things indefiniely.",
