It's the money that won't hurt your feelings even if you lose it and it's also the amount that would not lead you to regrets that you will remember even in the future. But it doesn't mean you are ready to lose it if you make a bet. You still make the effort to win games that you are playing on a betting site either a casino game or sports betting. I won't be using my saved money, that has another purpose. If you think you can just afford to lose $5 - $10 then do so. No one will tell you that you are cheap because no one will know. What's good today is gambling sites don't really have a high minimum bet which is cool for those who are betting cheap amounts and just doing it for an addition to the excitement of the game or just to have a little fun playing slots or any of their favorite gambling games.Imagine playing all those without money involved, it will be damn boring.",

There are times when. You just have money and you'll be very sure that you won't be using that money anytime soon, that's what they mean by spare money if there's a possibility of you using the money you possess anytime soon then it's safe to not use it for gambling. That's why as a gambler you should have a good bankroll management system set up so that you won't end up spending everything on your gambling account.Quote from: rachael9385 on July 18, 2023, 12:21:10 PMI think everybody who gambled sometimes does not know when they are in a gambling shops, just imagine you're about to check your past bets and you find your self about to stake another, please don't see it the other way round.I sense gambling addiction here, when incident like this happens its mostly a sign of gambling addiction but for one who is conscious of his gambling activities would never go to a gambling shop or gambling account online and all of a sudden starts to place a bet.

I will like us to talk about this.Depends, if you used a money you saved that could have been used for tlother things to place a bet there's a high chance that you'll be anticipating wins, but if the money was something you could do without and you are sure that you went to your gambling account for the sole purpose of having fun, even if your predictions turns out bad you won't feel a thing. Unlike when your sole purpose is to earn some cash through gambling.",

It is not good to be addicted at all. One of the thing I see very useful about gambling on this gambling board is the education we give ourselves on gambling addiction. It is really worth it.

Spending your savings on gambling means you're risking money that you cannot afford to lose. When you experience losses, it can significantly impact your life going forward. It's important to follow preventive measures as they help reduce the risks associated with gambling.Always remember that gambling is only for individuals who can afford it.",

It's better to set aside a little money from working or doing business for gambling, so that way you don't have to worry about losing the money that has been arranged for future.",

Its all about that split microsecond where you can see your opponents move unfolding and you have exactly that microsecond of time to make your decision of which counter-move to make. Gambling wins can also make you profit but unfortunately you will not be in control of whether you have a higher chance of winning or not. Unless of course we are talking about sports betting. With sports betting at least you can do some research on the players and so on. More research in that regard does give you a higher chance to win.But gambling games like slots? You are completely relying on luck. And the probability is shifted against you in the house's favor.",

I think the most important part here is following your budget. You get to have the discipline to follow when you will gamble, how much you are allowed to bet, and when will you stop gambling. Because when you ave those things, you are tempt to get in the addictive type of gambling. The complete opposite of profitable gambling.So yes, when you feel the impulsiveness to gamble bets after bets, that's a signal for yourself.",
