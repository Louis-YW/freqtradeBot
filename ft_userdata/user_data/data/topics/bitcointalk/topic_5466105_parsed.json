However, this is an escalation against one of the world’s largest companies which may signal us heading towards a bit of a Cold War with China.

I don't think it will go as far as a Cold War, in commercial context that is.Apple is just interested in the China because the dirt cheap manufacturing prices they can get there (as any other producer looking to make their products massively and as cheap as possible) and also because the size of market of users. In the end, Apple can always move their factories out China to other developing markets where labor is cheap, like India, but if they do it (in order not to depend much on Chinese resources and chips) Pekin could retaliate by banning Apple products from China. That scenario would likely make their stock value to dump much much more in comparison to a local dump because of some official CCP announcement like this one.",

No I dont think so either, wasnt there a big push back against Huawei and its 5G'something or other' not so long ago?I suppose they are cautious and or paranoid about sensitive information possibly getting leaked over a US brand smart device, cant blame them really but they are happy to have the production of the phones remain in China though so I wonderwhere this is going to lead....Maybe a cold war of sorts",

Probably other tech companies with stakes in both countries too. Anyone buying this dip?Sure, i could buy it if i would be stocking apple. But this isn't really a surprising move from China. I would be totally skeptical using tech from basically hostile country that might have government backdoors that would be exposing sensitive government information.Especially when chinese spys steal US sensitive information from governement, if i would be chinese i would totally assume that they were planning to spy with all the possible ways possible. Including backdoors in iphones.",

America actually wants China to take over the market alone But America is not able to stop it is their internal matter, but China is taking one step after another to achieve their goal.I do not know whether their goods will prevent the market, but I think they will to some extent, and they are a conservative nation, so that they can help their people and their neighbors to buy them.",

In that sense, the government of the United States does not want to have an actual competition, hence they were demanding TikTok to be offered for sale to one of the biggest American based technology corporations, anything for the sake of that information of American citizens not to be stored in Chinese servers. Soon enough Apple may have a little taste of what Huawei felt back in the day when it got widely forbidden in the west and isolated from Google's services and marketplace.",

So in response, this could possibly be like the last words that China can tell to Apple. Whether they like it or not, Apple will have to move and it cannot be stopped anymore since they've shown some recoil of their plans of moving outside. I guess that Apple has seen this repercussion of moving out from them. There have been some other countries that do offer cheaper labor and much lighter in terms of policies which Apple is going to like and not just them but also other companies that are sourcing their manufacturing from the mainland. Well, China has to choose what it is going to support and yes, they've got Huawei and also other brands that the CCP can hold and dictate on what they should do aside from just doing business.",

Canada even took the daughter of Huawei's CEO as hostage for 3 years because they saw the company is spying through the Huawei phones.This time its China's turn to ban iPhones for China government employees because they also see iPhone has a forever mic turned on. Its a wonder why it's only now that they know this when its been tracking iPhone users for time.",
