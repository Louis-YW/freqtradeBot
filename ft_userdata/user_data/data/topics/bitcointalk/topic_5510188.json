  "content": "It was at exactly 16th of September 2021 that a group of cryptocurrency enthusiast unveiled the first ever statue of the bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. The memory resurfaced online this month as a remembrance of an event that called the attention of the world to see the faceless sculpture of a great inventor, Satoshi. I looked up their site to find out why they built a statue of a person they do not know his face, identity, gender, etc.The answer remains for the love and memory of Satoshi, it doesn't matter about any concrete information on Satoshi, the faceless Statue was only erected to remind people that they play as more role in cryptocurrency like Satoshi did. That's why the face was made transparent. Additionally, it was made of Bronze, and it's the work of two Hungarian sculptures, Gergely Réka and Tamás Gilly. It's located in the heart of Europe - Budapest at Graphisoft Park - open 24/7 for visitors.         https://www.statueofsatoshi.com/Images are from the page of a bitcoin historian on twitter",

Hungary is a great country, I don't think that the government of my country would allow the faceless sculpture of Satoshi to remain standing for even a month they would have brought it down. Well the point of this is that, for me I am still hear in the crypto world because of the freedom it has given me to escape a tyrannical and oppressive regime while still living in the country. So yes, thank you Satoshi.",

The choice to immortalize a faceless figure speaks volumes about the impact of decentralized technology, where identity takes a back seat to innovation and vision. It’s symbolic of the way Bitcoin and blockchain function—open, anonymous, and focused on the idea rather than the individual. That statue captures the essence of the mysterious, yet revolutionary, figure behind the crypto movement.",
