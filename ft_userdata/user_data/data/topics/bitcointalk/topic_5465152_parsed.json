  "content": "Hello,Follow the recent happenings in West Africa and central Africa where there have been Military coup in the formerly colonies of France is it incidental? Incase you are not familiar with what I am saying let me bring to your attention that all the coup that has occurred in African in recent years are from Francophone  countries. Some of the countries that experience military take over of power include Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger etc. As I write now Gabon just experience a coup.The Irony of this matter is that when the military take over power in these countries the people come to the street rejoicing over freedom stating their liberation from colonial oppression through a civilian administration in their own country.A clear case of this incident is in Niger, the people are backing the military coup and are protesting at France Embassy that France should leave their country alone. Niger is likely to be the 7th poorest country in the world but has Uranium, Gold, Crude which is supplied to France and has France established company in their region.Mass celebration over military take over of power in these country I mentioned above shows the peoples' dissatisfaction of the democracy handed to them by their former colonial state.Has France instituted a government that will collaborate with them to steal from its people or is the military in these country tasty of power?The government of France are saying restore democracy in Niger whereas the people of Niger are saying allow us to deal with our own problem don't interfere in our affair. As I write the military leaders in Niger gave an ultimatum of 48 hours for France Ambassador and their foreign troops to leave but they refuse then I ask should a marriage or union be by force or to what end is all of this?",

      "body": "I believe it's time for France to let go of its former colonies in Africa. France's involvement in these nations has been problematic, with a history of supporting coups, manipulating elections, and exploiting resources. Their motivations seem rooted in self-interest, aiming to maintain power and access to Africa's valuable markets and resources in the face of global competition. And many people in these countries see France as overbearing and opportunistic, viewing it as a bully and a thief.There's a clear desire for more autonomy, freedom, and democracy among the people in these nations. Some have even supported military coups to express frustration with the weak civilian governments backed by France. Despite its intentions, France's presence has hindered progress. Military interventions have worsened situations, economic partnerships have exacerbated poverty, and political influence has harmed democratic values and human rights.Given this, I strongly believe it's time for France to step back and allow these countries to shape their own destinies. France's continued meddling seems to do more harm than good, and it's in the best interest of everyone involved to let these nations determine their own paths forward.",

These politicians might have links with France but their stealing and extravagance shows that they are thieves. France is influencing some African politicians but the real thieves are Africans, not Europeans.QuoteA clear case of this incident is in Niger, the people are backing the military coup and are protesting at France Embassy that France should leave their country alone. Niger is likely to be the 7th poorest country in the world but has Uranium, Gold, Crude which is supplied to France and has France established company in their region.Most of them are protesting because they have been brainwashed that France is the reason for their underdevelopment. But I agree that building industries in Africa instead of using them as a natural resources market would have created more jobs. But I don't think that some African countries would have been able to exploit and maximize their natural resources without support from the West. But France is not the problem of Francophone African nations, the politicians should take the blame.QuoteHas France instituted a government that will collaborate with them to steal from its people or is the military in these country tasty of power?I don't have any information on that but we saw citizens of Niger waving the Russian flag and it was also alleged that there is the presence of the Russian-backed private military company Wegner in most of these African nations. Some of them have sent out French troops and replaced them with Wegner mercenaries. The picture will get clearer in the future.",

They turned a blind eye because it was not their country that was being exploited, that is why the people in these francophone countries are not happy. Take Cameroon for instance that has a very old president Biya, who has been in power for over 40years and stays in France? why will a president of a country stay in another country and be ruling from there?France do not say anything when these politicians forcefully and corruptly remain in power against the democratic wishes of the people, they have no right to call for democracy to be restored.",

      "body": "According to historical statistics, there have been more than 100 successful coups on the African continent since the 1950s. Military coups have become the only approved means of transferring power in some countries. What would be the benefit of getting rid of a Francophone colonialist and replacing it with a Chinese-Russian colonialist? No one can deny the right of these peoples to freedom, and that they have been subjected to deprivation from France for more than a century, since after it gave those countries their independence, they installed their agents to take over the wheels of power to ensure their chances in the countries’ resources. But at the same time, these recent coups are not innocent at all, especially since they are blessed by Russia, which most likely helps these coups succeed with the help of the Wagner gangs spread throughout these countries.",

The celebration is short lived. And usually the cycle is one such that an administration that begins with force usually ends with force. It's not as if democracy appears spontaneously. Not that imperialism is a solution either.",

Debts or borrowing shouldn't hurt the future generations in Africa if utilized very well. To borrow for investment and proper capital investment is good and well monitored devoid of embezzlement or corruption but utilized for the purpose at which it is borrowed. If such cases if they are utilized, the repayment might even be from the benefit and proceed from the investment. The government can borrow to build bridges which toll may be collected, borrow to invest in agriculture, investment in power and electricity etc , all those would be returns in the future but when they borrow they embezzle it within themselves and the coup will persist because the people are looking on the military to savage them into another phase perhaps it could be better.",

You put a disciplined Japanese as President in Niger and he will get overtrown because his values are too different from those of the population.You put a corrupt African into a position of power in Japan and he will be likely discharged of his political power for crimes and corruption. If people do not recognize what it is good for them then a good leader won't be enough for them to progress and attract those professionals who left their motherland.",

Majority of the leaders that are overthrown have failed in their own rule of law. They rigged their elections, change constitution to go more tenure, embezzled money, they don't deliver on campaign promises etc. In-fact we clearly see civilian rule not democracy. Where they elevate themselves more than the people. I think Africa has a lot to contend.",
