What you will try to do is follow the events and then try to see how they affect the price.You can start by using https://coinmarketcal.com/en/ and then try to assess the impact of these upcoming events on the price.",

Always source from various websites because there could be some misleading news that has been delivered on the other website while the other is only factual.I have looked for some list like this: https://blog.liquid.com/best-crypto-news-2022 but you know what? It's not really updated. It didn't proof read that CCN was still on that list that tells \"2022\" although CCN was already out of update since 2019. That's why to look for something else that is better based on your research and likes.",

Mr.Mars buying again, or company Amazon/Apple in some confirmed news for Bitcoin would very likely have a positive effect on the priceThe time of shitty low-quality effort news has indeed passed, although even recently we have seen some really stupid things, like that completely fake news about Walmart accepting Litecoin or Amazon accepting Bitcoin that did help the price go up pretty fast even for a spike, but right now I feel like not even Tesla or even Mcdonald's accepting bitcoin again and in all locations won't make a real dent.Everyone is focused on rates and inflation, I'm pretty positive that if we see inflation going down far more than anticipated, stuff like 1-2% lower than expected, which would mean no further hikes we might see a sudden pump to 30k in minutes.Quote from: mk4 on September 30, 2022, 12:10:57 PMIf you're going to make trades based on cryptocurrency news, you're likely to lose out.

You're likely to just get front-ran.Big players are even one step ahead of this, they have people watching statements in real-time and signaling as soon as the first number is spoken, the moment any author opens his editor to start writing the article about what has been decided the whales have already placed their bets, and by the time you finally manage to get the news from a 3rd party you're just whale food. Besides, any crypto \"journalist\" who has some hot insider info will first sell it to his circle, then publish it.",

You can always do them both.For crypto news sites, there are lots of them and searching with a keyword like \"crypto news site\" will already give you massive result but usually sites that you can see first are the one that is more trusted or more popular than the rest of the result page.",

Your best bet is to go on Twitter, there is a huge crypto community there and whenever some news breaks, usually it’s retweeted and you know what is going on.You can find a few decent posters and search for hashtags like Bitcoin or BTC and you will have up to the minute information. Just keep in mind there are lots of scams out there. Fake accounts using same photos as Elon Musk or Binance CEO. So don’t click any links you don’t trust.",
