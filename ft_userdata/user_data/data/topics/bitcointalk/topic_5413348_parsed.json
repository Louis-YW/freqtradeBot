But I wonder why someone will see this kind of thing on social media and fall for it, it is definitely a means scammers are looking for victims and the best thing to do is to avoid it and always make awareness about any new ones seen. Nearly all giveaways these days are fake, but not only fake, but a means to scam.",

Or some people were so dumb to sell genuinely verified accounts?!I am pretty curious on how will this develop further (will this blow in Twitter's face or in the scammers'?).",

Totally bad for people to fall on this trap because for so many times that this schemes has been used there are still people who fall from fake giveaways. I think they really need to have serious education about those scams since its pretty damn obvious that there's no giveaways will double your money instantly or quickly and those who offer that are scammers only so I guess people need to learn a lesson from past lesson since ignoring them will cause them financial loss.",

I think platforms like Twitter, should provide a stricter experience on blue tick accounts. I mean, special attention regarding login with different IP and devices. that's because we've often seen accounts like that get hacked. although it is easy to restore.",

No, it simply isn't lucrative enough when you can buy low-level hacked accounts for 500-1000 on darkweb. I won't say it's not happening but on a large scale like how those scammers operate it makes little sense.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on September 15, 2022, 06:46:38 AMYou are right.

Click here to see the transactions made to the scammer's address. I'm also thinking those are not real, one address that has only two transactions and suddenly sends it all to this giveaway, the other somewhat active but matching an activity day with the other one? Also, about the sending back, that will never happen as you can't prove person x is the scammer because he sent money to a scam owned by him, but by receiving money from a scam you're definitely in trouble since you're going to be investigated for sure.Knowing how dumb scammers are sometimes, maybe they tried to fake a real activity and to make people invest more like 2-5-10 eth, and then they realized they don't have the money to fake it!",
