I have been on this forum for pass 6days now without knowing that, there is a place called beginners and help here. I'm here on this forum to learn, to know, and to succeed. I know nothing about Bitcoin, but I'm here to learn of bitcoins and to make progress on it. And for me to succeed here, it requires everybody to guild and direct me to learn and master everything about Bitcoin.In your first introductory thread, you said you knew nothing about Bitcoin. How come you are now a Bitcoin investor and have been enjoying it since 2017? Or is there something that I am reading wrongly in your story?",

Its that in mind, not having the necessary experience or sources of income to back your patience with your bitcoin investment could easily lead to you not arching as said with the investment.Back in 2017, bitcoin was at the bears and the year started kicking with price at around $965 and later hit a high at around $19.8k. That's some significant difference looking at barely a $1000 to where price later got go settle at for an ATH that year and now, the ATH is established around $68.7k although the current price is at $27.2k.So yeh, I could agree that one could archive much from that and to have invested a whole bitcoin in 2017, that makes it even the more possible but, vat say you don't have to withdraw in-between or having to add to your portfolio but all the same, you've done good for yoursd and I'll also recommend you don't make it your only source of income.Diversify into something else while, keeping your bitcoin portfolio and even adding to it.",

Op how do you explain this, you are here to do all these, but you have been investing in bitcoin since 2017. Op you former thread and are trying to contradict the present ones. You teach your friend bitcoin and now your friend teach you. Please be specific. Tell us who is teaching who. You even teach your mother.And look at this again ðŸ‘‡Quote from: Smartgoat on August 07, 2023, 10:43:48 PMAt first I want to use this medium to introduce myself, I'm a Smartgoat and I have being studying the futuristic of Bitcoin and finally I have developed a hundred percent love to Bitcoin. I have be wondering why people are queuing up in Bitcoin, then I began to ask if Bitcoin can make provision of food in our table. Because many people I know testify of Bitcoin and after I made my research concerning Bitcoin, I found out why people are comfortably investing in Bitcoin, is because it's a decentralized currency. then I have to come with the idea that Bitcoin can make availability of food in our table when we learn and understand the basic things of Bitcoin especially understand trading and long term investment of Bitcoin.I think with trading they will be a provision of food in our table, when we understand the rules and regulations of Bitcoin, I don't know if this my concept can make a provision of food through Bitcoin. But I'm well convinced that with this my views over Bitcoin investment and trading it will provide or sustain human, if profit are been made. I know that Bitcoin should not be dependent on, and we suppose to make Bitcoin our side hustle but with seriousness on Bitcoin investment and trading, we can achieve a success.What do you say about this again? From this op thread of \"Bitcoin achievement\" from 2017 to date. Op I must tell you the truth, your post history does not speak well about your knowledge on bitcoin, you are even struggling to call the word bitcoin. Someone who has been investing in bitcoin from 2017 till now would have a good posting history in bitcoin forum but yours is different. Therefore, I accused you of lieing to get Merit to rank up. If really you have been interesting on bitcoin since the year you have said, and bitcoin has changed you from bad to good. It is very simple, show us the evidence of your claim on bitcoin clear my doubt. I will like others to cross check it.",
