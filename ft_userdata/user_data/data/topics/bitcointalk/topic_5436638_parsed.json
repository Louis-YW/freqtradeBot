  "content": "If you're young and haven't inherited a property from your ancestors, chances are that you're forced to rent. Personally, I've been renting for over 6 years and have been living with my girlfriend for the last 4, sharing rent and utilities. Overall, we've both spent over €25,000 together, and after spending all this money, you're practically left with nothing and may be subject to looking for a new house at any moment.The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is between €300 and €400 at best; thus, I was thinking that taking a loan is as costly as paying rent per month, but after 15-20 years, you end up with a house. My main concerns are the following: First, if you're in a long-term relationship like myself, you can never be 100% sure that you'll be with that person in 20 or 30 years from now, which might prevent you from opting for a loan. Secondly, you need to be certain that the location or city of the property to be bought is convenient for future job offers and so on. Thirdly, because a loan is a many-year commitment, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to afford the monthly payment 15 years from now.On top of that, finding the ideal house as a renter is almost impossible; there's a lack of housing, and rents are extremely expensive and unreasonable at the same time. We had a difficult time finding a house recently, and it's far from ideal. There is now a new government-funded loan program that is about to start, funding up to 75% of the loan interest-free while the rest is funded by private banks and is subject to a relatively low interest rate. This led me to think about taking a loan and purchasing an average two-bedroom apartment, but I have the concerns that I voiced earlier.",

      "body": "You're clearly in a country with pretty low rent price. I don't know which country that is, but I'm also from a country like that, and I can say that I'll keep renting in the near future for several reasons, but a very big one being that we don't have a good well-developed mortgage system with adequate interest rates and long-term contracts (like you say, 15-20 years). My friends in Scotland opted for mortgage because to them, it was cheaper to pay the monthly mortgage than a monthly rent in the same district of the same city, so this way you both pay less and are living in basically your own flat. And the sum was very reasonable per month for that city, something a lot of people can afford, especially if it's a couple with both earning money. In my country, you'd need to pay around 3 times more for mortgage than the monthly rent, and you'd still find it very hard to find a mortgage deal. It's very unpopular, the interest rates are some of the worst I've seen looking at many countries, and it wouldn't be for 15 years because there's no trust in long-term economic stability (for good reasons) but instead, like, 5-8 years to pay for the whole flat.So you need to investigate the country you're in, its situation and deals, the safety and reliability of mortgages there, and then make an informed decision.",

In theory buying your own place is a great investment; in reality, not all cases/situations are that nice.However, my analysis is valid for my country. Some points may differ in yours.",

Once they did they took a loan and bought apartments because they both said that the installments were almost the same as the monthly rent but at least they live in their own place and will have something to leave their children when the time comes.",

Even a couple may struggle. With this upcoming loan program that I mentioned, the monthly payments are actually a little cheaper or approximately the same as renting.Quote from: DaveF on January 24, 2023, 06:07:56 PM~Snipped~Certainly, there's no direct answer to the question, but yes, the general rule is to avoid renting if possible. I'm generally quite handy when it comes to house repairs; I'd be able to repair a few things that may occur, but it doesn't apply to costly appliances such as a fridge or an oven.Quote from: NeuroticFish on January 24, 2023, 06:32:05 PM~Snipped~Definitely, both options have their benefits and drawbacks, but some of those you mentioned apply to both renting and buying. For instance, at least in my case, finding a house near the center is a huge issue for two reasons: higher rent costs and a lack of parking spaces. However, the largest issue with a loan is commitment, whereas in renting, you can practically leave whenever you want.",

All the experts warned them not to meddle into market as they will just pump the price, and of course they didn't listen as they saw it as another way to buy votes with someone else's (ours) money.Buying your own place is certainly a risk and it depends on the number of factors like what kind of job you have/how easy is to find another one, where do you live etc. For me personally it is worth a risk and basically all people I know are choosing that option rather than giving someone else your money for 30 years and not owning it in the end. I don't know how big are pensions in Greece, but in Croatia 95% of pensioners are not able to afford the rent so that's another reason to get your own place while you can.",

This assumption is unfortunately flawed because not all of us can get a loan. You need a high paying, stable job to get a decent loan. That said, most of us have families and I know a number of people who received help from their families when they got married and could afford their first apartment.This is a problem with no real solution. If you earn 2k a month and and your rent is 500 you'll never be able to afford your own place, unless you inherit it or get a better job.
