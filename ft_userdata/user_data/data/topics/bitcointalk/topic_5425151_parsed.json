Is there any other good reason to use TRX ( TRON )? I will agree with your thoughts, for many people Tron is really a dead project without any development or updates and Tron is known only for USDT transactions. In case USDT fails, I also believe we will have no other reason to use Tron. We invest for profit, and Tron is today nothing more than a stable coin, without any noticeable fluctuations. There was a time when I really loved Tron, and now I am extremely disappointed with it.",

I said this because I don't see any other reasons why TRX is doing so well if not for a lesser gas fee/transaction when dealing with USDT. Tron has its own stable token but it was pegged with limited reserved funds and tron USDT was the main reason that keeps the network is still alive with so many users. I didn't see any other reason than USDT that makes tron alive till now. This blockchain was so garbage and it's only having small transaction fees as an advantage.

USDT on Tron might be the largest amount on the market capitalization but we should acknowledge that USDT, diresgarding its controversy, has been playing major parts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem like an exchange, DEX, and DeFi, all are exposed to USDT. So if the consequence of it only affected TRX the most, I'm sure it is very unlikely considering the factor I have mentioned above. Nevertheless, I think Tether in the near to come will tightly conduct a full audit or fix their lack of transparency issues, noting the FTX fiasco making regulators keep an eye on this space.",

Is there any other good reason to use TRX ( TRON )? To some extent, I will agree yes, it might be that USDT is what keep TRX afloat right now.Not sure if I'm correct, but during the bull run last year, TRX was not one of those who have a tremendous growth. Again, I maybe just speculating here or my memory is wrong, but there are coins that beat TRX by x amount of % in the last great bull run we had. I mentioned it because it goes to show the the support is weakening and so if by chance USDT suddenly de pegged and can't recover, then it can bring down TRX with it.",

I think, in the past, there was more usage of Tron as compared to now, and the reasons are above.It could have a faster network transaction, but if no one is using it, then even that advantage will not be seen by anyone.And so it's true, we've seen a lot of USDT transaction and obviously, you can't do any without TRX and so that is the only usage for them as this point. They are totally reliant on USDT to keep them alive, so to speak. Tether has been asked for a full audit but they don't want to, and so we don't know if they are running on fractional reserves or not. So if by chance they collapse then it will also spell doomed for Tron.",

Is there any other good reason to use TRX ( TRON )? Definitely the reason why TRX are rising is because of USDT though other tokens are also using TRON network and that could help them to stay within the competition. TRX should start looking for alternative now after what happened to other stablecoins because if USDT experience the same faith, then TRX will surely be on a big trouble.  Cheaper network and faster transaction makes TRX different, I hope they can find other utility.",

Before it was all about the hype that Justin Sun has made about the partnership style of marketing and then with this adoption of having USDT on its network made it one of the most used protocol or network for the usage of USDT.There could be an affection whenever USDT fails and that will hurt the TRX network for sure. Because it is cheap to send USDT on this network and I guess TRX thrived and stand out with that.",

Is there any other good reason to use TRX ( TRON )? You’re not wrong here, USDT seems the biggest user of TRX network and with that if there’s a panic with regards to USDT the probably TRX will be affected as well. I can’t find any other good reason to use TRX and they should already anticipate this and look for other opportunities. TRX seems to be more complacent with USDT but after the issues with stable coins, they have to start looking for other good reason. Investors will start to panic if USDT started to fall, but I’m confident USDT will not ended up just like the other failed stable coins.",

Until now USDT is too big to be eliminated immediately, but over time, he will also find a way to eliminate it and replace it with BUSD entirely. Minted amount / marketcap doesn't give full picture. But BUSD has almost 200% of daily volume to USDC, and DAI isn't even in same league. I am not sure what the issue is with USDC and DAI but i am pretty sure they are going to be extra careful with stable coins after UST. Meanwhile usdt has 334% more daily volume then BUSD. There's no competing against that. And the fact that they accept it means that people can deposit it to binance and trade there rather then elsewhere. It isn't all competition. CZ talks about going full decentralized in the future. That would mean there wouldn't necessarily be any fiat backed currency by binance.Quote from: Maidak on December 03, 2022, 10:14:44 PMI also don't think people will find a better and more reliable exchange than binance at this point, CZ knows that and he will take advantage of it.
