Putin in a heart-to-heart conversation with the spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   Russia today is under even tougher sanctions than Iran, and it seems that the revanchist Putin, seeking advice from friends in misfortune amid the global isolation in which Russia finds itself due to its war with Ukraine, decided to pay a visit to Tehran, with which Moscow has had close strategic ties since the overthrow of Shah Pahlavi and the establishment of a religious regime close in spirit to the totalitarian regime in Russia.(1) The war with Ukraine, which Putin expected to conquer in a short time, has moved into a resource of the belligerents. If the West stands behind Ukraine, then Russia is alone in this regard. The Russian economy is not far removed from the state of the economy in which the USSR collapsed, when the only product that had value as an export was hydrocarbons, and not products created by the intellect of a person for the purpose of his well-being, which in Russia has never been a state task. The entire economy of the USSR, and then Russia, worked to create weapons, some of which were sold for free to third countries with a weak economy. In the absence of competition in all areas of production and science, the economy of the USSR could not compete with countries where freedom and human life were the highest goal of the state. The emergence and success of such people as Steve Jobs or Ilan Musk, as well as many others who turned the idea into reality, is impossible in Russia. The traditional backwardness in science and technology has not bypassed Putin's Russia either. Russia used everything that it got from the communists, without creating anything new, which affected the theater of operations. The Russian army was faced with more modern weapons, which the West began to supply to Ukraine. The Jewelins neutralized Russia's colossal advantage in tanks that burned like matchboxes. Both Western artillery and multiple launch rocket systems turned out to be superior to the Russians in both accuracy and range. It also turned out that today the war cannot be successfully waged without drones, which was demonstrated in the Karabakh war, when Turkish “bayraktars” literally uprooted enemy firing points.    And so Putin decided to ask the ayatollah for the drones that Iran has. It is not known how effective they are, but the very fact of seeking help from a country that is not particularly known for high-tech achievements speaks of how science and production are launched in Russia. A good proof of this is Russia's lag in everything related to space. The scientific and technological potential left by Korolev has been exhausted over the 30 years of Putin's rule. The funds were spent on the construction of palaces, the purchase of the most expensive yachts, the maintenance of children and wives abroad. The total corruption created by Putin is a priori incapable of innovation in the field of science and technology.     Putin's visit to Iran exposed the viciousness of the system of power, called by the Kremlin tyrant sovereign democracy, which can only mean one thing - democracy for the sovereign, in which the closest circle is nothing but an organized criminal group, and the rest of the population are weak-willed serfs, whose opinion must legally coincide with the opinion sovereign with the assistance of Jewish-Armenian propagandists who set the Russians against the fraternal Ukrainian people. The war started by Putin in Ukraine can be said to be lost in advance. At best, a tribunal awaits Putin himself, if the rebellious people do not crucify the bloody dictator at the gates of the Kremlin. The main result of the war will be the death of the Russian Empire, as the last monster from the era of lizards that has survived to this day. (2)1.
