If they are looking for a financial breakthrough, they need become involved with anything because good things in life don't just fall into their laps. Life is about taking chances and seizing any opportunity that presents itself.I don't like discrediting poor people or things related to someone's status and forcing them to know about investing in Bitcoin or in crypto. To be honest, it's not a good way, because you also need to know the condition of their needs with the condition of your rich needs, there is a clear difference. There's nothing wrong with advising them to invest but we also shouldn't omit the essentials to see how difficult it is for them to survive amidst a difficult economy. Instead of investing, just surviving from day to day they have to postpone their dreams and future in order to have money to make a living.Talking in your position is easy, but I'm curious what your perspective would be if you were in their position. pressure, very complicated burdens of life, and thinking about where to look for money tomorrow, do you have space in your mind to invest? certainly not",

Life is about taking chances and seizing any opportunity that presents itself.Is it true that only \"poor people\" are hard to advise on investing? I do not think so. And if that's true, then I think they have a very underlying reason for their reluctance to see investing as something they have to do to guarantee a future. How could they think of such things when even meeting their daily needs is difficult? I think we have to look at it from two sides, from the needs that have been met and from the needs that are lacking. I understand that the intention to direct them to invest is a very good thing to do, but once again it must be accompanied by the ability to do it from a sound financial standpoint.",

Their main focus is to feed, cloth, access health facilities and have accommodation, therefore investing in bitcoin is their least priority. But some desperate ones who are focused on attaining financial freedom can deprive themselves of some of these basic needs because they want to raise funds to invest in Bitcoin. I have seen people that can cut the cost of feeding and clothing because they want to save to invest. One of the advantages of bitcoin is that it can be bought in bits. They can save and buy a few sats each month and within a few years, they might have gotten a good sum.",

I have seen poor families literally eating the same food twice a day and even the left overs are eaten on the following day. That kind of poorer exists in the world man. You can’t expect anything from them which defines as “investing”. All they can invest into is a “hope” that they will do some random labour work 12 hours a day and hope that they will get food for it. They are just surviving, just breathing and still happy with it. I don’t think they in their own dreams they might be thinking about liquidating funds just like that on crypto.",

Don't try to force them, just because you think they can invest and be rich to lead a good life. Simple loss could lead them to suicide.

We might see that some people are expends on things they did not actually need, also some people are wanting short-term enjoyment rather than long-term benefit. Some people need an awareness of a step-by-step comprehension of what they are actually needed at the current point of their own life condition.",
