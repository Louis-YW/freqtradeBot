It makes sense that a world Bank country like Switzerland, that is Lugano in particular, could adopt cryptocurrency just like El Salvador and use it to facilitate growth and prosperity in their country.I can't talk about the control that comes in form of government regulations, but one thing is certain and that is that, cryptocurrency will get accepted eventually and would b recognized as a global payment option for transactions across borders.",

Thus more USD and other fiats will be printed. And the banking system will be making a lot of money as well. Because countries are now accepting BTC and relevant products and imposing huge taxes and fines on crypto users and crypto bad actors respectively. And in this, banks and governments will make a good amount of profit. Overall, banks will only make money while the user will withdraw or deposit fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat. When banks will make money and when governments will make money then at individual levels of countries a single country's economy will nourish and grow and then one by one countries accepting BTC will increase its adoption and more money will be printed and more money banks and governments will make. Banks will stay there and BTC will not take the place of Banks. As they are highly dependent of each other at the moment.",

Even now the way things are going if bitcoin is accepted to be use for shops and other events centers in many communities and countries then the future of fiat currency will be in trouble. I think when bitcoin has been use massively in many stores, there costs of living will reduce because many countries use dollar to increase their products because they are using imported goods and products. So they use dollar rate to make things costly for their citizens to buy. Though the fiat currency can't be automatically eliminated but it will be reduced drastically and the printing quantity will be reduced as well. And even now too the printing of fiat currency has reduced and why things are still.om the high side is because of the dollar exchange rate because most of the things we buy are imported goods.",

Of course we’d have to develop it more and there’s a bunch of regulations to go through but I really believe that bitcoin could be someday adapted by many if not everyone. The blockchain technology will definitely contribute to the banking system and might be incorporated into it. Central banks would have to find their balance between centralized and decentralized.As per global economy, I am sure that an individual’s economic status can be improved through bitcoin.",

People's stores of their wealth--today, called, \"bank accounts\"--will change into seamless, automated, diversified portfolios of investments that convert to either USD or digital currency on the fly. In other words, people will hold less and less sovereign currency because technology will allow them to only trade into those currencies when they absolutely need to for trade, or simply want to as an investment decision. For instance, Europeans won't hold Euros unless they happen to think Euros were a good investment at that moment, just like they'd invest in Bitcoin, Ether, or Legiteum. 5. As of this week, I'm now predicting that CBDCs do not have a place in the future world of money . In the above scenario, where would a CBDC fit in? Why would you need one?",

So if their currency falls, it might not be the global currency anymore.What does it mean to be a \"global currency\" though? I am talking of its use purely as a measurement device in order to figure out how much money to charge for things, or how much money you \"have\". Inflation of the USD wouldn't change this. The USD has inflated probably 3x in my lifetime, but I still know what I should personally pay my gardener per hour. I wouldn't know how much Bitcoin unless... I converted the value to USD. To me, USD is akin to.. the English language as a standard \"common tongue\" means of communicating. Quote2.

Many people are already cashless but it does not pertain to credit cards or such.[/quote]I'm pretty much cashless these days, but I wish I didn't have to use my CCs or PayPal for any purchase under say $100. Right now it's ludicrous that buying something from a vending machine requires an exchange or personal information--and I don't even dare trust the average content charge e.g. for a news story. All of that stuff really needs digital currency that can operate without identity just like cash. No digital currency has crossed over into the mainstream yet (although some of us are working on that ).QuoteQuote3. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin et. al. will remain as high-end meme investment instruments and stores of wealth. Non-blockchain digital currencies will take over the low end of the meme investment market.What do you mean meme? Bitcoin is far from being a meme investment. I mean an investment people make purely based on the name and how it makes them feel. For most people who invest in Bitcoin, the investment is in the name, \"Bitcoin\". They don't know what \"decentralized\" means, and their investment is actually just an entry in some central database at a broker. They are buying the word, \"Bitcoin\" because they think the word, \"Bitcoin\" will be worth more in the future. Bitcoin's actual utility is extremely narrow since it isn't even a very good means of clandestine value transfer because of chain analysis. And it's absolutely unthinkable as a mainstream means of transacting. Most will pay more for Bitcoin than they do for Ether for the same reason they pay more for the same exact shirt with a Gucci logo on it versus a Nike logo versus Fruit of the Loom.",
