  "content": "What happened; user @Hallantroe created the thread in which he gives advice how to avoid being scamemd, while the real purpose of that thread is to promote crypto recovery service. At first, nothing weird there (beside the fact that all those recover services are fake), but when you check their website you will see plenty of red flags; from claim of having 100% recovery rate, to fake team member photos and phonmy testimonials. Since this is obviously fake service, I am creating this thread in order to flag the before mentioned user.User Hallantroe Thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406011.msg60555716#msg60555716Archive https://ninjastic.space/topic/5406011Website https://web.archive.org/web/20220712152536/https://www.prudentrecovery.com/Flag Type 1 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3004Their whole team is fake, but as proof I am just going to share one of them, which should be enough to show that this is nothing but a scam, trying to profit from desperate people who already lost money.",

After all, more often than not scammer than person he manages to scam, its just that they have will to do it.",

Thanks for the warning and flags. All the testimonials on their page have no link to verify those profiles that gave those testimonials they are all false and just made up of the creator of this project, they know that there are some victims who will be desperate to get their money from scammers and many of them are on the look for projects that can do that for the victims, but the truth is if you got scam its almost impossible to recover what you've lost, these people are merciless they are victimizing victims.",

The only victims may be those who do not have or lack the knowledge of how this type of technology and system works, especially those who immediately believe that they have not even researched whether the recovery service offered is true and possible. Instead of recovering, the rest will be lost or the other wallet/account will be affected. But those soaked in this forum know that at first glance this is a scam.",
