I can easily submit a new social media account for kyc, pass verification and delete the account. What then is the fuss for this needless cycle.This country continues to amaze me",

The government should go and take statistics of the poor and provide a scheme that will make them benefit from the government.

Having said that, social media handles can easily be faked and cannot even be used to accurately detect the character of a customer.i might be wrong but the government is looking for a way to actually regulate social media here. if we look closely once your social media is linked with your bank then when the government needs to find your identity after maybe you have gone against there laws on social media like either promoting entities or other banned activities they can easily get your full details from the social media used for KYC which would so be linked to once identification number, which makes it easier to track the offend-ant down. But just like what cytpoway121 said it will be easier to just submit a social media handle that is not used or has fake BIOs registered with it.",

The government will want to take strict measures if they really want to make this happen and it’ll affect the overall well-being of many people. Just like they did to make BVN mandatory and also to use the new naira note that happened this year.

Considering the country we are, they will use this to gag people from expressing their opinion. I am not surprised because social media have grown so big that it now posses a serious threat to the conventional media and the powers that be. Take for instance,  they have silenced the mainstream media as regards reporting the activities of terrorists and the only way we hear about killings and ethnic cleansing happening in some quatters is through social. media. Furthermore, think about how social media was deployed for major events that impacted so much on our polity and governance such as the Endsars, 2015 and 2023 general elections and others.  Indeed, if not because of fear of insurrection,  this idea wouldn't have been conceived. My humble opinion is for all Nigerian youths to lend their voices in rejecting this move as it has no link with tracking money laundering and whatever name they might give it.",

We supposed get right not to give our this datas dem. E no even dey any necessary and even though dem make am compulsory say we must do am, e no go get any head.
