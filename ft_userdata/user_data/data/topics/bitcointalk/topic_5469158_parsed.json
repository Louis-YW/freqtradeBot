Your experiences matter!Yes, crypto payment gateways benefit businesses greatly. Who doesnt desire lower transaction fees? However, my nation doesnt allow crypto payments currently. I find it frustrating. For me and many others in my boat, its hard to evaluate the impact.I've heard tales. Stories of businesses thriving after taking bitcoin payments and others struggling due to crypto volatility. A double-edged sword. If I could use it in my business without legal restrictions, I'd join in.You must examine the market and country's perspective where you operate. Crypto is thriving in certain locations but not all. Some may find value in your experiences, but not everyone. Anyone else from a country where crypto's a no-go? How do you all feel about this?",

Actually having a crypto payment gateway for a business depends on the local regulations. For crypto friendly countries it might help but for countries were cryptocurrency doesn't have a formal legal framework, it's super risky to add them. Stop thinking cryptocurrency as a solution to everything. It's good for investment. It's okay for value transfer. But it's not really a solution to grow your business. It's better to focus on brand building and marketing to grow your business.",

Even my first instance of crypto (which thank god existed back then) was to purchase an in-game currency, and since I was below 18, I had no access to credit cards or bank accounts so I had to use crypto instead. That was back then. Now? You can probably expect even 11, or 12-year-olds to have e-wallets (Gcash for example in the PH) that they can easily use. Maybe if the implementation of crypto were to increase in the future, then it wouldn't really be impossible, but as of now?
