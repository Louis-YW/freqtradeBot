Price at $90 is still probably a good catch right now if you're going to hold it even past its halving. I personally don't care much about LTC since the real action is with Bitcoin.",

Halving is just slowing the mining of new tokens and it doesn't give much hype on the price unlike Bitcoin that the creator is still anonymous and not using his holdings until now.",

I have some litecoins so I might be shilling it a bit. Its price did increase from $40 to $100 over past few months and we can associate it with the halving.I'm too bullish about the coin and bought some around $94 a few days prior. I'm at a loss considering the current price but I've set a sell around 120 as I believe it is easily achievable.",

It doesn't make it more valuable. And i think he markets have already spoken. It doesn't peak. Maybe it's already priced in and people will start to sell in panic after the halving. I think that litecoin has potential to rise again with the rest of the coins in the bullmarket but i don't see any fundamental reasons for it other then it being POW, old and the fact that it hasn't been shut down. And at least in the past everyone knew what litecoin was, most likely because there were not that many coins back then. But i doubt that new people even know the history or the fact that the creator dumped everything in the top. That was somehow seen as a good thing by a community. I still can't figure out why. If Vitalik would dump his, his community would turn against him instantly.",

Now that's done, I don't think the price might see a huge rally but it's sure going to see some positive price movements as it gets closer to the halving event. LTC has been under the radar for a long time and this event will bring it to the spot for a while. Realistically speaking, LTC shouldn't see much growth but this is crypto, anything can happen especially it has to do with fundamentals of a project, the price is north-bound.Quote from: masulum on July 20, 2023, 04:32:06 PM However, for a trader, maybe they will take advantage of this moment to be used as a fundamental, because there will definitely be an assumption that the LTC halving will affect prices in markets like BTC.

I doubt the halving we'd see would have any big effects, the past halvings of LTC had a small pump, yes, but any big movements after that weren't due to the halvings. Afaik it was lined up instead with the start of the pandemic? So I reckon new investors drove in and boosted the price. At this point, with how disappointing the coin has been and nothing changing, I hardly doubt we'd see any minor price changes. Maybe a bit of a temporary boost, but that's it.

Im not even expect litecoin to go to as high as people said in the different thread. I remember that even someone said litecoin may be going up for another 100% after halving but i think if he was only joking about that caused by it will never happen.

Of course Bitcoin is still the leading project of the crypto space and this will probably be the case in the future too therefore it is nor really surprising that the BTC halving has such impacts.I can definitely see, that the LTC halving also has effects but only local ones. So i think it will only affect the price of LTC itself, which makes sense because the newly generated LTC are becoming 50% less, but i doubt this event will have any effects on other crypto projets at all. I doubt it will trigger an overall bull run or something like that.",
