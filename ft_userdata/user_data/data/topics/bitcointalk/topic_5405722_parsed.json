      "body": "Why do you want too? There's plenty of alternatives which are free, and you have complete control of the private key. What would be your objective? I'm assuming you'll either be charging or not giving the users the private key, since you describe it as a \"service\"? If you want to build one just to learn, I'd probably suggest aiming your sights a little lower, and eventually progress up from that.  Think about interacting with nodes or wallets before building one. That'll give you some knowledge going forward too how they somewhat operate.",

For that you only need to install Bitcoin Core:1.-Download it from: https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/2.- Use this manual to install it: https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#linux-instructions*Some extra info: https://roll.urown.net/server/bitcoin/bitcoin-full-node.htmlBitcoin daemons listen on TCP ports 8333 and 18333 for incoming connections and that's how you use it as a service, to work with it from the command line you can user bitcoin-cil.",

It depends on your experience in programming, you do not need to start from scratch, but you can build a built on top of electrum (last version -4.2.1) wallet library or any open source wallet, but the real question is what is your goal?There are so many free, open source, well-reviewed from expert so that you'll need something special to convince others to download Your Service.",

Are you looking for a wallet that would use for your services? Or do you want to build a brand new wallet service? We can't give you a proper solution until we realize what you need exactly. So please be more specific.",
