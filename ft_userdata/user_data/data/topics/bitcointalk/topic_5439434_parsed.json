From your citation, I guess you are talking about David Lyon of APC.  It is unfortunate that the electorate could not resist them because of the Powers that be, they arm twisted everything against the masses that voted him into power and nothing could be don about it. This is the case of Nigeria politics where the elites do whatever they feel like doing and getting away with it while the people sit, fold their arms and watch doing nothing to protect their mandate. Back to Rivers State, I think this time around it would not be game as usual, the electorates are wiser and can not be deceived anymore. I know they would bring money, they would share money but this time around it will be shared in vain and they would fail woefully.  The issue of retaining the state under one party system is not feasible anymore I think because gone are the days when the people are blinded with one party system but now, it is personality, what are your past track records, what have you been able to do before. All these would definitely speak for each and every one contender come 2023 gubernatorial election.",

      "body": "From my own perspective, I see this as a political strategy to decieve the people as if they are having issues between themselves which might turn up to be a lie. In secretes they dine and wine together and laugh at the masses that took their media speech serious. Naija you need to use your head reason these politicians, if not them go use your head play their useless games. Nwike knows deep down in him that he is a PDP member but he is angry over his party decisions on picking their heads. All of them na their belle make them dey do anyhow becos say election don reach and who no follow,no go benefit.",
