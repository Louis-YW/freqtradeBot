      "body": "This is not in any way related to Bitcoin, so this thread doesn't fit in this board. Nice one, mate. It's actually good to help people that are in need if we have anything at hand. But I usually don't buy the idea that when we help people, we come out in public to announce that we have actually helped them; it looks like helping while at the same time mocking those who you have helped in public. And I also don't see much need for announcing it here since the people you helped aren't here in this forum.Nevertheless, may you continue your good deeds; if your intentions are good, they will definitely pay off. Edit: have not gone through the OP's post history, don't know this was one of his usual ways. What's the point of creating bunch of threads? or probably a way for merit fishing ðŸ¤·",

I am not surprised to see another self-claimed helper who just creates a thread to discuss nothing, because this does not have any thing in connection with Bitcoin discussions, because you used your fiat to pay for the goods you bought for the poor widow.",

Bravo mate welldone, you did a very good work but their is no need posting about your good-deed here since its not even related to bitcoin and its totally off topic to what is been discussÂ  here in the forum. The forum is place where we share knowledge about bitcoin and help those who are in new to the technology and also share update on recent happenings in the world of crypto. I think you should just join in the conversation here instead of making it a must to be always creating post when you have nothing to share related to bitcoin.",

May you be blessed with what you have done for them. It seems to me that you have spread love through Bitcoin even though there is no documentation that you can show us.The more we help others in need, the more our income will not decrease even though logically it is not true.I totally support such a program.Sometimes the little things can have a big impact.Some of my friends after carrying out the Easter service some time ago, they also carried out the same social activities as you did, but they also did not document this moment.",

Do you think the forum will look good?Please as much as what you have done had come from the purest of intention, putting it here will make it look like you are hunting for merits and if you are criticize you may feel bad.

You helped a beg on the street with the sum of $200 and not only that you took the whole family to shopping. Well I applaud you for the good work. Thanks you for touching life with your wealth.",

This dude will not stop, expect another thread tomorrow Dear OP, whenever you do good, you don't need to create public awareness to make you feel good. The Father who sees you in secret will reward you in secret. The point I'm trying to make here is that most of us here affect lives in one way or the other but it's pointless bringing it here since it's not bitcoin-related.",

If you're gonna make a story that could motivate others to help then would be better to start from yourself. Plus why your threads are on Bitcoin discussion while your topic doesn't even mentioned Bitcoin? Just go to off-top or serious discussion because people wouldn't buy your story here.

I don't get the reason for his thread but I appreciate your kind gesture. Are you telling us you help somebody with your Bitcoin or what? It's not proper to publicize what you do for people. Kind gestures should be personal. In my religion, if you give your left hand shouldn't know that your right hand is giving. But it is painful to know that people are suffering. And most of these nations suffer because of corruption. This is because most of these nations have natural resources that can fend for all their citizens.",
