  "content": "The interesting thing about these RFK allegations is, he backs up what he says. He doesn't always say that such and such are the facts. What he often says is that he has certain beliefs. But when he comes out with the facts, he has the proof to back them up. There's a whole lot more at the site... plus a video of RFK saying what's what.BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan labhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-07-14-rfk-jr-cia-funded-wuhan-lab-covid-research.htmlThe reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the \"lab leak\" that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.These and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News' Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.\"I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,\" Kennedy told Watters and viewers. \"They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.\"Kennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.\"I think he caused a lot of injury,\" Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. \"I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe's population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.\"(Related: Kennedy is a genuine environmentalist who cares about stopping real pollution and geological destruction.)RFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autismUnlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as \"fake news.\" ...",

      "body": "He's probably right about all that, since Anthony Fauci was exchanging emails with the Chinese and knew what they were doing in Wuhan. Pharma corporations made billions on vaccines, that's a fact. The Wuhan virus (which for some reason isn't called that, despite origin places of outbreaks being used for naming diseases, like the Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu) was made in a lab and its release was hidden for months by Chinese authorities, who lied to people and put scientists in house arrests, to stop them from talking. This is not some conspiracy theory, just facts.",

This is not some conspiracy theory, just facts. And if you watch him speak, he tells it just like it is. He says when it's his own beliefs. He says when it's facts. And he shows what the facts are, because he has been gathering them for over a year.When he shows them the facts, they don't have anything to say. When he shows them his beliefs and opinions, he shows that there are many who believe in the direction that he does, and that there are many who believe differently.In the areas of covid and its vaccines, RFK, JR., is showing us how to think for ourselves. Where's the proof? he suggests. What the experts say is only right if they can show us the real proof to back it all up.",

      "body": "Why the collapse of a section of Big Pharma? Because the law is that if there is a medication that works for a particular disease, a vaccine can't be used. Both, HCQ and Ivermectin work on covid, and even better when combined. If HCQ or Ivermectin were accepted for covid, there could be no vaccine.The whole medical thing about covid was a lie and a coverup.\"A $200 billion enterprise would’ve collapsed if Fauci had admitted that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were effective against covid.\"https://twitter.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1685830247139168256WATCH THE TWITTER VIDEO OF ROBERT KENNEDY, JR., EXPLAINING THIS!...",

I think he’s right to be worried for his safety as well. His recent comments about the JFK files being illegally suppressed along with his hatred of the CIA has got to have him on some bad lists. I hope he sticks around.",
