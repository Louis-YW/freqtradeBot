What should we do to keep the little children who died in Ukraine and Syria alive? I want you to open new horizons for me intellectually on this subject. I've been thinking about this all day today and I'm really upset. Don't you feel sorry for little children who die in wars?",

I've been thinking about this all day today and I'm really upset. Don't you feel sorry for little children who die in wars?In the beginning there was a Paradise on Earth created by a True GOD (rather than \"gods\", as there is only one GOD), but humanity lost its place in the paradise because of disobedience to the GOD that created it. The CREATOR of the Paradise gave humans a commandment that must be kept else they will begin to die as they were created to live forever. The commandment was that the humans must not feed on something evil. They fed on it and became corrupted, and were then punished by their CREATOR. The corruption of the humans turned them into something else and they were weakened  and became mortals rather than immortals they were created to be.The lost Paradise will be restored in the future, but there will be a Covenant, oath or agreement between humans and GOD who made the Paradise. The Covenant will still be what it was in the beginning, that is, humans must remain obedient to the Commandments of the CREATOR. The Commandments are for the good of humans, and once we agree to obey them we will become purified of our corruptions both the ones inherited from the first humans and the ones we got while existing in this World. Then we will be grafted into the Paradise ruled by the CREATOR and HIS saints. No humans can bring back the Paradise except GOD. The Paradise I'm talking about is nothing compared to what you have imagined or seen. It's a healing and living Paradise, and it's unbelievably beautiful.  It's a place of absolute Peace.",
