  "content": "Do you think that the adoption of Bitcoin in poor countries as a means of payment can be a source of conflictI asked this question because many poor countries believe they are in democracy and enjoy freedom. However, the reality is that there is still some form of domination by former colonial powers. They are free on paper, but not financially. That’s why I wonder if one day one of these countries decides to adopt Bitcoin as a means of payment and whether this could lead to conflicts. Adopting Bitcoin could offer several advantages, such as increased financial inclusion, reduced transaction costs, and protection against inflation. However, these benefits may also raise tensions with established financial systems and governments.Do you think a poor country will experience peace if it makes such a decision?",

The basic concept behind democracy has made many to be making demo and craze all in the name of doing democracy, because the intention was taken away long time ago and the freedom had been deprived of the masses, a true democracy is what we have in bitcoin and not politics because the people are free on their own finances, while bitcoin remains a decentralized digital currency.",

It's crazy how many countries are indebted to great countries like China, Russia, the United States, and Great Britain. One way or the other they have to pick a side when conflicts arise. It's either they are followers of the country they are indebted to or they face another side. This happens to only countries that keep getting loans from these big countries. I heard news of many African countries who take loans from the China government. And such loans can be so difficult to pay back. Only one way they can pay back than to be a slave to the country they owe indirectly.

And it is one main reason why Satoshi made it more decentralized because if it was controlled by any government entities surely there would be conflict and disagreement between countries in power and lower countries. Right now, I cannot imagine any conflict happening because no country has full authority over Bitcoin. And every citizen in a country has the right to choose if they want to make transactions with Bitcoin even in countries where it is not legal. There are still a lot of Bitcoin users.",

The rate of illiteracy is very high on such countries. Hence, they don't know what true democracy is and they all pretend to be happy with what freedom they have. Now do you think these people will be able to use bitcoin? Even if they did, they would most likely be using a custodial centralized wallet to make transaction. In that case, they will still lose their financial freedom because those wallets will still be controlled by the government. And transactions with bitcoin wont be cheap for them. I doubt any people from those poor country will be willing to spend 40 cents to make a single transaction.

It wasn't successful in El Salvador's case, because the country was financially relatively stable, and even if it had accessed some IMF loans they weren't in risk of defaulting. But a heavily indebted country with a weak economy, like the poorest African and Asian countries or Haiti, could succumb to this kind of pressure if the default risk is too high.Quote from: Kevystia on October 24, 2024, 05:38:04 PM Adopting Bitcoin could offer several advantages, such as increased financial inclusion, reduced transaction costs, and protection against inflation.I agree here, but a pro-Bitcoin strategy for a poor country is a big challenge. And it depends on the type of country we're talking about.A small country with low population (less than 10 million) could adopt El Salvador's model: a pro-Bitcoin policy in such a country which attracts investments from the outside, or manages to create a thriving regional industry hub with Bitcoin/crypto startups and service providers, could already make a difference for the local economy.In a larger country, let's say from Cameroon's or Ghana's size on, however, it's more difficult to directly benefit as even a relatively large crypto sector would only raise the GDP by a tiny percentage. If the banking sector is very underdeveloped and only a small fraction have bank accounts, then there are indeed chances the population could benefit by financial inclusion. But in larger countries often already some reasonable fiat-based fintech services like M-PESA exist.So the question is which problem should be solved. If it's inflation, I think there are chances with a Bitcoin-positive strategy because one could lower the demand for foreign currencies; this for example worked a bit in Argentina - people bought USDT instead of the dollar, reducing the demand for the USD proper and reducing pressure on the exchange rate. But you have to take into account that this has to be accompanied by a strategy which keeps the fiat supply in line with demand, e.g. resist the temptation to \"print\" too much money.",
