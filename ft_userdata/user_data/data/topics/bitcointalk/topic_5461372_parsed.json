Sometimes the price is a direct reflection of these variables, but often these currencies manipulate the market capacity, and the price through the quantity offered, so be careful.xrp, Ethereum classic, Solana are examples of coins you should avoid investing in.You can invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and this is not investment advice.",

You can suggest me, I'll analysis about thoseI do not want to be frustrated, but it is difficult to know if the currency will rise by 5x to 6x. In short, the market has not changed, but the only variable is Bitcoin, and all alternative currencies change their price according to the change in the price of Bitcoin. Therefore, instead of striving and investing in alternative currencies, I worked hard to invest in Bitcoin, which inevitably It will be 3x to 6x the current price, which is about $30,000.Ethereum would be a good investment.Consider the following measures: - Market capacity is a misleading criterion. - New memecoins are a scam. - NFT & DeFi is an old trend.",

As there would be thousands of new tokens being issued everyday, people got to have some coins for gas. Namely, Ethereum, BNB, matic, Solana, torn, cardano, avalanche, steem, algorand and likes. Another sector that could rise again would be the dapps as people would be doing more transactions, that would increase the price of uniswap, bsw, 1inch, pancakeswap and likewise tokens. So, these two sectors are my high priority.",

DYORI agree with what Xal0leX said, it's better to choose a coin according to your own choice because you yourself will receive the consequences, so investment decisions are your obligation to determine where you want to invest.",

But diversifying investment is not bad so you can invest in other good projects. In this case, you should carefully check the goals and background of the projects as the fund is at your own risk. But in my case, the suggestion I will have for you is to invest only for the reasons you want to invest, even then I will ask you to explore another project that is utopia. I like the works of this project but I think they are very underrated.  you can have little experience of it if you want.",
