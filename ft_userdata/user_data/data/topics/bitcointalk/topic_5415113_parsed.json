  "content": "Exorde is built on 4 major technological pillars:1) Ethereum, a Layer 1 network: acts as a secure & transparent settlementlayer. This is the chain that secures the Exorde token economy2) SKALE, a Layer 2 network: an elastic sidechain network connected to theLayer 1 chain, acting as the Execution layer. It is a scalable and elasticenvironment, enabling high transaction throughput. The Exorde SKALEsidechain is where Exorde contributors and users will connect. It is on thisLayer 2 that the Exorde collaborative work architecture is built on. Thislayer allows a scalable platform to be built on, for thousands of users toparticipate and interact.3) Filecoin, a decentralized storage network: acts as a censorship-resistantdistributed storage for the data being created by the Exorde Work Systems.4) NLP, the branch of AI handling unstructured text. In Exorde, NLP modulesare used by the platform’s contributors to maintain and organize a decentralized neural database composed of all the pieces of information that thecontributors are feeding into the system. NLP enables the automation ofclustering similar & related content online, to build knowledge graphs ontop of the raw data.web site: https://exorde.network/Twitter:   https// twitter.com/ExordeLabsDiscord:  https://discord.gg/eTuFGMBG",
