      "body": "You buy when the price is low and you sell when the price is high. The question remains how high or how low are you going to go? That decision is based on previous price charts. If the price was lingering at a low and then suddenly dropped you would want to wait to see the low and buy just as it seems to recover. This is the tough part of the decision but that difficulty can be covered by buying at different levels in equal amount.By no means so I expect a newbie to do this effectively on their first day. But watch the market and read the charts, do some dummy trading.",

You don't want to get stuck with those projects because you're not assured if there will be a sudden volume up with such projects.There's also a tendency that the whales of those projects can manipulate it easy and the devs of it might just rug pull into it so be mindful on it.And mostly, the simplest but needs initiative - DYOR. As in do anything to know more about the project you want to invest or have caught your interest.",

You can use daily and weekly candles for more accurate result for swing trading, but also know that indicators can fail.You can also get some analytic data from sites like glassnode to know exchange inflow and outflow etc. Follow reputable people on Twitter and read news for fundamental analyses. Use the amount of money you can afford. If it is day trading, be more careful and use low amount of money. Indicators can help, you need strategies and also trading money management learning.",

These are the indicators that he shared. I tried it and trade with only 10$ in Futures trading. Just a few hours ago, I have 90$ until my last trade where Bitcoin dropped massively and luckily I made a stop loss, but I lost 25$ with that mistake of mine. Now my 10$ is now worth 65$.I'm not saying that the video I watched will also work for you, but that's what works for me.",

But as to time the market, it's very difficult, you might have to learn TA (technical analysis), and see which indicators are pointing to a buying option, or selling option.So there is no trick in the books, as for looking at the volumes, let's say a buy order, it could be misleading as well. There are whales that can influence it, like pushing for a large sell/bull order, they could have been just wanted to manipulate the price.",

The only problem was newbie tends to mixed emotion when they are trading which always result to the opposite buy high sell low. There’s no trick on when to buy or sell. You just need to established your trading goal such as what profit is your target to sell and at what price you are willing to buy because the rest is just waiting on trading in able to earn.Just buy and hold.

Most the losses I faced were due to ad-hoc decisions I made by got hyped by their marketing things. For example, I bought Tron when it was trading above 800 satoshi some few years back but I never able to sell it in profits even after years of holding. But the good thing is, I am able to stake it but prices wise I was misguided.I checked few things and then decided to invest with tron. That time, they announced about FTT giveaway for tron holders on monthly basis. Now I feel I should not have invested because I have followed BNB when it was trading below 0.0015 BTC and if I have bought them then I might have got at least 10x profits by this time.",

Many traders use technical or fundamental analysis to help determine when to buy or sell, as well as place stop losses and profit targets to limit risk. However, trading carries a high level of risk and there is always the possibility of losing, so it is very important to understand the market and have good risk management before entering a trade.If you are not ready with trading knowledge, then don't trade, it will only make you like gambling because you are just guessing without any knowledge.",

You can't just buy a coin because it drops today but some possibilities that it was till high compared to the past days. This is also a think to consider.",

I know there are users who are going to tell you to buy low and sell high. That's a generic suggestion anyone can make. Regrettably, none can pinpoint where that low or high is. Those who even give that type of suggestion are likely to be among those who are often caught unawares and they end up selling low or buying high which is against what they preach. To the best of my perspicacity, I don't believe there are actually overbought or oversold situations. At least, not while the market is still active. We only get to find out such a situation on hindsight and not while price is active around that region.",

But don't fall for flashy influencers who will swear on their 100% working ta and promise of  profits. TA is about statistics and probabilities. It's not a magic trick and there's lot to learn.
