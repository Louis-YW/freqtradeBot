I don't see any significant changes that should make you worry by holding it. And if we're talking about bullishness. It's likely that when the bull run comes, this is also going to be bullish so if you're looking for any potential altcoin to buy now.

But like you i dont believe but specificly in lose they will have. BNB is quite good coin. Do you have some smaller coins that will unlike BNB go 100x or even 1000x in near future?",

Though I'm confident that BNB can handle this one, but still there's a risk so better to be more careful. ETH should be your next option though its already on top but the potential remains there.

But it might not make same run like ETH because its like Ethereum fork or so. Although, that doesnt mean that it won't pump. Now what I look at other exchanges with proof of reserve and user protection funds like the Bitget which I use very well. Then buy thier coins, hold on the exchange, expect bull run while earning some benefits as holder.",
