There are a couple of good videos at the site.Ukraine, Russia, NATO and Nord Stream – Mike Adams interviews former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritterhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-02-ukraine-russia-nato-and-nord-stream-mike-adams-interviews-scott-ritter.htmlFormer UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter — also a former United States Marine Corps officer — joins Mike Adams in a far-reaching interview that covers Ukraine, Russia, NATO and Nord Stream.Ritter is of course heavily censored on mainstream platforms and is widely condemned by officials in the US government, including those in the State Dept. That’s because his analysis doesn’t coincide with the official propaganda being catapulted into the info war by the mainstream media.Ritter’s take on the current situation is that Ukraine’s leadership (Zelensky) is hopelessly corrupt and deeply infested with Nazis and murderers who issue hit lists of journalists to execute. Ritter himself has now achieved the No. 1 top position on one such list that’s run by the Zelensky government. (Yes, the Zelensky regime quite literally runs a kill list that targets journalists.)During the interview, I ask Ritter if he is “anti-war,” and he disagrees, stating that he wants peace for everyone, but is also trained on how to defeat enemies and is willing to go to battle to halt those who are aggressors against innocent people or nations. Ritter explains that NATO is the aggressor in this conflict, and that NATO has broken every promise, violated every treaty and incessantly lied its way into transforming Ukraine into a proxy state for NATO, from which the West plans to completely destroy Russia and its people.Hear the full details in the interview, below. Scott Ritter’s website is www.ScottRitterExtra.comBrighteon.TVI also ask Ritter about Russia’s nuclear weapons capabilities, hypersonic missiles, hyperglide vehicles and anti-air systems. He reiterates that Russia is far ahead of the West in weapons technology — both offensive and defensive — and that if Russia were to decide to launch nuclear weapons against western cities, there’s nothing in the US military defensive arsenal that could stop those missiles from reaching their intended targets....",
