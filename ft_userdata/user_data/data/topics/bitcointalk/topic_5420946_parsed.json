The space will grow more if we get to this level.I think it's the other way around, in the beginning, we are all thinking about decentralization and (pseudo) anonymity. But that was pre 2017, because after that, government regulation comes into place, altcoin after altcoin before born that no longer put decentralization as the priority. Even Ethereum right now when they moved from POW-POS became so centralized now. I'm afraid that we might not achieved that \"atom of centralized\" behavior in this time. But I don't think it will be a big hindrance for us to grow.",

The space will grow more if we get to this level.The crypto space have been growing and actually grown a lot. But to say that we shouldn't be relying on the influence of anyone, we like that concept.But can we stop that? I doubt that we can ever stop that type of influence in the market. The crypto space and market is a speculative market for which any speculation from a popular person in any other industry can influence the market negatively or positively based on what he's talking about it.",

The problem is centralized way has become main gateway for money to go in the cryptocurrency. did you find any other than centralized ecosystem? I don't even think you can find that. When you wanna send your money to the crypto and you must have dealt by sending it through your bank account. The decentralization becomes very usefuless when it comes to the utility but not for the money gateway. The fact that if crypto market can be monopolized by some parties that made collusion behind the scene and so none knows about the truth.
