      "body": "The rule of 125% collateral would mean you can only borrow $50 and repay <$4.4 interest on the $ 68 worth of XRP ( Currently 34¢ ) which is probably what you are factoring into your loan application.Out of the < $4.4 the lender would have to pay out of their own pocket TX fees to send the alt coins back to you.Quote from: shasan on January 05, 2023, 05:38:19 PMOp already changed the title of the post though s/he is a newbie at least this account is new. That I doubt - their user name is very similar to one I've seen in the gambling section (but I strongly doubt they are alts)",
