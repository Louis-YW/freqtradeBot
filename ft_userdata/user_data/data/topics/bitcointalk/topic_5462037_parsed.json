  "content": "It is good that in addition to the avatar space, the developers of this forum decided to put in a space for personal text. And I absolutely love it. It gives members room to express themselves in a few words the way they like. Some personal texts have been written in English, while some are in Spanish and other languages. Some of the personal texts are born out of deep belief in bitcoin, some pay respect and homage to a person, dead or alive, some are just plain humorous, some personal texts are simply telling users to be cautious. Whatever the case may be, they never fail to catch my attention. In this topic, I will be sharing my favorite personal texts of some users. If yours comes up and you feel the need to explain, please do because I always wonder what the stories are behind those texts.

There is also a quote that says that the richest lands in the world are graveyards because these lands contain great dreams, uncommon potential, innovative ideas, etc, that were never utilized. My greatest desire in life is to die empty. I want to give all I have in terms of skills, finance, and expertise to bless humanity before I die.

The one that really struck a chord with me is Kro55's \"Stop Nowhere\"; every time I see his profile, I feel inspired to keep pushing on despite the challenges. I also looked to see if The Sceptical Chymist has one on his profile, but sadly he doesn't because the campaign in which he takes part forbids random text and requires participants to use the company‚Äôs own text.

It's a proverb I picked up way back in high school. It simply explains human life in three stages ‚Äì the child stage 2. The youth stage 3. The child stage again. The third stage is the old age actually but it's likened to the child stage because here the human brain and its activities aren't as active and coordinated as when they are in the youth stage. That text is a constant reminder to me of the vulnerability humans suffer at old age when they have to rely on others the same way children do. So, that helps me relate with elderly people going through senile dementia or lack of coordination where they've to rely on others for care.",
