Which reminds me that I should be doing a lot more to try to be self sufficient in the event of an emergency. While there is no accurate means of forecasting what future supply chain disruptions might manifest. There is one surefire method of addressing the issue, which is to do everything possible to increase local production. (Or perhaps to live in a rural area with abundant hunting, fishing and foraging that is also independent for water and energy)Future bank runs and restrictions on credit have been announced in various regions as potential prospects for the future. No one wants to admit the worst case scenario might materialize. And hopefully it will not. But perhaps it is always better to be prepared than unprepared.",

If printing goes on without an increase in economic output, what good is printing? It will only result to a devalued currency. Just like that. We have been in a forward flight for many years based on more and more debt, more and more printers, and now because the balance sheet of central banks is reduced a little, just a little, and rates are raised, the OP starts to cry. If they really raise rates to more than 10% I don't know what he is going to do.",

I think you have to do a little more study on your economic textbooks to see the effect of printing more money on the economy. It has ripple effect if not properly managed and so this is not the solution. Whose country currency would you like to be used as a model for devaluation?",

You've been screwed over by the government's fiscal irresponsibility. I'd caution, the answer is never more government, more regulation, or more control.",

The fiscal and monetary policies are going on well with at least the advanced countries, and so are the inflationary measures. For example, have you not seen the aggressiveness of central banks, including the US Federal Reserve in increasing the interest rates since last year? All hands are on the desk to prevent the world's economic recession as far as I know. All that you are lamenting about are aliens in economics.",

I am not and I don’t want to bring up the war but let us be mature and agree that it is the Center point of whole inaction’s that’s are happening right now. Unwanted sanctions came in, now everyone is being enemies of each other and specifically the fuel rich countries on one side while the dominant country on the other.
