  "content": "Although I am not a bounty hunter and I don't think I will be one at least for now but a thorough observation reveals to me that bounty hunters and those who post in altcoins are being considered as unserious fellows. The baffling thing is that the managers (mostly high rank members) who bring the work (bounty) received praises and merits but on the other hand, the participants (mostly low ranking members) who participates in the bounties are being regarded as a non serious members and money mongers. This is purely hypocrisy! If I may ask.... Why is the altcoins board and bounty section created in the first place if those who participate in it are look down upon? Why are managers still bringing bounties despite bashing the participants of not contributing to the forum positively aside bounties? What will happen if all or majority of the bounty participants stop participating? How do you all expect the managers to survive without having those to participate in the work they bring? A reputable manager Julerz12 just confessed that he has no side work aside managing a campaign (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5433643.msg61569155#msg61569155). How do you expect the likes of him to cope with daily living if hunters decide not to participate in bounty again? Do you think project teams will keep on paying managers without seeing impact of promotion? How can people be aware of new and upcoming projects without bounties? Unless the above questions are answered honestly and without bias then I don't think it is even necessary to look down on them. I think we have two options here.Firstly, If the forum doesn't like their activities, I think it would make sense to remove the entire bounty section so we all can focus on improving the forum as we claim to preach and overlook the repercussion it will cause to those affected and secondly, if the forum can not remove the section then it is necessary to tolerate their actions and allow the managers to deal with spammers. Unless it is technical, I don't see how ordinary and normal discussions improve the forum as we claim. We choose not to participate in bounties but they choose to. Let respect their choice.I stand to be corrected anyway if my submission is not accurate.",

      "body": "I think bounty campaigns just have a bad reputation as there are many scam bountys and many people who participate have more than one account. Therefore they have a bad reputation, although certainly not all are bad.People who take part are certainly not discriminated against across the board, in my opinion. These people can also make a good contribution to the forum if they want to. Just because you participate in a bounty campaign, you can still make good posts or help other people in the forum.Unfortunately, the majority of bounty participants are only interested in how they can make money. They don't want to help other people or make good contributions. Therefore they usually have more than one account. When you find these people who have more than one account and are cheating on both good and bad bounty campaigns, it is more than fair to punish such people. But that has nothing to do with discrimination.Bounty campaigns are both a curse and a blessing for the forum. Therefore, you should not remove them from the forum. At least that's my opinion on it.",

I once bounty hunter and just improve my post to participate signature campaign on Bitcoin service board. I never experienced any discrimination during my bounty hunter days. I’m wondering what kind of discrimination you can get by just participating on campaign without doing any shit work here in forum.Maybe some people here generalized bounty hunter as shit poster because most of the bounty hunter is indeed shit poster if you check their post quality.

This is a discussion forum, and the 'work' that most bounty hunters do is outside of the forum, they only use the forum to post reports of what they did on other platforms, meaning they are not involved in any discussion in the forum. If everyone in the forum was posting only bounty reports, the forum would be a pile of shit right now. Members can do bounties if they like, but don't argue that it isn't a positive to the forum.Quote from: knowngunman on February 09, 2023, 08:36:16 AMUnless it is technical, I don't see how ordinary and normal discussions improve the forum as we claim.It improves the forum because that is what the forum is for, there are other sides to BTC than its technical aspect. E.G guding newbies how to store their BTC, helping to answer questions, and warning that centralized exchanges aren't banks, etc, all aren't technical discussions, but they are important and worthy to be discussed, and way better than posting only bounty reports.",

      "body": "Quote from: knowngunman on February 09, 2023, 08:36:16 AMI stand to be corrected anyway if my submission is not accurate.Your \"submission\" is, first of all, a wall of text. If you want to be taken seriously you should start with making posts that can be read effortlessly.Then, your premises are incorrect. The fact that it's especially lower rank members jumping in without second thought into bounties is their own fault. If they would not be so keen to see posting as a means of income and just use the forum as a forum (and see the income for their posts as a bonus) then everything would be better. But that comes with experience, and with experience the better rank also is there.So imho the participants are looked down upon because of their own behavior.Plus, it's not the bounty managers those who bring new bounties. It's the various projects and businesses. The bounty managers only manage all that.You have so many questions it's difficult to answer them all. I wish the bounty hunters come to their senses someday and think before joining to campaigns. Maybe some campaign managers will have tough days for a while, but afterwards the things may get better: better managers, meaningful payments, better rules too ... because I expect huge levels of meaningless posts in those campaigns.Quote from: knowngunman on February 09, 2023, 08:36:16 AMUnless it is technical, I don't see how ordinary and normal discussions improve the forum as we claim.I've seen plenty of meaningful discussions without being technical. The fact you don't see that, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.This being said, I think that your... proposals are based on incorrect fundaments, but I admit, I didn't read carefully every word you've written.Plus, I don't understand your problem:* Is it that some bounty hunters are not being accepted to campaigns? Well, maybe better ones got accepted and the (limited!) places got filled?* Is it that they spam too much? Report the spam at sight!* Is it that some bounty hunters or bounty managers see this as a daily job? It's a risk they take and it can easily turn bad. But it's their choice.This is a forum. You know, a place people discuss.. preferably about bitcoin and altcoins. Somehow far too many keep forgetting that... sadly.",

      "body": "I would argue. Since I often watch bounty sections, I can say that if we see accounts honestly participating in bounties that do not violate any rules, no one will ever accuse them of being useless. I will say more. You are not speaking here in a completely quiet tone, but with some kind of pretension. But what can you say about the fact that it is allowed to have several accounts here? Is this discrimination? Yes, participation in a bounty from one account will not bring a lot of money, and most often it will not bring anything. But bounty hunters are so greedy that when they have multiple accounts, they don't know how to handle them properly. I'm more than sure that everyone who participates in the bounty has several accounts, but some are so stupid that you just can't close your eyes to them.Therefore, lower your ardor and the role of Robinhood. There are rules; if you please, follow them. Tell me, on what other forum can I participate with several accounts and at the same time receive some money?",

Not everyone who manages a bounty campaign is a manager. only a few of them will refuse to run a campaign if they think it is a potential scam project.and the answer to your question is that they are greedy, like most bounty hunters.QuoteWhat will happen if all or majority of the bounty participants stop participating?I would like to see that. QuoteDo you think project teams will keep on paying managers without seeing impact of promotion? most of those \"projects\" are just rubbish and just try to get easy money. the effectiveness of the bounty campaign is not that important to them.if we look at the fact that 99% of projects are scams, then hunters can be considered as accomplices in fraud.QuoteHow can people be aware of new and upcoming projects without bounties?The bounty program is just a small part of marketing promotion. things happened even before that and there are various other ways of promotion. The mass opening of bounty campaigns, where the participants are automated multi-accounts, led to a complete drop in the quality of this kind of promotion.ask yourself about the quality of what hunters offer with posts like \"nice project\", \"good job\"...QuoteWe choose not to participate in bounties but they choose to.
