Unfortunately, there are lots of people in the world who suffer from poverty. They all experience some degree of health problems, also they are vulnerable to some degree of mental problems. In general, modern worldwide fiat money system is the tool created by the world's main tycoons and banks to control people... It must be broken!",

      "body": "How pathetic it is that in a world of over 7billion humans only a fraction of that number on earth have access to the luxuries of life. And that's because these fraction holds and control the means of production and legitimate use of force. And all of this is possible cause this fraction controls how money moves in and out of the hands of rest of us, and when anyone is capable of having control over how the circulation of money should go around they indirectly also controls how the people live.And it's this lack of control by any authority on bitcoin that makes the digital asset to seem like a threat that has come to liberate people from fiat regulations to financial self determination. Putting everyone in charge and control of their money without intermediary. With BTC the idea to plan on how to invest and be hopeful of profit has increased among many people, making them less dependent on fiat for survival. The idea that you have an investment that's capable of multiplying profit for you at anytime is enough to keep you in a good mindset and sound mind compared to a situation of no hope.",

Bitcoin is not a solution to poverty because it doesn't generate cash flow like some other assets. It just goes up and down from unpredictable speculative trading. When/if it will stabilize, it will be just a net zero against inflation, in theory. In the past people could get rich from holding Bitcoin because it was in rapid adoption phase. That phase will end at some point.",
