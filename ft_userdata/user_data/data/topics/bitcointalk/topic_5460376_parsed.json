  "content": "Today I made the decision to understand more about the technical side of bitcoin, and when I got there, I discovered something called a magic byte. Before I continue with my studies, I bring it up since I don't comprehend it. Please provide some clarification regarding the following:What is a \"magic byte,\" what does bitcoin technology utilize it for, and is there anything magical about it before using it? I don't understand it well even though I can see why it's termed a \"magic byte,\" so if possible, provide me more information. Before learning more about other aspects of the technical side, I want to know everything there is to know about it. And if I wanted to use it, what would I need to do in bitcoin technology to use magic byte? Is it When holding bitcoin in a non-custodian wallet or for transactions, is it necessary?.",

      "body": "Magical bytes are four bytes that signifies the start of a new message send by a node on bitcoin network. The messages gotten on a bitcoin network by nodes are usually a continuous generated data so this magic bytes are actually the separators of each message. In a simple language they’re like maybe a comma or full stop to each message. Read here learnmeabitcoin.com.

Just like the link started above there is nothing extraordinary about it rather than differentiating/separating two messages on the bitcoin node",

So everything in Bitcoin transaction begins with this magic byte, everything in a PNG file begins with this magic byte.Bitcoin transactions don't begin with any magic byte. They start with a version number (hardcoded to 0,1,2) and optionally a 2-byte flag for segwit transactions.Magic bytes are more used for files since most of the file formats are easily identifiable by their signatures at the beginning (the exception being different kinds of text files such as plain text vs code). But in any case, MIME types should be used for identification instead as they are superior to magic bytes since they can be stored as metadata.",
