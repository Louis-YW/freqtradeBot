  "content": "Did your nation's so-called 'allies' pop your gas pipeline?  Are you bracing for the U.N./WEF plan that you own nothing, eat bugs, and be happy?  Unenthusiastic about the burgeoning Kalergiization of your neighborhood?  Thinking about taking a long vacation to 'get away from it all' and watch the current years-long shit-show (or worse) from afar?I know of a newly finished 6 room set of apartments in semi-rural Northern Mindanao (Philippines) and I'm toying with the idea of finding a group of self-compatible European nationals who might want to live there for a while.  The place is new and fairly secure, and I know the owner fairly well.  Being near a school she built two 6-room units geared toward teachers and distant students to have a place to stay.  Cagayan de Oro City is about half an hour away, and the place has fiber internet.Locals rent such a place for about 50 EU/room/mo.  I'd charge 100 EU/room/mo and apply the remainder toward utility services, donations to the locals, etc.  Crypto is the only payment option.Alas, The Philippines is one of the few remaining countries (including U.S. and China) who are backward enough to still require the covaids lethal injections to enter.  At least on paper, but there tend to be work-arounds in places which are relatively corrupt AND disorganized (or, put another way, 'relatively free'.)  For how much longer is anyone's guess, and PH is a decent jumping-off point to explore potential greener pastures in SE Asia...although most seem pretty beholden to the IMF, World Bank, U.N., Gate's WHO, etc.  For better or worse.I'll get into the theoretical and practical details if this thread progresses beyond one post else it's a waste of time.",
