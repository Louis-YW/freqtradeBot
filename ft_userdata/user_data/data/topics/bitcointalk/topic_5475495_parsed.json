(I do not know how it works  )First, i would like to know why would you need open-source software for the payment gateway. The gateway will process the payment and it won't be storing the payment for a long duration so i don't think you need an open-source solution for this,As OmegaStarScream mentioned, Coinbase commerce is the best solution to integrate with your site and you do not need to know how it will work internally. You just need to link to your site and of course it will charge the fee for using their service.",

Cannot do it atm.In the case of private gateways, do I only always have access to my wallet or is the seed in the hands of the company?",

(I do not know how it works  )Maybe there are some services that can be recommended ?Hello xGALx, if you means open source you need check in Github source because in there has many alot crypo payment for website. If you need open-source solutions, a number of available platforms will support USDT and other cryptos. For instance, Check in gihub >> https://github.com/topics/crypto-payment-gateway<< is a crypto payment gateway supporting several cryptocurrencies. It's open-source, meaning you'll have more control over wallets and seeds.Some point is about open source is level of difficulty to code such a gateway, it highly depends on your skills and familiarity with the blockchain technology, cryptography, and the specific cryptocurrency workflow (here, USDT). If you're unsure, hiring a blockchain developer might be the best approach. If you need simple prosses and I recommend use some additional services, Coinbase Commerce, BitPay, and CoinGate have been rated among the best crypto payment gateway providers.",
