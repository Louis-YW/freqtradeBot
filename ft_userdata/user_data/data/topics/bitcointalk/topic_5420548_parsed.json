      "body": "Heyactually i can't clearly understand what you are trying to say but from your topic it seems to be bounty hunting, first crypto bounty hunting is not that favorable at this time and many projects hardly succeed or even pays their hunters at the ends of the determined weeks and months per says. Then talking about exchange, it comes from listing maybe after the project succeeded they could apply for listing and if their projects meets the exchange requirements then they will list and make announcement about upcoming listing of the new coin/token.Please when next creating a topic, there should be a reason for creating such not just spamming otherwise i would want the mod to lock this thread to avoid more spamming.",

People nowdays can give Job to bounty hunters who Will find any people in the world and always Will bring the money I had to stretch my eyes and read over and over again before I could at least grab this particular statement about you referring to people who always make emphasis \"Not your key not your coin\" as kids. But I will like to ask, do you know what this statement actually means? Because if you do you won't say what you just said, as there are several reasons why people make that statement and it Is,* When your coin is on an exchange you do not have total control over it, because one day the exchange could wake up and freeze your funds or go bankrupt and you lose all your assets.While,* When your coin is stored in a cold wallet such as \"Electrum\", you are presented with a private key whereby you have total control over the entire asset, as it can't be frozen or lost, in as much as you can still remember the keys",

They should have known better, if they don't research first then they should take the consequences instead of just blaming in crypto groups. I'm actually tired looking those people blindly choosing the projects.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 11, 2022, 03:46:54 PMThe bigger then money the more people will want to take bounty Job.Even then, if it pays like a dust they will still apply to the bounty lol.",

But not all of them are worth it to promote. It is risky to be a bounty hunter and the reason why I stopped this is because you don't know if you are helping a project that scams people. All you think is profit that will probably get not be the quality and potential of the project.",

Especially if the payment is in the top coins, not in the new coins.Big allocation or budget or partition would be totally useless since most of the projects would really be paying up with their own tokens which means that their value isnt known yet.No matter how generous or big the staking would be giving out or allocation but if these tokens would be ending up on having no value then all of your efforts and hard work wouldsuch come to waste and this is why bounty hunting is never been that good or ideal to do nowadays because of this reason.It would be only worth if you do join up on a campaign or bounties which do pay up on established coins like Btc and other altcoins which you could potentially make out conversion but if not thenrisk is always there.",
