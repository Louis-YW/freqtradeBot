Already had BNB so no need to talk about BNB.you can take a look at nominex.io, an exchange based on Binance and usdt. there are also many tokens and coins that can be traded there. there is also a farming feature that can grow your investment assets, and an update that now has a staking feature that you can check on nomiswap. I've been there for 1 year and have never had a problem.if you already have binance, all you have to do is create a metamask wallet and transfer your binance there and connect metamask to nominex, everything is done, it's just what you want to trade, or farm, or invest.",

      "body": "The most popular dex is Pancakeswap. You may use trusted aggregators like Dextools. So it will be easier for you to understand everything. Since you are holding BNB means Pancakeswap is the best choice, because it's built on the BSC chain. Using dex means you are holding your funds and you have full control over the funds. But don't forget to secure your wallet in a proper way. I will discourage CEX since you will not have control of your funds exchange will control the funds. But if you really want to use cex by knowing everything then Binance would be responsive for you. Don't forget to check tokens real or fake once you are using dex.",

They still far from Binance but they are better than most of other CEX. Personally I think they have good promotion and marketing strategy, though I think their overall User Experience is still need improvement. Their FTX token price is falling pretty hard recently but the whole market is in red.",

As of today, most exchanges are Binance style, they have their own tokens but their growth is generally not too big to hold them. Holding exchange tokens is only suitable for those who like to join the launchpad. BNB is the only coin worth holding because of its upside potential, the rest is difficult to grow.",

My second suggestion (although not too familiar with the exchange) will be FTT, I see its previous ath was above $80 and see people speaking highly of the exchange which could only mean the token will be good enough to buy. My third suggestion will be HT Houbi token, one of the top exchanges in the crypto world and a trusted one too. Kucoin KCS is also a good option, so far they have demonstrated to be a reputable exchange. You have quite a few good ones to choose from, it is up to you to decide which you think will be more profitable for holding long term.",

Already had BNB so no need to talk about BNB.Well the biggest one is obviously BNB but you already said that this is not interesting to you. At the moment there are several exchanges tokens out there that are interesting to me like for example Huobi token or FTX token but i have not read to much about them so i can not really tell about all the benefits that you get from holding this tokens.One exchange token that i am holding at the moment are KucoinShares though and i am quite happy with them. If you keep them on the exchange you get a share of the trading fees each and every day and if you have a big amount of KCS then this bonus is not even that small. Also you can take part in token or NFT offerings if oyu are holding more than 100 KCS. Of course if you are keeping your tokens on the exchang there always is a small risk of losing your tokens.",

I don’t know where do you get that option you have right now OP but look at the comments now, there’s a lot of good suggestions here instead of investing with that unfamiliar exchange.",

BNB in this case, eventually gonna have bullrun, it's just waiting for the trend to chance though it's just my 2 cents, but it seems BNB gonna be surprising a lot of it holders in the future.",

Already had BNB so no need to talk about BNB.I doubt any exchange tokens, CEX or DEX would be good for long term holding. They carry more risks. For any reason, if any of those exchange fails or something happens (like a major hack or something similar), the tokens would tank them with them. Not sure why you would want to invest in a exchange token. Other than giving lower fees, what other benefits do they carry? Better stick with bitcoin and regular altcoins.",

They recently migrated their platform to cosmos/atom If im not mistaken, and probably one of the best dex token that are still undervalued right now.
