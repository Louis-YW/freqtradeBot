When bitcoin was created, some people will not mine it even if they can use their personal computer to mine it. Even if they can use their phone to mine it, most people will not still do that. There are bitcoin critics and there are some people that will support bitcoin. It is now that bitcoin has gained world recognition that more people want to buy it. That is what OP is not getting correctly. I hope he will create his own coin and give it to people all over the world and see if that is even possible. Given it to more people only also means that the coin is not having value or of little value. But most people will see it not having value and will not even accept it.",

Bitcoin and fiat are worlds apart in their origin, utility, and distribution. Satoshi may not be your hero, but understanding the genius behind his concept might help before launching into a rant.Your steps, while imaginative, lack depth. Uploading heartbeats or DNA? Really? You want to risk privacy for monetary distribution? Your utopian currency seems like a hacker's paradise. And lets be real: distributing transaction fees to all accounts is neither feasible nor efficient. As for letting users vote on where network fees are used, its a wild gamble in a decentralized system.Come up with a more comprehensive plan, and maybe, just maybe, you'll have a point. Until then, try educating yourself a bit more.",

The difference is that fiat is 100% centralized and unless you want to break the law in a lot of countries and go full cash anonymous, you are using it through a centralized service like a bank that monitors your ever step and has its hand in your pocket.This is while bitcoin is decentralized and you don't need any third parties and nobody has or can have its hand in your pocket.P.S. you also don't know the meaning of the word \"premine\" it is wrong to use for bitcoin with 100% mined supply and it is wrong to use for fiat that keeps being printed without cap lol",
