  "content": "For most of bitcoin's existence, what appears to be volatility is just the market trying to determine the price of a new asset. But even as it's become more widely adopted it seems that the biggest downward driver on price is bitcoin's liquidity. It can be so instantly and easily turned into cash. 24x7. So anyone financially compromised turns to their most liquid asset: bitcoin.When markets drop in property, stocks, forex or even altcoins - bitcoin drops. From FTX to Japan raising interest rates just a quarter of a percent. A lot of people turn their bitcoin into dollars and there's a dip.Worse, because it's expected now, people sell to avoid the paper loss.I'm interested to hear people's views on this trend and if, how and when the pattern might be broken.And is particular, has it kept bitcoin's price lower than it otherwise would be, or are prices recoveries 'complete'?",

Most of the time there isnt much action on weekends anyways but if there is a large event then it can lead to a huge dump. Many traders around the world take the weekend off and hence there is less liquidity and this is why the volatility can go up.Bitcoin lately is more stable and less volatile than many stocks, look at stocks like NVDA or INTC, these are huge mega cap stocks and look how volatile they have gotten in the recent weekends, bitcoins lately has more liquidity to control its sudden moves.",

SInce you're calling bitcoin 'new' compared to other assets, you should have used the word \"relatively\". When you say \"bitcoin is a relatively new asset\" your readers will understand what you mean. For someone with English as their first language, you should know this. Quote from: deepskydiver on August 19, 2024, 12:28:51 AMBut even as it's become more widely adopted it seems that the biggest downward driver on price is bitcoin's liquidity. Are saying adoption has a negative impact on Bitcoin? If that's what you're saying then I disagree. Even the volatility of Bitcoin is something that makes it stand apart from other assets. Bitcoin is $58k today, if not for volatility people like me wouldn't be able to buy it at a cheaper price when it was $30k. If the lowest bitcoin can drop to for instance is $57k, there would be no need for holding bitcoin for a long term and it wouldn't be an asset that gives good profit if the highest it can grow to is let's say $60k. Volatility is part of what makes bitcoin a good asset.As for adoption, Bitcoin is a currency. Of what use is a currency if only a couple of people use it? The more the adoption, the more people accept it as a means of payment. For P2P transactions, how is that going to be made easy if you have to search the world for people who have BTC and want to exchange?Both volatility and adoption are good features of bitcoin in my opinion. The problem is, we want it to keep going upwards, forgetting that volatility works both ways.",

Bitcoin is an asset which demand and supply with other economical factors controls the price and no one can fully understand what makes the price to dip and pump. I know that FUD and FOMO can also contribute to the price movement of bitcoin.When there is high level of inflation, it most affect the price of bitcoin because investors might sell part of their bitcoin for other purposes and new investors might not have enough funds to invest in bitcoin which will make the price dump. You should also know that currently bitcoin is one of the best asset that gives high profit in the long run than any other asset.",

Arguably its relatively high liquidity and 24/7 market is actually alleviating volatility somewhat, e.g. the Nikkei 225 Monday crash would probably have been less pronounced if there'd be price discovery during the weekends as well. (of course after-hours trading exists, but trading volume seems to be rather limited)I think the far larger factor and simpler answer is that Bitcoin is still being viewed as a high-risk asset.

That contradicts your statement.The price movement isn't a result of liquidity, or the lack thereof. The problem is that Bitcoin is quite speculative in nature and that any news, good or bad will induce traders to either purchase or sell Bitcoins. This is seen quite evidently by the policies enacted by the banks recently, or spikes and dips when regulations are being announced. Traders speculate and either purchase or sell their Bitcoins as and when they deem fit. This trend can't be broken so long as traders are treating it as a speculative asset.
