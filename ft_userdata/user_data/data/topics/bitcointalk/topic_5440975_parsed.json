      "body": "Why posting without quoting is a mistake? I usually post without quoting someone post because I just want to reply to the @OP, what's the point I need to quote? I see some users reply to other users without need to quote their posts, but they're just mention their names. After all it just a posting style and it's up to anyone, just like myself where I didn't quote your post.2,3, and 4 are just common mistakes from newbies, but some old users still did that. Because you can see there are a lot users are keep discussing in Altcoin discussions which mean they're still interested with shitcoins.Let me add one more thing one more mistake done by beginner:5. Creating new thread which has been discussed before and the discussion is really generic.This mistake was done by you, because:Some avoidable forum mistakes of Newbies Some Common Mistakes Made by New Crypto InvestorsTop mistakes of newbies in crypto",

Quotes are not even important for every reply, except you are zooming in on a particular text in the thread.The others about trading and investing should only be attempted after doing your research. Not doing your research is one of the biggest mistakes newbies make that I have observed. Along with assuming the forum to be a means of getting quick money.- Jay -",

You should categorized it next time for a better list. Posting without quote is not wrong if you are replying with the OP general discussion. It’s only wrong if you are replying on a specific post above you and you forget to quote it which create confusion on the general discussion if that’s what you really mean on your point number 1.My one unforgettable mistake during my newbie days is when I trade a high leverage and liquidate my position in an instant because the price fluctuate in opposite direction right after I open my position. A terrible mistake but helps me a lot to become cautious on trading.",

The number one mistake you listed about replying without quoting, I don't think is a mistake, you only quote a particular reply if what you want to say is replying to what was previously said but if you have a fresh idea on a particular topic there will be no need of quoting any previous user.There are more to newbie mistakes I was thinking you will mention but surprisingly you didn't even mention the core newbie mistakes in cryptocurrency",

Well in my experience, my expensive mistake is buying useless coins and actively trading them for days. But after that, I lay low from trading (because I just felt lazy). Since the coins that I bought were shitty, their value went down in no time causing me some bucks. For beginners, do not be like me. Do not leave your coins if you're not planning to hold them for a long period of time. The good thing for me now is that I learned to avoid doing those mistakes and mainly focus on bitcoin.",

There is no balance of knowledge of the forum.2. Self-taught learning requires adjustments to see perfection and will not get results in the near future.3. Want to get rich quickly from the trading results that are carried out, so you ignore some basic things as support and risks that will be incurred.Often we find beginners doing some of the things you mentioned, for me it's a natural thing when they don't have someone who is able to direct them, but over time they will start to learn from mistakes and will continue to increase their knowledge. For the third point, not only for beginners but also for everyone, when placing emotions in trading then the risk will be accepted accordingly.",

They are so impatient that they try to draw attention to themselves by regularly creating new topics, the answers to which are on the forum and have been written more than once. But newbies are trying to create guides, tips, and other crap every day, just to move up the ranks faster.However, this behavior only draws the attention of detectives, who go through all the newcomers' posts and, as a result, spam, zero-value posts, and, of course, plagiarism is detected.A thousand times, the idea was not to run ahead of the locomotive. Reading, researching, and searching for answers on your own in the forum, and only in the absence of answers, opening topics is the best strategy, as well as gaining respect from the participants.  In a word, the more newbies are \"noisy\", the less they stay on the forum, considering the rules of the forum to be very strict.",

Is this necessary? This helps both the viewers and the op, the views can click on a quote link and go to direct original post a user is replying and for OPs that used Telegram, it will notify them of new replies and quotes..*Trading is out of forum related discussion, this is trading knowledge is necessary for beginners but I thought your message to the newbies is about forum mistakes.",
