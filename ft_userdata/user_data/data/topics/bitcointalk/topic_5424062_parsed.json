  "content": "I'm reminding everyone here of the frequent collapse of centralized exchanges, which has resulted in many assets and wallets being drained and dried for trusting their money on centralized exchanges despite many warnings of not your keys, not your coins. I have a message for everyone, and I hope they take it seriously, especially those who have yet to withdraw their coins from centralized exchanges or custodial services.The new designs of exchanges share a similar pattern and there is something I have noticed, Defi wallet integrated into Binance exchange wallets as a sub wallet and very soon, other exchanges will imitate the same style just to acquire more liquidity from users or traders.Binance has integrated a Defi sub-wallet into their exchange, the option requires you to add a recovery phrase from your wallet to interact with its own BSC blockchain, we all know how important seed phrases or recovery phrases are meant to be with you, no third party. It should be with you alone because that way, no one can get to your coins, they want you to keep your recovery phrase on their exchange please don't do that, care less of their policy whether they save it or not, centralized exchanges are element of the same company that cannot be trusted. Your seed phrase or recovery phrase is intended for you and only you.Some of the things you need to know:1. Not your keys, it’s not your coins.2. Don’t paste your recovery phrase on any exchange, I know very soon other exchanges will follow the same pattern which will result in the stealing of funds.3. Do not rely on centralized exchanges/ leave your coins on centralized exchanges.4. Don’t share your private keys with people5. Back up your recovery phrase and make sure they are properly secured and safe from threats and thieves.",

I better send btc when I need to send for withdrawal, and keep it in a trusted wallet (the one I use, electrum). If there is such an wallet integration feature on Binance, users need to create another wallet that is specifically designed to receive only a certain amount. Don't integrate a primary wallet which has big money value in it to any exchange even with seed phrase import feature, learn from any hacked exchange in history, when people lost their asset from this case. and we never know, where 3rd party saving our seed phrase, if it stored on server, its mean your account not really save.",

The major reason why DEX is not favoured by many is cause most have low liquidity when compared with bugger centralized exchanges, and this is a result of most users opting to use such centralized exchanges, boosting the userbase and its liquidity. Having more people shift to decentralized platforms would make then more profitable to operate and run and also make them more attractive to other traders.",

There is nothing developers can do about this, there would be centralized and decentralized exchanges in the industry and it is left for crypto users to choose the one that they want to use, at the moment the majority of people are going with centralized exchanges, they want things fast and easy, even though it is less secure and they lose their privacy; the only way the numbers will favor decentralized exchanges is if more centralized exchanges keep misusing users funds, going bankrupt and getting breached, i believe that way crypto people would have no choice but lose faith in centralized exchanges for the numerous cons that they do have.",
