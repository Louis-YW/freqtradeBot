  "content": "Good day everyone as the title of this thread said that I am already 1 year here in our community even though the exact date of my registration is May 14, 2021, and now it's already May 16, 2022, because of my job and almost busy every day I almost forgot that special day. I am so thankful to be part of this fastest-growing community which is everyone here can learn a lot of things not all about the forum, but also other discussions on different boards.I came here on the forum without any knowledge of what is bitcoin and other related cryptocurrencies but a big thanks from a friend of mine who introduce me here and teach me, after creating an account  I am not active for almost 1 month because of lazyness after I realize that  through this forum I can learn a lot, like on how to trade, invest and many more.1 year here in the forum I manage to rank up to Senior Member many struggles I encounter I've done a lot of mistakes in my newbies days but my friends in a different country they motivated me they said that just keep going forward and remember always don't do anything against the forum rules then somehow, someday you will reach what others already achieved. After that, I start reading different discussion from the different board on the forum and helping other who need helps.But after the super typhoon came here in my country I badly need a regular job to sustain and for the recovery from the damage  by the typhoon, and that's the reason why I spend less time here than before. #best regards Shamm",

      "body": "Shamm....I just have to say that your post sounds almost exactly like what typical bounty-hunting shitposters write, i.e, this is a forum to learn, trade, invest, follow the rules, \"I had a friend\", etc.  Note: I'm not saying your post is a shitpost (although I'm beginning to dislike these horn-tooting celebrations of \"achievements\", which in this case only took the passage of time).Take that as constructive criticism and not an attack against you.  Also, take note of the thread Solosanz linked to.  That's where stuff like this ought to go.",
