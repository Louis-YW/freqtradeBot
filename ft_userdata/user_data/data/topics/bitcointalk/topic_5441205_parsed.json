You can buy at any price and sell at any price as long as you feel profitable, but without analysis you will have a hard time finding good areas to buy.Understand how the market works, that is the recommended step for you. But it's a good idea to understand what botcoin is, instead of just expecting to profit from it.",

Problems with the local currency force people to look for better payment methods, and I am glad that in this country you can pay with Bitcoin, as I understand it, quite calmly.But OP, why are you creating a topic here in the newbie's section? It would be better to get comfortable in your local section first; you have a very good support group. Understand that by asking general questions on one topic, people simply will not be able to provide you with the entire amount of information.Just look at the name of the forum—the entire forum is dedicated to discussing Bitcoin.Grow and learn; everything is in your hands.",
