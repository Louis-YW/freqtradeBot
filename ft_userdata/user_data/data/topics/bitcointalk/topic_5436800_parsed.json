Thanks all and please feel free to continue to make recommendations and provide helpful advice as we will be reaching out to potential managers in the next few weeks to get started. Kind regards all. I was interested but I've done a little research. And now I have questions before I could toss you an \"application\" First off Id like to state your messages on twitter are disabled And tweeting with davinci looks lazy and tacky. I'm a little confused to what your service is, is it like nicehash? But instead of BTC payouts you do USDC and your own in house token called \"Home\"?Your website a few snippets.QuoteHow can I withdraw my earnings?As your PC is earning, you will be credited with USDC. This is a popular stable digital currency that can be easily moved to your favorite exchange or wallet and converted to USD or another digital asset.I see I am also earning Home Token. Why?BitHome is creating a simple and elegant way to reward individuals with PCs and mining rigs. BitHome wants to reward users beyond the earnings they can make through mining with their PC’s. That is why each user is also rewarded with their % of the HOME token in relation to the work they are doing.Your Service and privacy policy don't show up.Your \"Whitepaper\" did though.Code:Forward-looking statements can relate to potential future goals and project features that may or may not be built to the description in this paper. BitHomeis continuing to develop the platform, and this paper is simply meant to be an overview of current state of BitHome. This paper may include a vision forwhat BitHome would like to work towards. This encompasses, but is not limited to, BitHome’s goals, development expectations around the platform,features that may be discussed but not built or fully built, or any performance related to any growth related to the platform, community, token etc.Statements made in this paper are not a guarantee of future performance, features, products development etc. Do not rely on these statements, they donot provide any guarantee of any kind. These statements will carry risk. BitHome is under no obligation to provide information or any forward-lookingstatements.While BitHome coin is calculated in 10 min intervals, rewards on the platform are batched in intervals divisible by 10 (currently 30min) to eliminate dataentries per day.BitHome’s own blockchain does not exist today and is not in development as of this writing. This is considered a forward-looking statement and apotential goal of BitHome.Staking on the BitHome platform is not yet staking in the sense of performing validations on a POS blockchain as BitHome is currently leveraging theEthereum blockchain. Staking on BitHome currently is locking up HOME token on the platform and being rewarded for doing so. In the future BitHomewould like to build its own blockchain to allow staking that will support the chain. See BitHome’s future goals for its blockchain and platforms.These may or may not be goals of BitHome. These are considered forward looking statements.It's the starting with \"Forward-looking statements\" and ending with \"These may or may not be goals of BitHome. These are considered forward looking statements.\"for me. How do we redeem \"Home\" and how is its value determined?https://www.bithomemining.com/ is this your project?",

      "body": "Thank you for checking out the project and for your questions and concerns. We are here to be as transparent and build a brand of trust over the years to come and we are happy to answer any questions and help clarify your concerns or confusion. BitHome has been in development for well over a year and is continuing development. We are just beginning to enter into an open beta phase and allow user to test out the platform and software. We have opened DM on twitter thank you for pointing that out.   We are not using davinci to tweet we are using chatgpt for some tweets. We have written an article about how you can best use this to generate tweets about your business in the way or fashion that you like and you can check that out at https://medium.com/exploring-ai/3-things-you-can-leverage-chat-gpt-for-as-an-entrepreneur-e20867d50a3f We also do our own tweets and our working on additional video content to help users better understand the platform. We have a small team and we like to leverage technology as part of our business model. Sorry you feel that is lazy and tacky. \"How do we redeem \"Home\" and how is its value determined?\" How to you \"redeem\" home. There is no redemption. HOME is a crypto token native to the BitHome platform and ecosystem. Today it is an Ethereum based token and can be transferred and utilized inside the BitHome platform and on the Ethereum network. You also asked how its value is determined. With any crypto token value can be determined by liquidity and buyers and sellers. With any asset, price discovery happens when there are willing buyers and sellers, and we cannot provide guarantees or estimates of any kind around value. We are working to build a software platform and project and we have chosen to provide the overview in our documentation. \"https://www.bithomemining.com/ is this your project?\" Yes this is our project. Thanks again for checking it out. We hope this helps clarify any of your confusing. We are here building and will continue. Kind regards,",

As a bounty hunter, I have worked on a lot of bounties for many projects, I recommend to you a number of professional bounty managers without bias, and you can see the portfolio of each of them and see a list of their previous clients, and their nicknames in the forum are :1- Hhampuz <-Service topic2- irfan_pak10 <- Service topic3- julerz12 <- Service topic4- Royse777 <- Service topic5- joeperry <- Service topicIf you don't find someone who messaged you first on your Twitter, you can contact them through forum messages or through their official Telegram accounts.
