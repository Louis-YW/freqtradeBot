I strongly believe that this user can prove out to be a scammer and we should close the door before he do any wrong. more ever he break the rules of forum and should be treated.

The point is he must not revers his payment and we can't make sure about that.He's high likely a scammer, using telegram since it's easy to clear all chat and reversible payment. If he want to buy USD and sell cryptocurrency, then there's a chance he's legit user.",

I have to agree that if he agrees to do this transaction and he agrees to be the first one to do it then there's no problem. Also, if he also wants to use an escrow then I guess that makes it safe. Otherwise, there's the obvious if he rejects to do any of those and wanting the other party wants to go first and pushes the payment method that allows to reverse transactions.He posted another thread and told that he's got a lot of Bitcoins.Quote from: Adam Bryce on August 28, 2023, 03:11:10 PMI have 23.5 BTC which i want to exchange to USDT/USDC/ETHContact me via telegram: @adambryce",

As you've quote from what tomatocage stated that it's almost impossible for a newbie to just open an account and go straight forward to offer a service on loan without having experience or much details on what he's offering, such people have hidden agenda to use reputable organizations name or profile to scam others, maybe he thought here could be as other platforms not moderated on the use of social media, the more they keep appearing here the faster their bubbles are getting bursted.",
