  "content": "is it okay for you guys that metamask will now get ip address of the users? since we still want to be anonymous, if this will be implemented are you still going to use metamask, although they say that if you will use custom RPC they said that you will not be subject to the new policy, but i know most of the users are using the default settings for metamask especially those who are not much tech persons.Is it also the reason why trust wallet price pump because users are now transferring to them?Here is the source of the news:https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-will-start-collecting-user-ip-addresses",

      "body": "1. If you want to achieve 100% anonymous, you wouldn't use Metamask since it's a wallet that used to hold centralized shitcoin that will harm your privacy.2. If you want to achieve 100% anonymous, you wouldn't use less decentralized swap platform and centralized exchange!Quote from: tech30338 on November 28, 2022, 12:07:16 PMTrading - This is where you are going to buy a coin in an exchange like binance or use uniswap, metamask to buy, sell coins.3. There's no relation between Metamask's new policy and the increase of shitcoin price, actually anyone must hold their coins on hardware wallet if they want to hold for long term.It's better if you learn about privacy concern first rather than create non sense thread.",

Although personally, I'm using VPN so they might collect my VPN provider server   and if you have multiple vpn obfuscation they might don't know your real Ip is",

On one hand, it might help them enhance security and user experience, but on the other hand, it could potentially compromise the anonymity that many users value.I mean, if privacy and anonymity are a top priority for you, then this new policy might make you reconsider using MetaMask. It's true that they mentioned using custom RPC would exempt you from this policy.  For alternative options like Trust Wallet or learning how to use custom RPC settings.",

This is very bad and risky.",
