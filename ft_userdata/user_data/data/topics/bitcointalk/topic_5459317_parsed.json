The few boards it does make for GPUs are indeed for Teslas but I'm not sure how you will fit 20 of them in a single box.Also I am only seeing results for Tesla P40 when I type this search term in Google.What I suggest doing is go through this list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_chipsets , and try to find a motherboard with one of the recent Intel chipsets and that also has enough PCIe lanes for powering four (nvidia) GPUs, and then order them in bulk.",

If it's faster then an similar priced (and power draw) card then go with them.If not, it's only $200.-Dave",
