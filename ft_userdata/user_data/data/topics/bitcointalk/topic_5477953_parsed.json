Anyone who has access to the private key can sign the message. Therefore, you must maintain the security of your private key and sign the message in a form that cannot be used in the future by mentioning the name, the date, the purpose of the message, the validity of the message, and then any change in The wording of the message with even one comma will make the resulting signature being incorrect.",

In several discussions in this forum, people gave their views on how he could prove himself with majority supporting signing a message from one of his Bitcoin wallets. This reality that someone can actually claim that message make the whole thing complicated. Anyways, I doubt Satoshi is coming back to prove anything, it is not necessary because Bitcoin has evolved and made name for itself.",

It has been more than a decade since Satoshi has left. Somebody else could have gained access to those private keys. So signing from an address in the genesis block can only prove that there is somebody who has got those keys. Whether that's the real Satoshi or not is not decisively proven though. Right now, it takes a hundred of things to prove that you're indeed Satoshi, which makes any claim pointless. Any claim, even if it's coming from the real Satoshi himself, will have to address so many doubts.",
