Our main activity is the analysis of signal providers in the currency and cryptocurrency markets.❇️ We have developed an algorithm, a system that checks all transactions of a provider for a certain period of time and gives the result in the form of several tables: general and summary. They display all the necessary data for the analysis of the provider.❗️ We have already verified more than 90 forex market providers and also more than 180 crypto providers. We have tested over 85% of all traders from the TradingView community.🌱 Save your deposit from losses, verify your provider.➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖ ➖🗣 Chat of our community — Link🌱 More about us — Link💻 Website — Link✈️ Our Telegram - @TraderStatistic",
