To have a social media network that borrowed it's features from the Bitcoin network is commendable. A social media that has its username as private keys like wallets is attractive. The Nigerian government should obey the Supreme Court judgement because their is separation of power between the executive and the legislature. For the society to be free of anarchy, every institution should obey the law.",

But they would have to pay the miners' fees every time they used it. Nostr is using the simple, basic principles of encryption, but without a blockchain to be protected in the same way that Bitcoin's is. Nostr is almost like a simplification of PGP with the addition of room for two things:1. Ease of use;2. The quality of being able to have any number of apps built on top of it... built by any home programmer who has the skill.Lots of countries have patterned their government on that of the US. But they forget one thing, the thing that makes the US government strong. This is the strength of the 12-man jury.In the US, a jury can overcome any law that the government makes... limited to the case at hand. It can act like the government in any case, again, limited to the case at hand. Most countries that have adopted the US jury, don't give it the power to more-or-less regulate laws like this. So, the government of those countries is not really by the people.People don't like being slaves, even if it is limited slavery.",

You cannot bring up a topic and write nothing about it. Is the problem inflation or redesign of currency? Is it redesign of currency or the presidential election that will happen in few days. It is about the election or cashless policy of the government. This is about a country, make sure you understand what you are posting or better include a link so that people will read and understand the true nature of things.",

Posting topics on Nigeria's elections and government on Nigeria's local board will allow for a wide range of debates about what is going on in Nigeria.Having stated so, the Nigerian Supreme Court has adjourned the naira redesign case till March 3.Links: https://www.channelstv.com/2023/02/22/breaking-supreme-court-adjourns-naira-redesign-case-till-march-3/I anticipate that at that time, the Supreme Court would issue its ruling on the naira redesign dispute. Let's sit back and watch how it unfolds for the time being because, in my opinion, after the Nigerian election, everything will return to normal.",
