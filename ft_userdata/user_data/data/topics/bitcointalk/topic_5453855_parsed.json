  "content": "Hey, everyone! I've noticed that on campaign threads, the manager often leaves important bits of information in a post that's sometimes a few pages back. For example, in my current campaign there are things worth knowing about, before applying:Quote from: Hhampuz on May 02, 2023, 10:27:00 PMIf I catch you \"bumping\" your application or if you re-apply (while having left your application here some time in the last 2 weeks), you'll be put on ignore and forfeit any chance of joining this campaign in the future.Quote from: Hhampuz on May 02, 2023, 10:27:00 PMFor now you can continue to apply if you are a prominent member/previous CM participant.A lot of applicants are just flat-out ignoring those requests (more the second than the first), either because they find them inconvenient, or because they're not aware of them. Instead of forging ahead on my own and making a patch, like I usually would, I thought this time around I'd try getting some feedback from the community before sitting down to code. What do you guys think of a feature that would let the OP of a topic specify some \"banner\" text that would appear at the top and bottom of every page of that thread (maybe in a colored box, or something)?My thinking is that that would help with problems like the above, and would (over time) likely find a bunch of other use cases, too.",

I think you have already seen cases of some members making signature campaign applications even when the topic of the thread is saying CFNP or FULLOn the flip side, it helps the manager to know who is worthy picking and who is not based on how they don't even take a little time to read through the campaign OP or thread. I support your idea, but I doubt it will make much change when it comes to dumb applicants.",

Because the last manager message can be about term changes, application approvals, payment announcement, joke etc.If you can something to filter it further, it will be better but I am unsure it is possible to code.Your patch should allow a manager to add texts they want to get in the filterYou can code a filter to ignore any message from manager with these words that is for application approvals.Code:Bitcointalk Profile Link: Current amount of posts (including this one): SegWit (preferably bech32) BTC Address for Payouts: EARNED merit in the last 120 days: My dumb idea.",

It will help Campaign managers or the thread creators to write something important like an announcement/news header. But, Whoever never read replies before they apply in a thread won't read that either. See this, for example. The Campaign Manager said; Quote from: Hhampuz on April 25, 2023, 10:44:14 PMIf you are prominent Sr., Hero or Legendary Member feel free to apply. You do not need to have earned 500 merit in the last 120 days but please look within and be honest with yourselves about your standing in this forum and the content you produce. Now Look at the application of a potential participant and what he wrote;Quote from: acroman08 on May 10, 2023, 02:21:35 AM~Hi, I saw in the title that the campaign is open but I'm not sure for which slot, I'm posting my application just in case, thanks!He wants to participate in a campaign but did not bother to check the thread if any spots are available for him. This is how people ignore most of warnings! People were talking about giving warnings on a page, and look what theymos said;Quote from: theymos on February 20, 2019, 11:06:13 PMHonestly, I think that someone that na√Øve can't be protected.

I'm saying that campaign managers would be able to use these \"thread banners\" to keep important information in a very difficult-to-miss spot.

See the above response to iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2.Also, although I didn't do a very good job of explaining this (only one vague sentence at the end of the OP), I think a feature like the one I'm proposing would end up being useful for quite a few things. The problem I outlined in the OP is what gave me the idea, but when pondering new features, I like to avoid specific solutions and try to come up with things that would be generally useful (and I think this one would be, for auctions, competitions, etc.)",
