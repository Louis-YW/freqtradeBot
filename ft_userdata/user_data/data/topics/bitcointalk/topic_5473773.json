I hope u understand and grant me this extension.I would like to ask for second extension for this loan. I know it is already too long but my situation is not that good. I will pay with more interest on this extension and I hope you understand.extension time: 1month (on or before 12th july)repayment: 1250 usdt.I have put in bold what I think may help to understand why he has defaulted.",

I can't imagine a healthy-minded person can act like Edwardard did.You think it was some kind of exit scam, where Edwardard just got tired of being here and decided to wind up his bitcointalk \"career\" by stealing from you on his way out?  Assuming you don't hear from him, that's what it looks like to me and it's unfortunate--I recall when he was managing at least one campaign at any given time, and I remember thinking it was odd that he'd started participating in campaigns rather than managing them.  Either way, sorry for your loss.  $1000 is a lot to lose to a scammer no matter how much money you've got (and I don't have a clue as to your level of wealth, I'm just saying).Edit:Quote from: shasan on November 12, 2023, 02:16:33 AMI had also thought that the user was in serious condition due to a family issue. But if I am correct then the user might have response/contact me while the user came online but I have no response after several tryings.That might explain the need for money all at once instead of having to earn it over time through a sig campaign.  Still, with bitcoin being as high as it is and perhaps headed higher....I don't know, I don't understand the thought process of people who pull shit like this.  I guess there's still a chance he'll get in touch with you, no matter how slim it seems, and I hope he does.",

It is not a joke when they say usury brings nothing but misery and fire to the lives of both side, I mean there is not a single person in the history that could claim they have found happiness, health and wealth by usury, it always ends bad. Not to mention God says usury is equal to fire in life and there after.Having to pay such high interest rates, discourages anyone, but nevertheless they were fully aware what they were doing, so it's on them as well.It's best to trust God and help those in need by lending money with 0 interest, when God says that he will return much more than you lend others back to you one way or the other, you just have to trust him enough, you know.",

I don't think it's good to bring religion in this discussion. It's up to the lender if he want to lend with interest or not, even @OP lend with interest, I'm not sure if he's really make money from this service as there were many users scam him before.Even banks also ask interest and they're more aggressive when the borrower can't pay his loan.",
