  "content": "Hello,I've searched and couldn't find an answer either online or on this boardI'm considering buying either an S17 53TH or a T17+ 58TH but I can't decided between the two.Both seem to be using the same amount of power 2,350WLow power mode is what I'm after, with lower fans, temps and power usage.In theory, the T17+ should be the winner but I'm not sure since I don't have the information.Can someone please let me know which one of them can be set to use the least amount of power? I'll be using custom firmware for undervolt, auto-tuning and fan control.Thank you",

      "body": "@ BitMaxz : Thank you for your reply.Both the T17+ and the S17 are listed at the same price and with the same 2,350W power draw. Keyword: \"listed\".Electricity isn't an issue right now but could be in the future. I was also leaning towards the T17+ but again, my goal is to run them at their lowest possible speed with the least amount of power draw.I did have one S9 a few years back and I remember I could set it at low as I wanted even at 1TH with the BRAIINS OS. Would the same hold true for these models also?@sidehack : Thank you for your reply. So at low power modes, the S17 would be faster than the T17+?Whichever I choose, they will have their chip radiators re-pasted so they don't fall off, an issue that plagued both models from what I've read.",

You might have trouble with losing hashing efficiency clocking under around 400MHz (about 40TH with the S17 Pro, I think) but with an aftermarket auto-tuning firmware on there, finding a suitable setpoint should be pretty straightforward.",

As far as I'm concerned, it's behaving as expected.Please let me know if something is wrong with the above. Until then, I'm enjoying finally having a working ASIC miner. Maybe next year I'll get another one.Cheers!",
