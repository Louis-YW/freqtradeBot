  "content": "Goodmorning fellow btc traders, one thing i hate is to open  thread like this against a company but, i have to do this after 15 yrs of collaboration with validity.com (also known as 250ok)Validity.com is an email/data validation company based in Boston (United State)I started collaborating with this company back in 2008 or earlier after a brief interview via skype.then the company  was called 250ok. Paul fearless was my supervisor.Everything went smoothly in regards to communications,payment..until 2019 during lockdown due to covid19 pandemic.  One evening, i recieved a notifications in regards to payment from PayPal. I was sceptical, so i had to log into my paypal account to verify this paypal.I sent an email to the associated email address in regards to the payment. It was at this, i was told that 250ok company has been acquired by a new company (validity.com)From this point, i notice series of changes (delay of seed payment, signing of collaboration document via docusign...)The last norification from the company was a modification of mode of payment from paypal to bank. After filling out the form indicating my bank info's and other neccessary info's, i never recieve any payment from this company for the past  12 months plus.They keep giving excuses from one bank tranfer error to the other. So, i have to request one time payment via paypal in order for us to save on any associated fee's before closing the collaboration contract but, it appears they are more comfortable when it comes to delay/holding collaborator's paymentProof of document will be uploaded within few biz daysPls, i need your suggestion(s)taught on this issue.RegardsBitcseo",

      "body": "You worked for the company within the 12 months of non-payment? If you are certain the reason they gave for non-payment isn't your fault or not from your own side, then the company has a problem that needs to be quickly fixed otherwise they are violating the laws that protect workers like you(assuming it's not the fault of a third party) ... and could immediately be punished for such violation. Since it is a company based in Boston USA, you probably should inquire about the State's labor law to see if it's applicable to your circumstances especially as a foreigner. You may inform the body that regulates the labour law in Boston/USA about your issue and wait to hear from them. If the reply is good and helpful, you should let that guide you. Otherwise, you could continue to wait for the company to pay you or just inform it about the consequence of late/non-payment of its worker wages which the worker is entitled to. Then wait for little while and watch how quickly they resolve the issue or get punished.",
