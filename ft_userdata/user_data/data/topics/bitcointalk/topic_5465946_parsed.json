  "content": "MetaMask just rolled out a cool feature: now you can smoothly turn your crypto into regular cash and send it straight to your bank. This is starting in the US, UK, and other parts of Europe, mainly focusing on ETH.Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/metamask-adds-bank-and-paypal-feature-to-withdraw-to-fiatThey're even planning to extend it to other networks soon. Plus, you can now add your converted fiat to your PayPal too. A handy update for MetaMask's 30 million users. But at what cost?MetaMask conversion fees, and bank fees that would depend on your exact location. Security risks too. They require users to share their personal information and bank or PayPal details with Wyre, which may expose them to identity theft or fraud.And if you're not careful, you may also lose access to your funds should MetaMask or Wyre suffer a hack, a breach, or a shutdown.But, nevertheless, one step closer to crypto global adoption.",

Plus how much they are going to charge for this one? The price could be similar to other banking services for sure and there could be instances that it will not be instant withdraws. I have similar problems years ago with such cases, that I have to call the bank or the platform itself as they advertised it to be instant with a higher fee. And that time I needed the money right away but the services fail me.",

I anticipate that they will expand this service to additional countries soon. However, individuals who prefer to keep their identity concealed may not favor this, and I think it might lead to a slight boost in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.",

However, it's essential for users to be aware of the associated conversion fees and potential bank fees based on their location.MetaMask charges a 0.875% fee for each withdrawal, and your bank or PayPal may also charge a fee.This is a major step forward for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it makes it much easier for people to use their crypto for everyday purchases.",

They manage all the nodes in the wallet, and it is easy for them to prevent you from broadcasting your transaction with their knowledge of all your addresses. Now they will be able to know your personal data and link it to your bank accounts, and all of this, you bear the risks in preserving your cryptocurrencies.They have become a bank without guaranteeing the clients' assets, it is closer to the security lockers that some banks provide.",

If we are using wallet to convert, we are at least saving the transaction fees. So I believe if the conversation fees is competitive, it's good for the users. Unfortunately, my country is not listed so unable to test that feature right away. But hopefully it will be available soon.",

It should be emphasised that this withdrawal feature is exclusively available only on Metamask Portfolio. Also, they not only support withdrawal or selling, but users also can buy cryptocurrency using FIAT.This would be good since it makes liquidity and money flowing out or into cryptocurrency easier. It gives convenience to people who want to utilize the Buy and Sell cryptocurrencies with FIAT directly.Quote from: Apocollapse on September 09, 2023, 09:35:21 AMBad feature, this is really terrible if someone want to protect their privacy.Well, I think everyone should acknowledge that MetaMask visions are not going that way.",
