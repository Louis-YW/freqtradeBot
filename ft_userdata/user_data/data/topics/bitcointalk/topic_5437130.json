While in the forum we have many lenders who are giving loans for lesser interest, you are asking 4 to 9%. You have no track record nothing. This could be a collateral scam attempt too. You will ask for collateral and walk away with it.Quote from: yahoo62278 on January 28, 2023, 06:03:19 PMSign a message with today's date and your bitcointalk name showing you have 50btc to loan if you want anyone to take you seriously. Otherwise, this just looks like a silly attempt to steal users kyc info.Even with the 50 btc signed address I don't think I will be trusting them with a collateral.",
