Oh, then Kraken would be sufficient and suitable for that. You may not be able to withdraw every week though as 10 USD currently is only 0.0004, which doesn't meet the minimum amount (0.0005).If you're OK with using Lightning Network, then you can try OKX as OmegaStarScream mentioned above.",

Withdrawing 10$ like amounts from centralized exchanges it's not worth it, unless you're doing it on LN. Holding for half a year and withdrawing 250$ at once may make more sense[***]For such low amounts you may:1*. Find even people on the forum sell you such low amounts.2**. Find your way to a DEX (see https://kycnot.me/ for example, it has a nice list, although many of them don't accept fiat, but it's easy to find what you need)3. Go for reputable OTC exchanges. The price may not be as nice as on a CEX, but it may contain all the fees, including the withdrawal (of course, read all the info available).* Beware, there may be trust issues. Use escrow.** There's a learning curve for using DEX and selecting trade partners that won't scam you. Even a hones DEX can have dishonest traders, but if you are careful and not rush it, and learn how to do it right, you should be fine.---[***] Sorry, I've first read 10$/month, hence this late edit.",

Read my topic on consolidating small inputs. Get a hardware wallet. Exchange weekly, withdraw each time the withdrawal fee is less than 0.5% of your balance. So if the fee is 1000 sat, withdraw when your balance is more than 0.002 Bitcoin. That's close to once a month at current rates. Don't use LN for long term holding.Good luck!",

So where's the origin of the funds before it was sent to your exchange account? Why don't you just send it directly to a non-custodial wallet first, then do things later on since you can send even a 1 sat/byte fee using a non-custodial wallet.",

Binance BTC withdrawal fee is more than 1$ if you passed Kyc2 which is expensive for you because you says that you making every week transaction of 10$ only. Kraken is best choice so far because fee is only 0.23$ and no big risk involve and everything will be in your hand. All other Cex has high fee and more than 0.5$ which is not recommended for your status.",

So I would like to know if there is any good exchanger with the lowest withdrawal fee that you have used.You requesting for a suggestion on exchange that charges a very low withdrawal fee is not bad but you should know that there are different priorities that one would need to look into before jumping to conclusion. If an exchange fee is kind of low, I hope you would be prepared to meet up with the requirements involved in opening an account with them or otherwise. There are lots of exchange available that charges very little fee for withdrawal but you should not get your funds into scam exchange all in the name of looking for low fee exchange where you can trade and withdraw funds from.  From the above mentioned exchanges by other members all seems reliable and credible but you would do your own research and check reviews to clear your doubt to your satisfaction.",

If it's with fiat and you are using a popular payment method, you could consider Bisq for your BTC purchases. It's not only a decentralized exchange, but also a non-custodial and open-source wallet where you can leave your coins the same way you do on Electrum, for example. Whenever you decide to withdraw them elsewhere, you only pay mining fees. It's good because you don't have to withdraw them every week.The only question is if you will find trading partners willing to sell $10 worth of BTC or if the software allows it.",

It's better to deal with a reputable exchange than to get involved with a scam exchange where one could easily lost his funds all in the name of trying to reduce some expenses. It would be better majority of exchange get to implement the bitcoin lightening and besides op try to withdraw from other network is very risky because is not secure as the main bitcoin Network.",
