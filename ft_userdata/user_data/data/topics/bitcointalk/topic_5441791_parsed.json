Smooth organization operates as a function of good economy situations. When you economic power is stable and dignified, the evidence of Man's labour becomes very easy.You are right that basically the economy is the main pillar that must be controlled properly, in other words a strong state is with abundant economic power and proper management. The role of politics is to play its role where mobilizing the economy needs to ride on and this is where politics does its job properly with diplomacy to outside regions or countries to have good economic relations. So that cooperation is established to achieve a balance with each other.",

I use my country for example, the government introduced a redesigned fiat currency notes thereby given a policy order to retrieve the old notes in addition to a cashless policy that place restrictions to limited amount of transaction daily. All of these policies and procedures have introduced a lot of controversy from different quarters of the economy. To cut the whole story short, it exposes a lot about how economic power is derived through political power as the political controls the economical.",

But with the existence of economically powerful countries like China, the sanctioned countries already have options to whom they could ask for loans. It is the world we know today.When a country is able to provide for itself and provide products from its resources like China, it becomes independent. And will start investing in other countries and gain political allies. And just like an individual who has a good steady job and is financially independent, he can think of the welfare of his family.",

The government will not be able to operate if economic resources are not healthy and vice versa all the things you mentioned must go hand in hand, because all this support is needed by the government in carrying out the state system.",

When you economic power is stable and dignified, the evidence of Man's labour becomes very easy.When you refer to economic power, you refer to the availability of money, because you cannot talk about the economy without mentioning money. No matter the kind of power any government has, they need finance to execute whatever is planned and finance to also manage things. Money is powerful and any country that has unlocked how to stay in abundance of money is usually a powerful and influential country and can afford to use the influence of their economy to improve their military power and political influence. I agree with you that economic power is perhaps the most important.",

There are countries in Europe that are devastated but was able to recover in short amount of time, maybe they have  good leaders, but still though they have to produce something within inside and transform it as their best assets and then export it somewhere else. I still remember my history teacher in HS about this one, it is still the people and how they are going to produce that will help countries to recover from devastation and I think still applies up to this day.",

The other forms of power need financial power to function which is why other forms of power always want to attract economic power.
