Zero-knowledge proof may be considered in Bitcoin since it will solve scalability and privacy and it may not be considered but if it's considered then we're going to see another BTC fork coin. However, zero-knowledge proof also has its own drawbacks despite its benefits and it's just like the Tor browser you may not get the needed privacy if not used properly.",

I doubt that it will enhance the scalability, ZKP is complex when integrating into an existing protocol, and it may cause vulnerabilities such as bugs and errors. And it will add additional computational work, which is difficult to scale. When it comes to privacy, we don’t directly link our identity to a wallet public address unless you reveal and expose it, so we can remain anonymous if we want to and avoid using centralized platforms.",

You cannot dtart making comparable analysis of bitcoin with altcoins, you know that yourself that that's impossible, bitcoin has it own network and works according to it protocols, if you think thie issues of increasing transaction fees is going to be the problem you can have with bitcoin then maybe you should also consider other benefits bitcoin has over the other cryptocurrencies as well, ay least there were times things were very high with bitcoin transaction before the introduction of lightning network, now ordinals comes up, but before this.The transaction fee has always been high occasionally, let's wait to see the lasting solution to this, i believe it's not going to be hard like this forever, neither should we take this as a zero knowledge proof of whatsoever thing it may be, bitcoin network is still the most preferred over any form of centralized coins or network.",

Nah if after reading the article you still think BTC already had this system then I suggest reading it again, basically, ZKPs were meant for privacy concerns and still are, even many mixers like Tornado Cash is using ZKPs and as far as I remember it gets the useful information from the users but due to the zero-knowledge consensus it doesn't. It's a little confusing but you will get it.

By privacy incrementing factor of ZKPs, did you mean to say one would fraud other if yes then how it is related to decentralization, because for a seamless transaction one has to open a smart contract and the BTC blockchain is already capable of doing that, if you are making a deal then make a smart contract. If I still have not mentioned the real meaning of what you are saying then please elaborate more what you mean by a party scenario.",

For those who only knew about ZK proof through this post, give this quick read a looksee: Zero-knowledge proofs, explained Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explainedDeveloping and verifying ZK-proofs can be resource- and computationally intensive, particularly for more complicated proofs. This can result in longer processing times for transactions and more computational work, which might make blockchain systems more difficult to scale.Furthermore, ZK-proofs might add a layer of complexity that might make the protocol more difficult to audit and verify, sparking worries about potential security flaws or bugs.The article actually says the waiting times will be longer.The second bold part is the biggest problem: Over-engineering.The more complicated the solution is, the more potential attack vectors there will be. We should always follow the principle of simplicity unless we really have no other choice. There is no easy way out of this really, at least for now... Layer2 is still a good solution and we should adopt it instead of making everything more complicated.",

Therefore, ZKP will only limit the usage of the Crypto mixer and I hope to see the implementation of ZKP in the future for more competition in the tumbler space.",

Actually, I was trying to say, that if BTC blockchain comes with this feature then the traffic on Mixer might reduce because now people are getting a built-in feature to remain anonymous so why would they select a third-party platform?And yeah there is no doubt that to remain anonymous we have to follow more than 1 step to remain anonymous.",
