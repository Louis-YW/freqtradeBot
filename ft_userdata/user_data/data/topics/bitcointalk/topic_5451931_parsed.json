  "content": "Bitcoin Fees, Nodes, Ordinals Inscription and way ForwardOrdinals Inscriptions are the newly introduced images or texts embedded with a bitcoin transaction on the bitcoin network on blockchain, they are otherwise known as NFTs in form of arts, this makes the bitcoin network get more busy with activities thereby causing the transaction fee on bitcoin to rise, ordinals was introduced to the bitcoin network in march 2023 and the rise in transaction fee occurs as a result of the token called BRC20 which is the major reason why we experience an increase in transaction fees because it's a new inscription included to the bitcoin network with higher fees and the more the demand for this token is the more blockspace needed for bitcoin transaction to the blockchain which aims at increasing the transaction fee.We can assume that miners are one of the beneficiaries of this experience because they receives higher fee in other for them to maintain a transaction space for every individuals before their transactions is being run and get confirmed, block size is equivalent to about 4mb and any attached inscriptions may needed to be splitted if more than the block capacity it could contain, but the good aspect of it is that this experience may not last longer before a solution is being made Rise on bitcoin total transaction fees.                  rise of bitcoin transaction fees since after the introduction of ordinals.Graph 3Graph explanation on conditions why the ordinals inscription has an important role on transaction fees.Increase in Demand on bitcoin ordinance inscribed transaction increases the bitcoin transaction fee, while decrease in supply on bitcoin ordinance if the blocks are not saturated with inscribed ordinals simultaneously decrease the transaction fee. source Areas of Applications of Bitcoin Ordinals1. Fashion Industry 2. Metaverse technology3. Supply Chain4. Arts5. Medicine6. Agriculture7. Data science8. Music9. Industry brands 10. GovernmentIt is important to note that bitcoin Ordinals currently are in art formats (images) and there could be further progression into the other aspects of the economy as listed above with time, we must also take cognisance that bitcoin ordinals are not directly a smart contract NFTs, but they exist under the blockchain network, Ordinals increases the application use of bitcoin but has caused the incidence of increased bitcoin transaction fee, though they are well secured with the bitcoin network on the blockchain.Disadvantages of Bitcoin Inscribed Ordinals or Risk Associated.1. It may serve as an avenue to infiltrate malicious attack to the bitcoin nodes2. It causes congestion to the bitcoin network and activities 3. It increases bitcoin transaction fees on the networkSolutions to tackle this challenge on Bitcoin Ordinals The bitcoin network can act in such a way that miners will set a particular range (limit) as transaction fee for each block before getting confirmed and those that contains Ordinals or that do not comply to this protocol be removed into mempool and left unconfirmed.Reference:1.

      "body": "Those ordinals are absolutely useless for anyone and I don't know why people are still trying their best to bring NFT's into Bitcoin blockchain. It's because of such people the bitcoin network fees are increased and many users are getting affected by those higher transaction fees. I don't think that those ordinals can bring anything good to Bitcoin blockchain rather than bringing higher transaction fees.Those people who are still behind that NFT propaganda are just introducing such technologies to loot the innocent people. There is nothing called NFT in art world unless it's a physical piece of art created by a unique artist but in this case we are seeing bunch of artworks that have been generated by AI image generators and are of no use.Anyone can create those NFT's or in bitcoin network called ordinals out of thin air with just few prompts to increase the pressure on blockchain. These useless ordinals are causing more harm than good to the blockchain because there is no need for such protocols in Bitcoin blockchain. I wonder how can we protect the blockchain from such useless protocols?",

To support game-makers, miners and mining pools do have their roles in high transaction fee too. We cannot have evidence that they do this and that but it's reasonable if they broadcast some transactions in mempools with very high fee rates in order to force others to join the race.At the end, miners get benefit from the race by earning very good mining rewards than usual, with abnormal high transaction fee (with some blocks, it is up to 6.6 BTC).Verify it with Bitcoin block explorershttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=time(desc)#f=id,hash,time,guessed_miner,fee_total,fee_total_usd,size",

      "body": "I think that the fact that this type of misuse of the Bitcoin blockchain was allowed for in the initial concept illustrates the fact that Bitcoin was never intented to be a global mass payment system. The banking system would never allow the inclusion of large pictures of stupid dolls in their payment transactions. It is also interesting that this attack appears right at the time the bankers are ramping up the release of their central digital payment systems. Of course it is just a coincidence, or is it God helping the bankers with their Unicorn projects. Stay wild and free, and cut off the fake horns of the Unicorns.",

Miners probably lost or sold a lot during the last year or two...tightened regulations, tax introduced in some jurisdictions, forces to move due to mining bans and forces to improve the energy cleanliness of their operations. This shortfall needs to be made up for somewhere and manipulating fees with clever tricks like this only makes sense for miner groups to pursue.",

So what is the solution are we going to see a split in the way Bitcoin works now they we have been lied to clearly?Or will all this extra money people are making quiet down the fires of anger at what has been allowed to occur?Either way what has happened has damaged Bitcoin in the eyes of many feels like years of effort may be washed away for what?These are dark days for Bitcoin.",

And this mess can go on for very long.Bitcoin is not a decentralized digital currency right now, it's a decentralized casino for rich people to gamble on NFTs.firstlynone of the versions of ordinals qualify to be NFT.. none have true proof of transfer that is inline with how bitcoin/blockchains shows proof of transfersecondlythe memes (ordinal v2) was not actually being traded by lots or real individuals. it was a very small tight group sponsoring each other or more specifically selling memes to themselves to fake some high listings to hope some naive suckers come along and pay similar prices. you can tell its a small tight group becasue all the memes suddenly died out at the same coincidental time. then the next variety of spam started. in random world of individuality nothing happens so precisely, thus reveals how small and connected the idiots arethirdlythis spam this week is not to do with ordinals. its mostly just mining pool manager spending their rewards to make transactions with high fees to pay back to themselves thus no real costs. some may be sponsored to do this but most of the funds come back to the pool managers. its not really big whales wasting their hoarded coinsits mainly pools recycling old rewards to make new rewards via inflated fees to themselves of their collaborating pools..now back to the old v2 scam of the memesno they could not afford it. because if they were rich they would not need to scamthis latest spam is more of the mining pool group not the casey scam group",
