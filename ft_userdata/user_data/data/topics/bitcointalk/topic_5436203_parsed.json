You can mine other coins on 4gb and rest mine. I dont have 4gb for testing.There may be a problem with the RAM buffer overflow on the video card, but this is very easy to check if the monitor is connected to a video card with 8 GB of memory or disconnected for the test 4 GB videocards.Windows only uses the memory of the main video card that the monitor is connected to, there should be no problems with other video cards.I recommend Hive OS.
