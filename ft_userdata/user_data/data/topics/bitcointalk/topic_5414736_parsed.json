      "body": "You have to check the track record of the platform with such offer, especially on stablecoins, the highest i have seen from a legit platform is around 10% per annum, except for terra ust which offers 20% back then but that is history now. Nowadays, most platforms use this high return of investment method to lure investors to their platform initially as stated by @batan_bitcoin but as more people join the percentage will be dropped. So don't expect it to continue this high.If you want, you can take it but it will most likely be for short term.",

You have to analyze the fairness of the returns as well, don't just be blindly attracted to high numbers.Agreed, remaining interesting to investors while not explaining the underlying scheme seems like an outright ponzi. And incorporating \"DAO\" isn't give it any better, remember when Solana's DeFi platform DAOs' are agreed to do a hostile take over of someone's account. The recent bear market gives some centralized cryptocurrencies platform catastrophe until they get bankrupt. Making a new one under the disguise of DAO in the current market condition should be done with thoughtfulness not by solely finding a way to remain appealing to investors in whatever promotion or scheme that it would offer.",

On the day of profit distribution the whole amount will be in the treasury, investors can decide on the full or partial withdrawal of funds. With this approach you cannot build a pyramid.",

I know that it is forbidden to use the word \"bank\" in the name of the organization without an appropriate license. At the moment we are not going to get a banking license. There are more questions than answers with the DAO licensing so far. As far as I know, DeFi is not currently regulated. Of all the DeFi protocols, only AAVE recently received an e-money issuer license, and they applied for that license back in 2018",

The risk is really high than invest in Bitcoin because you don't know how trustworthy is USDT and USDC, there's a news if the CEO can freeze their coins on your own wallet. Another thing is how trustworthy the pool or centralized party you want to put your coins into. If the pool or centralized party have bad security, there's a chance can be hacked.While if you invest in Bitcoin you will have almost 100% security and the income high likely higher than 15% APY when you hold for at least 4 years.",

I am once fool on that and majority of crypto users. Im talking about ust staking. Well the percentage is pretty good and has decent profit from it but due to such feature or backed system it go down just like that.
