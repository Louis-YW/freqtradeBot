Went to sleep and checked in the morning only to be proven correct, both users had edited the blank posts and filled in some spam 1-liners.It's pretty evident that this signature campaign is filled with spammers, who don't mind promoting a service that has scammer numerous users, and are also abusing basic forum functions in order to reach their minimum quota.They're the following two users, Theones and bitgov:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=502210https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=253969Excuse me for the photos, they're not that convenient looking from my phone.Photo proof",

When I say, unfortunately, I mean, there's no point in reporting it to the campaign manager, because he already knows it. it's just their way of doing business.the maximum we can do is to mark them with a red tag but they already have it, so it's useless.",

I guess moderator won't take action then.In this specific case, the ending posts are not too much of a contribution to the discussion. However, back in 2017, I remember things worse, before the introduction of the merit system, the forum was filled with spammers. Currently, I believe that this is caused because of 1xbit's campaign. It's offering low quality/spam posters an opportunity to earn money, in any other scenario, they wouldn't have been accepted in any signature campaign.",

I still remember a few days ago when I was reading a thread on an economics board I found a lot of empty reply posts. but a few hours later the blank reply was edited and filled with a normal reply. But if I find it again then I report it to the moderators as spam. I guess that's enough. because as long as I report a spam post, the moderators always move quickly to delete it. sometimes even less than an hour. so that this step becomes effective. so that the spammer can't find the post to edit again because the post has been deleted by the moderator.simple steps and in accordance with the function and purpose of the 'report to moderator' button.",

No other campaign would want to pay such posters, if 1xbit's campaign didn't exist or was prohibited on the forum, we wouldn't see so many abusers.

The more spam posts that are removed the better for the forum regardless of the participant of any campaign.

However, if I understand what you're saying well, those users make shit posts to fill out their signature post counts before going back to change them, if I'm right. Does that imply that the campaign manager will simply pay them whenever the posts are complete, regardless of whether they provide great content or not? If I'm not mistaken, promoting a project also requires quality posts. Does this mean that the campaign managers don't just care because they've already been labeled scammers in the forum?",
