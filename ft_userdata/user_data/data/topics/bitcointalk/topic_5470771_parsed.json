I don't think the Op is the owner of the exchange; someone who is knowledgeable enough to develop an exchange will know how to market it and know that this is not the right way to create awareness for his business, as a professional proper ANN thread will do just fine and every piece of information needed can be found there.What I think is that the exchange might have just hired the wrong marketing team, which the OP appears to be part of, and the person who is in charge of the marketing might not even be checking what the OP is doing. What they know is that the information has been made public on Bitcointalk.The exchange is new, and they have a pretty good amount for daily trading volume. That's if those figures are real and not just some random number given to be made public.",

What they know is that the information has been made public on Bitcointalk.That is most likely the case.A small exchange with a small budget hires a crappy firm to do marketing for a couple of hundred dollars, those try to make it with just 10% of the sum and they hire some idiot on Fiverr to do 5 posts on social media websites and forums.Now fast forward, the exchange gets suspicious looks for this and a $ loss, and rather than new customers trying it you have older ones advising everyone to stay away from a business with such practices. Mission accomplished!Anyhow, this doesn't change the previous user assumption:Quote from: Orpichukwu on October 18, 2023, 10:40:39 AMQuote from: SatoPrincess on October 18, 2023, 10:31:30 AMJudging from all the posts you have made since you created this account, it’s obvious this account was created to promote your exchange.

Visit Koinpark site and know more about rewards and campaignsI am not always comfortable when exchanges promise so much benefit to their customers. Yeah, it could be a marketing strategy to attract customers since it is a new business but it could also be a bait. People's ugly experience with centralised platforms is enough lesson to be careful with them.   Quote from: Orpichukwu on October 18, 2023, 10:40:39 AMThe exchange is new, and they have a pretty good amount for daily trading volume. That's if those figures are real and not just some random number given to be made public.This thread Proof of reserves? Insurance fund? Best I can do is a random number generator! will let you know that these centralised platforms can do anything to attract customers and gain their confidence. Just bear in mind that any figure can be manipulated.

Can't give a bigger reward, 60 cents is not even enough for the transaction fee :3Quote from: AHOYBRAUSE on October 18, 2023, 12:38:17 PMI wanted to post the same thing when I checked his posting history.Why even promote it without any affiliate code or whatever.And if OP is an official representative of this exchange he should be upfront about it and not just throw in some random info and expect people to become curious about the site.  We see this quite often these days unfortunately.Maybe he is an employee of the exchange or maybe just a volunteer.It is India's local exchange and I just found out about it. This kind of promotion is not good marketing, people will look down on it because there is no intention to promote an exchange platform professionally. A good promotion would be to hire Influencers who will make a bigger impact, rather than just posting on forums with the title \"Start crypto trading at Koinpark\". There is no benefit and no reason I should switch from my favorite exchange to Koinpark Exchange.",

You've got everyone giving negative opinions about centralized exchange without even trying it.We have a popular proverb that says: “The goods offered are cheap,” because even if the goods are good, people think, why would he offer his goods to us if they were not bad or had a defect? You have to learn how to display your goods so that people can appreciate their value.",
