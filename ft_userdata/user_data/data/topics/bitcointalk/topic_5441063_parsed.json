But i wasn't bias on the question because i know that Bitcoin is a digital currency and it can buy things for the country that approve it as a legal tender, and with Bitcoin profit you can buy things for shop's that accepts bitcoin for monetary transaction's. So i want to ask this question generally so that i will have more insight of what bitcoin can buy using Bitcoin without converting to fiat currency before making purchase.",

You can exchange it with fun only like lazlo exchange 10000 BTC for pizzas.When more people use Bitcoin, its value increases and with one BTC, you can exchange for more things, more pizzas, bicycles, more Cokes.Bitcoin is not deflation but yeah it is only a meme.",

There is no Bitcoin standard like Gold standard in the past. With Gold standard, central banks fixed a price for gold. There is no fixed price for Bitcoin set by any governments or central banks.Price of Bitcoin depends on bank currencies like their inflation can help Bitcoin price but you can not say the opposite. Purchasing power of bank currency depends on price of Bitcoin.",

Everyone's answers will represent the legal conditions of their respective countries. If it were legalized, then it wouldn't restrict you from buying anything if you were in that country.",

As a matter of fact, even if there isn't a single store or shop that accept it as a currency, and you can only make use of it as such in this forum, it is still a digital currency.
