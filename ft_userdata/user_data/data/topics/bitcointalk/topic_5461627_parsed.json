Seems like it was an ISP issue, just needed to turn on a VPN.No you don't need to use VPN it's a server issue related to the website not your ISP. You can just wait I'm sure it would work later without using VPN.You can also try to download it on Incognito mode but if the issue still there I suggest try to change your PC DNS to cloudflare DNS 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1",
