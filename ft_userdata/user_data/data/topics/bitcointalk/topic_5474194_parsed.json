But if you gamble and have not lost so much and win huge, you may just do giveaway. If you have the capability to give those people that are in need, it is good, but it all depends on what has happened to you and the situation your are. Some huge winnings can be recovery of losses, but if not, good to also give out but wisely and do not follow what other people are doing. Be yourself.",

But the thing on influencer was they are just doing this kind of thing for views and promotion for their own benefits in the end. They will somehow use this as promotion to spread their ref links since most of the people who will view his video or post will surely follow him later on.The only influencer that I really like is Mr. Beast which his content is solely for helping people and tackling real life problem using his social media influence. The rest of the influencer especially gambling influencer is not that legit. ImhoBut if I win really huge amount. I will donate part of it on charity.",

If I have plans on what to invest the the money I don't think that I will be giving that much to the community. It is normal that gamblers when they win big, they share a little part of their wins with people around them, and what that guy is doing as a gambler is not something new because they money was gotten in just one game and gamblers believe that such win is worth to be shared with some persons to make them happy.

So if we want gambling to reliably have a positive impact somehow, those hosting the games (i.e. casinos) should maintain some programs to give back. A casino has a steady source of income from people's losses. And having a stable source of income means that they'll be able to fund larger programs that can have a lasting impact communities. Giving someone a laptop once is very good also, but imagine a program that provides education and provides laptops every week. Hopefully more of the bigger casinos will adopt some such programs as they become successful.",

Haha winning little also requires giving as little as it can be but the point is, it is almost like tradition for regular gamblers or addicts to give when they win. They see it as a social responsibility to other bettors to encourage or lift them up also. Sometimes that little money in gift go along way in the life of a gambler at least I know this for off line gambling.However, a non regular player like you might not see it as some obligated impulse to do because you may not have received from others too. More like it is a routine thing for people who gamble regularly.",

You're better off giving the money yourself to those who are in need, going to charities are going to make it more complicated and there's a lot of charities out there that don't really help what they've promised to help. Obviously you're not going to give bacj to the community if your wins aren't in the millions, that kind of money should be used to spend on your needs if not having a security for your finances. Be careful when you win lottery, you're going to see a lot of friends pretending to be your friend, you don't want to be a part of the long list of lottery winners that were too kind and too stupid to spend their wins that they've lost all of their wins in a matter of days, months or years.",
