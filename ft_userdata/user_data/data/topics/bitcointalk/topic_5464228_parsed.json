So, what might work for one person might not work the same ....Think about how much you could gain compared to what you could lose..........I really liked your all points but the attractive is fourth one because once you calculated the profit you could make on your investment plus how much risk you might have to bear. All other problems and factors solved by themselves like the time to book profit and which mindset should one have before booking profit. These all points are useful when one is doing holding instead of trading.Because I as a holder if follow all these rules (instead If i want to add some more rules) then I will be more than OK. But still as you said, we all have different mindset and different life hurdle like one could bear the market's bearish cycle but other might not. This current dip has refreshed the memory or fact that we should remain calm and not always so optimistic about something because as life is so unpredictable market is also.",

For instance, if you have bought a token or coin at a top price and your end up losing your money because you bought it at ATH. Next time if you want to buy a token again you will first check the all-time low and all-time high to know if you're buying it at a low price. Making and following your trading strategies is an important thing to do",

Just a little market movement in the opposite direction to the plan is enough to make beginners panic.just do it with the flow, even though losing sometimes it makes the psychology of the trader better in emotional terms.",

Absolutely right. People will never be motivated to learn unless they start experiencing their own struggles. That way, they won’t wait for answers, but they will eventually look for solutions to solve their problems and get rid of their current situation. Emotions are the hardest to control, but if you know your emotions will only worsen the situation, I think people are already smart enough to control their emotions and stick to their solutions wherein they can be productive and profitable at some point.",

      "body": "Quote from: Macoach on August 22, 2023, 10:51:08 PM~SnipIn my opinion, the advice you give is very appropriate and very good. Because the advice you provide does contain basic points to start investing or starting trading in the crypto world. But believe it or not, even though a beginner in the crypto field knows the advice like you gave, in reality all the suggestions are still difficult for beginners to implement when they start investing or trading in crypto, especially mental matters. Therefore, material knowledge alone, in my opinion, is not enough. But you have to be trained as the trading or investment itself progresses, so the point is that you have to be able to learn from direct experience. Because what I feel personally, when I first started trading and investing in crypto. My mentality was really tested, even though I had learned all the basic knowledge about investing/trading in crypto. But for some reason I always feel tense and anxious when I see the crypto market, especially when the coin I buy experiences a price drop, even if it's a slight decrease. The point is that in my mind there is anxiety or excessive anxiety. So if I can't stand the anxiety, I will immediately sell the coin that has decreased, even though I am experiencing a loss. Because in my mind, I'm afraid the coin will go down even more.But fortunately I was able to get through this difficult phase, and now I can control my emotions or thoughts more. So in conclusion, studying science in investing or trading in crypto is mandatory, but that doesn't mean that you feel you have enough knowledge is enough. Because the real test will occur, when you have started and run your trading or investment. So it is in that phase, in my opinion, that the knowledge and knowledge about crypto that has been studied must really be used. In order to subside the anxiety and anxiety that will surely be overshadowed. And if you can get through that phase, then you will realize that this is an experience that can be learned.",

Someone who was just introduced to bitcoin or crypto trading cannot understand all you have mentioned above, which is why the first foundation is learning about bitcoin and the crypto itself before thinking of trading.It will be good for everyone who is just new to cryptocurrency to keep these aside and focus on having basic fundamental knowledge about the whole thing before going for any trading strategy.",

It's kind of funny, hoping for a favor maybe? But not all threads are meant for everyone; they provide information to specific audiences. Even if I were to explain how it helped me, you might still find something else to comment on.

That's what they commonly say, but it doesn't align with my perspective. In my opinion, learning is the best teacher. The more you learn and practice, the closer you get to becoming an expert. This is what ultimately leads to gaining experience. You don't necessarily have to make mistakes to become skilled. There are valuable experiences shared by experienced Bitcoin traders, both here and elsewhere, that you can learn from.",

You know, who knows how to meditate? He knows how not to worry.A person who connects his activity with finances will worry, and he must do it. The next step for him is to accept mistakes, build a strategy, and not focus on just one. To understand what is happening to you, you need to experience all emotions, and only after gaining experience will you be able to manage them.Talking about going out and chatting and taking a walk doesn't work.",

If you use all capital you have for your trading, when you fail with your first trading positions, you will lose all or most of your capital. You surely will gain some sort of experience from your tradings, losses but as a trader, no capital, nothing to work with and it's game over.So if you are carefully and think that you will have to learn with market, trading positions and losses, you will have to use very small capital to start and avoid using all capital for trading. After getting loss, if you still have capital, you can learn more, analyze your mistake and come back, of course with rest of your capital.No pain no gain but no capital, game over!",
