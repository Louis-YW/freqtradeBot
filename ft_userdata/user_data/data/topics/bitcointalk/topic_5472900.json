  "content": "The countdown to April 25, 2024, the day of Bitcoin halving from today, November 5, 2023, is approximately 6 months, 3 weeks, and 5 days. As for my personal plans to make the most of Bitcoin investments before the halving, I'll focus on regular investments without dramatically altering my lifestyle, ensuring a balance between saving and enjoying life in the present. Here are the habits and behaviors I have adopted to ensure that I make the most of my investing in Bitcoin before that day arrives:I turned my apartment into a shared one, meaning I got a flatmate and used the money paid to buy more Bitcoins. No more buying new clothes, shoes, phones, or electronic devices. No more eating out. I'll cook all my meals. The money saved will be used to buy more Bitcoins.This month, I'm selling off my car and I'll start using the train for commuting to work or any other essential place. Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary, my social life is going to suffer for a little while. This delay of gratification is worth it.  I didn't renew my gym membership. I purchased some dumbbells and barbells to start working out from home. The money supposed to be spent on the gym membership will be used to buy more Bitcoins.There's a flip side to this. After the halving, my Bitcoin investments would have doubled. I plan to reward myself with the profit by:- Visiting Mongolia, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I've seen a lot of  documentaries about Mongolia on YouTube. How do you plan to make the most of your Bitcoin investments before the halving in 6 months?",

We're close to doing the same thing although I'm on the grind right now so I can accumulate as much money as possible so I can buy more bitcoin, hopefully the prices go down temporarily as I have a substantial amount of fiat ready to be converted to be bitcoin, doing some overtime in my work helps with the accumulation too. I've set my sell out price the same as you too but I don't know yet if I'm going to sell everything or just the half of it and wait for it to go up more again and then sell the other half. I don't really like to plan too much on how I can accumulate more bitcoin before the halving, I don't my life to revolve around just accumulating bitcoin and having all the time of day to be just thinking about bitcoin so I avoid plans.",

I am not going to do these things, unfortunately. All I am going to do is hold my signature payments as long as I can hold them. No pressure at all. I have other income sources where I can live very well. I don't have any plans to Buy Bitcoin at this moment. My Signature payment is like the DCA method. I am getting a couple of hundred sats every week, and I am planning to hold it as long as I can. If I need some money from my signature payment, I am willing to sell it just like I did last week. It depends from person to person. I don't know how much you make and what is your target. But my target is to gather a couple of thousand dollars. Of course I am not going to hold anything significant.",

That's the period of entering the market that I continue to do from the beginning of investing until now and usually I will try to vary and not fixate on the price of bitcoin except for the DCA method. For investment benefits, I haven't thought about which country to visit because currently we are facing difficult financial problems and if we try to travel, we might spend a lot of money.I have big plans to build several profitable businesses, both in agriculture and services, rather than looking at potential visits to other countries. Hopefully your wishes can be achieved and while you can travel, do it because when you have big responsibilities regarding finances it will be much more difficult to do so.",

I'm saving BTC every month and accumulating it, ready to sell when the price is lucrative enough. I don't have high expectations for the next ATH... $80k is already good enough for me to gain actual profits that are hard to come by in other investment instruments like stocks or gold.",

I sincerely hope that won't have any impact on you. Will you feel at ease with that if you had a flatmate? Bitcoin investing is a great idea, but you don't have to do anything that will negatively impact you in order to make an investment. If you are not financially buoyant, you may invest even a little percentage of your income in bitcoin, a large investment is not necessary. Although I personally dislike the idea of sharing my apartment, you may be cool with it if you don't do anything that would negatively impact your bitcoin investment.Quote from: alastantiger on November 05, 2023, 07:46:51 AMNo more buying new clothes, shoes, phones, or electronic devices. No more eating out. I'll cook all my meals. The money saved will be used to buy more Bitcoins.You are hilarious to me because you plan to invest in bitcoin, which means you will stop looking good. For how long will you stop buying new clothes? Do you know when the bull run is going to start? In case if your phone gets broken, won't you get yourself a new phone? If your shoes get bad, you will not get yourself a new one. All I will tell you is to just take good care of yourself so that you won't end up spending all the money you will make during the bull run on hospital bills.Quote from: alastantiger on November 05, 2023, 07:46:51 AMThis month, I'm selling off my car and I'll start using the train for commuting to work or any other essential place. Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary, my social life is going to suffer for a little while. This delay of gratification is worth it. Are you serious about selling your properties because you want to invest in bitcoin? But I hope you have emergency funds. In case of an emergency, if you invest all your funds in bitcoin, if problems arise, and you need money to solve the problem, you will end up selling your bitcoin to solve the problem. So when investing, always have extra cash outside your bitcoin investment.Quote from: alastantiger on November 05, 2023, 07:46:51 AM I didn't renew my gym membership.

Maintaining a car is always a financial headache for car owners. Getting rid of this ballast will allow you to win twice: you will stop spending money on fuel, spare parts and car repairs, and you will also receive money from the sale of the car.

Also, stop buying socks and knit them yourself instead.  Forgive me for this joke. When achieving any goals, it is necessary to maintain a balance by avoiding excessive obsession in accumulating bitcoin and sacrificing a comfortable minimum.Quote from: alastantiger on November 05, 2023, 07:46:51 AMThere's a flip side to this.
