      "body": "The previous bear market had a significant negative impact on altcoins, but it didn't kill the market completely and didn't kill trading either. This time around, some will also lose their market capitalization and never return to former glory, but others will remain and then experience growth along with Bitcoin when it starts recovering.I agree that regulations are the future, but regulations should be centred around protecting customers from losing money by big oversight of operations of companies like crypto exchanges, not on penalizing users, depriving them of privacy and restricting their options. Moreover, regulations should not extend the practices that are related to other businesses, so that they remain reasonable and fair.",

But since the market is still struggling and the factors affecting the market price is still present, we might not see the recovery before this year end. Maybe next year but eitherways, know your goal as an investor. If you cannot afford the market behavior, choose to withdraw for now because no one knows when will bullish trend exactly occur in this industry, so expect red marks on your assets. Surely it will but you'll be needing huge amount of patience before that day come.",

For the oldies and people who have been with cryptocurrency a while longer, we have had better experience with other coins like Luna that also performed in similar manner, so we are quite used to these situation and know that all these are just the bad days of cryptocurrency and the better days not just the good days will surely be back soon. Newbies that just invested in cryptocurrency should be not be discouraged, these are the not so regular occurrence in cryptocurrency and it is not a sign that you should quit cryptocurrency.",

This has shown that when it becomes too risky to invest in shit coins and why we should avoid it.most people know that more than 70% of altcoins will disappear with time, because there is no way for them to compete in this market, with so much copy/paste that exists in this market, many altcoins no longer have any sense of existing anymore, the owners probably already they are leaving little by little, they are already rich, they have already secured their future and they have no idea how to improve the altcoin so the solution is to abandon the altcoinQuote from: Flyingjack123 on November 18, 2022, 02:27:28 PMBelieve it or not the future is of crypto regulations.this is something we are all seeing, exchanges ask for KYC and even casinos ask for KYC and there are still not many countries that have made laws for bitcoin and we are already having a bad time with the damn KYC, so the future and even the regulation, there is no how to get away from it",

FTX shook just 0.4% of people99.6% of people(including me and you) were unaffected and are just gawkers and gossipersbitcoins market price pre drama seen a $17k price. so a $16k price is not a ground breaking cavity for people to fall to their death in. its just a wave of normal tidal movement being at low tide.as for regulationswell alot of people think \"regulations\"  is just KYCits not.regulations come in different forms:(-)user oversight(-)business protection (cant litigate them if under a shield)(+)business oversight(+)user protection(make business actions illegal to protect users)we do need to see more user protection regulations and less sweep a business practice under the carpet (ignorance)but there are other regulatory things itching at the door trying to get into the crypto spaceCFTC+EPA want to limit or restrict mining.limit/restrict how much users can invest",

Can these two manipulate the ethereum node to there favour? Then its slightly similar to CZ controlling Binance what you learn is user of full nodes are decentralised. but they mainly follow what their favoured services deem as the chain to follow because if their favoured services are following something else they are ignoring the users transactions. so users follow the exchanges decisions on all coins(exchanges are deemed \"economic nodes as oppose to just user nodes)with coinbase also a custodian of users stake. those users again wont wont to go against their favoured service because saying no to a coinbase decided change is destroying the coins out of users stake to pay miners of the winning chainso again users follow their favoured service. this makes places like coinbase a double threat to control. becasie they have coin, code and user fanbase control even if the change is bad. their fans will follow or fear losing their stake...ethereum when PoS only had a market price trhat was 2x above value because as PoW value was high . but now in PoS the underlying value has droped 15x.. to a new gap of 30x but the price has not corrected yet. so expect ethereum price to drop soon.right now ethereum is not trading based on its own merit of its own userbase of utility of token demand. it is if you look at the markets.. is blindly following bitcoin prices. meaning ethereum is being held up not by ethereum activity but of market arbitrage holding it up artificiallybitcoin is at great value to buy. ethereum is at bubble inflated premium and not good time to buy",
