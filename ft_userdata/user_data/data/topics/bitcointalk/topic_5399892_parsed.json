All that sold UST was mostly sold for Curve-supported stablecoins like DAI/USDT/USDC as they had the most on-chain liquidity.I'd imagine if that happened then any salvaged luna that was sold - it wasn't too low when the peg first fell, I think it dropped by about a third in the first 12 hours - was probably converted to coins like eth to have a stake in the ecosystem with a lot less of the risk too then. Quote from: AmoreJaz on May 26, 2022, 10:42:49 PM those large holders? but how did they know that it was time to cash out and buy another stablecoin or alt?You might want to check their website's quick explanation video on how luna works to understand this better or see if it clicks while you watch it but essentially:The protocol is based on the idea that a UST was always equal to a dollar of luna and a dollar of luna always equalled a UST (the luna and UST could both be minted via an interaction with their smart contracts on chain). When UST finally fell and lost its peg, each UST could still be burnt for a dollar's worth of luna causing that to crash too as the price of UST wasn't sustained - essentially, you could buy a dollar of luna for 95 cents for a while (and then 60 cents). The smallest losers in this scenario were the UST holders. Quote from: AmoreJaz on May 26, 2022, 10:42:49 PMi have the feeling that there's inside job in this situation. a large amount of money got liquidated for few days and nobody knows anything? that's bs!Terra Luna's redit made for an interesting read for me when this initially broke and more things have come to light since - apparently SK law enforcement have made attempts to freeze the assets of anyone involved with luna (afaik - there was a tweet about stopping any reserve funds from being moved out of their accounts). It's speculated Do Kwon did a large OTC transfer just before that to trade newly minted UST for BTC (or something). Quote from: AmoreJaz on May 26, 2022, 10:42:49 PMand now, do kwon is trying to save his face by introducing their luna 2.0? i hope people are not dumb enough to fall for another crap.This has probably done even worse for his repuation and the price of original Luna (since even its creator has abandoned the coin).

Some stocks have market caps in the trillions like Apple however that just means if everyone sold at the last traded price which obviously is impossible unless an equal amount of bids were at that price.When in reliability all it takes is a small percentage of that market cap in sell pressure to reduce the market cap by like half or so.Same with Luna. Most bought it when it was cheap and never sold. And some bought it a few months back when they were buying BTC to fund the stable coin. And that money is gone now.",

Quote from: Ojengonggu on May 27, 2022, 10:03:01 AMI hope everything gets better soonLol this isn't getting any better. They're trying to revive the chain with a hard fork (turning the old chain into Terra Classic), but the damage has been done. Do Kwon and the Terra project has already lost it's reputation. It's just going to temporarily be a traders haven for now — with them taking advantage of the ignorant few that's still going to buy in to their promises.",

There are reports that this large holder quickly exchanged their stablecoin for various stablecoins and for luna (which they subsequently sold). The above holder apparently sold enough for the stablecoin to fall below its $1 peg, and eventually, confidence in the stablecoin was lost, and the price of luna fell through the floor.Quote from: davis196 on May 27, 2022, 11:26:46 AMI hear rumors that Tether might cause next big cryptocurrency price crash, but this might be just some FUDsters trying to spread panic.Tether is backed by actual assets that are liquid, and USDT can be exchanged for real dollars. If the price of USDT falls far enough below $1, traders will buy USDT at market prices, and will exchange those USDT for actual dollars to make an arbitrage profit.",
