Then I minimize it when I’m doing other things with my computer, does still count or only the time when I browse the forum or remain my screen on Bitcointalk?I just notice that my total time logged in is still very low despite I’m always online because I leave my browser open almost 24hrs in my company computer while my account is still login.",

Having your account on a tab doesn’t mean it is login, when you leave a tab on a browse it almost as though you’re not online and when you come back you will have to reload it to see changes. Example is when you open a thread on this forum and leave the tab and go to another one when you come back to it you will see the same thing (last post) you left but when you reload it then new replies will appear that means you’re now logged in. Another example is when you set the time for you account to automatically logged out and you close the tab and come back after that time has surpassed you might still see the account login as you left it but once you reload it then it will log you out and require login details",

Most of the members of the forum haven't even completed their 100th logged in day and only a few have completed their 365 logged in days. Is it possible for others to see your logged in days or only you can see that? If I'm not wrong then the administrators or moderators might be able to see the users logged in time. Are third-party sites like BPIP.org, or Loyce.club or Ninjastic.space can determine the exact logged time or those sites are unable to determine those things?",

In this way forum members will not be able to outsmart their active time in the forum by using their inactive time as an opportunity to increase their number of days of activeness.",

Actively means opening page, read and do some actively activities. Opening a thread, and leave it there 24 hours does not mean you are actively using the forum for 24 hours.I don't know the formula to count login time and it seems the answer from one of forum moderators, OmegaStarScream is the best you can have.I have 87 days, 6 hours and 57 minutes with my account.

I read through what others have narrated and I realized that there are slight differences in response to how this activity is being calculated. The only thing that is sure is that once you are active, then the counter continues to accord that for you. I mean refreshing and surfing the forum actively, not just typing.The counter might also stop counting in a situation as shown above despite the person is still active on the webpage. This often happens to me mostly when I have a lot to type.",
