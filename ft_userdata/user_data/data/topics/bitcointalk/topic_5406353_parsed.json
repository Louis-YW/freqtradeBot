  "content": "I read an interesting debate about this topic during the time when I experienced heavy loss in online gambling. I’m trying to seek some reason online to justify my loss and give me acceptance for my loss that time. It didn’t help me but make me confused.    Anyway I will share the points of both side because it is the real life scenario.PS: I’m in favor for not banning gambling. @Livecasino  PROAS GOOD AS ANYTHINGQuoteAs the popular adage goes, time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time. Say what you want about gambling, but you cannot deny that it is fun. Heck, even if you do try to deny it, the science will just prove you wrong. We now know that gambling triggers the release of dopamine in our brains which, by definition, is linked to pleasure. All humans like the thrill of a possible reward. Gambling, by its very nature, provides that for us. As long as you go into it treating it like any other leisure activity – where you may actually have to pay up – it’s fine.FREEDOMQuoteWe’re all adults, aren’t we? Do we really need a nanny state to regulate our behaviour? At the end of the day, it should come down to personal responsibility. If you want to go ahead and gamble, you should have the freedom to do so. It’s never a good idea to grant governments the right to legislate morality. We’ve already seen the disastrous results that led to in regards to sexuality and drinking. Of course, like anything, there is always the risk of gambling being abused by individuals. That’s the risk you find with any recreational activity. However, it’d be foolish to create laws based on the extremes.IT’S USEFULQuoteMoney, money, money. That’s what gambling is all about at the end of the day, is it not? What better way for the state to collect tax revenue than by tapping into such a lucrative sector. In 2015, the money brought in by gambling in Europe was 94.2 billion euros. To put that into perspective, that’s nearly 2/3rd of the EU’s annual budget. You’d have to be an idiot not to exploit that goldmine.CONSAS BAD AS IT GETSQuoteReligions across the world have been warning us of the dangers of gambling for centuries. “You cannot serve both God and money,” sayeth the Bible. The Talmud condemns gambling as a sin. The Quran lists it as haram. Certain sects of Hinduism specifically forbid it. Would it not be prudent to heed the common wisdom of these great faiths?Even if you’re non-religious, you’ve surely heard horror stories wrought upon families by gambling. Be it fathers or mothers abandoning their parental responsibilities, losing life savings or destroying their home lives, it’s not a pretty sight. Gambling can be seriously detrimental to your social well-being.ADDICTIONQuoteOf course, you’re free to do as you wish, but how free are you really once you fall into the dark grip of addiction?  Problem gambling is a well-known psychiatric issue. Gambling triggers the reward centre of the brain. For certain individuals, this pleasant sensation creates a compulsive disorder. In Europe, pathological gambling rates vary between 2% and 6.5% in the adult population. That’s not a negligible number.IT’S RIGGEDQuoteThe house always wins. Of course it does: why else would anyone want to open up a casino? The capitalist system is based around return on investments. Casino owners and gambling websites know this all too well and, of course, they specifically create business models to ensure profitability. You could well be one of the very lucky few to benefit from this system, but you’re far more likely to be the stupid schmuck that loses everything. May the very low odds be ever in your favour…Conclusion: I got confused because the first time I read this was I’m feeling down that time while my perspective is against gambling but when I read it again when my mind is clear, I realized that the pro side has a valid point too. At that point I noticed that our opinion will varies based on our actual condition because it’s easy to say that it’s just a game if you are not playing and just sitting in the side line but if you are the one who’s experiencing the actual heavy loss, Maybe you will be in favor to the cons side.  Source: https://www.debatingeurope.eu/focus/arguments-for-and-against-banning-gambling/#.YtD9rS8RX4A",

If you lose, will the government pay you anything or money? No. The government do not care much as long as they are collecting taxes from gambling industry. It is you that will care for yourself and not the government. So in respect to yourself, financial life, marital life and being a good dad or mum, gambling is not a pro or of any advantage for you but for the government.Gambling is fun if treated appropriately by not gambling with what you can not afford to lose, by not gambling with the amount of money that can have you depression or resulting to financial or family problem. Just little amount of money to gambling is enough, we should not see gambling as a profession but as high risk.About online gambling to be banned, I will say no, just that gambling ads should not be allowed at anywhere children are accessing, be it online or offline.",

People who have problems with gambling, which is often used as an argument to prohibit it, if gambling did not exist would have problems with something else, such as drugs or alcohol.",

If online gambling is going to get banned, they should ban real life gambling too. There is barely a difference.What we need is a better education system and less population. Without these, there will always be lots of losers.",

You need to understand that you cannot win every time, and finding justification for what happened to you is already troublesome, IMO. I hope you can find a reason to control your gambling before it worsens.Anyway, I believe that online gambling should be restricted to the ones who can handle it. I think people who have too much time on their hands and gamble their life savings away are the people who should be banned, not the activity itself. It will always be a back-and-forth discussion about which one will be okay. Still, in reality, it's always going to be the person who is at fault and believes that they are doing the right thing even though they are losing so much and affecting the ones they care about.",

After all, the government frequently receives a cut of the profits from online gambling through taxes, which helps the state and economy as a whole.Two, I'm certain that it will transition to an illegal online gambling industry, making it far worse than it is now while eliminating the government's cash cow. Three, the industry has a lot to offer, much like other markets for addictive goods like those for alcohol and tobacco.More importantly, why would they outlaw an entire online gambling industry because some people are degenerate gamblers?",

Religious. It's up to each person how their faith works. I know a lot of guys who have rules in their religion about not smoking, drinking alcohol, and more but they still do it.Should it be banned? No. As I said earlier it adds thrill to the game. It's the people who abuse it that suffer from addiction. It all depends on how it will be used/played individually.",

I think that does not make sense as online gambling is available on the internet, which means all people from all countries can access and play it. Maybe people from specific countries can not access or play gambling on one or more casinos but that depends on the casino policy.It is why before we enter the gambling games, we must have wisdom and control and check if, in our country, gambling is prohibited so we do not break any rules or laws. If our country prohibits gambling, we do not have to try to play gambling because that will make us in trouble. All the things that we know have advantages and disadvantages, including gambling. So we need to know the disadvantage of gambling can make us in danger and you already have that experience. Playing gambling needs to have self-control so we can minimize a big loss.",

We can always play at a moderate way but yet we want the big risk and big winnings. I'm with the pros here as gambling is actually made for that added spice in the different games we play.
