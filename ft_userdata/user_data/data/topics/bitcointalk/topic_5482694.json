What would happen to bitcoin?We don't know what will happen but there will be a chaos, for sure. As far as I know, it's estimated that he owns up to 1.1 million BTC. There are 19 million bitcoins in circulation. Satoshi owns more than 5% of bitcoins that are in circulation. As far as I know, no private or public company owns as much as Satoshi owns, no other individual and organization owns that much too. Now, imagine, tomorrow comes satoshi with one million bitcoins, what will happen? Panic, absolutely every bitcoin holder will be in panic, every business owner and employees will be in panic because it's the situation that no one has thought about and no one has a plan to deal with it. It's a shock.",

Whatever the way he moves his coins, the market will shake. I feel the market will move positively because investors will start believing Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive. The crypto community would be crazy to accumulate Bitcoin and think there may be something cooking behind the scenes. But it's just an assumption; it is unpredictable.",

The disadvantage is the market will experience an increase in volatility, and the BTC haters will find a means to trace him so they can file unnecessary accusations and lawsuits. Assuming, the BTC was moved to an exchange wallet. This will lead to huge panic and possible changes in BTC development.Maybe this is what an anonymous user who sent 26.9 BTC to Satoshi's wallet from Binance on the 5th Jan 2024 wants to see maybe it will happen cause he/she can use the BTC to help the people in need.",

On the time that it would really be making out such movement then it wont really be shocking that if ever there would really be those movement then the community or even the whole crypto space would really be creating those kind of assumptions at the same time to be that happyor optimistic knowing that Satoshi is alive at the same time that tons of people would really be having those kind of fear that it would really be the cause of the huge dump into this market.There's no way that we could be able to know on what would happen in this particular moments or time but pretty much sure that the masses would really be having those common reactionof things that they do have in mind. It is really just that impossible that people couldnt really be able to determine on what are those probabilities.For me, then fear is there on which holding a million BTC coins then it would be able to dump the market so hard.",

The market will be in turmoil because people will be concerned about what will happen to bitcoin after that. Many thoughts will arise that will cause fear, potentially resulting in a market crash. The bitcoin in that wallet serves a purpose, and if that purpose is altered, we can only imagine what the future of bitcoin will be.Quote from: ChiBitCTy on January 23, 2024, 07:19:26 PMI don't care what anyone says, I am certain in the belief that Satoshi knew form day one exactly what he was going to do and how he was going to do it in terms of creating/setting up that wallet and then never moving coins out of it.  So I don't think theres any chance that we ever see him come back again.  It would be great of course as bitcoin needs help IMO.  What kind of assistance do you believe bitcoin requires now?

I mean someone will enter his wallet seed phrase or private keys and then try to send Bitcoin from the original wallet to another, he didn't realize he is doing a mistake, he went ahead to sign the transaction and after all that, he mistakenly broadcasted the transaction hash on the Bitcoin boded to be propagated from one node to another, no my friend that can't be a mistake but intentional mistake and purpose.If Satoshi sent his Bitcoin from wallet to another, that shouldn't be a cause for panic after all we have seen how institutional investors are moving bitcoin from one wallet to another, some of them move them most often to Coin base for sells, some are been move from wallet to another to sell but this are over the counter (OTC) sales and you don't know it's Bitcoin they are selling. So, it's nothing to be serious about and I doubt if Satoshi will even send to centralized exchanges, it can't happen and people will hardly notice if sell is going on.By the way, didn't team unlock shitcoins everyday and sells and nothing happen to the projects? Is Bitcoin that is only the problem here. Millions of tokens are been unlock on coins that are having low liquidity than Bitcoin and nothing happened but people panic over nothing when old wallets moves bitcoin from one wallet to another.",

But I am also thinking, since Satoshi cannot or would not move any coins he has because of the kind of attention it will raise, what is the plan exactly? How does he profit from all this? and how is he coping with creating something that he cannot financially benefit from without raising attention?",

I don't think that it will reach this point because bitcoin has gone through its current price because no one controls it, maybe us or whales, but it is not like we could change the market every time we want without sacrificing anything. And imagine if Satoshi can manipulate the price of bitcoin, then many investors will get out of investing in bitcoin, or worst case scenario, there will be no investors at all. In short, complete chaos will ensue; bitcoin will never be as we know it now if it is being controlled by even the creators themselves. But from what we are seeing Satoshi or other creators of bitcoin are silent, maybe for a particular reason, but one thing I'm sure of is that they are letting us investors do what we want with bitcoin; simply put, bitcoin is freedom in the financial aspect.",
