Have you tried with the default BitcoinZ wallet? and which wallet did you generate the .dat file in the first place?Keyhunter only supports bitcoin wallets, so you can't use the tool for this coin. You need to adjust the code to suit with the specific wallet magic code of BitcoinZ, refer to their address prefixes: https://github.com/btcz/bitcoinz/blob/f8842ec2859d38c22b8b03ee61c91f9f59cad403/src/chainparams.cpp#L159-L173.",

Looking inside binary data seems to be a wallet. Source told me that this is BTCZ.Adaptation is not possible as magic bytes are too short to find keys - file consists of these magic bytes way too often than the private keys exist so I would get very many false keys. One 0x80 byte is for secret key, so it is far not enough.Bitcoin have 10 specific bytes before private key.",
