  "content": "Uncle Warren is angry again.What would be the difference between trading in tradfi and trading in the cryptospace? Nothing except in the cryptospace, small minnows similar to you and me can trade using smaller position sizes and still profit handsomely because the volatility is much higher. On the argument of gambling, I reckon tradfi with futures and options trading is the biggest casino in the world.Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doubled down on his Bitcoin criticism today, once again suggesting that the asset is nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme. In a Wednesday interview with CNBC, the Berkshire Hathaway boss said he didn’t blame people for wanting to get involved in what looks like “easy money.”And today he continued his critique. “Something like Bitcoin, it’s a gambling token,” he said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “The urge to participate in something where it looks like easy money is a human instinct which has been unleashed and has always been there.” He continued: “It’s so human. People love the idea of getting rich quick—I don’t blame them,” before adding that Bitcoin doesn’t have any value but people still want to “play the roulette wheel” by investing in it.Read in full https://decrypt.co/126115/warren-buffett-bitcoin-gambling-token",

I remember a couple of years back when Jemie Dimon and this old uncle criticized Bitcoin in a TV interview, the market did respond negatively and the price fell by more than 20% in a single evening. That's not the case anymore so the crypto market is immune from such criticisms. Uncle can keep on saying whatever he wants or whatever makes him feel happy. It's never a good thing for big corporates or governments when the power of money is available to the commoners like you and me. They often show their frustration and that's one of such cases.",

I've seen him in an interview talking about it and he didn't seem angry at all, in fact he usually speaks quite affably. It doesn't change his mood for Bitcoin to go up and down in price.I don't know why you give it so much importance. He is from another era and at this point in his life he is not going to change his mind. He became a billionaire in a fiat world buying companies that produce goods and services, he doesn't need bitcoin for anything. He missed most of the rise of tech and only very late bought Apple.His are companies that produce goods and services by beating inflation, let's see if we understand, it's not just that he doesn't like Bitcoin.Warren Buffett: Why Gold is a Bad InvestmentWarren Buffett: Why Real Estate is a Lousy Investment",

They are business people, traders always looking for profits anywhere, so their rejection of bitcoin is the most unbelievable thing. What they're doing is simply because they don't want to share their quick wealth with anyone, they don't want too many rich people like them. I always suspect, on the one hand, they always propagate negative about bitcoin, on the other hand, they silently accumulate bitcoin if their Fuds create panic among other investors.",

      "body": "I think Warren Buffett's criticism of Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme is not unfounded and that the value of Bitcoin fluctuates greatly, causing sudden gains and losses. However, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and its value is determined by market demand.In the trading world, there may not be a significant difference between traditional finance and the crypto space. The difference lies in the level of volatility, which is much higher in cryptocurrencies. This means that smaller traders can trade with smaller position sizes and still be profitable. Futures and options trading in traditional finance also has an element of gambling, making it similar to the crypto space in this respect.",

He is the only reason I think why big funds started buying crypto.One thing is also to note that Ethereum took the majority of shares of Bitcoin and if there wasn't a second crypto, Bitcoin today will be worth $41.8k per BTCThat would be above $100k at the ATH of bitcoin.

However, one key difference is that in the crypto space, smaller investors like individuals can trade using smaller position sizes and potentially still make significant profits due to the higher volatility of cryptocurrencies.Regarding the argument of gambling, it's worth noting that traditional financial instruments like futures and options trading also involve a degree of risk and speculation, and can be seen as a form of gambling in some respects.Overall, while there are similarities and differences between trading in tradfi and trading in the cryptocurrency space, it's important for individuals to understand the risks and potential rewards of any investment or trading activity, and to make informed decisions based on their own financial goals and risk tolerance.",

Many people have the false perception of Bitcoin as a magical investment tool, that will bring them easy money and will make them rich quick. The problem here is the people's perception of Bitcoin, not Bitcoin.The big difference between tradfi and the cryptocurrency markets is that tradfi is way more regulated(which doesn't stop some scams to appear here and there and it doesn't stop the \"too big to fail\" banks to manipulate the prices sometimes).I really doubt about Buffet knowing that there are actual gambling tokens(issued by crypto casinos) on the crypto market.",
