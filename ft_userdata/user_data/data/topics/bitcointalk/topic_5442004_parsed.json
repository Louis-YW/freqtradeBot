Out of Metaverse and Artificial intelligence is fine. Then pick anything related to AI if you believe it would be a trend in the next few years. But for me I think it will always be good to spread your basket to potential projects on different category. Like pick few L1, some metaverse projects, some AI related, some privacy field, some gaming or nft project. Dont focus on one project, we dont know what would be the next trend. Last 2021 bull run, the nft season generated a lot of profits maybe will go to another types or resume the nft season.",

Out of Metaverse and Artificial intelligence is fine. We've got an opposite belief with Metaverse but with AI, I guess we're just a few steps closer until it's gonna be a trend in the market. We'll get to know that soon and maybe get a glimpse of it next year. But other than that, I am making sure that I get bitcoin other than any other alts and after bitcoin, I get the top ones like ETH and BNB. Yeah, I'm just rotating with those two as of the moment and not going far with random lottery altcoins that someone might think of having tremendous gains. I want to have that type of gain but I'm going with the slowly but surely strategy on this market.",

Recently, I've also been on the lookout for decentralized gambling projects that allow for bankroll investing, something similar to a fully on-chain Bustabit. Not sure if it's feasible but I think it would be a very attractive.On a different note, I'm a bit confused about the hype around Blockchain x AI. I'm not really sure what the angle or narrative is supposed to be?",

I think you are aiming to get response of altcoins that will be on trend in year 2025 that's why you mention the take you have on AI and Metaverse which is the take of people who will have a good price movement next bull market. Aside from these two, I think there is still hidden gems right now that will show up and be the trend next bull market. I personally don't any idea what those coins are but I'm pretty sure that it isn't being talked a lot today.",

Out of Metaverse and Artificial intelligence is fine. More Bitcoin. Outside of that, I'm looking at AI projects since they're all the boom right now, still waiting to see whether the hype is short-lived or not, AI actually went out of my tracking window at around the end of the year last year. Hoping there are some legit projects out there since AI, in general, has grown well above what it showed when it revealed itself at first around the middle of the pandemic period iirc? Other than those two well I don't have any plans yet, 2025 is still pretty far. I have my bags with Solana and Matic right now.",

We should not make predictions or buy early now, it's too risky if metaverse or AI or NFT is not the trend of the bull season, we will lose heavily.

Even though the metaverse and AI are really very interesting to watch, I don't want to miss any more moments. However, right now I'm even focusing on collecting these 3 types of crypto. maybe other coins also have great potential, but if a bull run does happen that year then bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB will be the first to go up very high.",

Out of Metaverse and Artificial intelligence is fine. Nothing fancy, I will go by the marketcap and will hold BTC and ETH. I know both of the coins since long back and I have seen their capabilities also. So I would rather play safe than losing anything. I might not be able to make great profits, but also the chances of getting losses will also be reduced if I go with BTC and ETH. And as you have mentioned, I will also look for some good NFTs and will add them in my bag. I completely don’t rely on the AIs. So I would suggest everyone to do a manual research on a product or coin before investing your hard earned money into it.",

I had the chance to stack it when it was still bringing 190% APY, I don't know what is the APY now, I unstaked it a while ago, and I've kind of forgotten about it since...Otherwise I always keep some MATIC, XRP, BAT and XMR.I was able to fill up on ONE when it was 1 cent, I don't believe it at all, but I consider it a lottery. I convert some dusts into some memecoin, and other shitcoins, but I sell back to every pump, I'm just looking to increase the value of my dusts. It works pretty well, but I am well aware that it is pure gambling.I am increasingly considering buying cryptos from the ISO200022 family in view of the release of the MICA law in Europe, I think these cryptos will make a nice pump at that time (XRP, IOTA, HBAR etc..)",

How about compiling an already classic portfolio of top coins (top 10-20 lines) and allocating investments among them?Of course, Metaverse and A.I topics is promising, but those projects in which you are investing now may simply cease to exist before 2025. Perhaps the hype around these areas will subside in the coming years, which means that projects related to Metaverse and A.I will also not be of interest to investors.Theoretically, I would be willing to allocate some amount for investment in this area, but it seems to me that many project creators will try to abuse the use of this topic.",
