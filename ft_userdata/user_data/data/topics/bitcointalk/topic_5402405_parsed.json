I am not saying that we will peak again very soon, that is not going to happen, but a recovery to 30k doesn't seem like out of question for the time being.I remember the 2018 period and there was a good recovery period there where we want to 5k+ range, and that means from 3.5k to 5k is a bigger increase than 23k to 30k, but it could definitely happen and be similar because of higher money required to do that. I do not want to convince anyone, I am not a rich person who knows how to trade and be rich because I am not rich which shows I am not a good advice giver, but 30k definitely seems quite possible for now.",

But let's see. Bitcoin just touched the 200 MA today, so it is likely to be a real bottom now, but there are slight doubts about how the S&P will behave, if it continues to fall, bitcoin will probably change the classic pattern of behaviour that we have seen in times of fall.",

However, the negative news has not yet begun, such as the Fedâ€™s decisions, monetary policy tightening, and the worldâ€™s problems are still lingering from the oil crisis, Covid to the supply chains, all of them are putting pressure on me Companies, institutions and individuals, which make the funds allocated for investment few and are used only in extreme cases.Put all this in place and the continuous failure of many altcoins algorithms, those currencies that have huge liquidity from clients and all their assets are Bitcoin and Ethereum.Put all this on one side and political tensions and legal regulations on the other.In forecasting, the most important thing is that we do not close the weekend lower, because it is an indication that the difficult part is not over yet, which may push us very far for the first time.I've bought with all my cash, I don't have a difference between 20k and 18k but I'm afraid we will go further.",

Buying now is still a good time and if rebuying at a later time if price drop sounds good but waiting for EMA crossing may not also be a perfect signal. Splitting may look good like buying 50% of intended investment.",

So final capitulation should be around $18k-$19.7k.",

Given everything that's going on, it's no wonder we're where we are, but when something loses as much as $10 000 in just a few days, many inexperienced people begin to seriously suspect that someone has cheated on them. My local media is literally crucifying Bitcoin and talking about the complete collapse of the Ponzi scheme, but thatâ€™s nothing new considering what they wrote in 2018.Iâ€™m not in TA and I canâ€™t say if the bottom has been touched, but for now weâ€™re sticking above $20k and maybe some things will be clearer in the next 12/24 hours. My layman's thinking tells me that this will not end so quickly, but we can hope that things will move in a more positive direction.",

If situation was normal I woulnd't think that we can go below previous all time high but with all these things going on in the world, I am not so sure.Regarding whether bottom is in, from my previous experience we touched the bottom when majority of people lost all hope, thinking that we won't see another bull market ever again and I think that we are not there yet meaning it can still go down. Either way, I am not interested in guessing the bottom and I am buying ever since Bitcoin went below $30K and will continue to do so. DCA FTW",

And if I'm not mistaken, it's 9 or 10 red weekly candles (correct me If I'm wrong).So there are a lot that is happening around that we haven't seen in the past. So the trend might change or worst this year.Hopefully $25,000 will be reach, that's the next barrier that we have to break.",
