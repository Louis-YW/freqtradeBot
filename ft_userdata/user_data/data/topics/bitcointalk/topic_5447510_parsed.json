Want to know why?- Newbie- No trusts- Account was just opened two days ago- No introduction. You are a ghost. If anything goes south, no one can get a hold of you but you require the identity of a Nigerian- Are you a Nigerian, Amerian, Indian, Japanese?Sorry if no one is foolish enough to respond to you, our name has been dragged in the mud for too long and often times for crimes we didn't commit. So, we are very careful with how we deal with strangers.I hope you understand.",
