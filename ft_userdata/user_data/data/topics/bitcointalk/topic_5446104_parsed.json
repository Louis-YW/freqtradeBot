True, as newbies only have limited knowledge and no enough experiences before they start trading, so that put them into high risk of losing their capital. Controlling the emotions is the key, but you will never master it unless you are never exposed to the real trading scenario and that you only invest to gain profits and not to learn and master trading.",

Controlling our emotions will always be hard as we are used that in everything we do, we always consider our own emotions. But in trading, the more you use your emotions, the bigger chances you’ll keep on losing. Most particularly if you lack the knowledge and experiences that you need as a trader. That’s the reason why new traders should never trade unless they are ready, mentally and emotionally. Otherwise, if they still insist to trade because of greed for profits, their money will just go into waste and end up losing them.",

Mistakes and errors are the best teachers which it is usual because you cant learn up things on positive outcomes because before you would be achieving this state then you would really be having to go through withthese challenges on which on the time that you had corrected out these faults and mistakes and learn from it then you would really be going into a point on where you could handle up yourself within this market.Emotions could really affect you out on big aspect considering that it could alter out decisions and plans that you had made out earlier.Learning is something that you do achieve out of those errors that you have done but of course it would be depending whether you do learn from it or just simply ignore.",

Self-emotion might be an enemy for you to consider but sometimes, that emotion saves our asses in trading in most cases.Emotions are human nature. It is always associated with our decision in trading. It's really tough to withstand every market condition and you can't just simply say to others that they need to control it. Even professional traders feel emotional when they lose. What matter there is, after those big losses that result in emotional stress, traders should learn to bounce back and learn from those mistakes.Building experience is really the key while being serious about doing trades.",

Experience is a big factor so you will be an efficient and successful trader in the long term. Without experience, you will find it hard to succeed in trading and you will always find it difficult to control your emotions especially when you are chasing for bigger profits, or you want to recover some losses. That’s the reason why controlling one’s emotion is a big challenge in trading, that most of traders fail to achieve it.",

You can only learn it all if you allow yourself to experience it due to constant trial and error. Trading isn't that easy since you need to consider things that would hinder your ability to trade and that's controlling our emotions when trading.Generally, it's not just trading that will benefit you if you'll be able to control your emotions perhaps it will definitely make you choose the right path of choices when you control your emotions.",

So true, people often think FII is your worst enemy in trading but surely it's only and only You yourself. It's you who will casually break your own rules casually and then do revenge trading further losing even more capital of yours. So obviously experience of failures will eventually teach you this thing only to do decision making correctly.",

Yes, that's exactly one of the main reasons why newbies are losing with their first trades. In all aspects that relate to risk-taking, every newbie is bound to lose at their start because they don't know how to plan the market yet. But once they gain experience, that's where they'll able to learn the lessons and manage to plan their next move on how they'll respond to the first failures that they've made. Those that aren't discouraged are the ones that continue and learn a lot. And they'll pursue trading because this is a market that they'll continue to thrive in because there's the opportunity. But then, even if they gain experience, soon they'll also realize that there are only a few percentages of winners in this market if it's about day trading.",

But you should also know that when a trader makes a good profit in his trading activity, it is also because of our emotions. In short, with every good or bad experience, we experience in trading here in crypto, our emotions cannot be excluded, or it cannot always be based on what we have experienced that is not a good result here.Because, if we are just calm and relaxed while trading even if the cryptocurrency market is not showing well, our mind will remain calm to think of a different strategy to solve the events, because they are still part of our emotions.",

Yes for sure, because if this is the root, the capital of every trader especially newbies will be affected, and it will lead to more losses.So for me, if you are trading, make sure to don't let your emotion control your trades. You should separate emotions from trading. Best example is chasing loses, it's very bad, especially if you want to chase that loss in just short period time or in just few trades.",

A lack of self-control and experience are without a doubt two of the most important causes why traders in general lose their money to other market participants.But they are not the only ones, taking risks that are too high, lack of money management skills or not having a complete trading strategy are also important reasons why this happens, and with this in mind you need to concentrate on improving on all of those aspects, because a single moment of weakness can be enough to produce massive losses and you need to reduce the chances of this happening to you as much as possible by trying to improve your overall skill as a trader and not just a small number of skills and leave a glaring weakness on your ability to trade the markets.",

The more experience you have, the better you control your emotions so to answer your question, it's yes.When I was a newbie in trading, there was also a time where I got FOMO'ed, and because of that I lost a half of my capital. I learned from that mistake of mine, but that wasn't enough learnings from me because I did it again the second time. I got FOMO'ed again and lost more than half of my initial capital. From that, I learned from it because I already experienced losing in trading. Though I can't say that I'm not experiencing any losses in trading, I can say that currently, I'm profiting more than losing in trading, and I'm not doing the same mistakes that I did again.Experience really is a huge thing when it comes to trading because from that, you will learn and you will adjust to it. If you made mistake, you will adjust base on what happened to you. You will not learn if you didn't experienced it. Maybe there are some traders who for some reasons, traded very well since they started, but most of the newbies really tend to lose their money as they start, and one reasons is their emotions.",
