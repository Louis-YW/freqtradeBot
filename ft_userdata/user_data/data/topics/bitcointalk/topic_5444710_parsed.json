  "content": "Greetings! I really ask you to help me with advice in my situation.For a long time I used one wallet and it accumulated more than 10k small transactions. And I know that this is most likely the limit of electrum servers.Electrum, as expected, went into endless synchronization. And I decided to export the private key to bitcoin core, having previously synchronized the entire blockchain.From electrum I received a private key of about this format -p2wsh:L1d*****Blockchain.comAt first I tried to import it into blockchain.com , but when importing , it is not possible to specify \"p2wsh\" before the private key , and without this prefix , an absolutely unfamiliar empty wallet of a different format is importedBitcoin CoreThen I tried to import into Bitcoin core, both in a wallet with and without descriptors. When importing with the prefix ( importprivkey p2wsh:l1d***** ) I get the error - Invalid private key encoding (code -5)2faThis wallet with 2fa from TrustCoin, I have both of these phrases. Code 2fa Google authenticator is also on my hands.How do I withdraw money from my wallet? Thank you in advance",

      "body": "Since this is a 2FA wallet, exporting a raw private key like you are doing is not going to help you, as 2FA wallets in Electrum are 2-of-3 multi-sig and so a single private key is insufficient to either recreate the wallet or to spend the coins.If you already have Bitcoin Core installed and synced, then I would suggest spinning up an Electrum Personal Server on top of Core, and then using that to sync your Electrum wallet. This will bypass the DDoS protections that public servers have in place which are preventing you from syncing your 10,000 or so transactions.Another option would be to skip the Electrum Personal Server and import your Electrum wallet in to Sparrow. Sparrow can connect directly to your own node without having to run an additional server on top. I'm assuming you would first need to recover your 2FA wallet from your seed phrase and disable the 2FA feature, and then import that disabled 2FA wallet in to Sparrow.",

You can test this for yourself by deriving the public key for that private key, and also by taking the Zpub from the keystore 1 under Wallet -> Information, and deriving the child public key at m/0'/x/x. They will match.He has extracted one of three private keys for a single address. This is insufficient to recover his wallet.",

      "body": "No.Since you are dead set on import this in to Core, I'll lay out instructions on how to do this below. I will repeat again, however, that running an EPS will be far easier. I've tested this and I can successfully recreate a disabled 2FA wallet in Core. However, I do not have a spare funded multi-sig wallet lying around, so I cannot guarantee that the spending function will work. If it doesn't, you could always export a PSBT back in to Electrum to sign it.This should all be done on an offline computer because you will be handling your raw private keys a lot. There is a large security risk in doing this, so again, you would be better off just running an EPS.The first thing you need to do is recover your 2FA wallet from your seed phrase and disable the 2FA function. Save this new wallet file somewhere you can find it, then go and open it with a text editor. Scroll to the bottom. You will need your two Zprvs and the final Zpub. I'll use ones I have generated for illustration, you should change these to your own.Under \"x1/\", copy the string alongside \"xprv\" which starts \"Zprv\".Under \"x2/\", copy the string alongside \"xprv\" which starts \"Zprv\".Under \"x3/\", copy the string alongside \"xpub\" which starts \"Zpub\".For me, I'll be using the following:Code:ZprvAmBjVZsczw9udGA2adgYqZA2i7VzBH3xEQTLBJ22Z4Uk7MHnJj39RCtPf5QiffHCKuv92be6P58Q7nNKpCEdQKM2KBc6DT4y8cTuDT3iqu4ZprvAmBjVZsczw9ufgr2H9GgyT5mDCk7N6DrDWJkodPRu7WsGLSK2L2ZNn85t4JZE3Y6KLyiszURQJUjmBtoASPWWU8yCpKkxL3wk1ESew4DSHdZpub6vZyhw1ShkEwQEAnMn82VyxEEBqWsWwhNJfbL2spe673exihurbSQZKECiqUu8TuKrFWY6B4W5x75KFikJKarnJfJs5gn1XdfX6o255N6R6Open your Electrum console, and use the following command three times, once for each of those three master keys:Code:convert_xkey(xkey=\"ZprvAmBjVZsczw9udGA2adgYqZA2i7VzBH3xEQTLBJ22Z4Uk7MHnJj39RCtPf5QiffHCKuv92be6P58Q7nNKpCEdQKM2KBc6DT4y8cTuDT3iqu4\",xtype=\"standard\")This will spit out a new key each time you use it. You will now have two xprvs and one xpub. Using the examples above, I now have the following:Code:xprv9vd7kzoM8cWaW6cQyFeKbJdDePAq5gPN5umDhExiRGtaNy6R31Kk5xiBoxY57QkTHAcYf4SraY2oE3XS5aFefMs9k36qeDxzhS4jrJAoizixprv9vd7kzoM8cWaYXJQfmETjCYx9UQxGVZG51ceKaL7mKvhXxEwkcKA3Xwt2wRufo1MGbg8WTHBbmP8sT3uRpQXmWf6dfpWP6wyJpqHHof6ZtTxpub661MyMwAqRbcH4dAkQ5oFjRRATWMmvH7DoyUqypWWJWsvaXLe8t35K92MbxqLswAH6wvAYyphYrWBaQq1gLc7ppnjiaSCnRfELhdewRwk6EHead over to Bitcoin Core, and create a new blank descriptor wallet.Open up the console for this wallet, and enter the following command, replacing my keys for your ones:Code:getdescriptorinfo \"wsh(sortedmulti(2,[00000000/0]xprv9vd7kzoM8cWaW6cQyFeKbJdDePAq5gPN5umDhExiRGtaNy6R31Kk5xiBoxY57QkTHAcYf4SraY2oE3XS5aFefMs9k36qeDxzhS4jrJAoizi/0/*,[00000000/0]xprv9vd7kzoM8cWaYXJQfmETjCYx9UQxGVZG51ceKaL7mKvhXxEwkcKA3Xwt2wRufo1MGbg8WTHBbmP8sT3uRpQXmWf6dfpWP6wyJpqHHof6ZtT/0/*,[00000000/0]xpub661MyMwAqRbcH4dAkQ5oFjRRATWMmvH7DoyUqypWWJWsvaXLe8t35K92MbxqLswAH6wvAYyphYrWBaQq1gLc7ppnjiaSCnRfELhdewRwk6E/0/*))\"Hopefully you will then see something that looks like this:Code: Â \"checksum\": \"6530kmqk\",Â Â \"isrange\": true,Â Â \"issolvable\": true,Â Â \"hasprivatekeys\": trueIf that's the case, then run the following command.

I don't know about the latest version of Electrum but I tested it a long time ago.That tool is designed for claiming Electrum forks from non-SegWit 2fa electrumand since those forks don't support SegWit, there's no reason for Trusted Coin to upgrade the tool to support 2fa-segwit Electrum seed.(or they do not have the time to update it)Also, it's basically the same as restoring your 2fa seed phrase to Electrum except the restored wallet file is in \"skeleton\" statewhich only consist of necessary data to be compatible with all Electrum versions and fork.",

So you could certainly use those three public keys to recreate a watch only wallet in some other software, but you could not then spend from that wallet without at least 2 of the private keys (in the case of a disabled 2FA 2-of-3 multi-sig).",
