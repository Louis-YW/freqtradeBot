  "content": "I had been using a Pyypl virtual debit card that served very well until it was enabled. But it seems Pyypl has been unable to resume their card service for a long time. That's the card I trust, because even though they had issues with cards, I could withdraw funds through banking channels. However, I am facing some issues, especially managing my subscription since Pyypl is not working right now and I don't know when it will work. So I am seeking another trusted virtual debit card that could be used through cryptocurrency. If anyone is using a trusted virtual card service, please share your experience.",

The main page is talking about non-custodial wallets and if you go to the card page you can't directly make an account and use the service you need to \"JOIN THE WAITLIST\" first and wait if you are approved or not.So how many days did you wait before you approved and received the physical card?Another thing that I notice is that they don't ask for fees?Code:Does Cypher charge any fees?No, we do not charge any joining or annual fees, and there are no transaction fees associated with Cypher Card.Another thing is it ask for KYC and it seems it only offers physical card and no virtual card. I think the OP is looking for a virtual card, not the physical one.",

Are you sure?Can you prove to us that you have ever used their virtual card and not just shilling about it here?The reason is, I see I have to join the waitlist by providing my email address. I am not even sure for how long   How were you able to use it minus joining the wait list?",

Regarding chain finance, it seems I have to order their hardware wallet in order to get a virtual card, as I learned from their medium post. It was made a year ago, but I don't know if they have already changed the system. I haven't found many reviews on Google about their service that would be noticeable. If anyone is using a reliable crypto virtual card service, please share it with us.",

      "body": "Hi guys, I have found the solution today, and it's been working fine, which is easier than the Pyppl service. Just today, I started using 'RedotPay' and have yet to experience more. We can make direct payments from Binance Pay; most likely, they get merchant accounts from Binance, but they are still charging 1% for deposits. I made two purchases today by using Redotpay, and both were Telegram subscriptions. Everything went smoothly and hassle-free. They need KYC, of course, but it's pretty easy, like Pyppl. Not much complicated at all. I will update my future experience. Still, I am not sure about their customer service, and there seem to be a few negative experiences over the internet. So use it at your own risk.",

Reach the founder on Telegram:@kuberanmhttps://cypherwallet.ioIn case, someone follows up this thread and tries to use the suggested card service. One thing I have to tell you is that if you ever need support at one point. It sucks! It's like a one-man operation. kuberanm seems to be the founder and is the same guy responding to support queries. When he is off for days, be sure to wait until he is backThey have no; 1. Production costs/ card creation fee2. No transaction fees3. No card maintenance feesBut I guess all the fees are hidden via exchange rates (exchanging crypto to USD when loading the card)When I tried to load 1300 USD, they needed me to deposits 1,326 USDT (That's about 2%)Also, they require KYC. Though, minimal, but it is still KYC.DYOR.",

      "body": "I assumed that back in late 2017 all these Visa cards were prohibited from providing any crypto services. I remember long time ago you could order a card, get it sent by mail, and you just loaded it up and could go to any Bank ATM or buy anything at a store and it would work. Then for some reason Visa disallowed their credit cards to be used by any crypto services, probably due to the fact that they were all no-KYC.So 7 years later and what has changed? have they reversed their decision and now you can use their cards again to make payments or withdraws or does it only work with certain exchanges like Coinbase where you are fully KYCs. I always wondered if these Visa prepaid credit cards would make a comeback.",

I could be spending $1,000 daily and that's moderate usage to me while another person, $50 daily is moderate usage to them.In case anyone cares to know, they are now switching from Mastercard to VISA. There are also quite a number of countries that can no longer use the service once they migrate to VISA. I also believe the fees will changeI know this because I received emails from them in the last few days about the changers.",
