Besides all that, I have seen many newbies even legendaries have made a good topic or reply but for some reason, they don't get that much appreciation. For such cases, there are many merits sources who have opened threads, to mention such topics or replies so that those merit sources would give them some appreciation. To be honest, I don't think newbies will value the importance of merits at the start but as time passes those who don't will understand it. Pro tip, don't post to get merits or trust. Post to get a reputation, be legit and dedicated to the forum, and of course try to contribute and grow faster. Join your local board, because I have seen many newbies don't even know that they have their own local board, Like I came to knew about my local board after a long period.",

      "body": "This sounds like something that would definitely inspire beginners, in my opinion. Actually, it's not easy at all, but the more you participate in the forum, comprehend its guidelines, and post worthwhile discussions, the more merit you'll get. In order to avoid discouraging newcomers, I would want to encourage people with high rank and merit sources to always offer merit for quality posts.This difficulty is one I initially encounter. I had trouble coming up with good topics to write, but the longer I stay on the site, the more I begin to get the idea of Bitcoin. So, right now, contributing to the forum is quite simple. I urge newcomers to thoroughly research a certain subject and to express their opinions on it. Do not post or comment outside of the themes.",

      "body": "Participation in a forum like this shouldn't solely revolve around the pursuit of merits and ranking up. If someone's primary motivation is to accumulate these then, they may be missing the essence of the community. Instead, it's more meaningful to be authentic and view this platform as a valuable opportunity for personal growth and learning. Engaging in discussions about cryptocurrency, money, blockchain, and related topics allows individuals to expand their knowledge and expertise over time.When you genuinely contribute to the community by sharing insights, asking thoughtful questions, and engaging in meaningful discussions, your efforts are likely to be recognized by fellow members. Merits and other forms of recognition will naturally follow as a byproduct of your authentic engagement. This approach benefits not only the individual but also contributes to the overall improvement of the Bitcoitalk community as well.",

When ever we motivate newbies, I think we should also encourage them to work and not be relaxed hoping that good information and knowledge comes easily, I hope they get motivated after reading this.",

      "body": "My encouragement to the newbies here is to read harder the tech behind bitcoin and basics of bitcoin. The forum recognise members with deep knowledge in bitcoin. The higher the knowledge of bitcoin a member harness the stronger the love. If a newbie reads and studies bitcoin to understand new features and developments being added to bitcoin, they'll love to discuss more about bitcoin and stay active in the forum. Newbies who create posts with few knowledge on bitcoin, their thread will only be attended to like any other random posts in the forum. But if they create posts out of strong and rich information about bitcoin such that other members can, through the thread, refresh their memories or learn new info about the growth of bitcoin. The newbie will feel a certain amount of fulfilment for learning bitcoin and the merit, which OP tagged as success can come subsequently to such newbie for learning bitcoin. The merit can facilitate the newbies to take action and read further to increase their knowledge of bitcoin.  A lot of newbies leave the forum because their posts don't seem important and no merits awarded to them, they'll quit the forum. That's why I encourage newbies to read extensively on bitcoin, they will see a better result in their personal response to bitcoin and also make new friends here in the forum.",

      "body": "Good advice OP, I guess your advice has touched the mind of newbies to prepare themselves well by reading and study anything that contain cryptocurrency so that they will be able to meet this opportunity in the community that will put smile in their mouth base on their quality Post. I know that newbies will not remain for newbies forever which you know, and they are trying their possible best to meet this opportunity but is not easy for them to meet the opportunity because they are still lacking one or two things, but they will continue doing what is good until they reach that success you are talking about.  I guess this advice is for me because since I decided to be more active in Bitcointalk forum by reducing some of the activities that is keeping me busy  day and night not to learn from Hiro members and legendary members has add more impact to me, and the way I use to respond to some Post in the Bitcointalk forum and local board have made me to believe that some day I will share my newbies story like the way full members and serior members are always sharing their journey history in the community.",

Don't run for merits, prefer gaining some domain knowledge and gaining a reputation in the community merits will naturally follow as your contributions gain recognition..For the rest Best of Luck.",

The best thing to do here is to start your journey on cryptocurrency, probably you could start investing already if you think you already know what you are doing you have done enough research already, and you want to start investing to make a profit. This forum could help you if you are just a beginner posting here could make you learn a lot and at the same time you could ask anything here if you having a problem or just want some advice about cryptocurrency or how you going to invest.The more you gain experience here in the cryptocurrency space the more you can create more quality posts here in the forum and that just means you're probably going to get more merits, I mean there are some benefits if you gain a good rank here in the forum at the same time you're also investing, I think that's a good opportunity already for every newbie to start there investment journey at the same time start here in the forum since its already a great community.",

But from my opinion,  the truth be told that no matter your aim and purpose on the forum, there is always a joy that comes with ranking up and these ranking only comes from receiving merits and merits o ly come from making good post and my opinion is that people shouldn't feel discouraged if they aren't getting merits especially  when they feel they've made good post because some times people read and appreciate  your post but might be short in merits to appreciate your post and might have you in mind till they have some smerit to appreciate your work which might take weeks or even days or months.",

You said newbies are not getting expected appreciation, which I can say you are wrong. We can still see newbies rank up on the forum here, so if they are not getting merit, how will you be able to rank up? But you don’t expect spammers to be merited.
