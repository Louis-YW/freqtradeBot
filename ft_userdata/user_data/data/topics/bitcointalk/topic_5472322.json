Its still interesting to read it today.Thank you to _act_ for the link, its a very interesting questionaire and is very relevant to somequestions which have popped up on the forum over the last while - for example:QuoteQ: Has your view of the whitepaper changed over time?Jameson: The only thing that I think has really changed is my view of how little of the system the whitepaper actually describes. It’s far from comprehensive. Bitcoin, as a protocol on a network and a whole ecosystem, has grown far beyond the scope of the experiment that it was in 2008....",

But seen the forum is very much quite about it. Satoshi Nakamoto create bitcoin for all because when he discovered that the authorities embezzling the fiat money that is meant for the people and making the poor to be perpetual in poverty. So Satoshi Nakamoto /bitcoin came has the freedom fighters to everyone in the world.",

If you haven't read it already, now might be a good time.What's there to talk about it even if we know about it though? Reminisce of the times when bitcoin was still affordable for everyone and anyone could've been rich if they just kept the bitcoins that they've earned in faucets? Those stuff are being talked about already in other topics so I don't see anything strange in the fact that it's not that big of a deal for some people. I do support that everyone should read the whitepaper though, and the anniversary of it's publishing should be a reminder to everyone to read the Bitcoin community's bible.",

Bitcoin protocol can be upgraded and Bitcoin has been developed a lot since 2009 but the White paper is where it was kicked off even before the Genesis block.The origin of something is always most interesting and it is the same for Bitcoin White Paper.By celebrating the Bitcoin White Paper, we can spend some time to readSatoshi's lesson.",

If thats prohibited here then this topic should have been deleted anyway. Yearly anniversary helps people to know about Bitcoin White Paper. By reading it, they will see difference between Bitcoin White paper and altcoin white papers. Altcoin projects attach many promising vision to their white papers which never turn to real achievements.In contrast with them, Bitcoin has gained big achievements since 2009 and even many developments have been done, something most fundamentals are in  the White Paper like the formula to calculate risk of 51% attack.https://blog.lopp.net/how-many-bitcoin-confirmations-is-enough",

Just like the baby, the idea of Bitcoin was already alive before the actual launching, but it wasn't until the day when Satoshi actually mined the genesis block that Bitcoin was actually born. In the same way that a child doesn't celebrate his birthday when the egg cell and the sperm cell met or when his heart started beating. His birthday is on the day he's actually born.",
