If possible, I'll be tossing my name out there as a possible back-up should the one reserved for the role is not available for some reason. I don't have a telegram channel experience, though I have a broad experience in content moderation in social media so that might help with something.Good luck to all these folks!",

I know the impact that it's bigger if the moderator is also a native for that particular channel. But I like to try on because I have experience in moderation tasks. Until when this application process will be open? I'll send an application to the email if it's possible to be part of the team to moderate the other region by another local.Quote from: joeperry on October 25, 2023, 01:43:10 PMYou'll need to work at least 7 days a week, 8 hours a day.

However, soon they will need to moderate the channels 24/7 so they will need more than one manager to accomplish this.Quote from: examplens on October 25, 2023, 11:54:36 PMPerhaps there is a logical explanation for the public disclosure of the salary, but the necessary knowledge and experience should be stated as a condition.
