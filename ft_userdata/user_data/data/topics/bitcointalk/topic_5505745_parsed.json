Besides, there are many movies about bitcoin, documentaries that are much more historical in nature.There is nothing wrong with the main character's statement, because indeed there are quite a few cryptos that end in fraud.

The biggest barrier we have ever encountered is the government, but we have also conquered them, they have recognized our existence and legitimacy. Therefore, movies or junk information spread on the internet no longer affects or damages the reputation of cryptocurrencies. Of course, there will still be people who hate cryptocurrency for some silly reason but that's not a concern because you can't please everyone. Even if you treat everyone well, there will always be people who are jealous or envious of you. So you don't need to worry and just ignore those things.",

We just have to accept the reality that it's not everyone that will accept Bitcoin or crypto and go on to speak good about it.Â  It's just unfortunate that we are literally living in a circle where bost persons in the Bitcoin space try to speak low of those investing in gold and other asset while those that aren't interested in Bitcoin do same by speaking I'll of Bitcoin.

This is for a very good reason, with a preconceived notion or certain perception of an issue, it makes it more relatable to the viewers when they view a film that is at most an hour or two long. It doesn't matter what they say, all that it matters is that the viewers are able to immediately get the point that they're making.You make it seem like they're intentionally attacking crypto, or that they have something against us. That isn't true and it is more about how the psychology of movie-watchers work and how filmmakers are looking to optimize that. It's naive to think of it in a one-dimension perspective without considering what's really important to them.",

But whatever they say about Bitcoin does not hinder the development of Bitcoin - we can even see how Bitcoin remains attractive in the eyes of many people and more than that, many countries have opened their doors wider for Bitcoin. From that alone we can conclude that the propaganda they make about Bitcoin will not change people's views easily and they are just wasting their energy.",

So that means what happens in movies not going to happen in real life. Movies are old and in their timeline, the crypto part might not have a good contribution and that's why they are thinking accordingly even in movies.I don't really know what the reason could be but we can't do anything about what they are showing in movies but if a traditional person is watching these movies and not into crypto yet will definitely move away from crypto and that's not a good thing. That's why I also believe that movies cast the wrong lessons.",

How google was limiting your ability to search for crypto related sites?Do you remember the smear campaign they launched to make people think bitcoin is bad for the environment? Nowadays they're trying to put people who say something they don't want to be said in jail. For instance in the UK they want to make social media companies to police content and arrest people responsible for something that they call misinformation. This means that if you don't believe in the government narrative and express that in social media, you may be arrested. In other words, if we have covid and they say vaccines are safe, but you tell people they are not, you're going to get silenced. Bitcoin is something they fear because if you hold BTC they cannot freeze your accounts and starve you, like they did to protesters in Canada. Protect your freedom!",
