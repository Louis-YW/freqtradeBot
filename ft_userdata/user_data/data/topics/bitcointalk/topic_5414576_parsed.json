  "content": "Hi guys!The situation is following:1) There is an old computer with Windows 7 on it and Bitcoin Core. I didn't use it for several years.And it's much too dangerous even to go online with it now. 2) There is  a new computer with Windows 10 (or Windows 11, I am going to buy one today).I want to use Electrum on it. Instead of Core.Just to make sure, do I understand things correct that I can just transfer ONE FILE from the old computer to the new one, using a flash memory (and that's why offline), and this very file is private key. And thus btc will be on the new wallet.Like this:1. Copy private key from the old computer, paste it to the flash memory.2. Put flash memory to the new computer.3. Copy private key from the flash memory and paste it into some folder belonging to the Electrum wallet.Is that correct?",

Since you're going to be using a new computer, don't you think it would be best to sweep the private key to a new wallet[1] (after exporting it from bitcoin core[2]) instead of importing the old private key? You won't need to connect your old device to the internet.[1] https://bitcoinelectrum.com/sweeping-your-private-keys-into-electrum/[2] https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/5933",

The wallet file stored on the other device can be deleted if you consider it unsafe. As an extra measure after importing, you can still move the funds to a new address.If you do not have the backups, following the suggestion above is a good way to do it as well.",

Instead of Core.The best procedure to go from one make of wallet software to another is to actually make a transaction (maybe in the week-ends, when 1 sat/vbyte is most probably processed fast enough) and send the coins from one wallet to another.You can migrate by importing private keys, but then you will have no new change addresses, for example, hence too much hassle with weak results.However, I recommend you make sure the Electrum is legit (downloaded from electrum.org and also verified).I recommend you keep the seed backup safely offline.I recommend you consider acquiring a hardware wallet if the money in the wallet is significant.",

So it won't be based on a seed, it won't make new addresses for you when you need them. And this is suboptimal at best.If there are many addresses in Core and you don't mind consolidating your inputs, import all those in a new Electrum wallet so you can transact, then make a new proper Electrum wallet (HD) and send there.If the addresses are few and you don't want to consolidate, then, as said, use sweep.Or, if you don't plan to make transactions in the near future, you just import all the private keys into an Electrum wallet and wait for your HW where you'll create a new seed anyway; and then just send to HW.As you can see, sooner or later you will have to go away for good from the old addresses. You can keep the wallet.dat file (it's advised to never remove old keys since you never know what you've missed), but you'll have to leave the past behind.",

No, it does not work just by copy pasting your Bitcoin Core wallet.dat.What you can do; if you want to prevent an on-chain transaction from happening (for whatever reason) is this.[1] Export private keys from Bitcoin Core. (dumpwallet)[2] Import private keys into Electrum. (New wallet, no seed, import keys)These actions do not mean just copying over a file; wallet.dat does contain a whole bunch of private keys, but it is not a key itself.Quote from: Gorilla22 on September 23, 2022, 08:43:27 AMIf this is impossible or dangerous, then I'll use more comlicated way.

Copying the private key from Bitcoin Core and pasting (importing) it into Electrum is possible and works. If we are talking about just one funded address, then you only need to copy-paste one private key.It becomes a hassle if you have used 10, 20, 100 addresses in the past. Imagine copying all of them the way you want to do it? In that case, it's better to use the dumpwallet command that n0nce suggested. That will create a file where you can see each key on a separate line. It makes managing them easier.",
