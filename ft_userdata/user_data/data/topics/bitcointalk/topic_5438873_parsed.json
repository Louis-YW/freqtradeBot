      "body": "The math on the Pfizer vaxxes and others is this...In the past, all vaccines took a long time to develop. In addition, for the last dozen decades, when vaccines came out, they were tested for at least months, and maybe for years before they were turned loose on the public. And there is no other vaccine that, when public results showed that a few people died, that it wasn't immediately pulled off the market.The Covid vaxxes came out after only a month of attempts to manufacture one, and they were not pulled from the market when people started dying and complaining of other problems.This is the only vaccine like this. So, being a mathematician, what are the odds? I mean, the odds that the Covid vaxxes are anything other than dangerous? You know. Odds! Not Pfizer information... which would be slanted at best... because they are looking for profits.I know a nurse who thought about this \"Operation Warp Speed.\" She realized that there wasn't any long-term testing. So she didn't get the Covid vaxx. She is the only nurse in her hospital who didn't get Covid.",

Not the fact that they get tons of mail and have to go trough all the spam?That's kind of entitled attitude that you would be so important to them that they would pick you from the hundred of other posts from their public email, when countless of people are suggesting similar things? Because don't you think they haven't been suggested this like a hundred times. Probably since 2017 ico phase when blockchain was solution to everything?Don't you think they have thought about this already. Because even if this space is new to you there have been TON of shillers trying to shill this tech to big pharma and institutions.Because at the latest after you most likely suggested your own blockchain for this, they just marked you as spam.",

So to avoid that they live in this destructive self-perpetuating panic loop that's leaking now in here. And while it's kind of sad how much OP really needs help, this is so fucking priceless! Lmao!
