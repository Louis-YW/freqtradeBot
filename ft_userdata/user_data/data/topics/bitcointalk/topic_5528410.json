How many exchanges existed in january of 2010?  Didnt mt gox lose customers money in the long run which wasnt 100% recovered?I would say there wasn't a lot of option to buy BTC at that year, and the only good option was to tarde with some users on this forum, but at that time the forum wasnt really popular at all, only few users know about It and the amount of mineras was really low even if the complexity of the mining network was really low, we are talking about Cpu mining and 50btc on each Block.",

Gox’s collapse in 2014 left a lot of people out of pocket, and many still haven’t seen compensation. It was a gamble back then, but it was your best bet if you wanted in on Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Repeating the discussion to more than a decade actually seems difficult to digest for me because even for people who are on this forum, maybe only a few of them have experienced it even though the sources we have when reading some journals or articles are certainly there but it will be a little different from the people who experience it so in the end I think speculation will not be too relevant to discuss because it is a past that not even everyone on the forum feels that way.Instead of focusing on the discussion of the past it would be better if we only discuss for now where now with the spread of bitcoin which is already quite well known to many people, there are currently many exchanges that can be used as options. Because for me it would be a little useless to explore the past because maybe even though there are some who can do bitcoin transactions, it is not certain that the exchange still exists today.",

So if on a platform there is a low number of bitcoins for sale, that means that platform has low popularity so there is not really that many more buyers to buy those coins than there are sellers wanting to sell those coins.",

      "body": "Back then, there were only a few exchanges available, like the ones you mentioned. That meant there were fewer options, and not many people were interested in buying Bitcoin. However, 2013 was the peak year for Mt. Gox, they were processing around 150,000 BTC per day until they collapsed in 2014.If you want more details, you should definitely check this out. Estimating the Market Impact of Mt. Gox RepaymentsQuoteExecutive SummaryMt. Gox is preparing to repay creditors (in kind) in July.Although the trustee holds roughly 142,000 bitcoin, the actual amount to be distributed is closer to 75,000 bitcoin.The distribution will occur at different days throughout the month, to a number of different exchanges.We believe that bitcoin’s extensive liquidity and the dynamics of the creditor distribution are likely to soften the impact of any potential sales.Bitcoin Cash is much more likely to suffer from creditor sales.",
