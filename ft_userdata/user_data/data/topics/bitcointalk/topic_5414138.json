That is what I have noticed on service board that people do not against. But just paying for people without anyone of them making use of the website (and many even do not know how to check if a website is fake or not), that is a means scam can be promoted, because even people that do not go through the site to be fake or legit would have positive review of the site which might be used to illicit scam. I do not like this idea, but because it is not related to this forum directly, I do not see giving negative feedback to be appropriate, but that is just my opinion.",

It could be that you need professional advice about this in order not to totally ruin your reputation in this forum. I will give you some hint even if you didn't pay for it, giving freely is the mutual advantage of this forum.You don't need to be specific that you need a positive review, it is unethical and a dishonest behaviour. Just state that you need a site review, and you are paying $5 for each review. Once there is payment involved, the reviewers will automatically be biased and review in your favour. That is how things work. They won't take your money and drop bad reviews. Keeping the review neutral will also attract more reviewers and sound minds. No one will leave you a bad or negative review, the worse scenario will be a criticism which will further enhance your growth. Tbh, the type of review your are requesting will not give your company room for growth, it will massage your ego or reputation and the words of insincerity will be so much misleading.",

There is no reason to provide an argument to this person as the person is a prior scammer who tried to buy fake reviews and once it is caught the person is trying to say me a future scammer. Also, there is another thing is that the person tried to say all the Pakistani people are scammers though s/he does not know that I am not Pakistani.",

It's understandable if it is an open review where you will give positive or negative reviews based on your experience on the site, but stating that they only pay for positive reviews only gives the impression that they are not really confident in the service of a project that they are offering and only meant to deceive people about their service.I don't trust projects paying people to give positive reviews even if they are not customers.",
