A merited reply is not always the most informative response on a topic, it is possible that the post that contains the most accurate information goes unmerited. You shouldn't also read only merited replies, would that mean that you do not read threads that no merits were sent throughout the discussion, or that you wouldn't have joined the forum nor read any threads here if Theymos never introduced the merit system.Quote from: Synchronice on June 29, 2022, 07:08:05 PMI guarantee you, take this into account and your problem will be fixed:1. Almost every person who wears Chipmixer signature is a quality poster.2. Persons who have high merits from global sections and not from Local ones, are usually good posters.Quality posters are not judged by the signature they wear.It does not matter the section you earn your merits, people mostly send merits to great posts, except the merit is bought, so if a member gets many merits from their local board it is because they are making great posts.",

I have observed, however, that there is no standard or clear guidelines that governs posts that generate merit. You will have to judge for yourself whether the post you are reading is worthwhile or not. For example, we have posts that have received a lot of merits but in reality, they are not so good and some that are truly crappy. It is important to be aware of that when reading posts. Don't take everything on face value. So, I don't judge posts based solely on merit, I consider the content quality as well as engagement.

For starters, this would mean favoring posts from an elite group of members (high-ranking members usually get more merits than newcomers). Secondly, such a system could be easily manipulated in threads that typically do not attract a lot of merits. Thirdly, such a system would require an \"us\" versus \"them\" mindset, which is contrary to what bitcointalk stands for.",

Not all merited posts are high quality. Sometimes people dump 20, 30, 50 merits on a single post even it does not deserve it. It is common with merit sources when they see that poster has good quality and contribution in general, but the source does not have time to check post history of the poster and an easy solution is pick one of them, and make a huge merit dump.In another case, it falls to merit abuse. So sorting merited posts in a single thread, and displaying it according to orders does not make sense. First, not make sense about quality of post. Second, not makes sense about flow of discussions. It's awkward when you read a discussion and can not follow its flow of idea, discussion from beginning to ending.QuoteI don't know if this was suggested before (sorry for repeating if it was) but wouldn't it be better if the replies with the most merites be shown at the top (instead of the most recent ones) and so on kinda like a reddit upvote system,or at least to add a sorting option to switch between these two display modes (by time of posting or merites recieved).You can suggested it for a new forum software, Epochtalk.New forum software.

The current version is more appropriated for the forum. Its not all about merit dude. Some unmerited topics are also good or sometimes not noticed but it doesnt mean its trash post.
