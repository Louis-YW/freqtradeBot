  "content": "I use more than one email address for different reasons and I got a scam message in all three email addresses, it's about metamask and I am familiar with this trick, I just feel like sharing here because we always have newbies joining the forum almost all the time. A scam metamask mail was sent out to my email addresses two days ago, at first I don't seem to care because it's not new but I got the same message of all three email addresses which prompt me to share on here. I am pretty sure that the metamask team has no mail ID and also the wallet never ask for email address when creating a new wallet account, so the question is how did they get your email address? This is a RED FLAG.The link directs me to a page link platform that asks you to insert your metamask recovery seed to proceed.They must have gathered hundreds or thousands of email addresses and used some kind of messaging tool to send out the scam mail alert in a single click. If you are new to crypto stay away from email messages, some are scams and they won't end up in SPAM Folder.",

Moreover there is a very simple method to avoid falling victim to this type of scam that anyone could apply (tech savy or not): Access the main site and check if that information is true!For the more paranoid, use a secondary laptop / account/ secondary wallet to verify this information before using it on the main account.",

This is the major reason I stopped participating in airdrops. Till date, I suspect that my personal data which I used for past airdrops and bounties before now would be chilling in someone's archive. I hope they don't get used for something sinister, anyway.QuoteIf you are new to crypto stay away from email messages, some are scams and they won't end up in SPAM Folder. I haven't ever updated anything going through email messages. In fact, I like to update my apps through the same source I get them. If I get an app from Playstore, I make it a matter of guideline to update that app through playstore. That's the way I play. With that I keep off random upload.",

      "body": "Scammers usually have two themes that all their attempts take; Greed or Panic.With greed, they lure victims with the possibility of crazy returns if they only risk a relatively small amount. And if they do get hooked, they keep tempting them with more while asking they pay some amount to get it, till it doesn't work anymore.Wit panic, which is what was used here, they scare you into making an urgent action or risk losing something. In such State of panic, you can easily enter limbic mode and not think logically, leading one to make a mistake.Always stay sharp and vigilant. Treat everything as a scam until proven otherwise.",

In that case, your email address has been compromised --you need to change your email address right now and unlink that valuable stuff in your email address. Thank you for sharing this and this will warn everyone, I thought this is only on the Electrum app but now it is also on metamask, scammers getting smarter these days.Â  Always check on the official website and download it if need to upgrade your wallet and don't forget to verify every app you downloaded.",

Have you tried to check if the email has an unsubscribe button? so that you can remove your email from their spam emails or block them. It's really dumb they ask for a seed phrase it is likely the same as asking for a Bitcoin wallet backup. A seed phrases should never be shared with anyone you should be the only one who knows your seed phrase typing it to any online device can possibly be hacked/leaked. So always keep them offline and don't fall to any trap like this.",

Still, you would find those that due to adrenaline rush, would jump at the information because, they've heard of the possibility of loosing there funds (besides, who won't want to secure there funds) but, in taking that step without first taking a moment to check into your reasoning asoning on what could be going on, your lose the very thing you hope to save.My advise and what works with me on this is, if its working fine @wallet, what's the use or need for an update. Its just unnecessary.

There is something called Email Harvesting where the scammers use bots to scout the web for email addresses, this hot use the @ symbol to identify any email format on the web and grab them one by one and add it to the list.

It's really recommendable to double-check everything before proceeding to click because one bad click will result in the loss of everything you have in that crypto wallet.
