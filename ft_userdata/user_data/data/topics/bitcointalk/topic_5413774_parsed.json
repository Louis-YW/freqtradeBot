  "content": "The Terra open-source blockchain project helps developers create decentralized applications and web3 products that can be used to power the next generation. Founders of Terra are Do Kwon and Daniel Shin. Due to the considerable drop in Terra’s price in the market, Terra was split into Terra 2.0, which is known as Terra (LUNA) today, and Terra Classic (LUNC), which was previously Terra. Terra blockchain is a community-owned, permissionless system. Terra Luna Classic (LUNC)’s circulating supply is 6,151.07B LUNC while its maximum supply is unknown as per CoinMarketCap. LUNC Inu (LUNC) can be traded on top cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Huobi Global, Gate.io, Kucoin, and others. Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) Price Prediction 2022 After touching support levels of $0.00028 and $0.00023, LUNC price swung from $0.00045 resistance2 to $0.00038 resistance1.  The market has reversed at the support level of $0.00028 and is now going sideways. Expected to be bullish in coming weeks. In the meantime, our long-term LUNC price prediction for 2022 is bullish since it cannot break the current support level anytime soon. We can expect LUNC to reach $0.001 in 2022.",

But with the current marketcap, I am really not confident with it reaching it for now. We are probably talking about a lot of time here before arriving on that level.I dont have any lunc now but still have some luna locked on binance airdrop before of terra but I dont expect anything from it since its distribution is on december and it will be for 2yrs monthly unvest.",

I am happy to hold for the next 6-12 months to see what happens but to answer the initial question yes I do think it can reach 0.001 this year.",

Here's some fact about recent pump and will the tax implementation will have effect in the lunc price. First of all, community passed a proposal to implement 2.5% tax on every on-chain transection until supply reached 10 billion. In reality, LUNC is having almost 7 trillion supply as of now and it would take more than 100 years even if LUNC's burned 100 million coin daily. However binance will only burn from deposit and withdrawal transection and it's having the highest trading volume. So no impact in the supply. So be aware of this and even if LUNC pumped to $0.001 than it would be done because of hype & fomo, IMHO.",

If people will celebrate for the arrest of DK, then this price can happen, there’s still a lot of time for this year and let’s see if Bitcoin can rise as well because altcoins market depends on that.

Many are very optimistic with LUNC because of their plan to burn the supply on a more aggressive way, though some negative news appear right before the update, I think this can't affect much the project. DK will face that consequences while LUNC will still focus on their plan and updates. Let's see if this target can achieve this year, almost 3 months left before the year end probably enough time to see some growth.",
