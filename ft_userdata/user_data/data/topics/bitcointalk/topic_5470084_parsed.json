  "content": "Have you ever found yourself a victim of stablecoin censorship? There are records of stablecoin issuers freezing or limiting access to stablecoin funds they deem suspicious. To my knowledge, both Bitfinex (issuer of Tether/USDT) and Circle (issuer of USD Coin/USDC) have been doing this for quite a while. If these entities do the exact same thing banks do, why are stablecoins rising in popularity? Investors could lose it all in an instant without even knowing it (unless they check the blockchain, of course).See for yourself proof of stablecoin censorship here: https://dune.com/phabc/usdt---banned-addressesAnd here: https://dune.com/phabc/usdc-banned-addressesThoughts?",

We know that address censoring usually happens because there is a report of hacks-related funds or other illegal activities.The deeper question is, does there are cases where stablecoins addresses are wrongly flagged? For example, the user did nothing wrong or illegal, but they got censored. If there are many cases as such, certainly, it won't achieve the current popularity. But if there isn't any or extremely rare, users would simply use it because there is a utility or use case. The possibility of censorship won't be a problem for them.",

Investors could lose it all in an instant without even knowing it (unless they check the blockchain, of course).Stable coins are centralized and the issuers basically control everything about it, they can print as much as they want (even if it is backed by nothing), or they can freeze it in their customers' wallets if they have a reason to. Stable coins are growing in popularity because some people are ignorant of the risks that are associated with it, whilst others use it because they have to (especially traders). The thing is, irrespective of your reason for using stable coins; you should not hodl it for the long term, use it for whatever purpose you want and sell it for Bitcoins immediately after.",

That's a point and difference between banks and crypto. I think CEX is not doing any bad here because If dark money used in their exchange then CEX will be responsible for it and also will be blame. This is part of regulatory system. Freezing individual accounts happened so many times but this is just temporary and will back to the normal when user pass investigation process.

Yes, DAI cannot be frozen by the wallet or inside your wallet because it is decentralized. There is a group of auditors and you can contribute to the decentralization of the network if you have a lot of money and buy MakerDAO. The only problem is that its price may not always be equal to one dollar, which is a problem with all stablecoins.",

Think about it, they are a centralized business so they cannot just close down any count without proper reason on why they did it. It will mean their business will get a bad reputation if proven that they are holding down or freezing accounts without any good reason at all. I don't disagree with stablecoins but I don't use the popular ones like USDT. If I have to pick a stablecoin I'd rather be in BUSD and I did a lot of transactions there when I was still playing DeFi games and NFT games so because I didn't have any problem using it I will just stick with them.

I believe this applies for decentralized algorithmic stablecoins. I'm yet to see whenever collaterized stablecoins that are decentralized (eg: DAI, USDJ) will be able to maintain their peg forever. Life is all about risks, anyways. Despite the on-going centralized stablecoin censorship, I don't think they will be going anywhere soon. Especially when most crypto exchanges and companies are behind them. They're better than traditional Fiat currencies because they can be frozen/manipulated at will. Not only that, but they're highly-programmable, allowing anyone to use stablecoins on \"De-Fi\" apps and more. I guess that's their main selling point over CBDCs (especially the programmability part). If stablecoin issuers only censor illegal activities on-chain, then should be nothing to worry about. But when things go too far, it's going to be a huge problem for everyone. Who knows if stablecoins will live alongside traditional cryptocurrencies for generations?",
