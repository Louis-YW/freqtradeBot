If you need those materials, then I will advise you to check out: 1.  [General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why? 2.  [General] How to earn Bitcoins  I believe this might be helpful to you as well if you can devote your time to reading them, as they cover important things that you really need to learn, such as what could be considered a wallet, security procedures, how to be safe, and how to set up a wallet. Many of the questions that you might think of asking might already have existing material about them where it's explained in detail. Good luck with your research work, and I hope this becomes helpful to you.",

But one thing a certain of is that the knowledge of Bitcoin is not on one particular website or video alone.  For a better understanding of Bitcoin it is the best if you diversify your learning resources and look our for more information's that will help you a lot. When i started learning about Bitcoin I watched a lot of videos and downloaded online courses personally.Also, the website doesn't seems to be that user friendly, I noticed that its not responsive for some other devices. It will best if the owner of the site make some changes o the color and the distracting night rocket gif there. I feel its unnecessary and some content should be made like a pdf so anyone can download it and read them without getting to open the site every time they want to learn.",

The time for the information might appear to be old, but there has been a recent update that has been added to it, and for the record, no information is a waste; the time frame in which it was published does not really matter. What matters is what you can learn from it, and as a researcher, when you come across something you are not too convinced about, what you have to do is DYOR. Just as there have been some changes in aspects of wallet recommendations when it comes to those who have updated their features and added things that might be considered dangerous to users, it's important to always run a little research yourself before adding to the information you have in your table.",

This is probably the best website/forum dedicated to the bitcoinin terms of content, including the \"old school\" website. The only thing is that it may not always be easy for beginners to navigate through the array of content and find exactly what they are looking for.

It's his personal choice we cannot say anything about his preference. Website is really beneficial but why do we need a website that only contains a few topics, while we have an encyclopedia made by Ratimov where there are hundreds of useful topics are listed about the whole crypto industry? And the amazing this is, all of those articles are also published on BTT just like the above-mentioned website.You should read these threads[SEPTEMBER UPD.] Beginners & Help EncyclopediaRatimov's Forum Guides, Tutorials & ListsAs a newbie, you will need nothing else, to get familiar with the basics of crypto, that is not present on the aforementioned threads.
