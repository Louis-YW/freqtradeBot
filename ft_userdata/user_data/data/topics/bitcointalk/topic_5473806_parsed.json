  "content": "Over the years since it's release, Bitcoin has been the first and most successful as well as promising crypto currency.starting from the year 2009 of it's creation by Satoshi NAKAMOTO it has been the king of the crypto verse.below are a couple of milestones achieved by the Bitcoin network as well as some facts.Note!! ; Additional information would be appreciated First Bitcoin transaction receivedThe first ever Bitcoin received was received by  Hal Finney whom was one of the earliest adopter and supporter of the Bitcoin network.He received about 10 Bitcoins from Satoshi NAKAMOTO on the 12th of January 2009.This transaction was included in block 170.with the hash ID; f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16 .It is also regarded as the first P2P transaction on the Bitcoin network.First block minedThe first ever mined block is known as the GENESIS BLOCK it was mined by Satoshi NAKAMOTO on the 3rd of January 2009 HERE are details about the hash .It is also referred to as the starting block.First hodlerUsing the definition of hodling which means to have Bitcoins in your wallet, the first ever Bitcoin hodler was Satoshi NAKAMOTO.However it was shortly after the lunch of Bitcoin the term HODLING came into play.The word Hodl was first used by GameKyuubi in  THIS POST which was actually a mis spelling of HOLD , however since then HODL has been used uniquely for Bitcoin to describe having Bitcoin in your wallet.First miner everSatoshi NAKAMOTO was the first miner on the Bitcoin network since he mined the first block ever( The Genesis block )his mining reward was 50 Bitcoins for the first block.Largest block ever minedThe largest Bitcoin block( block #774,628)ever mined had a size of about 3.96Mb which was very close to the Bitcoin block limit of 4Mb which is achieveable by using SEGWIT.The block contained the Ordinal \"Taproot wizard\".First Bitcoin purchaseThe first ever recorded purchase made with Bitcoin was done by   laszlo on the 22nd of may 2010.In this post   Pizza for bitcoins? laszlo requested to purchase some pizza in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins of which he did for 2 Pizzas making it one of the most expensive purchases in Bitcoin currently  although at that time 1 Bitcoin was only valued at about $0.003.Highest price attained by Bitcoin (ATH)As at November 8 2021, Bitcoin reached a peak value of about $67,567 making it's market cap hit a value of about $1.29 trillion . During this period there was about 18.9 million Bitcoins in circulation.since then Bitcoin has attained other large values like according to statista;Oct 2021 --->    $61,837Mar 2021 --->    $58,668Nov 2021   ---> $57,848Jul 2021 ---> $41,936How ever none has exceeded $67,567 so it is regarded as its ATH.First Bitcoin addressThe first ever Bitcoin address is known as the GENESIS ADDRESS. It is owned by the creator of Bitcoin Satoshi NAKAMOTO it contains about 50 Bitcoins which was mined from the very first block ever on the Bitcoin network known as genesis block.the legendary address is 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. However Satoshi is said to have about 1.1 million Bitcoins in over 22,000 addresses this he accomplished by using a new address for every block he mined to keep his anonymity.",

      "body": "I have general comment for you.It's better if you organize events from Genesis block to later blocks and events.Genesis block was mined with this hash https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26fQuoteCoinbase MessageThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banksBitcoin GenesisOn January 3rd 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamato (the project's mysterious creator) mined the “Genesis” block. The 50 bitcoin coinbase reward is unredeemable, as it was omitted from the transaction database. This means any attempt to spend it would be rejected by the network. Whether this was intentional or not still remains unknown.A total of 0.00 BTC ($0.00) were sent in the block with the average transaction being 0.0000 BTC ($0.00). Satoshi earned a total reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00. The reward consisted of a base reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00 with an additional 0.0000 BTC ($0.00) reward paid as fees of the 1 transactions which were included in the block.A first P2P transaction https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16Hal Finney is no longer here with us but if you want to know more about him, an important person in Bitcoin history, it is a topic about him.

Gox is not a first Bitcoin exchange.The first one is New Liberty Standard exchange. Archive of its website. Owner account in Bitcointalk.Bitcoin Market is not a first Bitcoin exchange and Mt. Gox is even after Bitcoin Market.Information is there too https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/QuoteOn 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at $0.000764/BTC by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.) The exchange rate history is available at two archived pages: first, second. Their last known exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC, using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com (PayPal USD trades). The owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on 2010-03-17, however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.",
