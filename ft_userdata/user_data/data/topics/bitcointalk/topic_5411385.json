Each time there is a drop, there has to be something going on. Either a huge rise that happened before the drop or an ongoing downtrend of a bear market.Take 2021 for example. In July and August price goes up 79% ($29k to $52k) and then in September there is a drop.Same with 2020.This is also why in both 2015 and 2016 price is actually going up because the drop already happened and that is the time for recovery.I'd say 2022 looks more like 2015/2016 considering that the market already crashed and it is time for recovery.QuoteAnd surprisingly, the poor record of Bitcoin for Sept tallies with the decline experienced in the stock market. For instance, the statistics shown for the US S&P 500 average downturn for Sept is 0.7% for the last 25 years.The only reason for any possible future drops could be the fact that people have been brainwashed in recent years to think that whenever US economy falls apart, they should panic sell their bitcoins instead of buying it as the only existing hedge against inflation.And US economy is falling apart these days...",

Without wasting time, four factors are to be watched for this September which is as follows;1. Inflation figures2. Market sentiment3  Ethereum Merge4. Other unexpected newsI mentioned Ethereum merge because its news helped cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to rise in July. Who knows what its realization in September could be?",

I don't think, there will be economy crisis anymore because many governments has created many platform to help their citizens not to experience what happened during the pandemic some years ago in the global economy. September will be more better than this month because the price will definitely move fast in September for people to have hope that the price will reach $65k or $70k before the end of the year.",

I dont really believe that much when it  comes to some patterns or histories which comparing up the present or future into it but its not really that bad to take up some consideration on looking to have at least theidea on how the price had been behaving in between years but doesnt mean that it would really be doing just as the same on the next year.For now we are almost ending this month of August which do ends up on being bear and high probability that this would continue on next month but nothing is assured.We arent able to make out some changes in movement if we dont see anysentiment that would affect the market or some catalyst but lets see on how it would really be started up.",

The market is programmed in a way that it will always goes up and down to balance price momentum.The fall of Bitcoin price had already started before the Russian Ukrainian war and I think the war might have made many investors especially the residents in the affected region to have sold part of their holdings to foot bills and other necessity. We can't proudly admit that the price of Bitcoin was after by the war. The war may contribution but should not be the sole reason.",
