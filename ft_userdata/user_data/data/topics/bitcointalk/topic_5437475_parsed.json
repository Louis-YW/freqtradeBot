  "content": "Do you ever think that CBDC and the word decentralize can ever go along well? It always sounds like everything CDBC is only centralised but with the way some new projects are working hard to accept CBDC and still maintain their decentralise part is getting more interesting, few projects with ISO20022 are joining FedNow ecosystem and some have been accepted onboard already. What do you think about this? Is there any possibility that CBDC won't mind working with few decentralised projects in crypto space?",
