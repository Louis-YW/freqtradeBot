Anyone who buys such a file will never be able to access the coins, because the private keys for them do not exist within that wallet file.If someone really did have a real wallet which they had forgotten the password to, then they could use something like this to allow people to trustlessly try to crack the password in return for some portion of the coins. There is no need for them to sell their wallet file.",

Even if the purpose is money laundering (which is an illegal activity), the methods used are a little sophisticated.Therefore, everyone who tries to say that you can buy wallets and then sell them to achieve a good return is trying to sell you something that is mostly fraud or illegal, and in the end you may not only lose your money, but also get yourself into legal problems that end up in prison.",

Let greed not lead us into a position of getting scammed , let's out smart these scammers.",

I can only agree with everyone in this thread. It's just not worth buying such wallets. Mostly they are fake wallets and there are no bitcoins on them. If you do get a wallet that actually has keys for bitcoins, they usually have a very strong password. Cracking these passwords is almost impossible and would require a lot of hardware power and regardless take many years. Therefore, no one reports in this thread who has successfully received bitcoins from purchased wallet.dat files.",

They add random data to make the discovery process difficult, and then you will not be able to know if the file is real or not except with the private key, but outwardly and it looks like it Sell a wallet file to someone with enough hardware to crack the encrypted password.you can read the details about it here Fake walle.dat can trick bitcoin core client?",

You might be able to find someone willing to sell you a wallet.dat file, but there's no way to know if it's legitimate or if the funds are still there.Once the funds are sent from a wallet, there's no way to retrieve them unless the receiving party decides to return them. So, buying a lost wallet.dat file is not a guarantee of recovering your funds.I think, better to focus on securing your own wallets and keeping your private keys safe.",

Whoever is selling these wallet files, are just scamming people.For common sense, think that why would anyone sell these wallet files if people could retrieve the money from them themselves? Why not they get that money in those wallets   The answer is simply that they can't extract the money but they want to make money from us by fooling us.Just stay away from these so called getting quick rich methods, you will only end up losing your funds.",
