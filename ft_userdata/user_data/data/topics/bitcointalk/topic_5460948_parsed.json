  "content": "We love our gambling for several reasons. Some of us do it for fun and entertainment, some do it for the money, and some do it for both the money and entertainment. Outside of sports betting and online casino games, did you know that there are other things you can bet on?Let me interrupt your reading at this point to tell you that I will be providing a list of some other things to bet on, which I have found on the internet. I will add the sources. Please note that I am not in any way affiliated with them, neither am I promoting any website. I do not own any of them. Now we have gotten that out of the way. Let's get back to the article.Here are some other things you can bet on, aside from sports and casino games:1 - Alien life and UFOs : Some of the bets you can place on this could be: Which country will be attacked first or which celebrity will be abducted by an alien.2 - Famous Award shows like the Oscars:  You can bet on the different categories of awards like Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, etc.3 - Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake: There is a cheese-rolling competition that takes place at Spring Bank Holiday near England’s Gloucester. You bet on the person who would be able to catch the cheese that is rolled down a hill.4 - Presidential Elections:  There is already a thread here for betting on who is most likely to become America's next president. I guess other countries would have a version of this too.5 - Celebrity deaths: There are websites that offer celebrity death pools. So you have to place your bet on a celebrity you think may die, when they will die, and how. Do you think people may have placed a bet on Jamie Foxx?6 - World Wife-Carrying Championship: Yes, this is an annual championship that takes place in Sonkajärvi, Finland. You bet on the husband that can carry his wife across the length of two-to-three football fields as fast as possible.7 - The Royal Family: This is another legit bet you can place on the royal family, especially if you are inclined to keeping up with them and the latest. Basically, everything about them is up for gambling.8 - Competitive eating competition: For example, during the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, you can place your bet on who would eat the most number of hot dogs and also if someone would or not throw up.9 - Bog snorkeling: This is a competition that holds in the United Kingdom and requires individuals to snorkel through a large stretch of muddy peat bog in the shortest time possible. There are many possible outcomes that gamblers can bet on. They include - Who the winner or loser would be, and in addition, the time it would take to win.10 - Economic and Financial Events: There are online betting sites where one can make predictions on the economic futures and financial events in a country or business in a particular period. You could bet on the stock market and cryptocurrency market crashing, the percentage of unemployment rates, etc.11 - The Pope: You can make your bets on who the next Pope would be and the Papal Name. There are online betting websites where you can do this.12 - Social Media Events: You can make bets on social media events. From what I have seen, some bets may include: \"Will Facebook become a Government Utility?\" and \"TikTok Spy Indictment Props\" by the end of the year.13 - The End of the World: As crazy as it may sound, there is an online betting site for this. People predict when the world would end. Don't know if they will be around for the prize money if they eventually win.14 - Kim Jong-Un: Just like the Pope, the type of bets people place on him are: When he will stop being in a position of power, how he will stop being in power, etc.What others do you know of?I want to believe that the list is inexhaustive, but I will stop here for now. I have also provided the references below if you are interested to read them exhaustively.-https://www.mintdice.com/blog/strange-things-you-can-bet-on- https://www.thesportsgeek.com/blog/bizarre-things-to-gamble-on/- https://betzillion.com/blog/weird-things-to-bet-on/",

It doesn't sound rational to me though others might be of a different opinion but I just stated mine while some of them are just place there and it's almost certain that no one is going to win the prize take UFO as an example.If you continue in this rabbithole you'll discover so many strange things that bets are being made on, this ones are just like the tip of the iceberg.",

The one that I really know about are presidential election and awards. They are not something that happen everyday or frequently. As I see others that you have mentioned too, they are not what gambling site can provide everyday too.",

Futuur is the only place I know for betting on general stuff, as @OP wrote about. But I rarely check them nowadays, although I still have some in there.Now I never bet on general matters like that because I rarely read political, general, economic, or celebrity news. So even if I bet, there is a possibility that I will lose even though before that, I could have just searched for information about the contest.Well, people have their way of betting and sure, there are still lots of people who bet for common things and need that kind of knowledge. And some still play gambling in sports betting or casino games. So it's not a problem for gamblers.",

So you have to place your bet on a celebrity you think may die, when they will die, and how. Do you think people may have placed a bet on Jamie Foxx?I don't like this kind of bet because it is bad for one to wish somebody death and will not be good for you to look up for the death of other people because the death of someone will bring pain on his/her family members. What I mean is that if you are happy that you predicted right and won big,some other people are sober and mourning. If it is down here in my country the family of their deceased celeb can say that you were the one that killed the person with black power to make money.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 25, 2023, 01:14:48 AM8 - Competitive eating competition: For example, during the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, you can place your bet on who would eat the most number of hot dogs and also if someone would or not throw up.I have seen this a lot of times and I have placed a bet on it too, but I loss because I didn't have the idea of who will win but I just did it for fun.",

A big difference between this form of gambling and gambling on casino games and sports is that these form of gambling is less addictive than gambling on sports and casino games. If you are not already an addict from gambling on sports and casino games, and you decide to start gambling on these, there is a smaller chance of you becoming an addict.",

Who will be attacked first? I guess I will worry more about the attack than remembering the bet I made. Some of them are shocking, I didn't really know they exist in gambling. I mean, there are still a lot of sports that are not being added to gambling sites and yet here we are talking about future events and worst, it might not happen at all. The sport World Tag Championship for example. I have been watching that sport but due to lack of viewers, I think that's the reason why they are not added to betting sites just yet. It's actually an entertaining game.",

Lol It's crazy and annoying what people are turning into all in the name of fun, it's still very hard to make the right predictions on online casinos and some people are behaving inhumanely towards their fellow beings. Anyone doing this is looking for the wrath of GOD, you are passing your boundary as a human being, I won't dare bets on someone's life when I don't even know when my time will be up.",

Yeah, I know these kind of gamble exist, but I didn't know there are still a lot or enough people who loves betting in these weird kind of betting. Enough to at least keep in running up until now. Celebrity deaths are like a deadpool kind of thing. Remember that scene from the bar where they place bets on the people who most probably going to die next. The first one though, is which likely you're not gonna win with those things LOL.Well, the only weird thing we place our bet on so far is counting how many white SUV's, Sedan, or Trucks that passes by in a certain period of time. Who ever gets the closest from the actual number wins.",

I never won but it was one of the best betting memories I have. sadly this only happened 3 times during the school year(we have 4 periodical tests each school year), because the next school year almost half of my friends went to different schools because their families moved and the rest are in different classes but we still stayed friends(just a note that school system different from other countries).",

I have even read like a kids game that it's like a gamble on what's going to be the next commercial on TV. Those odd stuff truly are possible to bet with.There's also this movie of Eddie Murphy IIRC where he has made a bet with a gambling pro to choose any number that he wants and he'll just guess it on that football game.",

Some of these activities ought to be prohibited or stopped since they don't feel right.

This option shouldn't be available, in my opinion, as it seems as though they are hoping for an alien invasion. Although some people find this form of betting entertaining, I find it to be not entertaining. Even though I don't think aliens exist and have no idea whether they really do, I still can't accept this kind of wagering.

What if someone makes the prediction that a particular celebrity would be shot to death and then arranges for someone to do so in order to win the wager? would it count as well?I think some of these betting options ought to be eliminated since this is just so uncool.",
