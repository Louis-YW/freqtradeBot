  "content": "Prowriterteam here.Here's what happened. So, Alex Merg contacted me to work on a project via TG. All went well for a while since March until after submiting the 4th batch of 100 articles of which he paid 50% upfront. With a balance of $2500 remaining. I submitted the work on 14th of May of which he's been online to see. But since then, he didn't reply any of my messages and have even went ahead to block me on Telegram. Edit: Nektajoon is a different person from Alex Merg.Scammer profile: Joonscam: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3547748https://t.me/roii99sAmount Scammed:  $2500Payment Method:  BTC/USDTProof of work submitted: : To be added shortlyPM/Chat Logs:  To be added shortlyAdditional Notes:  Telegram: @roii99s",

But this time around, he just zoomed off after receiving the work.Posting the spreadsheet here is a bad idea, especially when anyone here can access it and use the articles. I hope you understand why I won't paste link to the spreadsheet here.",

I have been here since 2017, even though I don't post often. Those people with trust scores and merits do scam too. So, I'm not a newbie.I don't know why people here are overwork with trust score or merit account. I agree it's my fault for not making use of escrow.Anyway, I'll ask people that I've worked with to vouch for me.",

The previous scam accuser claim that Joon contacted him and said that his Bitcointalk account is hacked, I guess you can try to contact the accuser and see if he can provide a contact link with Joon. Alternatively, you can make a flag against him, although the chance for him to respond is probably low since he kinda abandoned his business here. Hard to tell which story is true at this point. Other than using escrow, you can probably change the way your deal works. For example, submitting 10 articles, getting paid $100, rinse and repeat instead of getting paid upfront, and then submitting all articles. Anyway, good luck with your future jobs.",
