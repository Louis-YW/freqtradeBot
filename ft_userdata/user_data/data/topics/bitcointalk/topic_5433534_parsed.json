      "body": "I tried to search but no one shared this schematic/components list for this unit.Why did you suspect the capacitor? Do you feel when touching the capacitor is too hot? It's a simple way to know if the caps are shorted.If you have a multimeter you can check the resistance of the power terminal if it shorted or not and if it's a ceramic capacitor you can remove it and try to run it without the capacitor.",

The PCB is marked R_BOX_V1.1 2014_04_27Just look here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=639030.0Scroll a bit down, there are nice pictures of the PCB.Click on the Picture, and you will have a zoom option.What makes you think that the C36 (where ever it is) is broken? A picture would be nice, to identfy the location.Found it, looks like a 100 nF Capacitor, but I can Measure it on one of my R-Box to be secure.",
