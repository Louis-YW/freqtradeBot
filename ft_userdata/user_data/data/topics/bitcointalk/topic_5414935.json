Bitcoin was created in 2008 and launched in 2009.And after the launched bitcoin has passed different stages and has faced difficulties and neglected but it does not gave up upon all the challenges faced by it. Yes many people have contributed to the development of bitcoin plus you. All those people that are in this forum and outside that are using bitcoin to do transaction from one way to the other are all in the developmental process of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a freedom to financial economy? I really do not get this part of the article. How bitcoin becomes the financial freedom in one's life. As for me I took bitcoin as a normal Currency but it is free from central authorities control. One can use bitcoin to make a transaction online freely without the fee of third party cutting rate and unnecessary debit from bankers. Remember bitcoin is not 24 hours high for one to be saying financial freedom. There was something bear market  and bull marketas well. Just as national Currency but the different is the decentralization and Centralization.",

I am not sure how true is the flow chart and it’s connection amongst each other but it could be merely separate inventions whose reference has been taken by next generation or team of researchers to create something new. However there are few years which seems to be referred by modern world Satoshi to invent the protocol that we enjoying today. Like research from 1976, 1980, 1988, and 1985. Everything related to crypto and it’s inner protocol. Anyways, gladly this is amazing historical chart which helped us to get bitcoin working.",

Satoshi has a more brilliant mind so he end up successfully invented bitcoin and gained huge significance from its community. And maybe Satoshi’s faceless identity even added more interest on part of the community as they keep on becoming thrilled about it. But what is more significant about bitcoin that made it more successful is that because of its decentralized nature that made its unique from other cryptocurrencies invented.",

Well, that only proven how strong bitcoin is and how it's resistant for so many years. The opposite of what they're calling out seems to be the outcome of where bitcoin is right now and to those butt hurts, it's hard to accept that this piece of great technology and invention by satoshi has already been a threat to the current and long banking and financial system.It's even becoming bigger and soon, it'll be par with those big tech companies from its market cap.",

The reality is that many tried creating similar systems and failed. Bitcoin is successful because it is useful and it uses existing technologies in the right way.Altcoins are failures because they are useless and have nothing new to offer.Yes, because the primary tech behind Bitcoin is cryptography which was in developmentfor many years. The Cypherpunks lead the way or created the foundations with their various projects like:Quote from: aoluain on January 13, 2020, 09:26:11 PM1997 – HASHCASH is created by Adam Back and is formally referred to as “\"Hashcash - A Denial of Service Counter-Measure\"1998 – BITGOLD is created by Nick Szabo. This was a decentralised digital currency which was never launched. 1998 – B MONEY essay is created by Wei Dai and referenced a type of “proof of work” system to create an anonymous and distributed digital currency.The next notable leap towards Bitcoins launch came in 2004 when Hal Finney created the first Reusable Proof of Work [RPOW], an early version of what Bitcoin is based on, Proof of Work [POW].And all those people had a direct role to play in Bitcoins development",

Decentralized network, anonymous (but not scam and genius) founder are one of strongest support for Bitcoin growth after many years. Altcoins can not have that especially decentralized network.I see Ethereum has very long term vision and it has built up a very big ecosystem that is biggest amongst altcoins. Very little altcoin projects can have something similar to Ethereum about vision and success.QuoteBtc has passes through stages of development and improvement in years but alts wants to achieve this within a short period. Bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency but it is the first one that makes lot of noise and achieves great success. After more than 13 years, Bitcoin now is a biggest pillar of cryptocurrency market and blockchain industry. It plays a role like a gold standard, I suggest to call it as Bitcoin standard for other cryptocurrencies (alternate altcoins) to rely on.Even altcoins tend to rely on or don't tend to rely on Bitcoin, they are still affected a lot by Bitcoin.",
