  "content": "Premines exist when a cryptocurrency team at launch already has distributed coins to either themselves, a development team, or buyers of an ICO - before anyone could mine or mint it, regardless of the coin being PoS or PoW. 90% or more of all altcoins and tokens had a premine. Examples in the top 10 are Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Cardano, Tron and all centralized stablecoins.I consider it likely that most of the coins with large or 100% premine will fail eventually. In a few years they will be worth much less than at their heyday.The reason is a simple incentive mechanism. Premines benefit a single core team, even if they are distributed via ICO to other people. As a consequence, the future of the coin may be shaped, and there is a high probability for a single pump price curve: a phase the coin does relatively well, which may last some years (most of the time 2-5 years, in some cases up to a decade). But then, in a second phase, the coin will lose traction, and may lose 90% or more of its value (not considering bull/bear markets). Why?1) At first the premine gives the coin a competitive advantage: The development team is well funded and can make progress fast. The single pump can take place, with early adopters and the dev team making lots of money. There are coins to finance marketing activities, and also perhaps for airdrops and bounties. If a team manages the coin intelligently, this phase can run for several years.2) However, once the funds run dry, this competitive advantage is becoming smaller and smaller. The development team may make slower progress, some developers and marketing guys will have to be fired. Sometimes, the team simply exits and nobody hears anything again - which is similar to the unfamous \"rug pulls\". Sometimes, the team will be still around, or hire a low-cost freelancer marketing team to give the impression the coin is still running well.3) Often, if phase 2 has already begun and the coin's value is getting lower and lower, a \"community takeover\" may happen: a lot of work will be delegated to the current HODLers of the coin. However, it is unlikely that this will return the coin to previous heights (see below). Most likely the agony will simply be extended a bit.4) If the community takeover loses force, the coin may either die completely (e.g. due to an attack, being delisted everywhere, etc.) or stay alive with a low value and market cap during some years more. It may get occasional pumps but never reach again the values of phases 1 and 2.Can a coin escape this single-pump price curve?Ethereum seems to be the proof that also premined coins can do well over a long time, even competing with Bitcoin. Also, XRP may be cited as an example - it's one of the oldest altcoins and still thriving. And then there may be also BNB.  It seems that phase 2 in these coins never begun (XRP/BNB), or that phase 3 was very successful (ETH). However, I consider these three exceptions of the rule.- Ethereum has developed into an ecosystem of its own. A lot of token projects are earning money based on it, and the user base is regularly renewed. Network effect was almost as strong as with Bitcoin due to the first mover advantage in the smart contract/Solidity field. It's unlikely other similar coins can sustain so much activity for such a long time.- XRP and BNB have business models where aside from crypto activity there are other sources of income (XRP = cooperation with banks/fintechs, BNB = an exchange business).In most cases, however, hopes that phase 3 (the \"community takeover\") will solve the problem and make the coin thrive in the long term, will be in vain. First, there isn't much space in human's brains for lots of coins. Only very few platforms can thus sustain a prolonged network effect because they are known by those launching new ICOs/tokens/NFTs like Ethereum.Second, there's also a psychological problem. Why should I as a community member work on the coin hoping to revive it, if there was a team having made millions of dollars with their premine? Shouldn't they continue to do the work? They may still hold coins, so I will work for free for them ... This is also the difference to coins without premine. Coin without premine didn't have a single main beneficiary, so psychologically a \"revival\" and a successful community takeover is easier and thus more likely. Bitcoin is the blueprint: everything is community run since 2010/11.Discuss",

Many CEXes (if you want to list on CEXes) require certain amount of native tokens of the project. There are also lots of partnerships where it makes sense to use some of the supply to those. At the same time funding incentives developers, as developing doesn't need to be only a hobby to do when you have time from your actual work and life. Not every talented coder wants to take a risk of building cutting edge code for free at their spare time, only to have a chain that someone who has money to develope it forks it for themselves. Some coders definitely want to do it for free, but can we rely on those?  I am assuming that you mean that everything would be better if they were all POW without premine? Since POW is the only distribution model that i know that doesn't need to have a \"premine\" if we want to call even non-mineable tokens as premined. But it wouldn't make any sense to put every project on their own chain. That would just create ton of different chains what wouldn't be secure.Or maybe i am missing your point?",

The only way to survive its if the project was quite good enough to make the holders hold, and the people wants to still buying.And that open the gates for the security like you said..... it can be impossible to stop a community take over in some cases.",

I plan to write an article about them. The most well known is of course to mine at the start when the coin is not well known. As you'll probably expect I also disapprove blatant instamining - mining before any announcement/code publishing - but I consider it legit to launch an unambitious ANN, or even an ANN in a language not English to build up a regional community first while benefitting from that not the whole world will try to mine your coin (I'm not a friend of Anglocentrism).And I know some small cryptos without premine which are still able to pay developers simply through donations, and for several years (an example is PPC). There is also a much higher incentive to improve the coin for free if if isn't premined.Quote from: o48o on June 28, 2023, 10:57:05 PMOk, good point. But i still see many advantages for premine.

Pulling that off now would be a miracle.Well there were some examples for cryptos with \"cutting edge new tech\" launched without premine, for example Grin, which is one of the most advanced cryptos I know (no, I'm not talking about the PBFT derivatives which use tech from 1999, like ETH, Avalanche, Cardano, Tron etc.). Grin had the bad luck that it was 51% attacked, but is slowly recovering.And the things I marked in bold are not necessary for decentralized cryptocurrencies. And if a crypto isn't decentralized, why are you needing a cryptocurrency? You could also use a client-server structure like PayPal ...",

The \"developer tax\" (a mandatory fee which is either taken from transaction fees or from block rewards, and goes to the developers) you mention is implemented in various altcoins already, also in some which were initially not premined (for example PIVX).Such a developer tax, if it's mandatory, can however lead to problems which impact in the competitive situation:- If it's taken from transaction fees, then adoption can be harmed, because the coin would then be more expensive to transact than competitors.- If it's taken from block rewards, then it's simply additional inflation, which does not bring more security (like increased mining or staking rewards would do) but only dilutes the coin supply.There are however also models which don't have these problems. For example, in Signum (originally Burst), some big pools agreed to pay regularly a small fee to fund development activities and nodes which are always online. As this is completely voluntary, it's similar to a donation and thus does not impact decentralization at all. If problems for the competitive situation arise, the \"tax\" can simply be reduced or eliminated completely.",

      "body": "Most developers of pre-mined coins usually just stop trying after their product has hit the markets. Unlike ETH and XRP whose developers and creators are active in the community, these devs of other pre-mined coins will simply move on to another project using another name hoping to make a quick buck again. That's the pattern that I recognized on most coins that are left in the dust after being hyped before they hit the exchanges. Sometimes, the community is to blame, too. They view this coin as something that is the next big thing while in reality, it isn't, and they're only shilling for their own gain and, just like the developers, when they already profited, they'll just move on to the next 'big thing'.",
