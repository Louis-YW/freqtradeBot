The cheapest and most direct methods would be using CoinJoin or a centralized mixer, other than that you are going to need to use your imagination, something like chain-hopping if you can exchange your BTC to x crypto on P2P market and then x crypto to BTC which is more or less like using centralized mixing while not actually using a mixer per see.You can go as far as renting hash power and pointing it to the PPS pool and receive a fresh payment from a mining pool in a few hours, by doing this, you make it a lot more difficult for chain-analysis methods to find where your coins went to as this will require inside information from both the person/website who gave you the hashrate and the pool which paid you out, which is going to be very difficult to do, but this comes at a higher cost.",

But I'd suggest you to try out coinomize (one of the oldest mixing services after chipmixer). Im not recommending it cuz Im promoting it in my sig. space, but I have also used the mixer and its very smooth.",

So the question is what you're trying to accomplish. If you're looking for a decentralized mixer, I haven't seen one yet.Did you post the same thing on Reddit?",

The whole business model is based in gaming trust and aggressive marketing on bitcointalk. Chipmixer had over 2.5 BTC per week budget at once which is unrealistic considering only making post on a forum. But it really worked because that proved them that they have unbelievable amount of reserve to afford the cost.",

It doesn't matter how many times you split them up and then recombine them or across how many transactions you do that - if there are no new coins coming in then a blockchain analysis company can endless track them.Any kind of mixing or coinjoining will combine your inputs with the inputs of third parties to obfuscate which outputs are yours. That's the whole point.",
