I know there are a couple of them.Alternatively, you can go with Coinbase: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/how-do-i-buy-digital-currency-with-a-credit-or-debit-card-in-europe-and-the-uk",

But let me ask what's the need of buying with card when you can use the P2P option which I think it will be way more better with just Bank transfer to an available vendor. No card authorization from your bank needed.",

It is only worth it if you are sure you are going to use it in the long term to buy and sell positions or to participate in the P2P market.

I don't know how other countries' owned are designed to be. but I can say from my country (Nigeria) that it's simple and easy to pass. Just choose either your BVN (bank verification number) or any of your valid ID cards, from National ID to a passport. I always suggest the BVN part, for it's the fastest for verification; after that step, it's just the fiscal verification that takes only a few seconds to verify that you are a human, and that's all.",

For example, binance does not have official collaboration with banks in my country, so we cannot do fiscal verification, we can only use ID's and P2P.When I signed up on binance it was rather fast, took one day, but friends of mine have had problems with the camera during facial verification and also it took them several days for them to received the approval of the staff. Perhaps, it was just Binance team being over-whelmed by requests during the bull run of a few years ago, however I still stand to share those experiences so people can keep them in mind.Even if the process is shift and simple, it is not worth it to provide one's personal info to a service one won't use enough to justify it.",

If not, then here is the guide, but if you have and it is not working again, kindly note that recently, some UK banks have put restrictions on users interacting with a crypto exchange, and that may be the cause of the issue.QuoteIn the past week, two of the country’s biggest banks—Nationwide and HSBC—cracked down by applying daily limits for buyers or restricting credit cards from making crypto purchases. you can read about it here https://decrypt.co/122666/uk-crypto-crackdown-which-british-banks-buy-bitcoin%3famp=1https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-crypto-binance-stop-pound-withdrawals-may-122320856.html&ved=2ahUKEwjfwM2smdz9AhWehv0HHVxTAtsQxfQBKAB6BAgKEAI&usg=AOvVaw1pETeJfffNEjKDG0_ZYF30https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/binance-gbp-funding-onoff-ramp-to-be-suspended-in-may/%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwjfwM2smdz9AhWehv0HHVxTAtsQyM8BKAB6BAgLEAI&usg=AOvVaw1k0qPIj7XEWEu_6giaKJ6hhttps://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/binance-is-halting-gbp-deposits-and-withdrawals-as-banks-turn-their-back-on-crypto-02654548&ved=2ahUKEwjfwM2smdz9AhWehv0HHVxTAtsQxfQBKAB6BAgMEAI&usg=AOvVaw0UkzsnmYTWM-fDNnUGwEC4",
