  "content": "I had tried compiling the bitcoin-daemon in 2009 back when it was new and could not do so on FreeBSD. Thank you beastie. I think there was no windows release back then. I was unable to mine any coins since quickly by 2010-mid or something only people with lots of computing power  were snatching / solving away all the blocks. I recall by 2011, LTC was the recommended altcoin to be mined since it was  \"GPU-resistant\". That too I could not using solo mining to switched to pool.. My question is during the earlier phase between 2009 to 2012, those who mined lots of BTCs, especially using their laptops in 2009 when the rewards were high and difficulty was less, what are they doing now? Since not many understood or had the vision or foresight (how could they?) that this would blow up massively, not many would have retained those mined coins - sure some bought pizzas and I have myself bought some electronics in the past, how many people do you think have those 1000s of bitcoins with them now?What are they doing? Did they sell? Is there  any place I can read about them? Any documentary? No, I do not need names, I am just curious as to how many people's lives were actually changed. How many were able to go back and successfully dig out their old CDs and hard disks to get their wallet.dat files back - get both BCH and BTC. Many of us can't stop and feel sorry how we missed the bus, a lot of us were alive and alert back then, read about bitcoin in 2009, knew it is money in some form and knew people were buying / selling goods in exchange for it yet we did nothing. By 2011 there were online wallets available, many were storing their coins online, 3rd party custody.I think it should be possible to look at the initial blockchain entries and check which addresses which were rewarded have moved coins. Those who did successfully mine 1000s of BTC easily, where are they now? What are they doing? HODLing / sold/ both ??",

No such stories.. not even anonymous ones. I feel nobody who mined during the initial years is not without some regret.I read your main post, and I liked your questions, but there are already many success stories has been shared on the Internet, and a few days ago I also made a post on my local section about successful Bitcoiners. You can read many success and failure stories, and can also know how they got into BTC, when, and what makes them believe that they should hold it, sell it, or dump it. Some mistakenly dumped them already, some kept track and made efforts to excavate those hard drives even from piles of dump.Let me share some website links here, that after reading you might get your answer, but if you want what's the main reason, behind a person selling in early time and holding till now, that's cannot be known. 12 Bitcoin Success Stories: Meet Bitcoin MillionairesQuora",

HODLing / sold/ both ??It will be difficult to get the answer to your questions because most Bitcoiners prefer to remain anonymous. Bitcoin is decentralized hence getting the information about these individuals will be hard. I am not one of them because I got to know a few years ago but even if I am one of them I will never reveal it. Privacy is important for security reasons because those who have such an amount of Bitcoin would be targets of criminals since they will be rich. However, I guess that many of them would have sold their coins when the price increased. Some of them might still be hodling and making a profit from their coins. Others might still be mining, while a great number of them might have lost interest in Bitcoin when they suffered from scams or hacks.",

Unless there were old miners among the forum administration (and old users) who could tell their story.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on March 31, 2024, 02:28:56 PMbut those who sold at top must be doing some pretty good fortune right now.To sell at a profit, first need to be able to save bitcoin until then. Many of the original miners sold off (or lost wallet access to) their mined bitcoins for cheap, which eventually (changing owners multiple times) ended up under the ownership of whales like Winklevoss bros., Tim Draper and other. And there were also users of the Mt.Gox exchanger, whose bitcoin were stuck there for many years. Considering that in those days there were few btc wallets and storage methods (buy / sale), I assume that quite a few miners lost their bitcoins in that exchanger (and subsequent ones).Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on March 31, 2024, 02:28:56 PMPossibly they are doing some trading with altcoins with the profits they make with mining bitcoin or establish a business in real world, or ecen purchase assets like real state or land. One thing Im sure that they are rich now and thankful on discovering bitcoin on their early days. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Probably, some of them are among these lucky ones, but in those days few believed in the future of bitcoin and therefore were negligent and careless about the issue of preserving it.",

HODLing / sold/ both ??Recalling those who 'made' it early is indeed nice but for sure we know the answer on where they could possibly now with that instance. Most of them for sure sold too early and some even lost their wallets or their private keys. One reason behind this is not believing to Bitcoin's potential. Are they wrong from doing so? Well, the present would say yes but if it is from the past point of view, we really cannot blame them; the market value of Bitcoin only moved drastically starting 2016 up until the present. We heard stories of people who lost a hard drive containing large amount of BTC,  a guy who traded it to a pizza, and the likes. Regret is a normal reaction on them simply because we now see what it is capable of, at this point. And for me, things are the same with present investors; afraid that something bad could happen to this industry or that its market price could fall in a sudden. Between earky and present investors, we do share the same ground. No one knows of the future and if you are one who hesitates to invest then just be sure to avoid regrets in the future because of the possibility that its price could still go up if it would be fed by demand as years go by.",

Or maybe someone would have held it until now, and lastly, many miners may have been victimized when the big exchanges stole people's bitcoin in the early days. like Mt-Gox etc.If the rest of are old members, he can tell you some stories.",
