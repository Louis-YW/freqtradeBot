  "content": "I noticed the following troll behavior in the gambling forum: 1. You post a good quality post in a good quality topic, which does not get deleted by a mod. 2. OP deletes the entire thread minutes/hours just before the signature week is over. 3. You end up missing multiple posts from your paid signature. Not only do you miss out on the weeks payment, this also makes you look bad in the eyes of the signature manager.Normally, this would not be a problem for people who make more than enough posts. But it seems some topic starters are trolling on purpose by doing this. Not the first time this has happened to me and it is starting to become infuriating. This is not fair, especially for people who are trying to earn some money with signatures. No reason, no warning. Topics deleted within minutes of end of the week. And I make sure to check my posts carefully 2-3 hours before the end of the week, so this is not a coincidence, it seems.Solution: I am thinking Bitcointalk should introduce a timed countdown for deletion and a notification system which notifies the posters before their posts are deleted? Just so we are warned that our post will be getting deleted in a certain amount of time? - excluding justified moderator deletions of crap topics/posts, because there is already a notification system for that.",

Quality>Quantity. As far as I am aware, we are trying to minimize the gambling section spam, so recommending more filler posts to compensate for possible deleted posts is a bad idea.Gambling Signature campaigners post 10-15 gambling posts/week usually. Deleted topics do become a problem if you have multiple posts in the same topic.I fail to see how my solution would be a problem. It gives people a fair, timely warning. I have nothing against people deleting accidental topics but deleting established topics with many posts just before the end of the week is not ok.",

And even in this case, the moderators will not delete the topic because other users have answered it.And also, the topic can be moved to a section where signatures will not be visible, and accordingly, managers will not pay for these posts.As a result of what has been said, do not post on self-moderated topics.",

Is it? or mods just moved it to trashcan?Sounds like this problem is related to signature campaigns particularly post counts. If this is really an issue, better to post on a thread/topic that has lower chance to be deleted then don't just make a post for bare minimum on the campaign's requirements. Besides there are lots of good forum proposals suggested before by other members yet theymos didn't mind it, how about just this one.",

You end up missing multiple posts from your paid signature. Not only do you miss out on the weeks payment, this also makes you look bad in the eyes of the signature manager.I haven't noticed it. You'd better be more selective with where you post. In my current signature campaign I have no posting requirements in the gambling section, but I do go there and write posts. In other previous campaigns I did have a minimum posting requirement, and it happened that the odd thread was moved to off-topic or something or it was deleted, but I think if you are selective with where you post and write like 2/3 posts over the weekly requirement you won't have a problem. I have never been left without payment because threads were deleted or moved.

The problem could be easily solved if I only post ONCE in every gambling discussion topic. But that seems so very boring. How are you supposed to have a decent gambling discussion if you need to be nervous that 2-3 (or more) of your posts can be deleted just because you posted them in the same topic? And I only post in quality topics, not randomly. Also, I am not a minimum poster. I make more than enough posts with extra on top. The problem is that I like to have discussions with multiple posts in the same topic. I cannot do this if I have to look over my shoulder every time because someone might delete the entire topic. I am more upset about the fact that I took my time to type up good quality responses which got deleted. This has less to do with the signature pay. Rather I do not enjoy wasting time by typing up good posts which get deleted for seemingly malicious reasons.It just does not seem right to me.",

Anyway, I don't think that is necessary to introduce solution that you suggested just so members who are barely filling their signature quotas have time to write few more (shit)posts in order to meet their signature quotas and get paid. Being careful where you write and always make few posts extra should do the trick. And if those who are not selective where they write occasionally don't get paid, so be it.",

No one finds it funny having their post deleted after so much thinking and careful word selection to ensure one drives in their point. I think if after the first post on a thread and subsequent replies get deleted, then be selective on where you post. To be safer add extra posts so you meet up your signature quota",

A self-moderated thread, your OP can delete as many posts as he likes, without any justification, whether the post is good or bad. Furthermore, the concept of good or bad quality is always very subjective and depends on each person's opinion, especially in the gambling section.I often hear people say: that didn't happen to me; or you have to be careful with your posts; maybe you have to review your posts.I think this is unfair, because the problem is not always on the side of the user who makes the posts.Now if you ask what is the solution? Well, honestly the only solution I can see is for users to avoid auto-moderated threads.",

This is not a solid reason, can't be.It's a pain when you participate in a campaign where you are required to do X times of posts in a single board which was the reason I left OWL.games signature campaign. I was getting tired to force myself to post in the gambling section though I usually post there but having such a fixed rule is somewhat hard to follow.I would recommend you 1. To stop posting on self-moderated threads though this won't be a solution.2. Join a campaign where no specific board post isn't required.3. Join a pay-per-post campaign.",

Maybe the reason why I didn't experience this is because I'm only posting in threads that have been there for quite some time and not to some thread that just been created a week ago or two. Another reason is that I'm posting more than 10 in gambling section so that I have an extra incase the worst thing happens like what happened to OP. I agree with what others said that avoid self-moderated thread or if you really want to post on those threads, just think that it will not count as your gambling post at all.With regards to the solution, I don't think it will be implemented or the mods will do something about it. It's the problem of the signature participant and not the mods. It's the participants that will adjust.",

Yes, if the thread is self-moderated, only then the OP can delete individual posts. Although Self moderated threads are made with the specific purpose to keep the thread within the context but some people may misuse it by deleting posts so they are denied of signature payments. I am sure no reputed member does this, only the news accounts like to do this as they themselves can't join the campaigns hence they take revenge by deleting posts for those who are in campaigns.There are other threads that may be deleted by the mods as the topic is too generic or repeated many times.So in order to minimize the effect, follow my 2-step advice.1- Do not post in self-mod threads especially those started by the newbies.2- Make 25% extra posts. For example, if the minimum Post count of your campaign is 20 posts, make sure to make 25 posts to keep yourself safe from these things.",

I don't think it's a coincidence as it's likely that the OP has premeditated his lecherous intent to harm signature campaign posters.
