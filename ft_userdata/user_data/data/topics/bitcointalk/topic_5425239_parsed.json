  "content": "When I was in high school, I used to play often with my friends, it's pretty fun. Let's see who can find our mystery number first The rules of the puzzle are as follows:I have set a 4 digit number and you will try to find this number.There are clues in the pictures below. Let's see who will find this mysterious number in line of these clues If there is a + expression in the place indicated in red, for example +1, one digit of the number in this picture is correct and in place; but - if there is a number in this number, it means that there is a mysterious number, but its place is wrong. If it is 0, it means that no digit in the number is included in this mysterious number.Let's say the number I chose is 1453 and you said 1435. Since 1 and 4 are in the correct place, +2 and 5 and 3 are in the wrong place, but -2 because they are in the number I chose, so in this case it would be indicated as +2,-2 in the hint.",
