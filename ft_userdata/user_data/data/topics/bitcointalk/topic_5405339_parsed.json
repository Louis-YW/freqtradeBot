  "content": "Was scrolling the socials tonight and saw this post from the official Bitmain account announcing the launch of the long-awaited E9 Ethash ASIC. Looks like the E9 is opening for order / pre-order tomorrow morning July 6th, 2022 @ 9 AM EST.Thoughts, opinions, predictions?https://imgur.com/a/5TP1J7LI'm curious what the launch price will be given Bitcoin is currently priced under $20,000 and average going rate for GPUs seems to be $6/MH/s. I could see Bitmain pricing around $10/MH so my guess is between $20-25k.",

And before you know it, it’s another door stop. Which leads me to think who is actually buying these right now. Doesn’t seem to make any sense whatever. BTC asic I would understand but never for an altcoin ASIC.",
