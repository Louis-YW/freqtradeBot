  "content": "I notice that there's no thread for sportsbet talking about NBA, so I decided to create one so we will be able to discuss and post our predictions here. I'm hoping to see more screenshots of our bets as that would say we are really putting money on our predictions. I sometimes post on the ANN thread but since posters there are more focus on soccer which I understand the most popular sport in the world, can't blame them. So those who loves betting on NBA and been using sportsbet.io as your bookie, you are free to join the discussions here. OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://sportsbet.io/sports",

Having separate thread for every casinos for sports betting is totally unnecessary.I strongly agree with you mate because we already have a main discussion thread but from reading OPs post, I guess or see that OP want a thread for discussion of possible gambling and bets on NBA, which is a very nice one and if it's well moderated, to avoid possible spamming of the thread then it's acceptable by me.But basically, I hardly hear people talk about NBA bettings which I guess is as a result of my locality and the fact that NBA isn't really widely appreciated over herein my local community",

Most of the board here is just a sports discussion and already missing the point of a gambling discussion.I think those thread that is just a sports discussion should be move on off topic and topic like this should be the one remained on gambling discussion board because most of the user talking is just pure sports event and not an analysis at all for betting.I believe @rhomel posted thread is really the duplicate of this topic aside from this topic is just added by the casino brand. I agree that this is a redundant topic.",
