      "body": "So I joined and am active in accumulating GHS for mining earnings but I'd like to ask how are you going to make money here I only saw one advertiser so far and do you expect your users to purchase limer miners to increase their earnings?My honest review on this is its a combination of faucet and Ponzi scheme, so far earning is good because there are only a few active users now compared to the other similar site Rollercoin where your earning is only a fraction because of too many active users and you need to deposit to increase your earning.",
