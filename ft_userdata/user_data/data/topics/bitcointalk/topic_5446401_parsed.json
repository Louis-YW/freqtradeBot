      "body": "An FPGA miner is a type of cryptocurrency mining hardware that uses FPGAs to perform the computational work required to mine cryptocurrencies.FPGAs are integrated circuits that can be programmed after manufacture to perform specific functions.Unlike ASICs, which are designed for a specific cryptocurrency algorithm, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to mine different cryptocurrencies or different algorithms. To program an FPGA crypto miner to mine a specific algorithm, you would need to write code in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.There are also open-source FPGA development platforms and communities that can provide resources and support for learning HDL programming.",

      "body": "Usually FGPA mining is profitable before ASICs and becomes unprofitable right after. Usually they are a scale up from GPU mining because depending on the hardware or how its coded, it can use much less power than a power hungry GPU. However once an ASIC hits the market then its game over for any GPUs or FGPA.FGPA is also very expensive and there is a supply issue, its difficult to buy in large quantities.",

The idea of an ASIC is that you hard code it physically to do the only one task which is mining, but FPGA is like a raw ASIC, where you could introduce whatever functions you want.I'm interested in using them for brute force and new revolutionary attack methods in order to improve the security of cryptocurrencies. Just in case you haven't noticed, nobody is going to share their findings about vulnerabilities because this is a decentralized jungle where knowing about weaknesses is considered as a score against the rest of the world.~dig.There are also asics that can mine several algorithms. These are Baikal asics, but not all mining modes are profitable. If you buy an FPGA, then you will depend on the development team and on the speed of releasing new updates to mine new coins. And it's not free, many manufacturers charge you to upgrade your FPGA software if you need maximum performance.",
