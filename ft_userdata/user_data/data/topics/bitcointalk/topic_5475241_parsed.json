If it is through social media, you know how centralized and how they know your IP address used for connection. Once you know the work of Tor and how to block your real identity from being known to people, then it is possible. To be more anonymity, you may need some other special tools, but I am not that sure.Quote from: Wiwo on November 23, 2023, 06:55:26 PMGovernments have the tools to track anyone if they want to,  with decentralized coins like Bitcoin of the bitcoin is stored in your private wallet,  with your secret wallet keys,  it may be hard for them to track it but that is not the same with some centralized coins like USDT which is centralized and can be frozen even in your wallet.

Some governments actually permit their citizens to use that freedom, and will not track anyone for any comment made about them on social media or any other place.If the government makes it their responsibility to track down anyone or person of interest, I don't think the person will find it easy to escape or avoid the government because the government has a vast network, and have their methods.",

All they have to do is to force those crypto exchanges to comply with the countries KYC/AML policies and also request the exchanges to hand over customer data of Indian Citizens to them and since you may have KYCed in some exchanges, they will have all your details and will know who you are or where you are. They will have all your financial records, including how you were evading the tax.For example. Recently, Kraken was requested by the US to hand over user that to them - raken Warns Users: Your Bitcoin Trading Data Is Headed to the IRS",

They usually have the right to ask for these exchanges for customer information when they're tracking someone and you can't really escape KYC from these exchanges if you really need to use them. You can probably circumvent that by using DEX's and P2P but you lose a lot of convenience plus at some point, you'd probably mess up and use something they can track. This all stems from the government wanting to track you though and if you don't give them a reason, I reckon you're fine.",

But when it comes to decentralization, they can't really do that because they don't have the power to do it. This is the truth that, until now, other countries like the US have not accepted.Why did you ask that question, dude? What are you thinking? Is it because we are here in the crypto space or what? Just remember that once you use a platform that is under centralization, it will be tracked by the government for sure. Do you get it?",

Governments may intercept and monitor Internet traffic on the websites you visit, the content you access, and the people you interact with. The government is a much stronger adversary and has the ability to monitor much of your online activity. Overall, the potential for government surveillance of your online activities is widespread and worrisome, especially in the areas of privacy and personal freedom. It's important to be aware of government surveillance practices and take steps to protect your online privacy and security.",

They can monitor online activity and collect data on individuals, they have the methods of surveillance programs, data collection from ISPs, and cooperation with technology companies. They can also review your online activity, issue a subpoena, and obtain a warrant.You need to be careful, and if you are concerned about being tracked, you can take steps to protect your privacy like using a VPN or encrypting g your data.",

Anyway, most governments are tracking people for various reasons. Most of them are not doing it just for having opinions, but if you are making threats or are in some way a danger to society or others. In some cases even if you are danger to yourself.Ways to track and reasons to track vary depending your region's laws and resources. But yes, technically they can. Although they most likely wouldn't use their resources for random guy in the internet having wrong opinions. At least not if you are not living in totalitarian dicatorship.",

Yes. The government is quite capable and of tracking its citizens. They’re probably good at it too as they’ve had decades of practice and have developed several means by which they could locate someone. If by questioning the laws, you mean having a peaceful protest, then you’re likely safe. If it’s something else and you’re actively breaking the law, then perhaps you should be worried. With all the seemingly irrelevant information dropped here and there online, it probably won’t be too difficult to locate a lot of people.",

This will also depend on the person that have made that statement too. Government give priority to people that when they talk, it affects them and how the masses will react to that claim that they’re questioning them about. Government has the right to track anyone they wish to once you’ve been found guilty of any offence or been suspected of something. I know there is no  always transparency in all of this, some might be just to satisfy natural grudge of themselves by misusing the power they have at that time.

It is a conclusion I reached after what happened with the Chipmixer downfall. The authorities from both Germany and the United States had kept in mind the existence of the forum account of the person behind the service. Also, keeping in mind this is the place where Bitcoin was born from and where many project get their initial advertisement, It is among the interest of those agencies to keep an eye on the users around here, specially those they suspect to be into shady stuff.
