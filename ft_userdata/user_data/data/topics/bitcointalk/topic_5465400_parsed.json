I haven't studied the project but cant understand why are you posting this here, are you from any team members or some kind of promoter? Advisor, please mention your role.Why posting like this? nobody is going to take it seriously as you haven't provided any social media link or the source link to the project, I haven't clarified about the project or goal as well. If you really want people to go through your post provide some useful information. In general, outcome think most of us don't belive in Pre-Sales.Â    LEts see what others say about it.",

And the presale started on August 25, 2023. And receiving the rewards will be done on September 9, 2023. it's still relatively new, so you can't rule out the majority thinking about it negatively.And this is the source: https://twitter.com/FirepotFinance/status/1692899434596626913https://medium.com/@firepotfinance/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hott-presale-65429f9b457dNext time, if you promote a token dude, adjust the amount of information you give, so it will be considered badly. In short, the information you are giving here is not detailed on the topic you raised, dude. This is just a piece of advice. For this type of new project, thorough research is needed before investing.",
