      "body": "Yes it's safe as long as they are good quality.IYKWYD you can safely use a  1 SATA adapter on some cards.IYKWYD = If You Know What You're Doing. It means you know how to determine how much power a particular cardcan draw from the slot and that it's within the SATA connector spec.Edit: Here's a pretty good descriptionhttps://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/why-should-you-not-power-usb-risers-with-sata-power-connectorsThe only points I would add is not all versions of the same GPU model use the same power distributionso don't go by the posted chart. Measure yourself.Also the number of wires on the cable is a useful clue. Some cheap PSUs use only 6 wires for PCIe cables and 4 forperipheral cables and should be avoided. PCIe cables should have 8 wires and peripheral cables should have 6.And always follow up with a touch test to make sure the connector doesn't get too hot.",

If 2 sat cables allow a load of 54 watts, then this method can be used if your 8 Pin (6 + 2) connector does not consume more than 108 watts. For a video card with a consumption of 120-160 watts, this can be used.https://www.gpuminingresources.com/p/psu-cables.html",

      "body": "Okay I want to mention why Sata is risky.many times card clocking fails and card goes to max tdp. more often it happens with windows then linux.but I have had many cards since 2012 amd and nvidia decide to pull max watts even when they are clocked at lower power draw.merging the 2 sata from the same cable and only 1 riser works most of the time.merging the 2 sata from two cables and only one riser works all the time.I have melted sata cables when i did 2 risers more than one time.I no longer overload sata cables for my risers.I rarely use risers but if I do I am very careful.If I want to power risers I try to use a cpu to pcie splitter.That handles two risers.And maybe two molex cables each doing a riser.  which gets me to four risers.some psu’s will allow all molex and I may use two molex from an indentical psu.so this gets me to six risers and its pretty safe.but mostly I like all riser free boards.I got a lot of 1600 watt evgas on sale so they have a lot of wires. I usually have enough to make connections.",
