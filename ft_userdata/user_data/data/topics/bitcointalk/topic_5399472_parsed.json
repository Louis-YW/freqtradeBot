I try to disconnect from wifi again to sign the transaction but it doesn't seem to work, so end up having to enter password for signing when online.I've found lots of answers about how to sign using a wallet on a permanently offline computer but I don't have spare computer for this and besides, if it can be done on a permanently offline computer, it should be possible to sign on a temporarily offline computer.  As said, it is possible; cold storage is never connected and still can sign.You seem to have misunderstood some things. Also as said, the fact you just temporarily start the internet connection doesn't help at all to your funds' security. I've even read (here, on bitcointalk) about somebody doing this same approach thinking he has cold storage; sadly, he got his funds stolen.So your wallet is hot wallet, no matter you open internet connection only now and then.If you want added security, consider one of the following:* learn to use cold storage properly; it's cheap and easy to set up with Tails OS and a lot of reboots.* buy hardware wallet* generate safely (but not this kind of bad half-safety, please) a new seed, write it down, write down one of the related addresses, keep the significant funds on this like a paper wallet; the (smaller) rest of the funds can remain on the hot wallet (i.e. at risk).",

Hence why I was disconnecting to do this. How is it that signing whilst offline is no less vulnerable than signing whilst online?First of all, the wallet handles this for you. Second, it depends on the wallet; I do use Electrum with Nano S and there's no private key not seed touching my computer.Third, your setup doesn't make sense because if you have malware it can record your Electrum password and send it together with the wallet file next time you go online, whenever that happens.

The signing doesn't happen in a process in your laptop's memory and most probably it just gets the unsigned transaction and sends it back signed.However, maybe it's better if you tell if you use the hardware wallet with Electrum (so we don't have to guess where the keys are to give you better advises) and maybe what make/model is that HW (at least to know it's indeed a hardware wallet).",

I would double check you have your seed phrase backed up before doing this though.If you use Electrum as its own wallet, then just enter the seed phrase from your wallet in to Electrum on another computer to restore your wallet there and then delete your wallet files from your first computer. You'll need to use some dedicated software to write over the sectors of your hard drive which contained your deleted wallets to be certain the data is gone, though.In both cases you could also just transfer the wallet file from one computer to the other.Quote from: bhodler on May 20, 2022, 05:15:33 PMMy understanding of the signing process is that the private key needs to be revealed momentarily in order to create a signature to append to the transaction, which is why air-gapping is recommended, and also why I thought that this was a serious vulnerability if signature generation is done whilst online.Whenever you unlock your wallet, whether or not you are signing anything, your private keys are exposed to the internet.

Seems crazy to me that so much effort is made to conceal private keys and yet they are revealed to the internet in this way with apparently no legitimate reason. I think o_e_l_e_o is trying to say that there is a small window of time between when you open the wallet (with the correct password) and when the password is discared from the memory of the Electrum program that a malicious copy of it can seize it.Also there is a similar window when you enter your password to sign a transaction.Basically, the wallet password can be used on a later date by malware to gain access to private keys (if it was a keylogger it would merely record the password inside itself), it waits for internet connectivity to come back, and then relays it back to their own servers.The only possible defence in such a case (entering the password while there is internet connection) is to block all possible domains (WWW domains) of malware in the /etc/hosts file (Windows has it inside the System32 folder I believe).",

The online computer then broadcasts it, while the private keys never leave the offline computer. The offline wallet will never be updated with accurate balances, but it doesn't need to be - you use an online watch only wallet without the private keys to monitor your addresses and create unsigned transactions, then use the offline wallet with the private keys to sign these transactions.In terms of updating the wallet software, that would only be done if you were to download the new version from your online computer and transfer it across to your offline computer for installation.Quote from: bhodler on May 23, 2022, 03:26:50 AMElectrum wallet is stored on the computer so why is it necessary for the private keys to be exposed to the internet at all, let alone when simply opening the wallet?You misunderstand. Electrum isn't deliberately exposing your keys to the internet, but rather, everything on a computer which has an active internet connection is exposed to the internet. If your computer is connect to the internet, then there is always the possibility, regardless of how good your security precautions are, that either an attacker can access your computer and its files, or you get infected with some malware which sends your data to an attacker. If you store your wallet on a device with an internet connection, then it is exposed to the internet, even if you never even open the wallet file.",

Sorry if I tell you things you already know.Of course, if you are indeed capable of keeping your computer clean, then all this doesn't matter. But most people tend to overestimate their capabilities on the matter.Thanks for your help, I appreciate it and I think it's better to risk saying things that someone already knows rather than assuming they know it already and skipping important steps. Judging by many of the answers I've received, I've probably given ppl the impression that my computer's infected but I'm pretty sure it's ok - -running Mac with anti-malware/antivirus etc... Anyway, I have clearer picture than before and will be more vigilant as a result",

Whether or not that will confirm at a reasonable speed will vary, though. Better to check the mempool from an online device and see what an appropriate fee would be at the time.[/quote]You export the signed transaction as either a file or a QR code, and transfer it to a computer with internet access such either via a USB drive or a webcam scanning the QR code. The online computer then broadcasts it, while the private keys never leave the offline computer. The offline wallet will never be updated with accurate balances, but it doesn't need to be - you use an online watch only wallet without the private keys to monitor your addresses and create unsigned transactions, then use the offline wallet with the private keys to sign these transactions.In terms of updating the wallet software, that would only be done if you were to download the new version from your online computer and transfer it across to your offline computer for installation.[/quote]You misunderstand. Electrum isn't deliberately exposing your keys to the internet, but rather, everything on a computer which has an active internet connection is exposed to the internet. If your computer is connect to the internet, then there is always the possibility, regardless of how good your security precautions are, that either an attacker can access your computer and its files, or you get infected with some malware which sends your data to an attacker. If you store your wallet on a device with an internet connection, then it is exposed to the internet, even if you never even open the wallet file.[/quote]Thanks so much for your help - it's pretty clear now",

It's not you giving the wrong impression, we tend to assume most are running Windows systems. And especially there you can too easy have a can of worms without even suspecting it. That's why we recommend extreme caution, which usually means to treat the computer as infected even if it's probably not.I wrote it in the past, I'll add it again, just in case: if you plan to give your laptop to a 3rd party (for repairs or whatever) and you had hot wallet with private keys there, you should be very careful on cleaning/wiping the data (and free space too) to not risk giving out your wallet or seed.",
