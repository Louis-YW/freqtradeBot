  "content": "Is there an API that does both acquiring of funds and exchanging for Bitcoin? E.g. a user provides their debit card, the funds are taken from it and converted to BTC and deposited to some address.I know Coinbase does this within its app. But is there an existing API that does this? None of the APIs I've seen do the acquiring of funds, the user requires an existing wallet on the platform and it needs to be topped up with fiat.",

You don't get the above benefits with Binance, Coinbase or any other centralized exchange. I feel like many newcomers don't understand the importance of privacy and all the issues with KYC; they're in the 'I have nothing to hide' mindset that everybody gets conditioned into from childhood. It takes some time to wrap your head around it and understand how monumentally critical it is to take care about your privacy online.However, point 3 should be easy for anyone to understand; your funds can get stolen when you use a centralized exchange.Here's a list of crypto exchange hacks and it's not even exhaustive. https://cryptosec.info/exchange-hacks/Additionally, most 'legit' / not-yet-hacked exchanges have frozen some users' balances, closed their accounts, restricted access or blocked trading of some currency pairs, leaving users waiting for months to be able to get to their money.Most new users don't realize the huge discrepancy between 'deposit experience' and 'withdrawal experience' on these platforms. Deposits are always easy and fast, often without KYC, no questions asked. After more and more deposits, maybe some trades and gains, when they want to withdraw (This is the WRONG way to use an exchange by the way; just want to make it clear - but most people do it like this), suddenly they ask for some paperwork that you might not be able to provide or have other reasons why withdrawals are blocked, and even if it works, they'll slap you with a big withdrawal fee.I'm even aware of exchanges (still in operation) that a few months back, when Dogecoin pumped, mysteriously blocked all withdrawals of this coin due to a claimed hack. It is pretty certain that they actually sold their customers' coins to make a nice profit and bought them back a few months later, when the 'hack was resolved' and returned them to the customers.This kind of stuff can only happen with centralized exchanges and I believe is the most interesting point against them for newcomers that don't understand the privacy implications.If zander1983 got intrigued about all my privacy talk here, he should have a look at this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5394338",

How could I achieve this? The thing is, it's dangerous to give automated \"helpers\" like bots and APIs the permissions to access and work with your money. Can you trust it to not have any bugs or intentional vulnerabilities that would allow its creators to edit the receiving addresses and amounts being bought/sent? Probably not.

My assumption is that the coins will be deposited in an address that's part of your app. But maybe you can enter a custom address, which in your case would be one that's part of your Ledger. Someone who knows more about Cash.app could give you a better answer.Quote from: n0nce on May 13, 2022, 01:29:24 PMAdditionally, most 'legit' / not-yet-hacked exchanges have frozen some users' balances, closed their accounts, restricted access or blocked trading of some currency pairs, leaving users waiting for months to be able to get to their money. Don't forget the often-occurring wallet maintenance issues. You mentioned a good example with Dogecoin. Wallets can be in \"maintenance mode\" for weeks and months before you can access your coins again. Interestingly, it occurs when there are huge pumps or significant drops in value. Once the issue is fixed, it's too late to take advantage of the situation in case you wanted to buy something cheaper or sell it at a high.

Not necessarily the experienced ones, but certainly those concerned about their privacy. Often, it goes hand in hand, and those who have been around for a while are also concerned about remaining anonymous. That's something you can't do on CEXs where you are often asked to verify your identity and answer questions about your business activities or origins of your money.

There are guys who have been cypherpunks for like forever, way before Bitcoin, so they've not budged to the temptation of quickly acquiring some BTC on MtGox et al., and stuck to mining (especially early on) and P2P trading. Others got into cryptography and computers through Bitcoin, so their first purchases might have been through a CEX due to lack of knowledge when starting out. Some of them try to 'anonymize' after-the-fact (we talked about it here: How to leave KYC for good), others have accepted their decreased anonymity ('now it's too late anyway').
