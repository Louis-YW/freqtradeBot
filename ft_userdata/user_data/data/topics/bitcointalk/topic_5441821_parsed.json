If anything then 22300-22500 is perfect price to Open long position. I would say this it's time to stop guessing and gamble and come to me i'll teach you how it's working.I Also looking to connect and share ideas with people who see Same things that means you follow the Same indicators and you probably have instutional Investment education and Id like to talk with you so we both can share ideas and probably connect.",

Sure sometimes i follow simple charts like MAcd ..MA and so but Im focusing on checking the whales. But Im investing everyday 1% some days Even lower in top coins",

Some beginner still panic when getting predicting about Bitcoin will drop but have indicator made how lower price from Bitcoin before back to higher price later.",

I don't predict but atleast i dont talk or predict unrealistic nonsense.I dont ask you to follow Im saying just many people are duped to belive that we go a lot down.But i see the Nice short squeeze Im experinced enough to make this statement.I don't Blame anyone i was same like all of them newbies and so called experts.But one day i had enough and i decided to learn the rules of this game.And traders like plan b i follow indont follow for suggestions If they don't explain reasons for that why something will be happening.2021to btc 100k to hit was not realistic.There is rule of accumulating the coins techically it was impossible to reach.I dont suggest to anyone nothing i myself will be scalping longs becouse we have not much to go down we are quite low the whales Will do just shake off to get weak hands off and zig zag to get high leverage positions out.I dont predict inonly predict now becouse i want to help you guys If i see there is panic for no reason so just explain what is the situation here.U got to look behind the scenes otherwise you just gamble.So Im asking Are here people who knows Same things like me ?

Keeping the price in the same area for as long as possible will make it easier for bulls to pump it when needed.
