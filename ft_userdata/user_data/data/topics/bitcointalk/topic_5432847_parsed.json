      "body": "What is wrong with it? I don't think anything is wrong there even a low liquidity is not abnormal. The candle formation showed drop in demand though and it is not unusual for that to happen because price bounce up or down and that is what happened with the candlestick. Meanwhile, you only showed only candle and no pairs so that someone could check it out for you.",

I hope you can also differentiate between candlesticks and wicks? Because both are not the same. I found it hard to know what your complain is about, you see a chart, you screenshot it without indicating any information, it shows less information. As for the chart, it seems normal though. Even the coin you indicates its chart is no known, the time used is not known  and many other information not indicated.",

      "body": "You're seeing a doji that shows you reversal pattern and you're complaining that it's not a normal wick? What have you come to the wilderness to behold? That type of wick is something many a trader don't like missing for anything because it gives a clear indication of what next to follow. The best way to maximize its use (for me) is to trigger your trade when you notice that the upper or lower candle movements have been exhausted. Well, going forward, I guess you should visit babypips.com to read up on candle patterns.",

The candle that you show is normal, and if you have ever read science that discusses candlesticks, many will explain that.We always see the candles that you show in price movements, so there's nothing wrong about that. Usually traders who use the scalping method look for this moment for them to trade.",

From the chart the wick couldn't push price up because the trend wasn't going up, and before the wick formed there was a bearish engulfing candle which later turned into three black soldiers which meant anything that formed after ward will have to obey the bearish trend the reason price kept going down despite the long wick.",

      "body": "These wicks are generally not normal. They are happening now due to a small daily range and poor liquidity. These wicks usually happen during pivots and most commonly at daily highs and lows.Usually people put their stops at those areas and that’s when price ends up hitting a bunch of stops however since liquidity is lower it spikes up more than usual and then reverts back down.We had this in the past but it wasn’t this extreme as it is now.",

Because the only thing I can see is the candlestick between buyers and sellers and the big lines at the end of the candlestick that is long and short.What is your problem with that OP? So what crypto is that? Bitcoin? or what? because if I look at the chart, it's moving normally regardless of the coin you're referring to.",

Lolz. Charts could be funny and the perspective will change as we view them on different scale. The only person that could answer this correctly is the op and the way they are looking at the candlesticks. Try rendering different scales and also adding methods for TA so that you can understand why are that particular coin is behaving like that. Plus, no one even knows in what relation these candlesticks are and whats the asset behind it. (like one could tell about bitcoin, at X time, on Y day, with AB factor). You are asking everyone to find  needle in haystack.",
