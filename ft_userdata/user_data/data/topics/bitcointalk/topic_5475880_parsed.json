  "content": "Hi guys. I hope someone could help me with this.I have Ronin and Metamask wallet that is connected to my Trezor T. Recently, this kind of warning appear everytime I make transactions using the hardware wallet. I already reached out to metamask support to see if they have a solution but they just give me a ticket no. and said they will contact me soon. I already tried using different browser and update them to latest version but the warning is still there. I'm afraid I won't be able to access my stored assets once connect v8 is fully phased out. Is there any way I can do to manually update to connect v9?",
