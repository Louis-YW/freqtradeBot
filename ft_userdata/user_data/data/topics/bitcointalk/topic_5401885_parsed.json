What do you say. Use them to mine Ethereum Classic instead.It is the only thing you can do with those cards if you do not want to shut down your miners,while Ethereum difficulty is really high over 14 P it is a completely different story for the difficulty of Ethereum Classic,it is not that high,the only downside to mining Ethereum Classic is that the rewards in money will be somewhat lower.This is what I would do in such situation of course if you can afford to pay electricity without problems you can do this,if not then shutting down your miners and wait to see what happens is also a good idea.",

This is the time you reinvest your money to the latest GPUs to keep you ahead of the games. I think nvidia cards have a very decent hash in alternative PoW coins like Firo, Raven, Ergo. You should note that if you looking for alternative PoW coins to mine when PoW is no longer possible for ETH. Yes, it won't be right away but slowly diff bombs kick in, those PoW miners on ETH have to migrate to different PoW coins anyway.",
