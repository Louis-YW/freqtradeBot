It would fit better in Meta or Beginner's & help.There is no mobile version of the website as yet and that's the reason for the horizontal scrolling, one has been suggested multiple times and is available on the new forum software AFAIK, but at this time it's not available yet.It takes some getting used to if you start off using the forum on PC, but you should get a hang of it with time. I use the forum on mobile (doing so right now) and don't encounter any issues.",

To go for other browsers that are related with google, PHX browser and Via is good for it. If you want it to adapt to your phone format and make it more friendly with your phone, use UC browser, but that is annoying for me. These are browsers I can not advice people to use too, I prefer using bitcointalk on Duckduckgo, just like it is on computer, but you will have to magnify and scroll right and left but it is fun for me as I am used to it.",

I‚Äôm using my iPhone right now, it‚Äôs not as great compared to the experience when using a pc but it‚Äôs manageable. The first time can be frustrating because it‚Äôs hard to read every text because the fonts are small. I prefer to zoom than rotate my phone. I have gotten used to it.

I can type faster on a phone keyboard than on a PC keyboard, so I don't bother with a PC. If I ever have to do something that necessitates the use of a PC, I may switch, but for the time being, my mobile phone is the best option for me to use here in the forum because it does all of the basic things I need to do here without stress.Maybe this is your first time using mobile phone, but try and navigate through the forum for some days with it, you‚Äôll definitely enjoy using the mobile phone too in the forum.",

I seldom use tabs and phones when my PC gets low.. yunno the regular electrical issues we've got in my country? That's what we get every other time yunno; though we've got alot of areas with contact electricity.It's different cus you'll have to pinch to zoom out and in as the case might be( this happens when using phones). I also realized that I wasn't able to view some spreadsheets while using my mobile phone to access BTT, has anyone gotten some irregularities like that before?Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
