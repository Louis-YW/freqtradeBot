Or at least a low grade CPU?Yup, in 2009 you could have developed a mining software that could be run on about any recent device (albeit, at that time, smartphones were still really new, but you might have had a couple android phones that could have mined over wifi). Offcourse, you would also had to have developed all other infrastructure... Port bitcoin core for android, patch it so you could use a seperate mining software,... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/2009The difficulty rose from 1 to 1.18 in december 2009... At those difficulty levels, most recent cpu's would be able to solve a block from time to time. On a cellphone, you probably would not solve Â dozens of blocks per day, but i'm pretty sure you'd be able to solve a couple each day. Offcourse, cpu's in smartphones in 2009 might not have been powerfull enough to really solve a lot of blocks, but i'm pretty sure they'd hit a block from time to time.And yes, you could easily create a new altcoin that uses a new POW algorithm for which at this moment in time, no asic's exist. Hundreds of people have tried though, and most of those altcoins are long gone...",

What was needed to complete a transaction was very little but obviously with how popular bitcoin has gotten now, it has become more complex and difficult to mine and you need very sophisticated specific software and hardware to mine bitcoin.But don't forget that the difficulty level of mining bitcoin back then matched the capability of devices. Cellphones back then were not even as half as good as the ones we have now so I don't think it was possible.Quote Is it possible to fork the blockchain, and make a new version of bitcoin and the bitcoin software that can be mined on a cellphone again?

      "body": "That's an interesting question, albeit purely hypothetical, unless someone gas actually done that. I remember watching video of how mining can be done on paper (very slowly, but the point is that it's not impossible if), so I think that it was technically possible to develop a relevant app for that, even for a phone that wasn't a smartphone. But in terms of practicality, taking into account the difficulty rate of that time, I simply don't know.",

Therefore, both the type of phones which are not as sophisticated as they are now, and cellular network made it impossible to mine bitcoin then.But we also have to consider the fact that the Bitcoin network wasn't massive then compare to now. The difficulty level wasn't too complex, meaning linking up with the Bitcoin network then didn't require much power and and internet connection, which I think the modern day device can compete well.Quote from: mocacinno on June 13, 2024, 08:06:35 AMYup, in 2009 you could have developed a mining software that could be run on about any recent device (albeit, at that time, smartphones were still really new, but you might have had a couple android phones that could have mined over wifi).

The modern day device are quite advanced and have made so many upgrades. with the upgrade in internet connections, RAM, ROM, battery life, clock speed and others. So practically, it would have been possible for smart phones to compete. But there must be prons and cons attached.",

And next to this, even in 2009, a desktop (or server) cpu would have greatly outperformed a mobile cpu... So, even back then, it would have been better to mine with your pc's cpu than it would have been to mine with your brand new, first gen, very expensive smartphone.If you had to go back in time to 2009, it might have been a better idear to have bought a decent desktop pc with one (or more) good GPU's and \"invent\" GPU mining... The technology was there, you would have needed to patch bitcoin core to allow the rpc calls needed to mine outside of the bitcoin core process and you would have had to write software to mine with your GPU...If you would have tought of this in 2009, you could have been a billionaire right now sigh... hindsight...",
