  "content": "Evmos is a notable Layer 1 built on top of Cosmos ecosystem. It facillitates the Cosmos IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol by adopting Cosmos SDK within its infrastructure.Even so, the chain is an EVM compatible one that has a complete set of RPC from mainnet, testnet to local. This allows users to use popular Ethereum wallets such as Metamask, KEYRING PRO to manage all assets on Evmos chain.The chain aims to provide a scalable, high-throughput network (2s block time), to match Ethereum standards. Technically, it runs on PoS (Proof-of-Stake) Tendermint Core consensus engine which fully stimulates Ethereum environment for developers to build products, so called vanilla Ethereum.Besides, by staying on IBC, Evmos assets are interchangeable with assets on other chains built on Comos through a dedicated DEX as Osmosis, without a need of bridging assets from one chain to another.In terms of resources, the chain utilizes geth as a dedicated library to promote code reuse and improve maintainability. It also brings JSON-RPC layer to Web3 adoption that imitates Ethereum clients and tooling (Metamask, Remix, Truffle, etc).Learn more about Evmos Coin in our article",
