The best among them that I know is Bitmain Antminer. You can buy Bitmain Antminer directly on their official website: https://www.bitmain.com/",

You also need to know how much your electricity costs per month, if it's already high you should stay away from mining and start buying Bitcoin instead. The best place to buy Asic miners is their official platforms like Bitmain https://www.bitmain.com/This is more safer than any other places, like Alibaba and other third-party websites.",

Where are you located? For example, if you're in the USA, you might want to order from an American reseller, to avoid excessive import taxes and shipping costs.Generally speaking, ordering directly from the manufacturer is a good idea, but it doesn't guarantee easy delivery. Bitmain, for example, is notorious for sometimes making its customers wait months before shipping their orders. You can browse the forum, it's full of good addresses and topics on this subject. You can also order ASICs from reputable forum members, mikeywith has a long-standing excellent reputation, for example. Quote from: teoliya33 on July 20, 2023, 10:47:54 AMTo cover electricity and see some good earnings how many i need as a start?It depends on the price of your kw/h. And it also depends on the purchase price of your ASICs. With this data, you can calculate your ROI time and have a more or less accurate forecast (the difficulty changes every two weeks or so, so forecasts are never 100% guaranteed).",

Treat it as a prediction since the variables will likely change when you start your mining activity. It is really hard to answer since you don't provide anything concrete to calculate. You'll likely get better suggestions if you can provide more data imo.",

The profitability of mining can fluctuate significantly based on the factors mentioned above. It's crucial to do thorough research, consider all costs, and understand the risks before investing in mining hardware.To calculate the number of ASIC miners you need, you can use a mining profitability calculator. These calculators take into account the factors mentioned above and provide estimates of potential earnings and return on investment (ROI). Some popular mining profitability calculators include:CryptoCompare Mining Calculator: https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/WhatToMine: https://whattomine.com/For mining on ASICs, a beginner will first need to consult a good electrician in order to calculate the free power of electricity for mining and not burn down his house or other premises. Large power consumption already requires different control and knowledge than a few GPU farms on a balcony.",

How much are you paying per KW?I think it's better to start with one miner first, you will be able to learn how to configure the miner to a mining pool like Nicehash or others, for a newbie it will first look impossible, I will share you a YouTube video where you can watch and learn, and you can also watch many others on YouTube, just type what type of video you want and you will get tutorial videos.https://youtu.be/RNCXULhef74Since others have tell you about bitmain's official website I think that's the best place to buy your Asic miner, they have a warranty too.",

If he uses a USB miner, he will not notice an increase in electricity costs. With such an ASIC, the probability of catching a block is only possible in theory, but this is a solution for quiet residential mining. And for big chances, you need to watch asics for solo mining.",
