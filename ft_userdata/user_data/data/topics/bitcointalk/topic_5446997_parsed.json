      "body": "Lol, Everyone knows that most of Trustpilot review is fake because it can be manipulated on services like this. I believe it’s more appropriate to file scam accusation against them if they hire you to do a paid review and received less amount as promised. This kind of fake review is a shame. I know Duckdice is subjected to many criticism but I can’t imagine them hiring someone to do a paid review for 5$ each.  Can you share the screenshot of your contract before you agree on your paid review to establish case that they are hiring someone to do fake review.",

There is absolutely nothing shocking about this and honestly, I think most casinos offer money for reviews. Its just another way to advertise for the casino. Anyone with half a brain would do their own research and ask the gambling/crypto community on their thoughts rather than blindly trust \"review sites\".

It is obvious @OP is asked a task of posting a 5 star review << this means @OP is posting not only good review but excellent review since 5 star as far as I know is the maximum good review one can put on the platform.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on March 31, 2023, 08:43:28 PMBut this is the business model of review sites.

The thing is, the gambling platform itself asked for the 5 star review and not the review sites.  It is really unethical and some an act of fraud since the gambling platform is paying someone to lie for their own benefits or gain.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on March 31, 2023, 08:43:28 PMAnyone with half a brain would do their own research and ask the gambling/crypto community on their thoughts rather than blindly trust \"review sites\".

People can be able to manipulate a lot of things, having fake reviews on Trustpilot is possible, but I still consider Trustpilot and other review site to be the first part of my research because I have seen many legit and reputable sites having good ratings on the site while some bad ones having bad ratings. This makes me not to always consider all to be fake. To know if a gambling site is good, the best is to make further research like on an online community.",

      "body": "I am sure that the accusation of fraud will not be supported since the user deleted his reviews. He could bring charges or something like that if he fulfilled his obligations. Moreover, he did not provide a single fact that he deleted the reviews (in the sense that they existed for some time and were not removed as suspicious) ... I think with a 90% chance all reviews have been removed by TrustPilot.Here's an example... Neodice gave me access to his corporate account so I could set it up for them. But around the same time, I left two reviews from my account (one for Sportsbet, the second for BTCGOSU) and both of my reviews were deleted with a note in the spirit of \"We noticed suspicious activity.\" I am almost sure that TrustPilot has a recognition system based on such factors as IP, screen resolution, browser, and so on. And I believe that my two reviews were deleted precisely for the reason that I went to two accounts.➫ DuckyDice acted unethically? Maybe➫ Can the OP cheat? Maybe",
