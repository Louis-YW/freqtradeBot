I mean who hashes your 12 words? if it's done in the blockchain nodes wouldn't it means it's public for everyone to see? or if you do it yourself couldn't you just lie?In short: Where does the hashing of your password occur so it doesn't get stolen and can't get \"faked\"?",

I think I expressed myself wrongly (English is not my mother tongue), Let me take you through what I think the process is and correct me if I am wrong:12 words are your public key before being hashed into a string.the public key is a hashed version of the 12 words, and thus its strongly associated whit the 12 words, you can get to the public key whit the 12 words, but you can't get to the 12 words whit the public key.If I generate a new account on metamask:-My computer ask metamask for 12 words at random-My computer then proceeds to apply some math to the 12 words thus hashing those 12 words into a public key and a private key-Then My computer goes to the blockchain and identifies itself whit this public key, it doesn't identify itself whit the private key, because in the blockchain everything is public so it wouldn't make sense to show it in public.-Next time I log in, My computer makes the math to the 12 words I feed it, and comes whit the same public key to identify itself in the blockchainHere is when my problem comes, if the hash of my 12 words is occurring on my private computer, what guarantees have the blockchain that I indeed did the correct math and the public key hasn't been altered previously to being sent to them?, otherwise I could check the blockchain for any \"X\" public key, and sent it as it was mine, like saying that I make the hash of 12 words and the final result is this X public key. I am not sure if I am explaining myself correctly?, I am not saying that I \"decrypt\" the public key, I know this is not possible I am saying that I don't need to decrypt anything to start whit, I could just send it as it is.I assume the private key plays a role in all of this, but if it's private how come the blockchain can check its veracity and remain anonymous? Also I know that metamask has nothing to do whit bitcoin blockchain, it's just an example I believe they work very similarly on the crypto key aspect.",

They are the source of your private keys. Anyone with the 12-word phrase will have the keys that are generated by that phrase. That is why you must keep the phrase secret.The password (and not the 12-word phrase) that you enter into a wallet is used to encrypt and decrypt the data stored by the wallet, which includes your 12-word phrase.

The signature contains the public key that the address is generated from and is it created using the private key associated with that public key. It is not possible to fake a public key because it won't match the address. It is not possible to fake a private key because it won't match the public key. An address is a hash of a public key that is associated with a private key. A private key is generated using the seed phrase (the 12-word phrase). It is not possible to obtain a public key from an address. It is not possible to obtain a private key from a public key.Quote from: DavidAceti on August 26, 2022, 03:20:43 PMIf I generate a new account on metamask:-My computer ask metamask for 12 words at random-My computer then proceeds to apply some math to the 12 words thus hashing those 12 words into a public key and a private key-Then My computer goes to the blockchain and identifies itself whit this public key, it doesn't identify itself whit the private key, because in the blockchain everything is public so it wouldn't make sense to show it in public.-Next time I log in, My computer makes the math to the 12 words I feed it, and comes whit the same public key to identify itself in the blockchainA wallet only \"goes to the blockchain\" when publishing or searching for transactions. A block chain only contains transactions. There is no identification process. The 12-word phrase is your identity and you prove it by encrypting information with your private keys (creating a \"signature\"), and others verify it by decrypting the signature with your public keys.",
