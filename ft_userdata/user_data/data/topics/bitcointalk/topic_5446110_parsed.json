  "content": "In the journey of life, most times we are presured how fast the world is living us behind, so it makes us to think how to fast track our life, but the truth is that there is a difference between motion and movement..You can be in motion still not moving, we can say direction is better than speed.The truth is that everything takes time regardless of how fast you go, you can't rush life;there is a saying if you want to go fast go alone, but if you choose to go far go with a team, rushing is always in our DNA(blood),we rush to become an adult before learning to be a kid, we rush to build a billion dollar business before working on our start up, and we also rush to have sex before knowing what sex is all about, when you rush life you lose out some of the beautiful things life have to offer, so life is all about stages, for example you can't just wake up one morning and decide to be the president of the country no it doesn't work like that, you have to work towards it, even the book of life states \"there is time for everything.In conclusion;life is stages, we count one before counting two, likewise you can't force some one to love you, the truth is just do the right thing be hardworking and have that believe your wish will come through, rushing life might end you up in a critical condition.At the end when time comes no one can stop you, whatever has your name on it can pass to another person.",

I have been there and totally get what you mean. Life should not be rushed and this can help you ease a lot of situations when you get into trouble now in this stage of life. However, things will change and one day you'll agree with Mr.OgNasty as you feel less time left and more things undone. \"The days are long but the decades are short\". All of us will get the meaning of it sooner or later so don't rush and don't judge, we will all know one day.",

Because people are already looking up to you. And almost everybody has a target that before I get to the age I won't have done this and that.",
