  "content": "Itâ€™s not clear for me how a collaborative exit works, in particular how atomicity is achieved.I would assume the ASP will fund an on-chain transaction, paying to Alice, in return for a VTXO forfeit from Alice.Will the payment to Alice be an additional output on the next pool transaction or a new transaction?How atomicity is achieved if it is a new transaction? Does it also use a connector from the new pool transaction?",
