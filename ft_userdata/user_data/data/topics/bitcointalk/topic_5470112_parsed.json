Be warned, Â don't involved in mob beating, Â very dangerous because in the end may be the suspect is the victim because there is a high rate of conspiracy around the organ missing trends and modern actions have been seen to be a bad approach to them.

Every end of the year, most of us know, but we will just ignore and leave our children, siblings, and even our neighbours carelessly because we think nothing will happen. At the end of the day, we will be regranting our actions.In Nigeria now, we should be more vigilant and put more eyes on our young ones, children, and even the older ones because you donâ€™t know what their juju will request, and we should avoid making random friends. Your friend can use you to make money because of the situation in Nigeria, and we know this situation is not getting better but getting worse every day. We should pray for forgiveness from God and seek for protection.QuoteThe reason I decide to create this thread na base on the recent happening I de see online of recent. Just last night, a bolt driver was shot dead around my area with no clue on the course and then I came online this morning to see a video where a man's private part disappeared from him because someone touched him and supposedly took it in the process.Stealing manhood is now a major thing happening in many parts of Nigeria because it happened several times in my state, and I usually see other incidents that happen on social media. I also see one recent one where the criminal who stole the manhood confesses that if they touch a person, the manhood will disappear, but it is still there. That is why they are not running, because the more they bet before they return it, the more money they will have when they reach home. That is the reason they are not running early, unless they see that they will kill them. That is when they would run, so please, let's stay safe.",

But anybody wey fuck up na him cut his story short , we need to protect ourselves from dangers. This country is really turning to something else that we never even imagine to dey happen every time, just like that man's private part no dey save again, every small shake now you will everyone dey check his own if it still deyÂ   it look like funny but anybody that it happen to joy no get dey.

I see this thread as very important, and it will serve as a reminder to many people because I believe that all Nigerians are aware of this kind of bad act in Nigeria when the year is getting to an end. It is not that the bad act doesn't happen in other months, but at the end of the year, it always gets worse. The funny part is what is happening these days, and I believe many people have been hearing about the news that there are people out now stealing men's private organs. Some people are saying that when their body touches someone, the private organ will disappear, or even some are even greeting someone and answer, so we need to be careful about where we visit or who to answer if they greeted someone.",

I belong to a platform wereÂ  activities happening in the state is updated. If it were possible to upload audios here, I would have done that for us all to hear for ourselves the reality of things as they happen on daily basis. Both at broad daylight, things happens. Kidnappers, armed robbers, car snatchers, ritualists etc are out with their plans to get at unsuspecting individuals for their evil act.One needs to take their personal safety serious as you go about your daily activities. Be very sensitive and alert to take note of your surroundings and happenings going on. The security agencies can not guarantee you your safety but only you can do that for yourself as you owe yourself your personal safety. Take your safety measures very serious so as not to be taken unawares by any unfolding event.I had to come up with some personal safety tips and measures for one to take to be on the safe side this period and I will keep updating it so that everyone would see it and know what to do when it comes to safety.
