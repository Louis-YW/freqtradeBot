Since I am assuming that at least some amount of people hold their crypto on that platform I would suggest looking for alternatives as you really don't own your money there.",

I think the articles are blowing the statement out of proportion.  Yes, it is in the Coinbase SEC filings etc, but it is somewhat obvious that if you don't control the private keys, the bitcoin are not your's.  You are just a creditor.  That has been known all along and is nothing new.  It is just like if you have assets at a US Bank - although purportedly not at a Swiss bank.To me it sounds like FUD spread by people who want people to be scared and panic.Informing investors of the risks is a lot of CYA, the reporting on it is FUD.",

Armstrong also said that Coinbase's institutional customers have certain protection in their TOS that should protect their assets held by coinbase in the event of a bankruptcy, and that they are working on getting their TOS updated for retail customers to protect/segerate funds held by coinbase.

As far as bankruptcy proceedings are concerned, crypto exchanges are not treated in the same way as banks. Banks are usually in the \"too big to fail\" category and that owes to the fact that most people use banks. So the government would usually step in to save the banks from bankruptcy & liquidation as in the case of Fannie and Freddie.But crypto exchanges are not put in that category so they are usually allowed to be liquidated. Partially because the emergance of so many scam exchanges made regulators turn their eyes away from the subject.",

I have had a few cases in my past where the Banks where I had deposits.. filed for Bankruptcy and in the end.. I got a fraction of my deposits back. (Something like 23cent per Dollar) That is just the way it works when you trust centralized financial organizations like Banks. My government does not give any guarantees for deposits at Banks, so you are on your own if they fail. (A lot of governments do step in with bailouts, if that happens... but it depends on the financial situation)",

(A lot of governments do step in with bailouts, if that happens... but it depends on the financial situation)  In that case, you have one more reason not to keep your money in the bank, but to be your own bank. I can't say if this is the case across the EU, but I have deposit insurance of up to €100 000 guaranteed by the state - although for me personally, it's just a promise that doesn't mean I get my money in case the bank goes bankrupt.As for CEX like Coinbase, such warnings should be prominent and clearly visible to anyone who registers and decides to trade. Of course, it is not in CEX's interest to encourage customers to withdraw their coins, we all know that they want to position themselves not only as a place of exchange, but also as crypto banks.",

Banks are usually in the \"too big to fail\" category and that owes to the fact that most people use banks. So the government would usually step in to save the banks from bankruptcy & liquidation as in the case of Fannie and Freddie.In much of the world, banks are insured by some kind of insurance fund. Banks will pay a portion of their deposits into the insurance fund and will guarantee customer deposits, up to certain limits. This gives confidence to deposit holders of banks, even when the bank is doing badly financially. It also effectively socializes losses that banks incur after the bank goes bankrupt among all banks in proportion to their size.There is no similar insurance fund for crypto exchanges. Although some exchanges are starting to offer deposit-like products that pay interest, whose deposits are used to provide loans, most exchanges do not make loans with deposits intended for trading. This means that exchange losses will typically come from hacks/exploits, which is difficult to insure against.",

Investing into their stocks is different which is what many of us are confusing and also this is same risk as investing on any stocks as well.",

The former is a requirement from the SEC; the latter is obviously a FUD.That Coinbase stocks are plunging is no huge surprise in the face of a plunging Bitcoin and other top altcoins. To report as if Coinbase is near its end is nothing but a malicious attempt to sow confusion.",
