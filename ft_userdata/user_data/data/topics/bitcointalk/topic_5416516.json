Why shouldn't just buy these coins on my end ?It depends only on user, but our protocol has several advantages over this approach: Time - you do not need to use your time to find the exchange or dex with all coins, find how to stake or farm coin, rebalance coins, gather earnings etc. Our team will do it for minimal fee. Fees - without huge budget the fees could erase most of the earnings. In our case you just need to buy vault tokens and pay single fee. All the farming fees will be divided to all holders so even with low budget you will earn on farming. Security - our team is professionals in crypto world for years. We are using only selected safe farms and protocols. Our team for wallets using only Leadger devices. You just need to keep single wallet with our vault coins in safe place, the rest our will handle for you. Rebalancing - our team will consistently and constantly rebalance the vault holdings. That also mean profit realization and cheap buying to keep proportions in vault.¬† If you would like to do it on your own you would need much time and pay a lot of fees. Aidrop - if you participate in our public sale, you will get airdrop main governance when it will be established (Q3 2023). Plus the project is not well recognized yet, so return from entering public sale could be x10 x50 x100 or even x1000.There is many more things like psychological, community etc. things where our protocol have advantage but we want to keep the answers short. If you would like to discuss, come join our telegram  What if value token market cap will be much lower than assets in vault ? Our team is prepared for such situation, there is two way to deal with that. All our vault tokens have burn function, the users could burn their tokens to get equivalent of assets behind their token. The second option is the vault manager which will catch up these situations and just buy and burn tokens till equalization which will generate additional income which will stay in vault. What is deflationary coin?To be deflationary the project need to burn more coins than is creating or like in our case the value behind token need to only rise. It should deflect on price - the lower in circulation coins or the more coins in vault behind the token, the value should be increase over time.What the value governance coin YR will provide ? The YR will be deflationary token with many streams of income - vaults, swap, lottery, predictions, nft, stable coin. All these streams will generate money to burn main token. Furthermore the users will be able to manage the project, which vaults to add, manage the fees and many more. These two main features will give YR value. The vaults holdings are safe? All the holding amounts will be available live at webapp with wallets holding it, so users will be able to verify them in any time and check all transactions executed. We also care about safety with working with wallets so we have defined best practices in security which include using only leadger devices directly from producer, using only safe trusted farms, governance protocol and POS staking. Audits and insurances will also be used.",

      "body": "FAQCan I participate in YRD public sale to be entitled to airdrop than burn tokens to receive funds back ? Yes the users can use this strategy, all funds will be returned to them minus fees. Remember, burning at the beginning will be performed only once per week, so exact amount of funds returned depend on price of coins in that moment. YR total supply is 1 000 000 000, isn't this token will be worth nothing ? The price in public sale will never be lower than 0.1 Matic. Additionally, our protocol have burning program, so even when the price will drop drastically after launch our burning thanks to that will quickly burn massive amount of tokens and the price should reflect that. The total supply will never rise so we believe in long term the price should easily beat this 0.1 Matic, so even some YR tokens can make you rich !",

      "body": "For people who do not have time to read all whitepaper. There is incoming in the beginning of Q3 main governance YR token which will not connected with vault but to governance all protocol. It will be capped on 1 billion token, and 30% of it will be airdroped to participants in incoming vault tokens YRD, YRG, YRS. Participants sale will get 5% from first public sale, 3% from second and 2% from third airdrop of YR total supply each. Its a not well known project yet so this is huge opportunity to get thousands or even millions of tokens by small amount of funds. Our team will do everything to make YR worth over 0.1$ at first than over 1$ in future due to burning and protocol development. Do not miss that chance !",
