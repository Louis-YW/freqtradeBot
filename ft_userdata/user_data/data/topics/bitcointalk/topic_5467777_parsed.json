Even though as people may know, OP often bets with big bets and often shares his story of often achieving big winning targets. I don't know whether his money has run out because he lost gambling, but there is truth in gambling with money that is ready to lose. and don't be too confident with bets that we believe in because it still all comes down to luck and it's not that easy to win.I'm not really used to parlay bets like this, but just to say that OP is actually not a gambler who likes small bets, OP often bets for big money so it's a bit hard to believe that if OP is looking for a loan for that, he should bet with the money he is ready to lose or the money he currently has. because it is true that it is not recommended to seek a loan.",

I’m not familiar on this feature for parlay bets.

I have seen this in real life though it was a small amount but the guy loss them all and pay the debt. Gambling is not something you borrow to play.

This your plan is not clear and I don't thick you can see such amount as a loan in the forum.Looks like you might've missed something in the OP's post. He wants to borrow $50k to hedge their parlay bet, which means it's basically a sure win whichever way it goes. However, the catch here is that he doesn't have his own cash and want to borrow from a stranger, and that's a bit of a gamble in itself.Now, if the OP doesn't have anything to offer as collateral for the loan, it's tough to see how they can promise the lender that they'll get their money back.",

Besides, that $95k you'll be gaining is literally free considering how little your stake is for the whole parlay. Betting $50k in a 3-way parlay with 3 odds gets you at an even better position than letting this parlay ride. You are already at an advantageous position, why choose to let it lose now by loaning and trying to hedge? You'll gain a few thousand at most in hedging, whereas in cashing out the $95k and keeping the same bet, you'll still be able to win a lot more.",

You have already hit a once in a life time jackpot, putting your trust on that last game is just insanity no matter how you feel about it. Ask yourself would you try to double that money in dice, because that's similar to what you are doing now. You can lose everything or get free 86k. You have no control over that next game after it starts, so this is not a game of who wants to be a millionaire. Ask yourself: Which would make you more mad, losing $86k that you have in your pocket? Or losing something because you didn't bet on while getting 86k for $2.5 bet? We don't bet on things all the time. We rarely regret that.",

Why take a loan when you can get the $95k, bet $50k on the remaining parlay legs, play it safely and you'll still come out on top with free $45k already bagged regardless of the outcome. I think at this point, OP is just trying to rile people up in here, or are making us fools to believe in his screenshots if it is indeed the case.
