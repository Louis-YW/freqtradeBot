  "content": "Does gaming makes memory temp on 3070Ti less hot than mining? No matter what I do to my 3070ti it always shows 96°C when mining and 86°C when gaming, I tried GTA V and Call Of Duty multiplayer but only gaming makes my GPU run extremely hot.",

Also if it's plugged directly into the motherboard it tends to be hotter then GPUs using risers. Change the thermal paste can reduce temps from GPU, but not from memoryIn some cases they can even increase tempsfrom memory because the person need to disassembly and assembly the thermal pads in the perfect spot and give the right pressure to mount.The right service to do is to change thermal pads to reduce the memory temps, but if the card have warranty I don't see reasons to do if the card is under 100ºCBut your advice about GPU fan set and desktop airflow is good and can help reduce some degrees",

They design GPUs to run extremely hot. I had many old GPUs and they ran at like 80-90 degrees on GPU chips for years because AMD design them to be quiet. So it had high temps to not be crazy loud and it lasted like 5 years before I sold it. So I wouldn’t worry about damaging anything.",
