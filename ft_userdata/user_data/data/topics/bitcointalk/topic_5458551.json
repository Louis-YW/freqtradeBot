  "content": "To Ethiopia Head, you were suppose to completely remove tplf from power for peace to reign, instead you went on to negotiate with it. Now the cancer is regrowing and trying to create choas allover Ethiopia by encouraging fault lines among the ethnic groups or trying to unite them against Eritrea, with the assistance of Foreigners and people living outside of Ethiopia .How do you expect Eritrea to withdraw from Tigrai when you have put her in a very dangerous and difficult situation? You ceded part of your former lands to her, used her against the tplf you called terrorists, now you negotiated with the terrorists with the help of foreigners and decided to let it go free without considering the consequences of this foolishness. You think tplf will ever truely forgive Eritrea for the lands you gave her? You think it will ever forgive amhara? It's more like you used and dumb Eritrea and Amhara after getting what you want (obedience from tplf) . How can you be so foolish. They have fooled you to save tlpf and will later use it against you. But it will be difficult for them as long as we continue to observe situation.I noticed you are trying to merge TDF with Ethiopia army... don't forget it's greater than the army you are trying to merge it with. And it's under the power of the one who currently controls Eritrea and Amhara forces. If we noticed any more issue that warrant our intervention, TDF will be merged with Eritrea and Amhara forces to defend the regions and possibly Ethiopia.Related Post:To Russia and Ethiopia, why negotiate with the ones you called Terrorists?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418432.msg61189278#msg61189278",
