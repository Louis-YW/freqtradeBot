When it comes to wagering competitions it's hard to compete on those in all popular casinos... even harder with limited bankroll. I used to compete before, but I stopped with that. I don't have as much free time as I used to have, and with a small bankroll, we are forced to play for hours if we wish to compete with some whales. Of course, we need to be lucky enough to not bust the balance in the meantime.",

It's a scenario in which they hardly lose. now for those people who don't have a lot of money, they have low and limited capital, so they play without any great expectation that they will be able to winI saw the requirements for declaring winners and in my opinion they are very good, because there are many people who play with a lot of money in the casino so one of them will be able to win and have a happier Christmas, if I were rich and I was playing and If I won a Christmas prize, I would jump with joy until my neighbors heard, because the feeling of winning is something unforgettable.
