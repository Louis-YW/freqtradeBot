  "content": "Hi, the duck won't pay me my winnings. I made a deposit of $1000 my txid 0x3dc40e7e46e7b0abd0daa8adab2dffe9adde699a3df92e259e89e093dfb5f069Next I was betting the usual soccer bets, including real madrid and nba basketball, volleyball. I both won and lost. My balance ended up being $2,477. Next I planned to withdraw my winnings and bet further. But they didn't let me and blocked my account. They asked me to pass kyc 3, I passed it for a very long time because of their guilt. As I did not have access to the account, and the mail was very long answer. Sometimes I waited 5-7 days for an answer.Then I passed the procedure successfully and was given access to my account, but saw only my deposit of $ 1000, and they took my winnings. They accused me of something unclear and do not want to pay me my full amount. In their chat can not help, communicated rudely. At the post office answer for 3-5 days.Please help me in the payment of my entire amount",

You have to show some prove if you want to accuse a casino because that is how your story will be believed. Show some screenshots of what happened then you can be advised appropriately.",

And in the chat room said that their provider marked me as I bet arbitrage. What kind of bets arbitrage do not know, I bet the top leagues. At least one of them is the NBA. I'm a second day trying to get through the chat on their site. But I'm waiting in line for a very long time.",

I got a reply from the subredge, all right I was accused of arbitrage betting, but I did not bet any arbitrage bets. They were regular bets, not which I lost, not which I won. I will be creating duck fraud threads until it resolves my issue. I bet honestly, they have a very bad attitude towards players. I attach a screenshot. https://prnt.sc/re0HGB3qjM2A Don't worry it's a safe link. My duck login is Furtikzergagil and my email is Furtikzerga.gil@gmail.com",
