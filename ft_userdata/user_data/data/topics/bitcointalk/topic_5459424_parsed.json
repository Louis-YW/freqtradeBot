My simple definition of gambling is \"try your luck\", because you don't know what will be the outcome of the game that you staked. Although calculation is involved in gambling, like forecasting and permutations to predict winnings. In the end it is fifty fifty or sixty forty chances of winning. At the same time you can not accurately predict bitcoin , because of it's volatile nature. You're not 100% sure whether you'll win or loose.  Furthermore, I've leant on this forum that it's better to invest in bitcoin, with what you can afford to loose, meaning that it's not safe to invest your main capital. This is where I think that bitcoin is like gambling, because despite the accurate knowledge of bitcoin chart, you're never too certain of making gains, just like in casino, online betting and the rest.From my observation, people don't have much regards for gamblers, they either see them as lazy people who don't like to work, or people who want to take shortcut to get rich. Although people are entitled to their opinions, but I don't like to categorize bitcoin in this group of \" try your luck \". I know bitcoin is of a higher level, it's a decentralized digital currency that you can use to make transactions, at the same time you can cash in when the coin appreciates., or even trade it to make profit.So having made all this comparisons, do you think that bitcoin can be classified as gambling?",

Because we only try our luck, even though it's not certain that if we have knowledge and analysis it will definitely make us successful, but at least we can reduce the risk.I agree with you, if we invest or trade bitcoin, but we don't know anything about bitcoin then it is the same as gambling. So, we need to understand bitcoin before trying to dive into it, so we can have an analysis of when is the right time to buy or hold bitcoin. Bitcoin is an investment instrument that has a high risk, if we don't know the knowledge it will be very dangerous. But every investment that has a high risk must have a big profit. So let's understand bitcoin before investing in bitcoin",

If you invest all of your Capital in Bitcoin and the price happens to go against your prediction, the result won't really be nice at the investor's end. But when you invest what you could possibly afford to lose, there is a possibility of you not panicking even in the worst bearish season because your hopes of surviving are not on that investment. But one thing is for sure: no matter the rate at which the price of Bitcoin seems to drop, the hope of regaining back all the recorded losses is still strong, provided that you are still holding your Bitcoin and not selling it off out of panic. While for gambling, when one makes the wrong prediction, there is no chance of regaining the amount spent. You will have to keep on putting more money into other games in order to gain back what you have lost in previous games, which if the chances all depend on luck, you will end up losing more until you are completely drained.",

Gambling means betting on something that if you lose the bet your money will vanish and if you win your money will be doubled but in case of trading there is no such condition. Money may increase or decrease but it is not likely to vanish completely like gambling or double profit. Strategy is not very useful in gambling but strategy is very important in trading. People who understand trading well choose trading as their profession because there are more chances of profit if you understand trading. Gambling is somewhat dependent on luck.",

If the bitcoin price reduces to $27k within  72hrs you still left with that same fraction of 0.033 btc and, when the market turns back $40k you may have higher in price but with same fraction of bitcoin. So tell me why should people keeps classifying bitcoin to gambling where you place a bet to lose or win. I think similar topic has been created already, maybe next try using the search option to find them out.",

They are fully different but in many cases their strategy looks like same but if you focus on every volatile things you will think it also as a gambling. Bitcoin is a store of value like Gold or Silver and it's price increase or decrease according to demands. So we are almost sure about it's potential for the future. But gambling will remain same. Gambling is like a game where you have to choose yes or no as example. Because of uncertainty of Bitcoin price you can't say this gambling. Day by day people will adopt Bitcoin and it's volatility will decrease and usecases will increase. But some blind traders trade or invest like a gambling mostly in future trading.So you can use your gambling startegy in Bitcoin trading but can't implement a proper trading strategy in gambling.

Gambling is a totally different thing and there is no proper strategy for a gambler other than the luck factor. I have always been saying it and I will say it once again that gambling is purely dependent on someone's luck because only a lucky person can have profit in gambling. Those who don't have a good luck should try stops betting instead of betting on the games that are purely luck oriented.",

Bitcoin trading is like Forex trading where exchange of one item for another is made. It's a clear cut from gambling. A gambler only hopes to get to their dream with just cash staked to catch fortune overnight. Again, the average disposition of a gambler is that of recklessness and wildlife with smoking, womanizing, clubbing and all that. In Nigeria such are seen as acts of irresponsibility.QuoteFrom my observation, people don't have much regards for gamblers, they either see them as lazy people who don't like to work, or people who want to take shortcut to get rich.Well, you can also add the desperation part to the mindset of gamblers. I think that's even what scares people more. Anyone who's desperate can \"do and undo\" like we say in my local parlance. Maybe I judge this too harshly and that can simply be because of the way gamblers behave on the average.",

I cant blame out though into those people who would really be having the impression on making trading crypto would really be a gamble. Yes, its a gamble on the sense you are risking your money but at the same time it isnt considering that you could be able to apply some analysis and technical approach into it on which it would really be creating out that kind of advantage on which you cant really be able to get on pure luck based games.Its a different category and its up to someone whether they would really be having that kind of gambler like behavior on the time that they would trade or would really be doing those casual stuffs.Entertainment and an activity which does involved investment or making profits is really that totally different.
