Their are some kind of conversation I will not advice anyone to even partake on, those argument where you know fully well that the person who is saying things against Bitcoin does not even know what the are saying, the point which they are making doesn't in any way relate to Bitcoin. Those kind of argument is not what one will get them self involve in trying to explain something to someone who is not ready to listen and learn, because they will end up dragging you to the ground with them.In cases where I see people with wrong perspective regarding what Bitcoin is and all of that, I stand to correct them in the little way that I can, this is because I see them as people who are willing to take correction, so bringing them back from their wrong direction will not be a bad idea. In the aspect of teaching and educating people about Bitcoin, I don't do it more often but if I have the opportunity to do that I explain to people who are willing to learn little about it base on how I understand it. It's not compulsory for us to be going about arguing or teaching Bitcoin to people who are not willing to learn, if they want to call Bitcoin bad names let them do it, it won't stop Bitcoin from being Bitcoin, it won't reduce any value from it.",

It's good the way it is. if you want to be a positive change to the people around you related to Cryptocurrency, just inform them with good practices like Buying a Hardware Wallet and keeping their Bitcoin secure, giving a influence on them will help you spread awareness.

Those bad experiences and feedbacks that I've got personally really turned a lot on me and that's why even if someone approaches me and asks me about it, sometimes I like to answer but there are times that I just want to remain quiet. Another reason is because of privacy matters and trying to avoid wrench attacks.",

Be a good Ambassador in your locality and represent Bitcoin to the core.It's not a bad idea to teach people about bitcoin but no law mandates you to do it. You can tell people about the currency if you have the opportunity and sometimes you can decide to keep your knowledge to yourself. For me, I am mandated to dispel every false interpretation or misconception about Bitcoin. If someone wants to generalize that bitcoin is the same as other cryptocurrencies, I will immediately counter such belief and educate the person about bitcoin. There is no way a person will equate Bitcoin with other coins because they are not the same. Even today I reoriented my neighbor about investing in Bitcoin because he is seeing the sector as a Ponzi scheme. I had to take time to differentiate between the bitcoin space and others. And I was glad he got the point and his old belief was dropped. Bitcoin talk is a community where members learn and share ideas about Bitcoin and others. The rules of the forum cover your activities within the forum. Your activities outside the forum are your business because the forum promotes privacy.",

I think being said as an ambassador gives that heavy responsibility as an individual who's into Bitcoin investing. I know that we should play our parts for giving people the idea of what Bitcoin is but there's the right forum, right time for it to be said. Not everyone that asks you are literally interested in knowing it, if you've been into in the past and you talked with people that have asked you about Bitcoin. You will understand the struggle for being a voluntary ambassador and person that wants to drive people to this space. We're not obligated yes but if you think that it's your sole duty to have it with different people no one can stop you but we can also have that disappointment in encouraging others to be one. For some safety measures, if it's just happening over the web, we can secure ourselves but to happen it physically. Then, you know the dangers that you may get.",

Be a good Ambassador in your locality and represent Bitcoin to the core.I agree in principle, promoting Bitcoin is cool. But overall, I'd rather promote the P2P concept than Bitcoin itself. It keeps me from attracting attention, and those who understand the value of P2P systems will eventually find Bitcoin and understand it themselves if they bother to. However, I think that in some cases, it's better not to promote than to promote in the wrong way. Stuffing people is counter-productive, and saying things that are wrong and misunderstood is a very bad publicity.I was once in a hotel in Estonia, and a young Belgian was making pro-Bitcoin propaganda. I thought \"Nice !\". I pretended I didn't know anything about BTC, and I realized after 5 minutes that the guy knew almost nothing about it, and was talking nonsense. This is counter-productive, I don't think it does the community or Bitcoin any favors. I hope that, as time goes by and more resources in multiple languages become available online, some of the propagandists will improve.",
