Question now is if this is just a pull back in attempt to go on another upward trend or if we are just about to enter a bearish trend. Yea, it's another pull back and it is a norm in bitcoin price movement because it's a volatile asset. We are still in the bull run and I am hoping to see a price above $120k as the peak price in this circle. However, this is an opportunity for you to buy more Bitcoin if you have the funds available. Don't panic but hodli with happiness.",

Trump's new policy reacted to the market so fast. Its supposed to be a correction for Bitcoin market as that's normal. But no one can tell if this correction might be longer than we think. The fact is that we are being given a good chance to buy and stack more coins in our wallets. So don't miss such opportunities if you know you can buy, get to it. I just hope it returns to its bullish trend sooner. For the altcoin market, it was really affected and I wish them quick recovery..",

Hopefully it can recover next few days/ weeks but who knows?? According to reports, over $2 billion has been liquidated in the last 24 hours so the possibility of a market recovery in the coming days is almost certain but the question is. How far will the market recover and will the bull season continue or are we slowly entering the bear season and there will be no altcoin season as most of the market is expecting? With Trump initiating a trade war with Canada, Mexico, China and the EU could be his next targets. That would certainly make the global economy more difficult and have a significant impact on the markets. So I started wondering: will we still have a bull run like many people expect (4 year cycle) or will we enter a bear run from here?",

Predicting is very hard in crypto,all we can do is to wait,not just if we saw a decline of price we will say that it is already down trend,sometimes we think that it is a down trend specially when everything is not happened according to what we plan or what we expect, i think we just need a small break and be more cautious because crypto today has a very high volatility.",

This correction give you the opportunity to buy back Bitcoin and other coins at a low price. Usually after the correction, the price will increase and change the direction so that will be the time for you to make a profit by selling the coin.The trader and investor like to see this current situation because they can buy at a low price and hold it. They will not want to miss this chance so they will buy back using their funds and waiting for the next thing that will happen.",

Question now is if this is just a pull back in attempt to go on another upward trend or if we are just about to enter a bearish trend. It's too early to say that this is going to be entering the bearish trend. But we don't know if we've reached the peak already or not yet. But with what I speculate at this time, this is a pretty normal thing that happens every bull run.This scenario is not different from the past that we've got before Bitcoin broke $69k ATH of 2021. It did broke last year and then it made more heights afterward.Like what you've said, this is just a pull back and we have to wait for another uptrend because the market has been resilient as always!",

I just hope it returns to its bullish trend sooner. For the altcoin market, it was really affected and I wish them quick recovery..Bitcoin's response to the global market trend could have a negative effect on the price, as Trump is solidly entering into a market war with his 25% tarrifs on Mexico, and Canada imports, then 10% on China. All affected countries vowed to retaliate especially China that's looking at challenging Trump's levies at the WHO these are not good for bitcoin as the focus of most investors would be on the ongoing global market changes. Probably, Bitcoin will correct its price, but if trends as this begin to persist the price of BTC might go bearish, though, nobody is sure of when.",

The best way to be profitable in this space is, don't buy the green buy the Red, I love when the market is bleeding, to me it means an opportunity. Despite that Donald Trump administration placed a high tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, which caused the sell off in the market on the short term, the market will definitely bounce back in the future.",

If you are very good at technical analysis, you will understand that the market could surely not continue bullish, but at some point we have to retrace to fill up inefficiencies that have been created in the course of the bullish trend. In my opinion, this is what we are currently seeing, that is, the market is retracing to fill up the inefficiencies and fair value gaps that have been created before it heads back up.",
