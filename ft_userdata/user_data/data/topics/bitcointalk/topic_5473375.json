In that way you aren't actually losing money since the coins in these networks have no value whatsoever and won't have to worry about paying fees, etc. You also won't spam the main-chain with your test transaction.",

Even if the hex number is out of range it is converted into a valid private key by using modulo, as others here have pointed out (unless the number is 0 or a multiple of n). So no. Anybody will be able to retrieve any bitcoins sent to this address.",
