As far as i know that there are two toncoin. 1 created by chinese developers and another 1 from russian developers. Both were being contradicted from one to the each other. The development was not so impressive and i can't even understand what's main target for this project. We didn't need toncoin anymore and that's purely hype caused by telegram rumour to launch a coin in the past. You can replace it.",

      "body": "For me IMO probably i will choose those projects that have good history in the previous run and which is still more popular in the market nowadays because surely they can win again in the long run, and for me even they reach their current ATH only where in its enough and a big win for me as well. Imagine what percentage you will have if you bought at the bottom and they recover back to the ATH..",

So once again you have to ask why you allocate to such token.",

It's better to replace all of them with low liquidity which was under 10 millions USD as daily volume trade with some better tokens that available in the market. I think you must think about that if you are looking for profit and you shall go for the tokens which was always getting hyped. The sustainable development and growth actually needed if you wanna go for long term. These days the news will come once the project had been developed some good products.",

That must be the one he preferred and not those who are in the mainstream already like bitcoins and ethereum. There are investors that are like that. They think those coins potential aren't fully unlocked yet and they want to be a part of it before it happens. That is already their choice and we can't do much about it but for us we are already happy and contented with what bitcoin and ethereum has to offer.There's also more to come from these two coins now that eth is transforming and expected to become better while for bitcoin everyone is speculating that it will reach 100k or more, later on.",
