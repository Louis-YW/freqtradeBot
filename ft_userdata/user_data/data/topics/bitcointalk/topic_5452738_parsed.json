      "body": "That's a good offer but risky. So, first as you are a newbie, how you can assure that you will not run from the site owner. Because obviously the money that can be earned through google ads will be sent directed to you as the adsense owner. Second, what are the type of payments you are accepting to pay to the site owner.",

      "body": "OP this offer of yours is very enticing but yet dangerous. From my quick check on your profile, you are a newbie with no reputation here or audience not to talk of having a positive feedback from anybody here and you expect members to patronize you when in the real sense you could abscond with the website owners fund accrued in your adsense account. I think it could be okay this way ;If you can surrender your AdSense to any reputable high ranked member here for an escrow Service based in your agreement with them that would call for transparency and credibility as the funds in the account would be safe and secured for both parties as no one would be worried over the other part absconding with funds meant to be shared amongst the parties involved.I think you should consider this and possibly explore other options as well because this is a thing of funds and access to account.I will also advise anyone dealing to be cautious while dealing so as to avoid unforseen circumstances in the nearest future. Do the needful before engaging.",

      "body": "It would be helpful if you could specify the percentage of the traffic earnings that you will be taking or sharing as well as the payment methods and payment timing. Based on my previous experience with Google AdSense I remmeber that you need to have a minimum of $70 in earnings before you can make a withdrawal each month.And also as previous users have mentioned this offer can be quite risky for both parties. To reduce the risks involved you in this offer you should at least establish clear guidelines for payment such as a guarantee that you will pay the agreedpercentage at the end of each month for exemple. Additionally the traffic provider should respect google adsense rules and regulations set forth by them, or else both sides run the risk of having your account banned.In my opinion it will be safer and more beneficial for you to get your own traffic and create your own website rather than relying on external sources. This way you can have more control over the content and advertising on your sit  and avoid potential issues with third party providers. Alternatively the traffic provider could explore alternative advertising options or create a new AdSense account to minimize the risk payment and breaking rules.",

Why risk when you can have your own adsense account. I wonder if you being a partner can have access to that adsense account and check the data. Because that would be something you can use as a partner of him.  If I were OP I would probably just use the account to monetize youtube videos, it's been a good source for most of the influencers by just uploading related niches to it.  Is crypto-related content allowed in adsense?",

Anyone can create that, but achieving organic traffic that will bring profit through Adsense is a little more complicated. Don't look at it like a piece of cake.Next, there is a big difference between a newly created Adsense account and 10 year old. This older account is always immediately accepted, regardless of the quality of the site, while the new ones have to go through the approval process and are often negative. Also about Adsense, unfortunately, not everyone has the privilege to open an AdSense account. In some jurisdictions, this is still impossible.Yes, Adsense can be allowed on sites with crypto-related content.",

Not everyone has the skill to make vhttp://ideos and make it appealing or make the video shows in the top of every user's search either in youtube or google to have more views and make it trend. I agree everything examplens have mentioned it really takes time and effort to get approved your application in adsense. So this is really a good offer but i doubt how to make both parties fair and OP should be open for escrow.",

So this is really a good offer but i doubt how to make both parties fair and OP should be open for escrow. Op is looking for a website with traffic, he will not just accept a website or traffic he will base it on Adsense criteria and its profitability based on Google Analytics and Keywords analysis so if you're running a site with good traffic it's better to have full control of its monetization by taking a chance by applying.These are Adsense Criteria for 2023 Quoteyou must be at least 18 years of ageyou must have control of your siteyour site must contain unique and interesting contentyour site must have clear navigationyou must avoid driving fake traffic to your siteyour content must comply with Google content policiesyou must not include copyrighted content in your blog without permissionsyou must use a supported languageyour site must not contain the abusive experienceyou should have technical pagesmake sure your site is at least six months oldhave some sufficient trafficnumber of posts.https://myfavetools.com/post/13-google-adsense-approval-requirementsMaybe  OP will have a taker but both parties should know the risk and how to have a better deal.",
