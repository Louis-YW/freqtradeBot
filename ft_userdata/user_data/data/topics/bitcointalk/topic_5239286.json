  "content": "Hey there guys, im creating this topic just to share and \"maybe discuss\" my case with Binance's support;At the moment i didnt knew what exactly happened, but, i've copied the adress 13PcbKjLBjVUYcSevYELQDc1pLDm6Bb9Difrom the \"Copy Address button\" and deposited 0.10 BTC \"That's a high value for me\"At that point, everything is ok.Been waiting 10~20 minutes, and my balance haven't updated. Ok, something wrong is happening hereFor instinct, i've just checked my wallet again, and, for my hopelessness, my real BTC wallet is 19rRmQXDKxu8bQki2tJqdPJ2H1SfoYunHCThe \"Copy Adress is automatically copying the adress 13PcbKjLBjVUYcSevYELQDc1pLDm6Bb9Di\" PS: I've also recorded with OBStudio what just happened; https://youtu.be/EqUqI6eaU6IOk, that's a problem. since i have already deposited 0.10 BTC in ANOTHER wallet. No other way to solve it, i had to open a ticket. And that's the answer i've received;Binance's answer ;Dear Ivan,Thanks for reaching out.We are sorry for what you encountered. Please go through following tips immediately before you take any further action.1. Install anti-virus software to scan/kill Trojan and other viruses as soon as possible;2. Disable plug-in/extensions for your browser, trading bot or third-party APP and uninstall unknown software on your computer;3. Change the password for your devices and accounts;4. In a critically dangerous situation you should format your hard drive and reinstall the OS (operating system) on your computer (If you are not sure how to do this, seek professional assistance);5. Consider seeking help from an information security expert to determine how to achieve the best possible level of security;Thank you for your understanding.Best Regards,Binance Support TeamMy reply ; Right.But, what about my 0.10 BTC's?How can i get it back?Binance's reply ;Dear Ivan,Thank you for your follow-up.As shown in the website, your BTC deposit address should be 19rRmQXDKxu8bQki2tJqdPJ2H1SfoYunHC. If the address changes after you copy and paste it, you will need to check the security status of your device. You can refer to the instructions offered by Elaine before. In addition, I regret to tell you that, given that the destination address does not belong to Binance, we are not able to freeze any funds/accounts tied to the recipients.If you are interested in pursuing this case, we recommend that you file a police report or cyber-crime report so that you may receive assistance as soon as possible.Your understanding is much appreciated.Kind regards,Binance Support TeamThe point is;I have already formated my computer, downloaded the official .ISO from microsoft, paid for the OS, the anti viruses is ok, nothing have been detected.Do you think the Binance's support is right in that case?I agree that i should have paid more attention, yes, but, the \"error\" is occurring only on the \"Copy Address button\", not in my Ctrl + C / Ctrl + VThat's it guys, thank you for reading.",

Newcomers?I agree there's a lot of malwares / scamwares / viruses, but, if the virus exist, and it only affect a button, its a simple button, what about protect that button? or maybe making a different kind button?In that case, the button should'nt exist then, right?Well, my ctrl + c / ctrl + v is working good. if there's was no \"Copy Address\" this problem wouldn't happen, agree?",

I think your computer has virus created by hackers or scammers because as what you have said, once you copy your BTC address, different wallet address has been copied and I can't judge you with that because just like me once I alredy copied my btc address, I will paste it to the filling form and don't even check it again.

That happened too with some of my friends, but then they formatted their laptops and installed a new system. After that, they try to copy-paste the wallet address, and they are fine, and the malware is not there. You should format your computer, and instal a new system if you don't want to get the other bad experience.This lesson is worth for you, at least, you know that there is a malware which can infect your copy-paste command, and you should be careful. Make sure you double check or triple check on the wallet destination and make sure it is right before you click the send button.",
