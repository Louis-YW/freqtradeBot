It's just making each of its customer to be disappointed with its closure.",

The bankruptcy of the platform and its team is conclusive proof that they are the ones who fabricated this hacking rumor to exonerate themselves. There are hidden matters that we do not know yet. I hope that the government will investigate this incident because I am sad for the money of the users of the FTX platform, I hope that they will be compensated.",

It's because they're trying to push people away on them as they tackle and deal with their existing problems. It will no longer surprise many if the websites Alameda is involved with will have come to its final day and will just shut down. And that is because it seems they can no longer deal with their matter.",
