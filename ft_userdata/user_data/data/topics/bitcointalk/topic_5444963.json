      "body": "Yes, we all believe the same things too on Bitcoin and these things are quite basic or elementary when we are describing it. So far, there has been no technology yet that can threat the secure nature of Bitcoin though we don't know for sure what can be years from now - and I leave that to creative minds to think of the future of Bitcoin. Now, of course, we know that being crypto Bitcoin is very volatile as any development that can affect it or one that can be impacting the people holding the coins can push its value in the market down or up. As many institutions are now into Bitcoin their decisions can be creating the directions of where the market is going. I am looking at Bitcoin as a medium for the people to experience more freedom away from the controls and eye-watching power of the government or its agencies...but of course this fact alone can also be making Bitcoin the focus of those people.",
