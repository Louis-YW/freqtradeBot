  "content": "I was sent a bit coin transaction from someone who owes me money, to my cash app account. I know that cash app has a $2500.00 daily cash limit but supposedly an unlimited BTC transaction limit. I was surprised that the BTC transaction did not arrive, though it was a 5 figure transaction, and asked about it and was told by the sender that it was stuck and suggested that I open a new trust wallet, which I did.Well opening a new Trust Wallet did not solve the issue so I was told I needed to link my cash app wallet to the trust wallet by making a $1000.00 transaction into my trust wallet, the transaction from my Cash App wallet showed up in the Trust Wallet and posted in the wallet balance but the pending/stuck transaction did not appear. I was then told to make 4 additional transactions of the same amount, $1000.00, to \"stake\" the wallet and this would allow the transaction to be released to the trust wallet. I got busy doing something else and came back to the trust wallet and my wallet balance showed $0.00. I finally located the transaction codes for my transfers and found out that the BTC was transferred out of my trust wallet 15 minutes after it arrived. Well needless to say I do not have the extra $4k, to send down what looks like a black hole. They provided various screen shots from BlockChair.com showing both transactions in the blockchain and have answered questions about each part of the transactions that have been made since the initial payment and why its not in my wallet balance. I was asked today if I had made the additional payments to the trust wallet.  However, so far the crypto dots have not connected in my brain and I cannot find anyone I know with knowledge of crypto currencies and the blockchain, I'm 65 yrs old.So the questions I have are:1. Why did Cash App not accept the large BTC transfer, I have used Cas App over a year and have almost 100 BTC transfers equaling the amount that was owed and sent to me.?2. Do you have to \"warm up\" a new wallet with some transaction history before it would accept something that might be considered out of the normal transaction amounts for the wallet to that date?",

      "body": "I'd assume you're being scammed/have been scammed by the sender. There is the potential that cash app have the funds on hold and if they do you should be able to search the deposit address you gave the sender in somewhere like blockchair (as you've mentioned or btc.com/blockchain.com) and have it show you the unconfirmed transaction that the sender claims is \"stuck\".On warming up a wallet, I'm not sure what that might mean but it's not a thing with bitcoin. You can send any amount to any address regardless of whether its been used before (and actually it's recommended not to reuse addresses for both privacy and potential security reasons).",

Bitcoin isn't a black box like PayPal wherein the sender sends a screenshot to \"prove\" they've sent the money. The front end of a website can be trivially altered. I can inspect the elements of a Blockchair page, and \"prove\" to you that I've sent you a million dollars in bitcoin.Did you ask for transaction id?

Meaning you can track it down and open a financial investigation?",

I don't know if you are still on this forum or not,  but just incase you are still here,  or you come back in the future,  I will like to tell you that your case is a case of scam,  if you story is true,  then it's rather unfortunate that you've been scammed,  it is my advice that you should contact cash app support,  maybe they can be of help to explain things more clearly to you. Quote 2. Do you have to \"warm up\" a new wallet with some transaction history before it would accept something that might be considered out of the normal transaction amounts for the wallet to that date? There is nothing like warming up a wallet before sending any amount of money into the the wallet,  even if the money you are putting in the wallet is in billions or trillions of dollars.If the person you are talking about has the private key or seed phrase to your trust wallet,  then be rest assured he's out there to scam you even the more,  my advice is that should not put any fund into that wallet anymore.",

You look it up yourself and see it was sent (and confirmed!). If that is done, you have the money, if it's not, then you are being scammed.I recommend you use hardware wallets for 4 figures amounts, I recommend you learn to look up a transaction on multiple block explorers (and it would be nice to also try to avoid scammers)",

And I think the link that was given to you if there was one that said to download trust wallet again here there was a chance that a scammer could enter you so that he could have access to your account. Or if the problem is not with the cash app itself, how did I say it? because there are also users of the cash app who say that they have been hacked or fraud, look at the image below.",
