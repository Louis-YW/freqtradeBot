      "body": "The third topic is about one bounty company; isn't there too much honor given to another scam?When will bounty hunters finally begin to understand that participation in such programs is tantamount to playing roulette? At least choose experienced managers, and don't go everywhere as soon as you are promised unrealistic payments.The forum does not moderate scams. I agree with Cantsay. How long will you be upset if tomorrow you are offered to participate in the next bounty?And please don't call bounties a job.Grow up.Quote from: Cryptoworldman on June 05, 2022, 12:12:04 PMSeniors, please answer my questions The number one question is how do I know if a project is good or bad?The second question is how to verify which project can pay and which can cheat it willDoes this tell you anything about your manager's experience?Pay attention, exactly 15 days later, he apparently learned to distinguish between black and white and decided to become a manager.",

You're only show your name were on 94th and the new spreadsheet, you name are on 142th. I don't really know why the management added more participants because they've not answered yet, but their accounts are newbie rank and they can easily create new accounts without lose anything.",
