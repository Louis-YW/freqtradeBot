Bitcoin cannot be just printed, it has to be mined.To cost to mine one bitcoin varies according to the cost of electricity. THe average cost to mine one bitcoin is around 30,000 USD, which is more than the currenct price now , according to Cointelegraph:https://cointelegraph.com/news/30k-btc-price-has-severe-impact-on-bitcoin-miner-profits-analysisQuote“If depreciation and amortization charges are included then the cost basis for mining Bitcoin is at around $30K, basically at the same level as current bitcoin price.”",

With the equalization in value of one Bitcoin to $14,000 does it means both could consume same amount of resources since they amount to same value? You cannot compare. It's apples and oranges.The price to mine one Bitcoin depends on various factors, but most important is the mining difficulty and that's something variable and not easy to understand. Even more, the price of bitcoin on the markets is not the mining price (nor the mining price + a known %). Halving, the increase of miners, the better and better hardware make difficulty and \"mining price\" be more and more expensive.Now fiat. I don't know the official numbers and I'd guess that neither you do. Fiat money is printed multiple times. Old and partly destroyed money is replaced too. And destroying old money and re-printing is costly too, not only the printing of new banknotes.Then, nowadays we use banks and cards. Since mining pretty much keeps almost the entire ecosystem running, it would be fair to somehow add all the fiat-relate part too. So: all the banks and their servers, then at very least VISA and Mastercard have to be added to the equation. Maybe even all the ATMs and PoS systems in shops (we can do the same for Bitcoin, but it won't change much). And it makes the numbers become significant, however, unknown.So there are 2 numbers we don't know (maybe the numbers for Bitcoin can be guestimated). I let you compare them.",

      "body": "The cost of printing fiat money can be whatever the central bank wants. For example, if the central bank decides to print a $10,000 dollar bill, the cost of printing $1 lowers. If the mint decides the value of the banknotes, they decide the cost of printing a unit of it as well. The cost of producing a bitcoin can be measured in hashes per second. The more the mining, the higher the difficulty, which means the higher the cost.

Cost of printing fiat does not determine its value, in fact the definition of a bank note is that its value is so much higher than the cost.But when it comes to bitcoin, although the cost of mining a new coin doesn't determine bitcoin value but it is directly related to it.

Like Bitmover said, Bitcoin can not be printed but mined, but I believe you see mining as printing since the mining also require time and money to do.I can not say which consumes time or money more to print or mine since i am not a bitcoin miner neither am I working in a central bank that prints fiat money, but what I do know is that, $14,000 usd worth of fiat money and $14,000 worth of Bitcoin are not the same, since fiat loses value continually due to inflation, and bitcoin on the other hand is a hedge against inflation, I believe it's better to spend that time and resources to mine bitcoin rather than printing fiat money.",

But the biggest part of the money they \"print\" is actually digital which was my point. For example during the early days of COVID pandemic FED printed trillions of dollars. There is simply no way to physically print that much cash.There is also not even serial number on the notes to cover all that money.
