  "content": "Upon browsing very old threads and marketplace deals way back when this forum is launched. I've seen this first time in this forum, I never know that there is an option before to be anonymous as is.  I know that it's remove for various reasons and I speculate that it's removed due to inefficiency and to avoid outlaw post in this forum. Will you agree if such feature were brought back to this forum? I can see first time visitors, People who just have questions about his situation on crypto that don't want to create an account will be the one utilizing it. Instead of creating account for such single use and leaving it, They can use this anonymous feature. I'm sure that this could be problematic since it attract spams in the forum but restricting them to post only into a newly created board such as [Anonymous posts](I imagine and invented the name) will sorta filter all those anonymous posts.",

Also unregulated posts such as threat will come more often I think. So yeah we should just stick on the current account system.",

Spam would increase exponentially, I could almost guarantee it.  I haven't seen any of those bots shilling testosterone or some weird product/service lately, but they were around a couple of years ago and probably still would be if that captcha hadn't been addded.  I'm not sure if that's the reason why you can't just post here anonymously anymore, but I can't imagine allowing that anymore.",

It does not really equate an Alt account. If fact, we can’t see ignored profiles anymore, and all post seem to be assigned to a fake user_id(u)=0 (mouse over the Ignore link of the Anonymous account in the first post here and see the UserId: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15911.msg208900#msg208900). It’s also likely  that all Anonymous accounts have their posts assigned to this same 0 user_id, so you can’t tell one from the other apart.",

Seriously, no one gets accountable fir the things they do or say and could lead to a lot of abuse. This won't be good. I get the point that, they don't don't to participate in some of the forum promotions and benefits here but, the abuse would be massive as users would see that for an opportunity to break rules and have nothing to loose while, over working the moderators. Yeah, there would be a few that would actually mean well but it doesn't hurt to create an account, your not paying to do so and the forum doesn't seek for your privacy details (No KYC).",
