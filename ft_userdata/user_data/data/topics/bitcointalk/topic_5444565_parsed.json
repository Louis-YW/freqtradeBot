  "content": "Hi Guys,Due to significant factors discussed in this thread. I believe it needs a separate thread to aware the community about \"What is hiding behind Centralized Exchanges User Agreement\". Literally, I had no idea what was written on their User Agreement page until today. It's almost impossible to read all terms and conditions when we sign up on every website. But, regarding exchanges, casinos or where we will spend our money. It is worth reading before you sign up. I am pretty much sure 95% of users of these exchanges don't know what is written on their user agreement page. Because they are too long articles and we miss the critical part where they reported that they could seize user funds for any reason without any explanation. Would you deal with such platforms when they say they can seize your funds for any reason without giving you an explanation? Here I gathered up the Top five centralized exchanges[1] Important part of the User Agreement. 1. Binance;Quote from: https://www.binance.com/en/termsYou agree that Binance shall have the right to immediately suspend your Binance Account (and any accounts beneficially owned by related entities or affiliates), freeze or lock the Digital Assets or funds in all such accounts, and suspend your access to Binance for any reason including if Binance suspects any such accounts to be in violation of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any applicable laws and regulations. You agree that Binance shall not be liable to you for any permanent or temporary modification of your Binance Account, or suspension or termination of your access to all or any portion of Binance Services. Binance shall reserve the right to keep and use the transaction data or other information related to such Binance Accounts. The above account controls may also be applied in the following cases:2. Kraken;Quote from: https://www.kraken.com/legalIn the event of any Force Majeure Event (as defined in Section 23.5), breach of these Terms, or any other event that would make provision of the Services commercially unreasonable for Payward, we may, in our discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice, suspend your access to all or a portion of our Services. We may terminate your access to the Services in our sole discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or deactivate your Kraken Account and all related information and files in such account without liability to you, including, for instance, in the event that you breach any of these Terms. In the event of termination, Payward will attempt to return any Assets stored in your Kraken Account not otherwise owed to Payward, unless Payward believes you have committed fraud, negligence or other misconduct.3. Coinbase;Quote from: https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states6.10. Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation. Coinbase may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Coinbase Services, and/or deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Account(s), with immediate effect for any reason at its sole discretion and is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you. You acknowledge that Coinbase's decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your account for any reason in our sole discretion, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to Coinbase's risk management and security protocols. You agree that Coinbase is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.4. KuCoin;Quote from: https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-terms-of-useArticle 35 Where the Platform deems on its unilateral and independent judgement that any event that undermines the security of trading may arise, the Platform shall have the right to suspend, interrupt or terminate all or part of the User services (including fee-based services) provided to a User under this Agreement, remove or delete registration information of such a User, seize illicit profits that the User may gain, without notifying such User and without assuming any responsibility to such User or any third party. The aforementioned events include other circumstances under which the Platform, based on its sole judgment, needs to suspend, interrupt or terminate all or part of the User services (including fee-based services) provided to Users under this Agreement and remove or delete the registration information on the ground of transaction security and other reasons.5. BitFinex;Quote from: https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/exchange/termsRight to Use the Site: If you (i) have an Account, (ii) are not a Prohibited Person, (iii) do not operate your Account, any subaccount or Digital Tokens Wallet for the benefit of a Prohibited Person and (iv) comply with these Terms of Service, Bitfinex grants you the limited right to use the Services. The right to use the Services is a personal, restricted, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license, and it is subject to the limitations and obligations in these Terms of Service. Nothing in these Terms of Service gives you any license (other than as set out in this paragraph), right, title, or ownership of, in, or to the Site, any of the Services, the Copyrights or the Marks. Bitfinex may suspend or terminate the provision of Services to you, your Account or any subaccount or Digital Tokens Wallet, or to any of your Digital Tokens Addresses, or to freeze or terminate your Account or any subaccount or Digital Tokens Wallet, or your Fiat or Digital Tokens, at its sole discretion, as required by applicable Laws, where Bitfinex determines that you have violated, breached, or acted inconsistent with any of these Terms of Service or exposed Bitfinex or its Associates to the possibility of sanctions, restrictions or Losses pursuant to applicable Laws, or in connection with an investigation regarding any of the foregoing.For more detailed information.

When you realize the fact that once you send the money on centralized exchange its practically not yours anymore and they can do whatever they want it for whatever reason, you start acting accordingly meaning not using it for storing and only for its initial purpose (read: exchange).For that reason, I never have more than a couple of hundreds of dollars on an exchange because I know that every time I send it, it may be the last time I saw them.",

I think in order not to get double answers, it will be useful for you, OP, to read the opinions of the people who answered in this thread. How many people read crypto exchange terms and condition this day?I just checked the thread and read some interesting replies. Some people agreed they did not read the User Agreement, just like me.I created this thread for everyone who did not read the User Agreement when they signed up. It's impossible to read a few thousand words written for global users. Some part was written for some specific users. That's why users think I am not from there, so reading this has no benefit. In this thread, I quoted the most crucial part of the User Agreement, where Exchanges said they have the right to freeze your account at any time without explaining. I wish people at least read this part of the user agreement, so they know that their funds are at risk. Everyone thinks it won't happen to me until it happens to them. About double answers, I don't mind when people keep answering the same thing even though the same answers have already been posted by someone else (This is a perfect example). The issue was solved when it had five replies. People still posted another six replies even though they knew the problem was solved. Sometimes I find myself doing the same (Sometimes do not read all the posts). In this case, I will ignore those posts.Quote from: Rikafip on March 12, 2023, 12:56:12 PMFor that reason, I never have more than a couple of hundreds of dollars on an exchange because I know that every time I send it, it may be the last time I saw them. True Indeed. But we think it's not going to happen to us until it happens. People won't use such centralized exchanges if they get NON-KYC Alternatives. Take me as an example; I saw an Escrow service website and they were looking for suggestions from this forum. Its name was Zenland or something similar. I liked their system. I wish we have a non-KYC Platform where we can trade with locals.",

I read in social media about how many people face trouble and their assets freeze suddenly after huge amount withdrawing in Binance.But don't afraid for trading and saving assets in several exchange market although they have hidden user agreement, due not any rule break seems not problem with our account and keep running well when withdrawing or deposit assets.

Although I admit I haven't read through the user agreement, but the fact that they are centralized exchanges already gives you the ideas that they can control and do whatever they want with your account and also with whatever funds is in it. So funding it with a little amount is the best way to go about it, so that if eventually any thing unexpected should happen you won't have much to loss.",
