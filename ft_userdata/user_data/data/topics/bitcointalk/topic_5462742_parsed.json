Yeah it's a real bummer to see so many coins become paper weights. It's cool to see the newer coin makers put the addys on the coins. I have messaged smoothie offering to pay for his time to dig it up. (if he has a list) but I know he doesn't always respond. So I figured I would take one last shot before just peeling the coin. I really don't want to peel it. It's a long shot but figured I would try.",

But no response as usual. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I guess he would rather see his coins die and turn to paper weights.",

Public keys are valuable pieces of data that must be stored properly by the new owner. These are cryptographic technologies, to keep pace you need to develop proper infosec around them. For example, what if I was a hacker who knows the first bits of your coins public key.  If I am able to contact the manufacturer and retrieve the full public key by impersonation it would void the security and confidentiality of the product. Hackers could gain access to the full public keys of coins owned by individuals they were targeting to determine their funding status. If someone stole a picture of one of my coins and contacted the manufacturer like \"Hey, can you please give me the full public key of this coin. I lost the address a few years ago.\" And the manufacturer provided the full public key, it would be a breach in security. Ummm no to all that.  This sounds like a smoothie ass kiss to me… 🤣",

But I don’t hold smoothie at fault if this has been his policy for the entire time he has produced coins.
