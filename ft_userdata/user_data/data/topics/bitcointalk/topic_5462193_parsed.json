The claim is pretty expansive.   We also need to stop identifying specific chems as sole source apps.  that cannot be true.a better concept is a principle app with useful modulants producing a gentle and safe improvement.  Such a formulation combined with a sound diet could be expected to heal and fully restore a damaged organ.We need to apply this empirical concept to our whole range of plant based therapies.  They all tend to work gently instead of abruptly like our drugs....Avocado flesh is one of nature's nutritional powerhouses of healthy fats, but its leaves have also gained attention for their high nutrient value as a natural therapeutic alternative for restoring the body's major organs. In a study published in the International Journal of Phytomedicine and Phytotherapy, researchers discovered that avocado leaf extracts significantly repair the liver, kidney, and heart from injuries. The preparation involved rinsing avocado leaves in distilled water, air-drying, blending them into powder, and mixing them with 80 percent ethanol for three days, followed by freeze-drying into an extract....",

Western medicine changed all these and made people believe that only western medicine is good and safe for use. If more plants are studied, there will be more discoveries on other benefits that other plants can provide. Researchers need to visit Africa and learn from people who practice traditional herbal medicine, they will be able to point them in the right direction.",

It won't restore organ function, but it helps prevent damage and maintains longevity.  Nearly every fruit or vegetable would be sufficient. All herbal medicine is taking these plants and performing phytochemical extracts. You don't need to go that far, just consume the entirety of the plant and that's enough.",

Can't make any money if you don't sell yourself.Before 5,000 years ago many people lived to be over 900. Following the great flood of Noah's day (at about 5,000 years ago), ages began tapering off to what we have today. Here and there around the world people have lived and are living well over 100 years (a few over 200), all without doctors.Let nature, nutrition, good hygiene, and common sense be your guide, and you will live longer than the doctors, who don't live any longer than their charts, and often a lot shorter than their charts suggest they should.",

I would tell you to provide a reliable source, but I imagine it's going to be like conspiracytheories.blogspot.com.I don't expect any belief regarding what I say, one way or another.The oldest copy of the Bible that we have (at least publicly known) is the Septuagint. The Septuagint shows us that God made the earth and the heavens to be the way they are, 7500 years ago. The Great Flood of Noah's day happened about 5000 years ago. Prior to the Flood, people lived for hundreds of years... and for a while after the Flood, as well.Josephus, the Hebrew scholar and historian, backs this up (lived 34 A.D. and 101 A.D.). Josephus says that he took his information from the oldest Hebrew Bibles he could get copies of.You know that the Bible is truth because of Moses, the writer of the first 5 books. The Bible is far and beyond the greatest book in history. Why? Because it's a record of what happened. People kept the Bible record because the miraculous things written therein were so spectacular that these people couldn't be persuaded to forget these things.The current Bible that we can get a copy of at the store, is generally very good. The best English translations are the NASB and the NIV, each for different reasons. All the standard English Bibles are wrong in their ancient timelines, as shown by the Septuagint and Josephus. But these Bibles are extremely accurate on virtually everything else.",
