What to do if you stop trading?Invest your money in Bitcoin and hold it, don't trade.QuoteAnd what are the rules and regulations for me that must follow this platform recommended some close ones will say you will learn from this platform so much and I hope to recover from the loss and get a lot of benefits and knowledge gain that is why I am very excited to hear. Change yourself to be a Bitcoin investor, don't trade.When you are a Bitcoin investor, DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) is a good strategy.https://dcabtc.com/",

There are no assurances while working in the financial markets since they do what they do and you have no control over them except to decide how much money you want to risk.Profit is a reward for making good decisions.Keep in mind that cryptocurrency trading carries a high amount of risk, and you should always be prepared to lose money. Before investing in the cryptocurrency market, you should carefully assess your risk tolerance and financial goals.",

If you have patience, then investing in it will allow you to recoup your losses over time. Do not trust altcoins, and of course, use DCA. On one topic, it makes no sense to describe all the advantages of Bitcoin. The forum is all about learning, so be patient and slowly start reading step by step.What you lose in trading is a typical phenomenon for beginners who want to make a quick profit, but alas, trading is a very risky business.",

Sincerely, I have no idea how skilled you maybe in terms of trading, but I will state that you have lost money on numerous occasions because you don't good skills of trading. I may readily determine that you still require more knowledge and training in term of trading. Despite the fact that many traders always complain that trading is difficult due to the danger it entails, I think if someone has sufficient knowledge of trading and good abilities, he or she will be getting good profits from it and may not be facing many losses. However, I doubt anyone on this site can guarantee you that you will recovered your losses because there is no guarantee in the cryptocurrency sector. All I can say is that your knowledge is the foundation for assurance in the cryptocurrency industry.",

Trading means a good combination of knowledge, flair, luck and strong balls. Trading is not guaranteed to ensure winning / earning.This being said and from this post of yours, sadly, I would conclude that trading is not for you. But no worries, there are few who have all it needs for being successful traders. If you do have money you afford to lose (or at least have it locked for long time) you may consider just holding bitcoin for a number of years (5, maybe even 10, for a start). However, dyor and decide for yourself whether you want to spend or not.",

Trading is about experience in reading the market correctly and acting wisely at the correct time. For example when you are trading altcoins it is of utmost importance to know when to enter (buy the altcoin) and when to exit (dump the altcoin). In almost all cases where people lost money in altcoin market, they bought the coin but could never decide on when to dump it so they end up bag holding it and losing money in the process.Such experience is only acquired through lots of analysis of the market and figuring out what makes altcoins pump and when they get dumped.",

Always keep your emotions in check.Invest only what you can afford to lose.Always stick to a known strategy until you fully know how it works for you, then you can practice other strategies. Let's say we have about a dozen strategies and you don't know how to use them at all. Just go with one first, master that one until you know how it works, and then try the others, one after another. For example, if you try strategy A and think it's not working, then you jump to strategy B (Don't be like that). Be calm and learn any strategy you've got first.I would say you should not be too expectant of quick profit. Also, trade with a small amount until you know the number of successful trades you can make, then you can top up your capital because you will definitely be confident in your skill and have the possibility of making a profit in the trade you are going to open.Trade on a platform that is easier to use, not some kind of sophisticated platform. Â I hope it helps.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",
