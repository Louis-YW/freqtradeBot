  "content": "Many people asking the same Question -can i buy now...when is a good time to buy etc... so i may can help with thatThis is not a financial Advice just my personal oppinion:I recently found this (wish i would have found it at the beginning of this year i swear i would be rhich right now xD)Its called walltstreet cheat sheet and its telling you the future movement of BTC pretty exactly and many people just dont know about that thing take a look in the future of BTC:https://ibb.co/BZjJkf6as you can see BTC is doing actually almost exactly what it is supposed to do according to the cheat sheet. Right now we are close to the Dip between the double top after the \"ANGER\" Phase of the cheat sheet.Till this point (today) the BTC movement has an accuracy to the cheat sheet of at least 80% ore even higher. So get rdy to buy the dip coming in the next 1-3 Weeks followed by a heavenly high triggered by the Ripple lawsuit that will turn out with a win for Ripple building our the double top (with a higher peak). But as soon as people may have realised that even if Ripple would have won its lawsuit, nothing essentially would have changed besides that everything can stay like it was before, at least for the moment. Then the fall will begin, cause XRP will be massivly overbought in no time and this downfall will furthermore beeing supported by problems in the house of binance which is about to become a problemchild with all of its crimes. There will be expensive consequences that nobody exactly can tell now, but one thing i can say, if binance gets their ass kicked this will become expensive for all of us. And at least i think that the events around binance till the end of the year will lead to the depression prophesied by the cheat Sheet. But after this challenges are over, the way is free to enjoy the following BTC halving in 2024 what will trigger the next bullrun already prophesied by the cheat sheet.So when are good times to buy?Now? = Yes but only till XRP Lawsuit Peak is overAfter XRP Lawsuit victory while skyrocketing in 2-6 Weeks = NO, dont buy Highs!At the deepest point of the following depression when everybody thinks crypto dies..again... about oct-dec = YESJanuary 2024, halving year = NOW ore NEVER!Again this is no financial advice, just my personal strategy",

Now is when to buy it, but you might not want to commit all your money to buying it at once, so I advise that you DCA. We are near the big year (2024) gradually, but one thing is certain, no one knows the exact price that Bitcoin would be when the halving happens. This is why it's better to avoid risking carelessness and still avoid missing out foolishly. This is why I advise the DCAing approach, and this should be done every 2-3 months for effectiveness.After all with this approach, you would not miss much if the halving time meets Bitcoin at a low price, while you won't be regretting if halving meets it at a high price.",

Everyone who goes with the DCA doesn't even care what's going on and what will be. This can be another thing buying/accumulating more in the crisis situations as more than the regular times in DCA but fixing some base conditions to buy seems unfair because we know the potential and we also know its never late to be in the market so fearing what on buying when market is showing good rally. Try to avoid getting trapped into the timeframe choose DCA nad spend res of the life in crypto in peace",

The case of Ripple and Binance are mere speculations for now because nobody knows how it will play out. I just hope that the ftx issue will not reoccur this year. To reduce the effect these predictions, the dollar-cost average (DCA) investment style remains the best option. It helps one to use the profits from buying the deep to cover up the losses of buying high. It is great to also know that Bitcoin will still survive these problems and the bull run will certainly be next year. But for me, the best time to buy is now but gradually and consistently.",

Right now we are close to the Dip between the double top after the \"ANGER\" Phase of the cheat sheet.The price is more or less following the old patterns before the last halvings and is slowly recovering after bottoming out last year at under $15k, and everyone who followed those patterns has already filled their bags and has already made 100% profit. Others who, like you, analyze what will happen with some shitcoin or with some CEX will very likely regret the missed opportunities again, but it is a story that is constantly repeated, and I am not surprised that nothing has changed even today.",

My problem with DCA that i cannot use this strategy right now because i am building a house for my family which should have cost about 500k  but then corona came followed by the ukraine and now we are about to pay almost 800k. This forced me to sell off anything i had at the possible badest moment (january) while i had invested closely before the ftx desaster ^^ this situations cost me a lot of money and now i only have 3k bugs left to invest but still i cant say if i can loose them ore if i would need them becouse the house could possibly become any more expensive depending on what comes next ^^ but still i dont want to miss the Lawsuit and for the next month we will work with the money from the construction financing. So my thoughts are to stay invested in XRP for now till the lawsuit thing is over (so this is my \"term\" )  then sell the high and stay outside the line till the end of the year when our house should be finished and the way is free for the halving. Because i still think Binances crimes will force expensive consequences to the crypto space which have the possabilitys to couse new ATL even with a victory in the Ripple lawsuit.  so for long i think for me personally it would be nov-dec the best time to get in again after selling off the lawsuit event.",
