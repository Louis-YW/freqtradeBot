Someone will push a button and it will ignite to something much more powerful and controlling>? more centralized?People speculate a lot of nonsense about bitcoin and the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Is he a Russian spy? CIA? Japanese? Chinese? English? is Satoshi related to Pablo Escobar? It’s crazy! How can a decentralized network (blockchain) become centralized? Bitcoin source code is open source, everyone can see it, that’s makes it free from manipulation. QuoteBitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. Developers are improving the software but they can't force a change in the rules of the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software they use.

Bitcoin's origins are unknown to any country or region. China was among the first to utilize bitcoin following its creation. Even if the owner is Chinese, the protocol, which was built to be open source software, cannot be transformed into a centralized system with complete access to the government. That is simply an untenable assumption to consider. Bitcoin will always be decentralized.",

Maybe China will able to make their product control the world, but I think it is hard to be true if they can build the Bitcoin ecosystem from the beginning and make it great like today. They can't control Bitcoin if ecosystem mining can be done anywhere, and they are even leaning to banned Bitcoin which I think is impossible for China to control if they forbade themselves.",

Honestly I don't think this figure is correct.In the past, majority of Bitcoin miners concentrated and located their mining farms in China mainland. After China attack against Bitcoin mining, there was a big migration to other nations like the USA., Kazakhstan ... that contributed to make Bitcoin network more decentralized.Nowadays, China mainland does no longer have 60% of Bitcoin total hash rate. I am sure 60% is not a correct figure from China mainland.Mining MapWith a speedy growth of adoption, Bitcoin network will become more decentralized in future and Bitcoin distribution (in addresses) will become more decentralized too.Top 100 richest Bitcoin addresses.",

So there is literally no chance it was created by any government agency or organization.Why 60% adoption? why not 50? I don't even know how randomly you picked that number without any facts or assurance of being 60% and then the red button is pressed but it's very silly of yours.As SquirrelJulietGarden shared the Adoption curve, we are nowhere near the 60% adoption percentage however we are growing faster than ever. I recently made a similar post where someone said people are being negative and hating Bitcoin, I surely think it goes from person to person, and in your case, you think it's controlled by China which is another conspiracy theory episode that you can post on TikTok and get some views and brag about.Coming back to the topic, no, it's not owned by any organization, it's owned by people of planet Earth and it's very decentralized as per the blockchain data.",

Don't talk too much about things like this, where was bitcoin created, and who is actually satoshi, researching all of this is not really necessary, the most important thing is that with this bitcoin we must be able to use it properly and wisely, so that the world knows, what is the specialty of bitcoin .Do not speculate too much about things like this, because it will not produce any results. Especially associating bitcoin with China, because in my opinion, this is not a matter of which country, on which continent, and by how many people was created, but it would be nice if we should only be grateful, because when we grow up we come to know about this bitcoin. And don't ever try to dismantle the identity of a group or person (Satoshi Nakamoto), who has created a solution (bitcoin) from the mistakes of the financial system in this world.",

A longer longevity Bitcoin has, a more decentralization for its network.Even if China is where Bitcoin was created and where it had most of Bitcoin mining farms and hash rates. Today it is no longer true for China mainland as Bitcoin hash rate has been spread globally to more countries. It has become decentralized enough to avoid any shock from policy change in one or two countries. If one country bans Bitcoin mining, miners will migrate to other countries and continue their mining activities with only a few weeks of transition.",

So how can China ban a technology that originates from them, I think there would rather embrace and build every possibility possibilities that will enhance their control of Bitcoin if it originates from China, Satoshi's origin is far from being Chinese and even though Satoshi may be an acronyms name or code name but the aspect of Chinese involvement is just a baseless speculation.",

And what's with 60% adoption thing, I don't know if we can hit that goal I think not in the years to come, right now the estimate is that we are lower at 10% worldwide though I think there might come a surge of adoption but we don't know when, people just flock when crypto is in hype.

Some trolls in this forum even claim to be Satoshi, the claims of who is satoshi would never stop. Op you should have chosen a different country to link your assumption of Satoshi to, China is a dictatorial nation that likes to control their people, BTC is the opposite of that, and i don't believe a member of the CCP has a hand in creating a decentralized currency.",
