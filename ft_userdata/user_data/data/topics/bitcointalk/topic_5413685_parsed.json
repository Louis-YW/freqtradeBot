  "content": "Ethereum recently (actually today, Sept 15) upgraded its network from a Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to that of Proof of Stake (PoS) with promised improvements for the ecosystem. Here's my curated list of the top gainers from the Merge.1. The environment - The 'new and improved' Ethereum should consume 99.9% less energy than the previous system. 2. Network - The Merge guarantees more security, scalability and sustainability.3. Validators (Stakers) - ETH owners will be able to stake their coins while earning more.4. ETH Holders - Though there isn't any significant increase in ETH trading price, however, successful completion of Ethereum Merge is a stepping stone towards other planned upgrades. These upgrades may lead to increase in ETH price in the near future.",

Quote from: genny2kuk on September 15, 2022, 01:45:20 PM2. Network - The Merge guarantees more security, scalability and sustainability.Lesser decentralization. Thats what we have now. More scalability and sustanability will be introduced in next updates (sharding) if ETH will deliver it.Quote from: genny2kuk on September 15, 2022, 01:45:20 PM4. ETH Holders - Though there isn't any significant increase in ETH trading price, however, successful completion of Ethereum Merge is a stepping stone towards other planned upgrades. These upgrades may lead to increase in ETH price in the near future. There is not significant increase because we are in \"sell the facts\" stage which will dominate next days/weeks as long as whole market wont go up like crazy. Increased value (if it was in fact increased) will work in long term (months/years).",

There is a fact that proof of stake will less the energy consumption by the ethereum holders and aside from this I don't see much advantage the merge has over proof of work and if we must view it closely the proof of stake favors the big bag holder who can afford to lock their funds in the staking pool for a long time and giving them the power to control the network.",

PoS is healthier compared to PoW in this case, so we can not conclude anything yet at least for now. There is pro and con, but I believe it is an upgrade instead of a downgrade.They won't postpone it for years if they do not have a proper reason to do it.",

Yeah, I believed that the hype on the merge have been price in, when the price of ETH almost reach $2k, around $1,900 and then there are speculators who spread the news that it might hit $2100-$2200 on the actual merge but it didn't happen because of the CPI.In the long run the biggest gainers will be the one who are going to used the used the Network. If the number of users and investors are going to grow in the next couple of years, then this merge could be consider as a success. And as others said, the whales and manipulators, Lol, since they are going to stake that much ETH, they will have the control of the network.",

In addition to the above mentioned, i sincerely hope this merge will somehow reduce the transaction fee to the lowest level as we have in other networks.This has been discussed already, the merge can’t solve the higher fees because this update is for the mining so it will become more friendly and less in energy consumption. Maybe on their next update ETH will address that issue but I think this is not their focus yet. The biggest gainers are those who are able to take profit, holding is not good especially if you bought at the top and currently trap on its current price. Let’s hope that ETH merge will bring more good updates in the platform, this is just the beginning for sure.",

Right now, I just hope that the network is still secured and there won't be flaws caught out with this transition.How I wish that I was one of the people who holds a lot of ETH.",

You forgot the biggest winner which is bitcoin, the biggest competitor bitcoin had was ethereum, but now the ethereum developers decided to actually go through the merge and become a POS coin, so bitcoin has basically no competitors now.Now this does not mean that I think the price of ethereum will collapse overnight or anything like that, however this change gives too much power to the ethereum whales to do whatever they want, and it's a mistake to think they will take any action which will go against their own interests, as in many occasions those interests will run contrary to the interests of the average ethereum user.",

Yet what happened is the total opposite. Though the event is really a great advance for ethereum as it being improved on PoS. Theres a lot of miners who are probably clueless what to do on either staked their stash or sold eth and focus on another coin to mine to avoid the lack of use of their mining equipments.",
