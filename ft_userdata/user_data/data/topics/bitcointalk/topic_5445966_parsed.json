  "content": "Sometimes I wonder if one of my computer science teacher might be Satoshi Nakamoto.1. One time, one sentence he said to me, which always ghosted through my brain:\"Would it not be fantastic if all information in an information system could be kept forever/always ?!\" (Something like that)(He looked at me like he really wanted to have my oppinion... and he was unsure of himself... I cannot really remember my answer or reaction, I think I just stayed silent and was a little bit amazed and surprised by this statement/question/action... he also bent around me and looked me really hard in the face with a bent head... like he really wanted to have some kind of answer or something. Personally I was probably thinking something like: \"This guy is completely crazy, talks weird... looks weird/funny... hard to understand... the harddisk would just get full... it's probably a stupid idea... but then again maybe it would be nice... but why would you want this ?! They guy didn't seem to be making much sense to me... at the time... I think my silence and slight rejection of him... just made him a bit frustrated or something lol... wtf was he talking about lol.)2. Plus he was also a foreigner looking person, chinese or japanese, was very hard to understand ! LOL.3. He did design computer system for a library... so he a software architect and/or programmer... and/or database specialist.Strange isn't it ?!(Unfortunately I am not very good with names...) I might still have some documentation that might have his name on it, but the chance is kinda slim and I don't want to bother searching it for now in one of my old boxes... but if you must know here is some information on him:Country: The NetherlandsSouth part of the country, limburg/Heerlen, IT studies Heerlen.Now you have something to go on !",

I asked my dog and he said you have some good evidence. He is going to investigate your claims right after he is done chasing the neighbor's cat.",

It would have been given a benefit of doubt if you attach the said paper but still how sure are we that everything is not fabricated? LolBy the way, if it was Satoshi, congratulations for having an encounter with a brainboss. It actually change nothing thou.",

Lol this is grand. Because your IT professor stated that it would be great to have all information in a system kept forever you think he is Satoshi. Lmfao that's called the internet and doesn't even remotely come close to anywhere near a lead to Satoshi Nakamoto. You are too nieave my friend, but it is a wonderful fantasy you have. This is more so wishful thinking.",
