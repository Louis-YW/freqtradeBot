Chinese poker and Stud games would be interesting, and maybe they would add other variation with tricks like leaderboards and rewards. Maybe adding KYC would be better to still ensure the security of both the casino and the players involved. Overall, this simply means that more players will get on board and hoping that the casino can accommodate all the players, with all their withdraws ,deposits, queries, and customer support.",

But in any case, I believe there are a lot of poker players in this forum who will be happy about this update.Stake is a reputable casino and bookie, and can handle large amount of deposits and withdrawals without a problem. You won't question their capability of handling this type of game. And you are confident that they won't screw you.So let's wait and see when will this game will be open and what perks are waiting for poker gamers.",

It would be better to have poker as their own developed game. Stake have resources, fund and everything they need to grow too. I don't think they are going to bring 3rd party software. I'm excited to see something cool.I'm a huge fan of board games, it would be huge if they launch.Quote from: mitchr4 on May 21, 2023, 11:53:37 AMIt would be great if that happened.

Maybe betnomi has it too but I haven't played there though I once was planning to participate in a tournament here but due to my time schedule, I couldn't.",

And probably even more important almost all time zones can find interesting games at any time of the day in fiat places, with crypto we need to catch \"the right time of the day\" if we want to see some action.Well, the Stake is big, and I guess they can come out with something big... but what will they do we will see.",

Might even see this as a gateway to get into the big leagues considering how massive the influence of Stake is in the sports industry from the outside, evident from their numerous partnerships and how they don't spare costs in making sure that their customers are receiving the best of service in this industry. With more and more sites closing out on Poker and the game being a little hard to find and play with nowadays, this will really push users into switching to Stake, real smart move if i do say so myself. Hopefully they put their own twist to this game and offer users a genuine and unique stake.com experience.",

There are other sites out there as well, I just cannot remember their names. The only thing that people may or may not like is most of these sites accept crypto for deposits and convert to usd balance, but they also allow crypto withdrawals.As far as stake offering poker, it's never a bad thing to have more options. They have a super large player base and will probably do great with starting poker. I wonder of they m ay be interested in hosting a bitcointalk series?",

I've only tried pokerstars for now and i didn't like the user experience in there so much. I am betting stake will build a better one. I also kinda hope that they will start to host big world tournaments, as they would have gravitas to do that and casino infrastructure for money would be in place already. All they need is as sleek user experience as they have in the casino and i guarantee that people from other poker sites would come running.",
