  "content": "Latest news from Palestine, Israel and the Gaza strip: Hamas fighters attacked Israeli territories, towns and even captured a military base with all the armored vehicles and arms. Hamas fired more than 2200 missiles and the legendary Iron Dome failed to protect Israel with many missiles getting through and exploding in the streets. Lots of people were kidnapped, some executed. The US seems to take the Israeli side of the conflict, whereas Russia seems to support Hamas.   Will this (re)emerging conflict fuel a new war and worsen the global economic situation?",

The country is full of Siren sounds and the attack is a complete surprise for the Israeli security forces. Hamas had purposely started the fight and entered the Gaza Israel border. There is no sign of peace as the Hamas Military commander have called Palestinians to launch attack. For some time period the people of the countries were leading peaceful life and once again it had started and the impact can soon be seen on the whole will worsen the crisis.",

The added pressure of another war will more likely force the Fed to lower rates and the Government to begin issuing stimulus in order to keep this from sending us into a deep recession. Fighting a war on two fronts is going to really put our currency to the test. In other words, we are so screwed, but war spending will allow us to kick the can further down the road again.",

Maybe this will have an impact on the global economy. Because until now the conflict between Israel and Palestine has not reached the stage of total war. So there is no significant impact from the feud between the two countries. Because Israel's colonization of Palestine was carried out very slowly and did not immediately colonize Palestine completely. I don't know what the reason is, but what is certain is that there is something we don't know about this. Because if you look at the military strength that Israel has and compare it with the military strength that Palestine has, the difference in military strength between the two countries is very large.Year 2023Quote18 Israel 0.2757Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.detik.com/sulsel/berita/d-6503707/100-ranking-militer-dunia-2023-indonesia-urutan-berapa/ampIt be seen that Israel military strength is currently ranked 18th in the world.So in essence, if you look at its military strength, Israel can actually control the Palestinian state in total. The reason is that the military strength possessed by Palestine is not comparable to that of Israel. But perhaps for some reason Israel did not do that.And the conclusion that I can draw from the Israeli and Palestinian conflict is that it can indeed affect the state of the global economy. However, this depends on the scale of the war taking place in the two countries.",

It's just making a lot of noise in the media because over the past 24 hours, it has been the Palestinian resistance that is hitting back and not the terrorist organization commonly known as Israel.For example if you search the entire Western or Russian media you will not find anything regarding the IDF terrorist raiding the Al-Aqsa Mosque 48+ hours ago, brutally beat the women praying there, rip off their cloths assaulting them.

If I'm not mistaken, there was even an official statement by the US military. Ukraine and Zelensky also commented on this, saying something like \"Israel has a right to defend itself\".As to Russia's support of Hamas, I haven't seen any official statements by the Kremlin so far and I have limited access to Russian media but some sources claim that Russians are ridiculing Israel's defensive efforts and are happy to distract US's attention from Ukraine.

Iran-backed Hamas seems to get more support from Russia for political reasons.Russia does not support Hamas, although it does not classify it as a terrorist organization and considers the leaders of its political wing to be legitimate partners for negotiations (at the same time, the Muslim Brotherhood, from which Hamas spun off in 1987, is considered a terrorist organization in Russia). It can be assumed that Russia's sympathies are on the side of the Palestinian people, but there is no need to draw far-reaching political conclusions from this. Russia is a multinational secular state and any radical religious manifestations are unacceptable for it.",

This war will hinder the production and distribution of these goods which will lead to an increase in price. The economy of trading partners of both Israel and Palestine will be negatively affected. This war will also lead to mass refugee crises leading to mass immigration. The economy of neighboring countries will be affected because of pressure on basic infrastructure and an increase in government spending. Allies of both parties will have to use money that would have been invested in key sectors to sponsor this war, which will lead to slow global economic growth. We can't also quantify the loss of human resources. Skilled people that would have contributed to global economy might die or become disabled due to life-threatening injuries.

Iran-backed Hamas seems to get more support from Russia for political reasons.There are some speculations that Hamas wouldn't have carried out this kind of successful assault without external support. Some political analysts believe Russia might be one of the backers of Hamas. They are assuming that with a war in Israel, US and NATO's attention will be divided meaning that Ukraine will not get the needed support. It's normal to see your enemy suffer defeat, it is not strange to see Russia mock Israel.",
