It is taxfree if you win anything below ~$1200 but if you win more than that, you'll have to pay a 20% tax to the government on that winning. I don't think it is any different in any country. Unless it is one of those countries that don't tax income, you'll get taxed whenever you make money from anything. It doesn't matter how you make your money. Whether it is from trading, working, collecting rents or dividends, gambling... they tax them all. They even tax bank interest which is under the inflation rate. You already get buttfucked for putting your money in a bank and they still tax it. Fuck them greedy bitchez.",

Â  Just kidding. Well, here in our country there's always the 20 percent tax for lottery winners, especially the jackpot prize. I haven't checked about the other prizes such as 5 numbers or 4 numbers but I doubt they are cutting some taxes on them. I played in a poker room before and they have the same rule. 20 percent is being cut from the pot prize of the tournament. I got used to it back when I was playing there and I like they are announcing how much the total prize is, it is the exact amount that you will receive because they already took their cut from it. That's better in my opinion because you won't feel mad about how much money is gone just because of the damn taxation.",

Seems enjoyed with Australian gambler because they don't have to pay taxes fees for government when winning in gambling platform, but the gambling platform is legal or illegal website there?Some countries not legal with gambling platform and banned all website have connected with gambling, seems if countries not allowed with gambling not have to pay taxes yet but little difficult with IP access have to use VPN.",

However, it is important to acknowledge that all gambling winnings are subject to taxation, and the specific amount owed depends on the type of gambling activity and the total amount won.As far as I know, if an individual's gambling winnings are below PHP 10,000, they will be required to pay a 10% tax on the earnings, and 20% if however, their gambling winnings exceed PHP 10,000. It's worth noting that if an individual wins at a casino, the operator is responsible for reporting the winnings to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). However, it's unclear what the tax implications are for winnings obtained from offshore casinos.It's important to mention that small-scale gambling games commonly found in local neighborhoods are exempt from taxes. These include raffles, small-scale lucky draws, and bingo or any other gambling games that can be found on the streets.If there are any instances of tax evasion, it is likely due to the law not being restrictive enough.",
