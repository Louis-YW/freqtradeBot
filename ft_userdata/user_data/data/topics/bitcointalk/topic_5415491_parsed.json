If you have a bad s19 control board you must replace it with a control board which only use for s19, not for the s17 control board. Take note if you have a fake SD card with fake volume the firmware that you are trying to flash is always corrupted so better use an authentic SD card Samsung or Sandisk.",

If not then your network might have conflict IP sometimes Bitmain send units with duplicate mac address if you can able to replace the mac address it might fix your issue.",
