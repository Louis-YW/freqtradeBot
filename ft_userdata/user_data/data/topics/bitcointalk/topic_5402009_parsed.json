But other terms in online gambling is very different though and as I have said, you really have to play and experience it before understand them.",

But let say you are s smart gambler and the first time you wanted to try online gambling, then you will want to know how fair they are. So you will do and research it yourself, read their terms and conditions and maybe see this one or two terms under. And with that, it might be different for every individuals. Maybe in just one try and user experience they will have the grasp of it. But for the majority maybe it will take sometime to be familiarized with these jargons.",

      "body": "There are different terms and jargons that are used in gambling. Perhaps the latest gambling technical terms that I learned are those associated with sports betting like parlay and others. I learned them many years ago when I started sports betting online. Prior to that, I do sports betting only with individuals, person to person in other words. On the other hand, there are also other gambling terms which I learned much later than the game itself. For example, I learned and play poker much earlier than I learned the terms such as turn or river or rainbow or ante. Before, I just knew the mechanics and the game without really knowing the jargons.",

But from my experience alone, I have yet to encounter a term that is of its first kind.",

Granted I only played a few times each day, but it naturally came to me while playing. Never really tried looking for the jargon themselves and studying it though, cause if I did, it probably wouldn't even take that long. Now as for terms like \"martingale\" which is a strategy or a pattern to use, or any other term outside of specific games, then that took much longer since I did not even realize it exists in the first place. I used it unknowingly at one point even. Though tbf, only jargon for specific games is rather important. Outside of those? Not really.",

The best way to learn them all quickly would be to study statistics applied to games of chance, which in turn would help you understand much better how they work.Quote from: Darker45 on June 10, 2022, 01:08:19 AMOn the other hand, there are also other gambling terms which I learned much later than the game itself.
