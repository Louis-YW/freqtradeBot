      "body": "If you've got a good strategy behind it then it's not a bad idea. Flash crashes can cause problems though if you're poorly collateralised but if you understand what you're doing pretty well you can weather it (also being over 40% debt to assets is definitely a bad thing but still bad if you're investing the extra funds elsewhere).The additional problem with doing this is holding the borrowed coins in a way they're protected and can still be used. You're just throwing money away if you don't have instant access to them and a crash occurs.Fully collateralised defi alternatives are a great investment. Defi alternatives that aren't collateralised well are probably worse than exchanges - look at what's happened to Luna.If you've not got a good (and RELIABLE) investment lined up for the money or don't need the cash then it's probably a bad idea.",

      "body": "Personally, I don't think so. I'm generally not a fan of borrowing whether in crypto or outside of it. But I guess it matters why you will borrow. I mean, the reason for borrowing. If you're unbanked or you have a hard time borrowing outside crypto and you badly need to get a loan, then crypto lending platforms are options. But if you're borrowing for the sake of borrowing or for the sake of something else not really urgent, I'd advise you not to do it. You're only courting risk. Instead, value your Bitcoin and keep it where you have your private keys.For one, crypto is volatile. Your collateral could be liquidated while you're asleep. If you're lucky, you only need to add more collateral to be able to avoid liquidation. Secondly, how much of your collateral's value could you borrow? 50%? 60%? Not worth it. Third, take a look at the history of lending platforms; they're falling one by one. They're generally irresponsible. Finally, forget about the word decentralized. 99.99% of them are actually anything but decentralized.",

If it were to be an investment where a higher level of profit can be controlled by the borrower it will be a nice idea but going for a risky asset with loaned funds is a big risk that will reck both the lender and the borrower sake of impatience and volatility.",

Personally I never use loan for investments because I only invest money that I can afford to lose. I know it's a cliche but it's a cliche for a reason. If you invest borrowed money and lose it, how will you repay your loan? And if you invest money that you can afford to lose, it won't be that big of a deal. Imagine if you borrowed money and invested into FTT a week ago. How would you repay your loan now when it crashed? And I'm not talking about some low cap shitcoin.

Many professional traders is borrowing money so that they can increase there capital with just using there same amount of money as collateral.Simply you are just using the money of none risky trader for your aggresive trader to earn more and you just paid them back when you profit or loss same small amount when your trade didn't turn as you planned but atleast your loss is small but your profitability is high that time.",
