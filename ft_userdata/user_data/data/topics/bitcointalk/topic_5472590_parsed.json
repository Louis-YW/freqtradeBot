If it is like that and they are relying on gambling, gambling sites that they are using will be very happy because they will make more money from them. I guess that most people that will be gambling among the 32% will be 80 to 95% men.Gambling should be for fun, not a way of making money.",

Well, I tell you, this pecentage is too high considering some of the 225m population are minors or kids, or women, which the rate of gamblers is really high.

Nigerians are always looking for alternative means to survive the hardship in the country so if they resort to gambling as a source of income,I am not surprised because the economic situation of the country is not encouraging so one would need to improvise just to survive.",

This is not only the case to Nigeria but literally to most 3rd world country that has a national lottery. I never bet on a lotto but I won’t blame them on spending money on it since you will never know when luck will comes to you while the betting amount is very affordable.Quote from: knowngunman on November 02, 2023, 03:23:37 PMBut, I think we need to know how much betting sites are paying out daily too, so we can make comparison.  Regardless of the exact amount, They will always win due to house edge.",

However, I have noticed that gambling seems to be somehow embedded with the Nigerian culture or something like it. I do not have any Nigerian friends myself, so I cannot be sure, but it would seem to be that way, that gambling and betting has turned into such an important part of Nigerian culture to the point of that high percentage of it's population engaging on it.It would be preferred if those going through difficult times did not gamble at all, but realistically, there is no much casinos or the government can do without a serious and we'll funded program.",

Many Nigerians are hardworking and strong and can do low-paying jobs to survive. They only see gambling as an alternative source of income. The harsh economic conditions are forcing many people to put more money into gambling hoping that they can get some financial benefits. I don't think any data shows how much Nigerians have won or cashed out from gambling. But have seen news outlets reporting how some gamblers won big. I am sure many people are benefiting from gambling because they would have stopped betting if it was not beneficial.",

Because after all, our position in gambling is as players, not as business owners or share owners in certain casinos. And I emphasize again that our position as players is that when we want to play we have to deposit a certain amount of money so that we can get pleasure from gambling, not profit.However, it is desperation that makes them behave in this way and spend some of the money they have to try their luck at gambling in the hope that they will get a big win that can change their financial situation. The increasingly difficult economic situation, increasingly narrow job opportunities, increasingly tight market competition and ever-increasing needs, this is what requires them to have as much money as possible to be able to answer all existing needs and problems. However, they are careless, instead of increasing their efforts to change the situation, they prefer to do stupid things by continuing to wait for a big win in gambling that will change their life.",

Because the country consists of both the rich and the poor. Not everyone is extremely poor in Nigeria. So, they'll be able to have fun playing games. It's just like checking how much Nigerians also spend on hotels and wines. You'd see that a high amount is also spent everyday. The government generates lots of money in Nigeria. Only people who don't know how big gambling is worldwide would doubt such digits. I won't doubt it, since the population is enough to spend such an amount. Many of them play games with vendors and they get paid. So far the person wins the game. Hence, if the numbers are real, it's still based on estimation. It's not realistic to say that they need gambling to survive in the country. That means the person won't survive. Since gambling has never been made for people to make lots of money. Most of them won't be able to meet up with daily expenses and food as well. Economic crisis doesn't mean markets won't sell and traders making profits. These traders also bet while in the market. You'd see that gambling is quite large in Nigeria with high volume of profits for vendors and bookmakers.

Millions of Nigerians according to WHO live in extreme poverty. Such people need not try gambling. It doesn't occur to them that such things exist. As for the resources the Niger Delta part of Nigeria are still fighting for amnesty for the bad effects the oil business has on agriculture. These people depend on fish farming to survive. But, Oil ports and rigs have destroyed their fishing businesses. With the government feeling reluctant about it. The whole oil producing states still live in poverty. Minimal developments. Such people with their stipends, will easily try luck on gambling, things may get better along the line.",
