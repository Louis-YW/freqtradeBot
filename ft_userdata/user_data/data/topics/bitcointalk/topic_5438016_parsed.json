Usually they get banned / nuked when they are posting things like that but users on the list that hosseinimr93 posted are all still here?Or is it more the altcoin sections that bans for malware wallets are quick.Reported to github. Looks like this is the new whack a mole.-Dave",

I thought they haven't been banned, because that's not recorded neither on modlog nor BPIP. nemruth and Atrain622 made post on February 2. Since modlog keeps the data for the past 7 days, their ban should be shown on modlog. It's weird that modlog doesn't show that.",

I have reported it.Reported Done, dudeI hope the GitHub teams will review my report and ban the publisher's account as soon as possible.It is good that most of the accounts of these scammers have been banned from the forum, and I hope that members will not stop reporting their topics if they create new accounts.They created this wallet that contains Malware to target and hack the accounts of Bitcointalk members and their devices and steal their wallets, so in my experience, doing a system scan through an antivirus program for the device of someone who downloaded this wallet is useless. He must disconnect the Internet immediately, install a new Windows system, and download a program to freeze the system.",
