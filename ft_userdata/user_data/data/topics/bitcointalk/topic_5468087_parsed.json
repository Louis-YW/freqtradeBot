Good for you if you do able to make $80 in just two days or something that 80% gain in 2 days isnt something that majority could really be able to do so or gain but doesnt mean that its impossible within this marketon which as long you do able to know on how to play with those moving prices then you could really be able to take advantage with the volatility and this is what makes interesting specially to those who do really knows on how to play with the volatility. Just bare in mind or just remember that making  yourself that confident would really be bad. Always stick with those risks management of yours and trying out to enhanceand make that capital to be bigger so that in later on then you could really make out some adjustments in every trading position or order you would be making on which if you do find yourselfthat already self sustaining then it could really be changing up your life forever.Just remember that this market is unpredictable and expect those unexpected things to happen along the way because not everyday this market looks good or fine.You would soon be able to encounter those movements which it isnt really that correlating neither with TA or FA.This is why you should be attentive and would really be that careful.",

We usually feel good when we make a profit on any investment we make, and the same is true in bitcoin trading, where many lose money when they are unlucky or lack adequate background knowledge. I want you to understand that trading involves experience and in-depth information, and that luck is frequently a factor.

I don’t know if this is your first trade ever or the first trade that you have ever made profit from since you’ve been trading but if the former is the case then I’d advice that you take your time to learn more about trading because most times beginners luck could kick in and then we’ll start having the mindset that we are now good at trading,,, don’t fall for that just take your time learn how to read and predict market trends that way you’ll be able to make more from trading.

But you must accept some risk before you start trading, since you can earn $80 in two days trading, which can make you greedy later on. Of course, it is very pleasant for you as the best earnings of your life, but you must be careful that you can lose your money if you trade again without understanding. But you said, maybe even a government employee can't earn this much as you have earned by trading for two days. But you have to note that trading is basically risky and most likely to lose money, if you seriously understand the market first. Of course, if you can visit the market well, you will definitely be able to make more profit, and you will be successful in the future, so you should know everything well in advance. If you start trading in Bitcoin you must have an understanding of market volatility, you need to gain enough knowledge about when trading will be profitable so that you never face losses.",
