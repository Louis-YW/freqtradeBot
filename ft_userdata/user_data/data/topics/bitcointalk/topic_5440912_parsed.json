How about a peeled coin?ThanksI do the same in the past by peeling coin when Bitcoin at peak price around 60K rather than sell it because you will need to wait for the courier to arrive that sometimes took months if overseas that result to long waiting especially if you need the cash badly. I just sold the peeled coin to @minerjones to recover some of premium cost when I purchased but still worth since the price of Bitcoin now is almost just1/3 of the amount I get when I peeled it.I suggest to use @minerjones as an escrow or a shipping forwarder to guarantee safety of your coin. He made a lot of successful deals involving this kind of coin.",
