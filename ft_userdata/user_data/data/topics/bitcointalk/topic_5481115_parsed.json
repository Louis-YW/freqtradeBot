According to the article you shared the link, it's said they have listed the sport ETF tokens and it's ready to resume trade tomorrow, but this could only be possible if the SEC can give their final take on the ETF approval until it has been made official by the SEC (which I believe there is a higher possibility of it happening). It's not yet good to say it's been approved. They listed the ETF tokens just as exchanges add token tickers to their exchanges and wait for the right time for them to officially kickstart the trade, so for the time being, it's not yet approved by the SEC.",

It should be noted that ETFs can enable artificial creation of Bitcoin supply by the fund manager. No proof of underlying asset = paper bitcoin. I'm not bullish on this news for that reason...Trust units vs. ETFsAccording to the screenshot it doesn't say anything about ETFs, rather commodity-based trust units and an instrument that has ETF in the name, but that is a trust unit.Quote from: OgNasty on January 10, 2024, 09:11:10 PMThe ETF has in fact been approved as of about 20 minutes ago.  Impressive that we have come so far.  When I got into Bitcoin you would have been laughed at for suggesting that such a thing could even be possible down the road.  People had timelines of 2050 and a price of a couple grand as possibilities.  Everyone has been impressed with how strong our movement is.  In a lot of ways, this is the end game for what people thought was possible for BTC.  Next up, more countries adoption Bitcoin as their currency.Can you please provide a source link as nothing in this thread clearly says that Vaneck, Black rock, JPM, etc. Applications have been approved.",

There are no more rumors anymore as SEC has finally approved bitcoin ETF, and we’ll expect that after this approval, we will start to see bitcoin price to surge higher in preparation for bitcoin halving.However, bitcoin price drops is still possible to happen but instead of dealing on it negatively, I think it’s also a smart move for us to accumulate more bitcoin so we can gain maximum profits when bitcoin bull run is already happening.",
