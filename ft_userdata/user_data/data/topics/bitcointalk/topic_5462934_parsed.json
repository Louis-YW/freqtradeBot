  "content": "You are free to ask questions here as a newbie. We are going to give you answers to your questions.1. Obey the forum and local board rulesUnofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQUnofficial General Guidelines For Posting( Na de koko dem)2. Merit, activity, rank, position and badgesMerit and activity FAQ: Everything you need to know about forum 'activity, account ranks and meritForum ranks/positions/badges (What do those shiny coins under my name mean?)3. Staking of bitcoin addressAs you have already registered on this forum, it is good to stake you bitcoin address. You can do that here: Stake your Bitcoin address hereStaking of your bitcoin address is used to claim the owner of a bitcoin address. It is good to stake it on this forum because if your Bitcointalk account is compromised or hacked, it can be used to recover back your Bitcointalk account. You can not use an exchange address or a centralized platform address for staking because private key is used to generate the digital signature. You need a noncustodial wallet for it.Recommended wallets for stakingBitcoin CoreElectrumBluewalletSparrowWhat you will stake are:your bitcoin addressyour message (you can write anything you like, like your name but including the date you are signing it)and the digital signatureYou can stake your address to prove the ownership of your Bitcointalk account which can be important during Bitcointalk account recovery, borrowing of money, trading and changing of address in a signature campaign.4. The use of the forum search engine for local boardFor Google search:For people that will prefer google search, you can use this for the search:Code:<topic title> Nigeria (Naija) - Bitcointalk</topic title>For forum search:At the left upper corner of this forum is a search space which you can use to search for topics. You can search for topics to know if the topic is already existing on this forum, to learn from the topic and the whole thread or to avoid thread duplication. But this is more about local board and I will be more specific to let you know how to know the threads that are existing on this local board which is the second forum search engine that you will see at the upper right corner on this forum which is beside 'home', 'help' or 'profile', 'my messages ' that are all written within blue color. Click on the search -> write the topic you are searching for 'on search for'. At the down part, click on 'choose a board to search in, or search all' after you uncheck 'check all'. Look for Nigeria (Naija) and check ✔️ it and scroll down to click on search.             Before posting any topic or creating a new thread, you can use the search engines to know if there are existing topics already. You can use it to learn from existing topics as well.Searching if recent occurrence has been created on local board, to avoid duplicating topic Important info: [Guide] Searching effectively5. Ninjastic.spaceNinjastic.space - BitcoinTalk Post/Address archive + APIhttps://ninjastic.spaceThe main reason I included this is because many forum members said it can be used as a better search engine. All you have to do is to go to the website, click on the menu at the upper left corner, click on posts and search for the topic or post that you want to search for.Ninjastic.space has many other functions. It is good for looking for deleted posts, checking of users bitcoin wallet or altcoin wallet addresses posted on this forum, even if it has been deleted. It can also be used to look for user's posts on the boards the user is very active, this can be done through the user ID. It has other functions and worth visiting.6. Signature and AvatarTo add signature, click on your profile -> forum profile information at the left side -> you will see a big space to paste the signature code that you copied. To add avatar, at the upper part of the big space to input your signature code, click on 'go here' to upload your avatar.To add avatar, you must be a full member. Any rank below full member can not wear an avatar.

Notifications, of new topics, replies, mentions and meritsReplies in this regard means any other posts aside topics. For the forum's notification, the notifications are sent to the email you used to register on this forum.Notification of new topicThis forum has notification for topics and replies. If you want to be notified of new topic on a particular board, go to the board, you will see 'notify' beside 'new topic'. I am referring to new topic which you can click on to create and post a topic. Click on notify. With this, you will be notified of new topic that is posted on that board. The notification will be sent to your email.Note: If you do not visit a new topic that you have been notified on a particular board through the email, you will no longer get notifications on the board until you visit the board.Notification of new replyOn the thread you want to be notified of new replies, you will see 'notify' beside 'reply' (the reply you can click on to make new post), click on it (I mean click on 'notify' that is beside 'reply'. But ones you have been notified of the next post and you do not visit the thread, you will no longer get notification of other replies on the thread until you visit the thread again, but I think that is good because it will not create disturbance.Ninjastic Telegram bot notification of topics, merits, mentions and repliesIf you want to be notified of merits and mentions, this will be very helpful. You can also use it to track a thread, but the notifications may be disturbing if you track a thread with it because as people are posting on the thread, you will be getting the notification of each single post.Ninjastic telegram bot can now be used for notification of topics.[TELEGRAM] Yet Another BitcoinTalk Notification BOT (merits, mentions, topics,+)https://t.me/BTTSuperNotifier_botLoyceV notifications of mentions and following of users:The first link will be about notification of mentions.

Readers are leaders. If you learn, you are investing. Learning is an asset.If I should use myself as an example.I took time to first learn how people that are merited are posting. I followed what some of them are posting. With that, I learned a lot. But I wanted to know more about bitcoin at the time and earn more knowledge about it and to know ways to avoid online scam and hacks. I searched online about how to avoid online scam and hacks which were some of my first topics on this forum. Just take it slow, read from what established members are posting and follow them very well will help you.Some people on this local board are earning merit. Look at their posts too (with the English boards) and you will understand better. Making posts useful, informative and educating will help to ranking up. Do not come for money, come for knowledge and you will be surprised.",

And secondly, read more than posting on the forum, and then learn to study how those post who get the most merit are been structured, so as to apply same to gain merits too. Quote from: Agbe on August 12, 2023, 10:57:37 PMThe forum search engine in some time e no dey give what you dey look for so in most time I dey Google search engine and if I dey find someone from Google about the forum I dey use the format, on the google search box, type the following Code:Useful information for Nigerian newbies in Bitcointalk.org and anyone who has written concerning this topic go come out and you go select the one you dey find, although the author name e no dey come out so you go click dem to find the particular one you dey find.For me, I think the forum search engine can best be used for fine if a thread is already in existence on the forum, why for a broader aspects about how to fine x, y, z about the forum, then Google is a better tool for that, such as;  How to post image on Bitcointalk forum & e.t.c",

Use the forum search engine instead, 'change it from match all words' to 'match any words'. The message age should be between 0 to 1 day (or 2 days) for the obvious reason I pointed to already, and check ✔️ only Nigeria and search.This is what you will see with maybe few other suggestions:Mate2237 topic is the second while yours is the first. Supposing you have not created the topic, you would have seen Mate2237 topic on top instead.This applies to topics created not long because the longer the days the topic is created, the greater the inaccuracy and inability to see what you are looking for.Edit:Alternatively, you can check the topics created recently on the first page of the local board and you can easily know if similar topic has been created or not.",
