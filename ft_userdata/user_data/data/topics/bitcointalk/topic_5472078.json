As we dey talk, na e con show meÂ  one miner like dat wey e dey mine for over 7 months now. d miner dey mine eth and talk say until e don mine reach 0.005 eth before e go fit withdraw d coins go wallet. e show me say miner don finally reach d specific amount but when e con dey try withdraw, Dem con dey tell am to deposit 0.005 eth first before e go fit withdraw any money from d Website. as I see dis wan, I just smile because even him self know say na scam. dis one con make me remember say back in days, there were many off these free miners wey still dey pay person. but now na scammers na come dey run all off them. how you go pay 0.005eth take withdrawal 0.005 eth. it's obviously a scam attempt any one wey mumu try pay money give such website, e money don go.

      "body": "Me I know plenty people wey dey mine all these free token them but the thing no move me for body at all at all. Not only say majority of them na scam, they are pure waste of time. The people wey manage collect small money na like once in five years, the money self no reach anything. If you consider the time you dey spend, the data you use, the memory space of your phone or laptop and the risk you dey exposure yourself to connecting your system to those networks or downloading and installing some of those softwares, it will become clear say na direct waste of time. As me I no dey do am, I no fit advice anybody to put body for that thing.... e no worth am walahi talahi",

      "body": "To get that free money na big wahala for internet ooo, unless someone is just lucky, especially in the cryptocurrency section, because it is the cryptocurrency industry, a lot of scammers are facing this day's to scam people. Make person just imagine what happened to your friend for mining coins for a long period of time after all the stress it discovered say na scam things.what a pity life. I never mined coins before, but there are some people that mined some years ago who say it pays them, but nowadays scams target the portion that is an easy way to attract a lot of people who are looking for free money. The funniest part that will pain person pass is the time wasted on it. Nowadays, if someone wants to involve itself in any airdrop or mining stuff, they need to be very careful; if not, they will scam them. So with this kind of stuff playing around in the cryptocurrency industry, we newbies have to be very careful not to involve ourselves in finding easy money.",

      "body": "Na true say no free money for internet, but on some how, some lucky people still dey see free money collect from time to time.But anyway, no be that one make us dey discuss this Sha, so make I bone that side.Let me say that 99.99 percent of all this mining stuff are nothing but either a scam waiting to happen, or a ponzi scheme that will eventually crash when new people stop joining and new fresh money stops entering their system so they can use and pay the old members. We must always be vigilant and try as much as possible to avoid such platform because the chances of getting money out of such a platform is always slim, most especially for those joining late if the site is a ponzi scheme, like the one reigning in my area now, they call it Argo, I just dey pity people wey dey put money for this supposedly mining company - as they call themselves.",

The only one ah fit remember say ah do na one music app like that wey ah they do some task like watching of videos and playing of music then if i get like 100 points ah fit withdraw am. E dey take me up to 1 week to get those point and after that 1 week the money they only b 2$. All those things nah waste of time cos if you calculate the money you go carry buy data and the time wey u go spend to con they play those music and watch video with other small small task person done use that time do better things. Na so ah use stop, but ah never try do anything wey be say nah mining cos e no they pay even the pi network sef wey them carry preach everywhere ah no do am for one day. My beleif nah say nothing good comes easily and nobody go one give you money wey u no get better thing to offer to am.",
