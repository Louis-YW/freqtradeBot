At first, I thought that the OP was talking about fiat currencies; this is the first time I'm reading about local currencies, and even by translating and reading the articles provided in the starting post, I'm yet to understand what they actually are and what their purpose is. What are they based on, and why is there a need to have over 80 local currencies in France? Have we returned to the good ol' days when we were exchanging eggs for bread and so on?Moreover, the main reason I don't see Bitcoin as a viable currency anymore is because it is nowadays deemed an asset that appreciates in value. On the one hand, you have fiat currencies, which, due to inflation, constantly depreciate in value, and on the other hand, Bitcoin, which is an anti-inflation measure and is expected to gain value in the upcoming years.",

For example, it is not possible to use local currency in a supermarket or hypermarket. The local currency can also be used to develop solidarity projects.It is not possible to deposit local currency in a bank account.In my region I learn that there is one of these currencies for 10 years. I have never seen any business with the logo of this currency. In addition, you must join the association that issues them.

So it's just a kind of currency that is only used in those 80 regions and not applicable to other regions. If it is only used to strengthen the region and create a macroeconomy, wouldn't that just override the use of their national currency or they could exchange it for the official national currency. Quite confusing with \"local currency\". Quote from: hatshepsut93 on July 17, 2023, 11:05:54 PMBitcoin, being a volatile and global currency uncontrolled by anyone, wouldn't suit these needs.

But in case of their local currency, they can control it and maintain its value.In my country Indonesia the currency remains the national currency and anything other than that is illegal and would be against the law. They may be able to control the currency, maintain its value and keep it pegged to the value of the national currency so it will remain stable. But when it comes to using Bitcoin, it will be a different thing. We know that bitcoin fluctuations are very fast and are influenced globally, creating great volatility. The use of Bitcoin is not just a currency for exchange, but also thinking about regulation and its impact on their economy.",

Because it is possible that the local currencies encourage people to support local businesses and keep money circulating within the community. It could be they are incentivized to buy goods and services from local merchants using local currency, which helps bolster the local economy and creates local job opportunities which means using local currency has more benefits for them.I'm looking at the map and I think the reason why there are 82 local currencies in France is because it has a big wide area that results from diverse many localities.  The wide area of France encompasses various cities, towns, and rural areas, each with its unique economic and social landscape.  As a result, communities across different regions may have different goals, priorities, and challenges, leading them to establish their own local currencies, and IMO, Bitcoin or national currency won't help.",

Not everyone use bitcoin so there's limited usage of it that's why many choose to use their local currency since this is more convenient to them.Each person is free to select the \"economy\" in which they want to live. In my opinion, most people prefer local currencies because they are more mainstream and common. The \"security\" they provide is, the main reason for this, among other things. Because they are backed by institutions in a particular nation or region, these currencies provide a certain level of stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making them a good choice for people looking to avoid volatility and maintain your money safe.Bitcoin may not be a good fit for everyone... But for those investors and people who are looking for better financial opportunities, Bitcoin is, in my opinion, more suitable. Due to the fact that it is a decentralized cryptocurrency, it is not governed by any central authority, which may be attractive to those seeking greater financial independence. Even so, some people are attracted to this cryptoactive due to its high volatility, allowing them to invest and with knowledge on the subject, analysis and a lot of patience, generate significant income.",

Let them be free to decide what they prefer. Bitcoin is about privacy and autonomy each individual has, so let's make it be real even when deciding to adopt BTC or not.I leave them using what they want, in 10 years there are only 500 users for the local currency in my region... Maybe nobody see any point in using this currency either.Quote from: ultrloa on July 17, 2023, 11:13:47 PMQuote from: Becassine on July 17, 2023, 08:28:09 PMI don't know what it is in other countries but in France there are local currencies, about 80.QuoteAlthough it is difficult to determine an exact number, it is estimated that there are about 80 on French territory. Through a social, environmental, local or even regional objective, their interest is to convey the values ​​that conventional currencies no longer embody today, and this movement is arousing growing enthusiasm if we are to believe a report by the Sol Movement , which oversees local currencies at the national level, published in early 2021. ID offers you a non-exhaustive list of local currencies in circulation by region, as well as an evolving map.A friend was bragging to me about the merits of her local currency, but I wonder what's the point since we have bitcoin? Bitcoin which obviously includes the world population. I did not really understand the objectives of these local currencies, I was wondering if local currencies existed in other countries and if people understood the interest of these local currencies which seem to undergo inflation like the fiats.So I assume you mean fiat then local currencies is more useful since they are well accepted in anywhere you go on your locality compare with bitcoins. I get your point about bitcoin but reality bitcoin is not well oiled up so we cannot use it anywhere for now and most of the time we can only transact this via online transaction and to person who use it. Not everyone use bitcoin so there's limited usage of it that's why many choose to use their local currency since this is more convenient to them.However, there are many places where bitcoin is used. Besides, bitcoin beach seems to work very well for example.Finally, maybe it's just a ploy by the French government to authorize useless currencies to prevent people from learning about bitcoin?",
