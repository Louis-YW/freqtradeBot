      "body": "Sometimes it becomes easy for we to advise people on cryptocurrency trading while we are still learning and we also have to understand that for now crypto trading is one of the hardest because it is not regulated and no channel for daily news, weekly or monthly just like it is in Forex trading and with that you can decide when to stay away from the market when news is to hit the currency market and so this is the biggest challenge of trading crypto for now. This is why a trader should take lower risk and also use stop loss.Quote from: Researchoo on February 03, 2023, 05:19:34 AMInvest in a crypto index fund: An index fund is a type of investment that tracks the performance of a particular market index, such as the S&P 500.

We can't just throw money too easily and that much more if that is hard-earned money because we can't just put trading like gambling where we rely on luck otherwise, forget about trading. Having a basic knowledge of trading is the very least requirement and even using trading bots won't simply work. We have to consider and invest first in knowledge for this is the tool to success or else, losses are only what we get. I don't think that is what we wanted to happen, so we don't need to push ourselves if we are not already ready for this.",

I believe this suggestion was originally meant for stock market investment then OP just convert to crypto since he is suggesting to seek help from crypto professionals while these so called crypto pro are normally social media influencers and shillers. Stock market pro trading is different from crypto pro trading since crypto has a lot of clown pro traders that giving shitty advice. I won’t recommend asking someone advice on trading but instead DYOR(Do Your Own Research).",

Because trading bots will be useful for monitoring the market and trading automatically according to predetermined settings. So you can set where to stop or place a stop loss when the price drops and place a buy order or take profit.Trading bots will also reduce the emotions that may be involved in the trading process. Emotions will interfere with trading when done manually. But remember that trading bots also come with risks. No matter how well the bot is made, of course, there will be some errors or bugs that occur. Therefore, don't trust all trades with bots. Manual trading using technical and fundamental analysis will be better.Quote from: SquallLeonhart on February 04, 2023, 06:01:10 PM-snip-With bitcoin holding, I talk about guaranteed returns when your holding period extends up to four years. This must be a new kind of advantage that you cannot enjoy anywhere else. I always wonder why people struggle with trading when they got an easy approach to guaranteed profits through holding.Trading or Hodling is an option. Depending on which choice you will make, each option has its own risks and benefits. Holding will not always be profitable, it also depends on how your psychology is when holding for the long term. The panic will set in when the price continues to fall and there is no increase in the asset you are holding.Bitcoin may be the best asset for the long term, but will you survive when the price is out of the question? So trading or holding will have their respective advantages. Nothing can be guaranteed, crypto has a high risk and must be prepared for any conditions.",

All of us are not an expert right before we invest in Bitcoin but we also experience big losses first before we realize our mistakes and correct it. Also not all those who invest in Bitcoin are fortunate to earn a profit but the only thing that they got is losses.It's only true that investing/hodling is the go-to thing of people who don't know or don't want to engage in trading. There is no way to say that BTC has a zero risk. BTC actually is the most riskiest asset in crypto because it's known to be highly volatile. We don't know the future of BTC so I won't say that there are guarantees here.",
