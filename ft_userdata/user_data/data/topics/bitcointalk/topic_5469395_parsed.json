If you present something that helps people lose money quickly as something amazing, then your project should be treated with caution. What matters to a good trader is the asset mix, trading volumes and variety of trading pairs, not the size of leverage.",

If this site of future trading ability manage with small leverage under 125x is not bad ideas but I have been quit for long term with future trading. By the way with this future trading side, have an excited offer exactly with fees transaction, usually in Binance with new coins listed on future trading have bigger fees but if still huge above Binance on future trading fees I don't think any interested have to try with this platform exchange for future trading.",

Because I will tell you that people never just only look for the possible earning and offering high leverage but they/we are looking for a platform that can be fully trusted. Many get fooled by such offerings, now it is an old tactic that most traders already know and are aware of what will happen next. If you and the site will lower the leverage amount, maybe that will gain attention and confidence but with that 125x, that could be the reason why they will stay away.",

If you're an experienced trader, you surely can't overly rely on these two factors. Moreover, these two factors are no longer novel enough to set apart the trading platform you're referring toYea, it's a formula for a disaster, specially if you are a newbie in spot/future trading. And we have heard horror stories as well to the point that the young trader has to take his live because he lost all the money in trading.So just be careful with this kind of tools, if you don't know anything about trading, I will advise everyone to stay away from it.But if by chance, you have experience already, then maybe you can try what the OP is promoting. But nevertheless, it's not an assurance that you will make a lot of money using this so called \"best tool\". Everything is still on the hands of the trader.",

If your service is that amazing, you should have just keep it as trade secrets and not bring it for the public to use but I know you are lying my friend, there is nothing amazing about 125X unless your are nothing but a gambler. You mean to tell me I can use your tool to make 125X just like that, show me your prototype history of trades and then the withdrawal and I will believe after that, I know you have nothing in it.Secondly, why not register a dot com domain officially since this is a company. Unless you are in beta phase, there is no need to be using a dot trade domain for your website, at first glance people might think you are just another scammer which from your write indicated already, Discord would have been better option to convince people, telegram houses lots of scammed activityMy review on the website, remove that video on mobile phone view, it disturb the first page or make it hyperlink wrapped with YouTube html, make sure change that color, yellow looks odd.",

If your company needs to be shared here in this manner to get customers then I am sorry but you are not going to get all that much attention. I think it's clear that you need something bigger and you need to keep on improving. I believe that it is going to be hard to handle it for the long term, but it is also quite possible that you could do better marketing for free as well.Just to give an example, if you are incapable of making an infographic, then you are not going to end up with anything good in return, the result will not be all that good and you should be guessing what else you could do about it, I get that it may not be all that great, and I get that it is not going to be all that important for you to know that to build this software, but you should definitely know it if you want to continue marketing, that is the best way to do it and if you lack that then the results of your marketing will not be all that good.",

Because I will tell you that those who promise big returns usually turn into scams. No, the majority had already learned from their mistakes and you can't erase the fact that futures trading is quite risky than spot trading.
