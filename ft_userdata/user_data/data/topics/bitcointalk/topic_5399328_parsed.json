      "body": "1) This should probably be in digital goods.2) I don't believe it's allowed to sell your stake.com account.3) It's likely the buyer of this account could have the account locked or deposited funds confiscated if it is discovered that it was sold here.4) Selling a KYC'd gambling account is basically identity fraud for the buyer and could land them in some hot water.I appreciation your entrepreneurial spirit, but I question how smart this would be for the buyer.  There are definitely some red flags here and I also believe you'll have trouble finding an escrow agent to facilitate this type of trade.Anyway, best of luck to you, but I'm not sure this is it chief.",

      "body": "it is a huge risk for the buyer because in case the next level of verification is required they could practically not prove that they are the real owner of this account!QuotePlease upload supporting documentation for your Source of Funds. Document laying on a flat surface must show all 4 corners and all information should be clear and identifiable.It would have to generate a high volume of bets (risking) to receive compensation that is proportionally minimal ... considering all the risks it really doesn't make sense.They will earn so far the same amount (and ranking a brand new account) just playing with a brand new account!From Stake Forum https://stakecommunity.com/topic/32457-dont-ever-thing-of-selling-or-buying-a-vip-account/QuoteChances are that when you buy a premium account that you will end up accessing the account in a new location or perhaps even a new country. As a result you will most likely be banned from the service (for suspicion of VPN being used). However there are some service online that seems provide helps for selling such accounts but as said before also by OgNasty there are too many red flags",
