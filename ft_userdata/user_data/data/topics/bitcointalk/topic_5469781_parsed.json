  "content": "Who wasn't worried about the transaction fee of Bitcoin some months ago should raise up their hands...and the Nay has it...lol Jokes apart, the Bitcoin transaction situation months ago was a subject of concern for many people especially me since I've not witnessed such ever since I became more conversant with it. This was particularly alarming when people online were complaining bitterly. The situation even took a burden on CMs here and it raised discussions as to the way forward in many quarters. Those who are privileged outside BTT started using alternative coins and tokens to ease their transactions. My transaction stuck for over a month and I could remember seeing a high transaction fee like 650sat/vB.My research then showed that the problem was primarily due to the demand and supply where Ordinal and BRC-20 present issues which are scalability problems. I even wrote a topic about this when I was kinda angry about the whole thing. It's of course relieving now to see the same Bitcoin that hit 650sat/vB transaction fee now in 2sat/vB a while ago.I saw unconfirmed transactions above 400,000 at that troubled time, but now the unconfirmed transactions are a bit above 28,100 which I believe will continue to decrease over time. But come to think of it, even at 2sat/vB, we still have over 28,100 unconfirmed transactions, maybe some people don't want to pay any fee at all...lol.I'm happy Bitcoin shows its reliability once again and has defeated the spammers and those without good intentions. I also share to let beginners know how to calm down if a situation like this presents itself again. Bitcoin will always win.",

      "body": "This is a welcome development, although your screenshot shows it on the all-time low that I have ever come across this week. Although I made some transactions a few days ago and sometimes last week at 5–10 saturdays as a transaction fee, this appears to be convenient for me as I proceed with such transactions. The high transaction's fee, which happens back to them because of network congestion or the increase in transaction volume due to the NFt that was being minted on the bitcoin blockchain, made the network unconducive for us all. This was truly making and breaking the true purpose of bitcoin, as we were unable to use our coin when we wanted to, how we wanted to, as many were looking for alternatives that could help reduce the fee, and those who were willing to pay the high transaction fee were just completing their transactions very fast. It's good to see the fee reducing drastically.",

Bitcoin will always win.Bitcoin was never in any battle even then, so I don't see what the win is all about, anyone that doesn't believe in Bitcoin because of the fee then was raised then they should not be in Bitcoin in the first place. I think newbies should be more aware about how the transactions works I don't this some people actually don't want to pay those fees but they aren't aware that the higher the fee the quicker the transactions would be.",

It's of course relieving now to see the same Bitcoin that hit 650sat/vB transaction fee now in 2sat/vB a while ago.That’s a lot, over 650sat/vB, I didn’t actually notice that myself, the most I did was around 100sat/vB on my transactions and that was after I’ve had to bump fees severally and still didn’t get much success with the processing speed of my transaction. Although, at 100sat/vB, there was some progress so, I’m wondering why would anyone go that far to processing a transaction with over 650sat/vB, it’s way high.The reason behind these fee hikes is no secrete when you frequent the cryptospace and actively transact in between. As alarming as it might have been, we always knew it’s only for a time, just like the various seasons in the market, it’s sure to rise and fall.",

This limit cannot be surpass by miners when including transactions into blocks so since they have been Chunks of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool it is logical that the number will only reduce gradually as the transaction fee is low now and if more transactions are broadcasted because many will use this opportunity to consolidate then Those transactions with extremely low fee will be dropped",

Tokenization is in part what made Ethereum's blockchain bloated to a point that running a full node requires datacenter grade servers. Can't have decentralization with that. Ordinals also brought a lot of bloat into bitcoin's blockchain and mounted a lot of pressure on transaction costs and confirmation times too. Hopefully if they become popular again in the future their addition to the bitcoin blockchain will be reconsidered.",

Days ago I was surprised to see Bitcoin transaction fee to be as low as it is, it's been a long time I've seen that type of low before but OP, I am not going to sit on this thinking it's going go always be the same, because right now it's not more $0.08$, I checked mempool this morning and it's going up again, now at $0.19 so that's that. When the Bull market comes it's going to get more painful for Bitcoin, a high transaction fee will be one of the most discussed at the time, and even the Bitcoin Ordinals will nearly cripple Bitcoin, I believe this is going to be unavoidable, the real spamming hasn't even started yet, let's wait til the next bull market and see.",

Therefore, I believe that most nodes will be able to broadcast transactions with 2 sat/vB, but will not be able to do it with 1 sat/vB. .here you can find max limits https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/reduce-memory.md",

In particular, problems with high commission prices will be advertised in the media more than once. Let's see what will happen with transaction fees and queues for confirmation of transactions in the next bitcoin / crypto-hype. Considering the minimum expected price for btc is $100.000, I am sure that commissions will again surprise us all with their extortionate rate.Now for another moment. Everyone is waiting for bitcoin mass adoption and widespread distribution of the bitcoin, when they will pay for it left and right, when there will be a very big user base. What will the commission be? Is bitcoin ready for this kind of scaling? Add to this that btc is rising in price and that by then this will also directly affect the level of commissions. All this together will “pleasantly” surprise with the amount of transaction fees.One more thing. Bitcoin is priced at $1.000.000, as predicted by some very enthusiastic bitcoiners Can you imagine how high the commissions will be at that moment?The past events with the jump in the price of the transaction commission on the bitcoin network were a kind of crash test, which confirm my fears that btc is not quite ready for the high “influx” of users, demand, and level of transactions.",
