  "content": "Hi everyone. Starting from the fact that I am almost totally ignorant of the subject, I wanted to know from some competent person if there are any macroeconomic data thatcause an almost immediate consequence on the price of cryptocurrencies. I also wanted to know if, by the same principle, there are \"fundamental\" data on individual cryptocurrencies, which publications cause an immediatevariation in the market. What I'm interested in is understanding if there is any correlation, even if minimal, i.e. 0.NÂ°%.Thanks in advance",
