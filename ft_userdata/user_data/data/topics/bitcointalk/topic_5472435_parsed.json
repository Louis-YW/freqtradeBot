  "content": "Can anybody recommend a desktop software wallet (that can run on Linux) that natively supports BIP-39 passphrase (\"13th/25th seed word\") and multiple blockchains at the same time (at least Bitcoin and Ethereum)?Most of the hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger support passphrase, but the only software multi-crypto wallet that I was able to find with passphrase support is Coinomi which is closed-source and has a bad reputation. The rest of the software wallets seem to be Bitcoin-only or Ethereum only (like MyCrypto).Edited: added that it needs to be runnable on desktop, not a mobile app",

It has a Linux version, claims to have \"a BIP39 passphrase encryption on wallet creation, hardening the security of your wallet right out of the gate\", and is likely open-source since I managed to find their GitHub page: https://github.com/CoinSpace/CoinSpace. It could be that, however, they are confusing concepts by referring to a mere seed phrase as a wallet passphrase, so it needs verifying.The other option is to switch to Windows or use emulators like Wine to run Unstoppable Wallet on a Linux machine. Or just ditch these pesky altcoins altogether.",

I wouldn't only rely on open-source criteria, wallet has to be famous, demandable and frequently inspected by developers but there is no such wallet that unites many altcoins and also supports Linux or Windows. Or your best bet is to use android emulator. Another option, and I would say it's a good option, is to use hardware wallets. Trezor hardware wallet is probably better than many other software wallets that float online.",

So you already have a passphrase-protected wallet that you created elsewhere, and now you want to recover it, am I right?How many altcoins are we talking about? Is it too many to recover the seed + passphrase in separate wallets instead of one multicoin wallet?I would first recover my bitcoin and move it elsewhere before starting to recover the alts. After that, start with the most valuable altcoin stash. I think you will have to lower your expectations here and use a closed-source wallet, but only do it after your BTC is safe.",

If that's the case and OP doesn't already have such a wallet generated elsewhere, then it's an even bigger reason not to go down the road of using a multicoin wallet to store the bitcoin. Keep your bitcoin separated from everything else, and transfer the alts to wallets based on their value. Since he mentioned ether, he can find open-source software for that asset as well.",

For some reason I remembered Bisq because it's not only a decentralized exchange, but you also get a non-custodial wallet with a seed phrase that you can use as such. But I don't remember seeing a passphrase feature in Bisq, and I am not sure how coin recovery of other assets besides BTC and BSQ would work.
