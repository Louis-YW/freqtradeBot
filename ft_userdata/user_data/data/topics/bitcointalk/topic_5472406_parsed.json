Once again, here comes the importance of doing adequate research.I see that the mixers' sites are the ones that scammers set their eyes on because of the ease of impersonating them through their domains and making them close to the legitimate mixers. Therefore, people should add the legitimate domains of mixers or any other platforms they use daily to their browser bookmarks without clicking on any unfamiliar links they might stumble upon by chance.",

The individual in question is known as \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk or \"cryptofbi007\" on the web. There is a high possibility that there are malicious intentions behind their replies, such as attempting to socially engineer people into thinking certain things. I have found possible connections and similarities to this case, which indicate a high likelihood of bad intentions behind his activities.I have provided detailed information about these allegations in my post, which also mentions the \"JackETH\" BitcoinTalk user.

It's more of a inquiry rather than implanting them with thoughts maybe you're talking about psy ops or something like that, I might be wrong on that part though but hey I want to learn something everyday.",
