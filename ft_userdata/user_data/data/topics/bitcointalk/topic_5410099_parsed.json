      "body": "How many education projects do you know in blockchain that has made any impact? I really haven't seen any making an impact like the rest of the project from other trends. I have seen a few education-related projects in the past but unfortunately, they could not make any impact on this ecosystem. Ledu is not an exception either, education ecosystem may have a good use case but no project has been able to truly explore and utilize it.",
