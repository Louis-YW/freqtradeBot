I don't even think we're THAT big of a source for users, but it is a hub for new users to know what's up since there are countless threads about the majority of the well-known casinos here. All in all, I'd say yes they can, since the market isn't limited here in the forum. Now if you were solely specifying the forum, then I don't think they'd be able to keep up, unless users of the casino themselves were to bump and talk about the casino within a mega thread of their own.",

      "body": "We cannot really know unless they share their data on gambling activity and new user registration. We can only guess from using other metrics like their ANN activity and website visits.In case of those two casinos, I also noticed a drop in their forum popularity. For sure the stoppage of their long-time sig campaigns also contributed to that but I think the main reason was their inability to pay withdrawals on time.Another case we could use is Bitsler. They ran a campaign here before but they decided to stop also. As I can see, their ANN has not been so active unlike other casinos with ongoing campaigns. In addition to that, there's someone recommending avoiding it because of the changes in policies about rewards [1]. I think we can now assume that the drop in rewards can be attributed to the decrease in their revenue. That decrease might have been caused by lack of marketing here in the forum or in other platforms.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399656.0",

If you take away the passion and strong leadership skills, it will be less attractive to people like me and companies won't do well. By the way, I like how they give everyone the opportunity to earn a living rather than piling up the rewards for themselves alone. In regards to Bitvest and the other, it's more of a problem of the unseen. There are problems that needs to be avoided/eliminated otherwise things may never remain thesame.",

All of the forum advertising through signature campaigns, bounty stuff etc all helps these casinos and people to become aware of them but they aren’t 100% reliant on the forum and if they were they likely wouldn’t last very long. Of course again there’s a reason they advertise here and that’s because it works, but it’s not 100% essential.",

Older casinos can go back to using forum ads and signature campaigns as before to remind their members that the old casino wants to get back into the gambling business. But they have a lot to prepare, including who will continue or make ANN for their return. Maybe the old casino needs to reorganize its team to get back to running as smoothly as it used to.And it won't be easy because nowadays, many new casinos have started to get good positions in the Bitcointalk forum so they need to compete fiercely.",

Regarding the case of 777coin and Bitvest and any other casinos, they have done their best effort in this forum and they have good player base already. Stopping the advertisement in this forum does not mean that they stop their advertisement completely.",

That's right. Bitcointalk is really big important to them when it comes to advertising since it is related to cryptocurrencies which some of the gambling sites use as their currency. And, I think that advertising their gambling through the BCT and having a signature campaign will be a great strategy to pull up new players since a lot of people are visiting BCT.",

An old casino could still continue working without advertisements but other casinos with campaigns would have an advantage especially when it comes to attracting players. We should keep in mind that most players are also relying on advertisements here on forums. It could make them easily decide what to choose.",

The main feature there is that in order to maintain the number of subscribers you should always invest part of the profits in advertising, as some of the old subscribers leave and you need to get new ones. I think the system is the same. If you do not replace users who are leaving (for various reasons), you will quickly find yourself without an audience. Another issue is that there are many other platforms for advertising besides BTT.",
