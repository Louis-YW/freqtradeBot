Here everything depends on the traders not provided by someone's personal or bot.  And the best advantage is lower fees and number of withdrawals than other exchangesI like spot trading a lot, I don't know how much other people like it. Spot trading has very low probability of loss and trades can be taken as time changes. Many people say that futures trading is popular but the possibility of loss is also high and the profit is high.",

It may not be bad to have a channel with good signals, but it's much better to figure out what you're doing yourself. To do this, you need to study the issue a lot, explore, try, gain experience, fall, rise and move on. In principle, everything is like in the rest of life.Whether it's daily trading, scalping, swing or whatever, it's up to you to decide what's best for you. It depends on many factors. Maybe you have a lot of money and you should just invest and not trade every day. In any case, it is worth trying and choosing",

Agree. If a person is interested, then perhaps he has some amount of money, but there is no knowledge and understanding of the processes. This can lead to loss of money. You need to understand at least a little about what you are doing, otherwise it can lead to loss of money.One of the best advice I've ever heard is take $200 and trade small amounts until you're more experienced. This money will not be so pitiful to lose in case of unsuccessful transactions and you can gain an understanding of the processes",

While trading comes with its fair share of risks, it also offers the chance to grab some sweet profits and potentially even live off them (if you're trading to make a living). Now, I don't want you to go down the same rabbit holes I did, so here's my nugget of wisdom: before you leap into trading, find a mentor, arm yourself with knowledge about the ins and outs of trading, and most importantly, embrace patience. Trading is a skill, and skills take time to hone, so no need to rush it.As for my master plan, I'm all about that buy-and-hold strategy during this bull run – can't wait for the bear to strut its stuff.Speaking of strategies, I'm a proud scalper. Why, you ask? Well, let's just say that my emotional control isn't exactly as strong as the Hulk's, so I prefer those quick in-and-out trades. Quote from: direktor1977 on August 23, 2023, 05:08:19 AM1. Which exchanges you use and why?And when it comes to exchanges, Binance is my jam. It's user-friendly, the fund withdrawals are smoother than jazz, and they sprinkle in some nifty tips to supercharge your dollar-cost averaging strategy – that's if you're into that sort of thing.Quote from: direktor1977 on August 23, 2023, 05:08:19 AM2.

However, when I have time, I tend to do some scalping if I see an opportunity, by an opportunity I mean when I find a coin or a token that is going up and down quickly, so I observe it for a little while, check the chart and see how people are buying or selling and make a few trades on it.Sometimes, you get profit but sometimes you might get some loss, I always make sure that I have my stop-loss set so that if the coin or the token starts dropping all of a sudden, I don't lose a lot of money and the money I used don't get stuck, so the stop-loss gets triggered and the assets are sold with a small loss.",

Recommended Boiannce and Kucoins one with KYC and Ku coin is absolutely KYC free.🔵 To Screen coins you should not follow others, Personally, I used to screen coins on the basis of the Descriptive and Fundamental analysis while going to Long trades... Longer time frame and use the technical and Sentimental analysis while going for the shorter time frame. In regular tracking, a few platforms can help you as Coingecko, CoinMarketCAp etc, etc.🔵 Signals success is dependent on yourself if you really want to use the signals that are the real signals in my view ( here I do not mean by trade type signals with TP and SP), I'm talking about the investment signals as Dips & some other on-chain analysis reports. Coinglass, Glassnode, and Heatmap reviews can help you here.🔵 The trading time frame really depends on your portfolio or I can say your initial capital.. I used to Hold trade on a longer time frame weekly and monthly and now from few months Daily as well recommended a longer time frame to start trading and understanding the amrket.",

My advise to you is to take things easy because trading involves it own risk. Another advise is don't give someone your money in the name of telegram group or trading for you or you to copy trade.
