But since there’s a chance that Dapps will grow when this merge becomes successful, There’s a point that congestion might happened again and L2 project might be needed.For now, The only thing we can do is to wait for the performance of pos eth.",

That's it , many devs will still use other blockchains as well. You cant compare ETH to most of these coin, It is close to Bitcoin and SOV coin in few years from now. It has one of the biggest community and market in crypto. ETC would have been a better argument. ETH developers are very active even with the challenges of the high transaction fee, they got staking and best platform for Defi. High fee transaction seem to be the toughest challenge possed especially for smallmoney traders. All the coins still got ETH blockchain and many could flood back soon.When you said SOV what do you mean? Are you talking about Sovryn project? That project has very bad performance and the volume keep decreasing, always have a high hope but now I am not sure anymore, maybe, just maybe, one day people will see that smart contract and defi on Bitcoin is the best.",

L2 is just an option if the blockchain network can’t handle all the transactions but they are already useless once the blockchain can handle it for themselves. Ethereum is the only project that has tons of L2 project because of its very slow blockchain but this PoS might be the killer of L2 project once the tps increase.",

      "body": "The Merge doesn't actually address Ethereum's transaction fee issues. One of the many myths surrounding the Merge is that it will solve gas fee problems. Actually it doesn't. The Merge is about Ethereum's shift from PoW to PoS. It is not about expanding network capacity. So it is wrong to expect that the Merge is an update regarding gas.So don't be surprised when after the Merge the gas fees will remain high. It will still be dependent on the traffic. If there is congestion in the network, the gas will increase. If transactions are not highly competing against each other, the gas may decrease.

It's about whether the ethereum merged will have an impact to the layer 2. In my opinion if merged has nothing to do with second layer solution. It's not about the dev choose based their taste. It's about the technical specs from the blockchain that can give a lot of benefits to the developers and its platforms. I think that people know this so well.",

The biggest problem with Layer 2 projects is that they are usually not decentralized, they have creators and developers which mean that they are working overtime to make it better. So, if one day things go south, they could always try to do something else and go with the flow and change their features to apply for the brand new better tech.I am not saying all will do that, some will stay and try to get more attention, but the option is there to change it to the better version if they ever want to. Hence why I believe it would not be really that much of a trouble for them in the long term.",

The eth team didn't say that once ethereum merged is completed, the layer 2 will now disappear. Layer 2 are already created, so they will remain but what people are afraid of is that the layer 2 coins will get weaker because many will return to eth once eth fees returns to normal but you said it will not happen? Ouch, I think people that hope for it are going to be hurt once again because this isn't the first time they hope for that but every eth upcoming updates they always say that eth fees will return to normal but anyway there are still layer 2 which can be a good alternative to eth because they have a cheaper fees and they are also fast.",

They doing really great in scaling Ethereum with swap fees no more than 0.2$ but the question is if will keep existing in the futureNot exactly. The ETH blockchain will still remain under heavy load due to it being the most popular smart contracts platform in the world. PoS would only have a positive effect over ETH's energy consumption, but that's it. The real deal would be scaling ETH through Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. I don't think such solutions will disappear, since they can prove to be useful at times where ETH's congestion becomes uncontrollable. When you have a PoS-enabled ETH blockchain, Sharding, and Layer-two scaling solutions, then you'd get an unfathomable experience in \"De-Fi\" beyond compare.I think the combination of different scaling techniques in ETH, BTC, and other chains would help them reach large masses of users without experiencing any drawbacks whatsoever. I'd prefer to use a Layer-2 scaling solution that is decentralized, than a scalable smart contract platform like Solana which is highly centralized. The future is all about off-chain scaling solutions and interoperability in order to make crypto/Blockchain land a better place. Who knows if major cryptocurrencies reach higher prices because of increased mainstream adoption? Just my thoughts",
