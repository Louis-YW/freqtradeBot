I was asked to register on the site with my mail and out of precaution, I created a new email to follow the procedure.What happened was, after registration, virtual Bitcoin which werenâ€™t the real thing was loaded on my page and I was asked to deposit some amount as gas fee. That was were it ended for me and them but, itâ€™s been such a long time and I canâ€™t get hold of them no more.Whatâ€™s best to do is, to follow those trading investment sites where most of the participants are mute. They likely work this kind of scam on telegram.",

Do someone no a goog list?Haha ðŸ˜‚,To be honest with you, I personally think this is not even something you should asking about, although I can't come up with a list at the moment since I am just coming across this thread (hoping some other users who had see this thread earlier had come up with some list), but to make your own list is very simple.You can head over to Google, a simple search with the right keyword will bring up hundreds of results with thousands of lists of fake crypto sites, clone crypto exchange links, even fake wallets that are listed on Google play store, as well as other Android app stores around.If you enter on telegram and or Twitter(now X), Facebook, there are millions of people posting fake crypto airdrop links looking for gullible people that will click, connect their wallet and have their wallet balance drained, you get more than a handful of them.",

It is good for him to go to telegram because it is the scammers. And also op can check the scam accusations board and there he will see more of it. Op before then what do you want to use the list of those people? You didn't stated it clear for us to understand that you want to attack them or what. Don't go and attack them when you are not anti attacker because police who chase arm robbers became arm robbers. And many people have given you some clues so you have to follow those steps to achieve whatever you want. But be careful.",

After you find them, just ask a question regarding your investment or get guidance on how you can make an investment, and then you will receive dozens of DMs from scammers that's going to give you an offer on their own website or platform.",
