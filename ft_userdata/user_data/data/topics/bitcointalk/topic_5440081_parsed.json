If you are still interested you will need to learn how to trade yourself with grunt work using a demo or small account.The only books I liked were \"Reminiscience of a Stock Operator\", it was very entertaining and \"Trading in the zone\" which is mostly about trading psychology. You should read that book because it will prevent you from blowing up your entire account in 1 day due to revenge trading like most people do.",

You can learn more and get practical steps on trading because it gives you graphics on the market and candles. I support little reading but more practical work on trading. If you are scared of live trading, then you learn with demo that will build you more.",

And how will this benefit in developing your trading skills, given that it talks about a background far from technical analysis.In general, trading is great and focusing on what you want is the best.

Having plan B is very important in trading. With good plan B, traders can exit the market without big loss.Plan B can be closing position with same entry price and accepting minor loss in trading fee.Plan B can be closing positions with cut loss order or stop-limit order and accept loss to wait for other chances later.If a trader does not have any plan B, soon he will be punished by the market.",

All suggestions are welcomed.Try to look on your local bookstore, I’m sure there are trader in your place where you can buy their book at a cheaper price and you can easily understand the terms since you have the same language. Anyway, the rules in trading are the same regardless of its content, and its good that you are leveling up your way of learning, I also suggest to attend some seminars about trading, you might also get more knowledge their and use it for your trading activities. This is a long process of learning and I wish you success here.",

According to your statements, you have learnt a lot from the forum and YouTube and you wish to go to the next level. To advance, one must not only read numerous books but also apply the little one they have learnt. Many people, in my opinion, learn more and go to the next level by building on what they already know and applying what they have learned. This is what leads them to the new level. As a result, consistent practice is the best way to learn more. As a result, trading is what we need to learn more about, but I believe practice will help us get there very fast.

Well anyone wants to succeed in life but the problem is that not all are like the OP who are truly committed. I can feel that the OP already learned a lot from the sources that he mentioned but he is still hungry for more information. I like that attitude. He only didn't mentioned if he already applied the knowledge that he learned but he better do it first because how will he know that he already improved or not? Or maybe he already do it and found out that his knowledge is still not enough yet, and that is why he was looking for more.I agree on the last part that you said. Books can only give us a hint or they can only provide definitions to the terms that we don't understand, but the rest are not taught with it. It's about us who discovers it.",
