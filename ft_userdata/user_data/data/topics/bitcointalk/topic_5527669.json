The arrogance of these guys man) and that's the only way their bags will pump more.So what do you think should be done to stop them now?",

      "body": "Quote“The biggest obstacle for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not the Fed, Treasury, banks, or even Elizabeth Warren. It’s Ripple/XRP. They are aggressively lobbying against the SBR by throwing around millions of dollars at politicians, desperately trying to derail it.”How is that working out for them? Pres. Trump just signed an executive order banning the creation of CBDCs in the United States,plus another order to create a bitcoin stockpile that doesn't include XRP. Cynthia Lummis author of the bill to create an SBR was also made head of the US Senate subcommittee on digital assets.In other words the SBR is all but a done deal at this point. I would call that an epic fail for Ripple XRP. In light of all that Ripple doesn't seem like much of a threat to bitcoin anymore do they? I guess they didn't throw around enough bribe money.Good riddance to XRP and the entire shitcoin scam industry. They will die a slow painful death into irrelevance. But perhaps Garlinghouse can stay relevant by defecting to China or North Korea to help the communists set up their wonderful CBDC big brother state surveillance network. Keep hope alive!",

If you'd exclude anything that's not centrally controlled, Bitcoin's market dominance would above 80%.I can only hope there will be some people who see through this, and realize anything that's centrally controlled is even worse than just going BRRR on the money printer.",

Do they believe the world will abandon Bitcoin and follow XRP? I honestly do not understand their thought process because deep down they know bitcoin is superior.It should be common knowledge by now that the more bitcoin grows the more altcoins grow too, so why don't they all rally behind bitcoin, even if not for the leave of bitcoin, but for the fact that it will favour them if bitcoin succeeds. They should also know that the cryptocurrency industry will collapse if Bitcoin becomes non-existence because the trust people have in the market is somehow tied to bitcoin.

However, in my opinion, this does not mean that Donald Trump and his friends have suddenly become cypherpunks and freedom supporters. It is just that the idea of ​​​​creating a digital dollar has caused a lot of objections from many Americans. However, this does not mean that the idea of ​​​​building a digital concentration camp in the US has been completely rejected. The goal of Donald Trump and his friends is still a strong US dollar. Donald Trump also wants US government bonds (Treasury bonds) to be in high demand. I ask myself - do Donald Trump and his friends want to promote decentralized cryptocurrency or centralized projects of American companies? In my opinion, they are more interested in the second option. I would be happy to be wrong.",
