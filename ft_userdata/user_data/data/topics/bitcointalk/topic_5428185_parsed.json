I'm waiting for your answers! What do you exactly define as fees? It’s always great to choose exchanges which have trust and reputation. If you go after minimal fees and choose a new yet unpopular exchange, and if they later on scam attempt on you, then you won’t be left with choices, as your whole money will be lost by that time. So I would always suggest you to go for the exchanges, which are there in this market for atleast 4 years. Best exchange according to me will be Binance and Kucoin. Rest is upto you OP.",

      "body": "If you are looking for with minimal fees trading I think Binance is the best option exchange market for your choosing, trade there with BUSD pair and use limit order between selling and buying without have to pay fees yet. But if you mean about withdrawing fees all exchange have the same fees withdrawing at altcoin or Bitcoin. Binance have support with P2P and you can convert or withdraw your stable coins assets like BUSD or USDT to be fiat and withdrawing directly to your Bank account without any fees.Before FTX collapse exactly the most cheapest fees exchange for withdrawing our assets, there are not have to pay fees yet when withdrawing at FTX, but right now this exchange have been indicate as scam exchange market and I don't sure have other exchange market without paying fees like FTX.",

I'm waiting for your answers! If you are afraid of fees then you have no much clues  about the system. You would be looking or wanting recommendations for less fee exchange and get into the wrong ones which are unpopular and new in existence. If they scam you, your assets together with your funds are all gone. So I will advise you to go do your own research on long existing exchange with good reputation from the masses and verified on coin market cap with huge daily trading volume. With this, you are guaranteed of your funds being safe for trading. But you should remember that \" not your keys, not your coin\" still stands. The transaction fee should not be an issue rather the safety of your assets and funds should be your priorities.",

Which depends on what coin you are going to withdraw Binance is a bit expensive around $3 when withdrawing BTC but you can get a cheap fee if you withdraw BTC on another network like Bep20. Or reduce few by exchanging BTC to other coins with very cheap withdrawal fee.Check binance withdrawal fee here https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee",

You have to make a little more effort if you want to leave a serious impression that something you are promoting is really worth it - I will certainly not make an account there and check whether you are telling the truth or if it is just one of a series of scams.",

In any case, the smaller the exchange, the higher the gamble of not being able to absorb misfortunes from various problems and issues that can happen from here on out. I would prefer to trade on the most trustworthy exchanges rather than one with lower fees but unproven. It ought to be an exchange with good volume and more markets to I can choose to trade.   An updated ranking of exchanges based on trading volume and ratings is provided here.",

You can use Bestchange (Link in my signature,) it has a wide range of platforms in which you will find the cheapest fees and a comparison between many platforms according to what you want, but it is better and before using any platform: - Do your own research and have an in-depth research. - Avoid any platform with unknown information. - Ask about it here in the forum.So I guarantee you that you will get the lowest fees.Also, the type of cryptocurrencies you want to convert plays a crucial criterion, as some currencies are not listed on some platforms.",
