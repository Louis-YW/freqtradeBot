  "content": "QuoteIf you ask most people around the world what they mean by the “American dream,” nearly all will respond with some version of upward social mobility, the American success story, or the self-made man (rarely the self-made woman). Perhaps they will invoke the symbolic house with a white picket fence that suggests economic self-sufficiency and security; many will associate the phrase with the land of opportunity for immigrants.https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/state-of-the-american-dream/churchwell-history-of-the-american-dream The above is a quote from the George Bush Institute of the typical response an individual would receive when they ask someone about what the American dream is. And this is the truth, the American dream includes the component of upward economic mobility. So many successful people in the United States of America would agree that they have achieved the American dream and those who are not yet there would agree that they are in the process of achieving or reaching the American dream. With a high unemployment rate, housing crises, increasing student debts, inflation, recession, wars, famine, high interest rates and all those factors that affect the economic mobility of many families both in America and all over the world threatening to wipe out the middle class, would we still say that  the American Dream exist? Is it still achieveable or attainable?Secondly every country in the world has some version of their American dream, if your country does, what is its version of the American dream and does it still exist? Is it still achieveable or attainable?",

Perhaps they will invoke the symbolic house with a white picket fence that suggests economic self-sufficiency and security; many will associate the phrase with the land of opportunity for immigrants.Secondly every country in the world has some version of their American dream, if your country does, what is its version of the American dream and does it still exist? Is it still achieveable or attainable? It's still achievable and worth a lot for believer of American Dream. For example, in America women could easily do their jobs but in many countries where women are restricted in homes only. Not targeting any race but still many people of backward mindset still exist. So, for those women American Dream is a thing because those who wanted to become a Doctor, Engineer, etc. could fulfil their dreams in America.That's what American Dream mean, the land where dream comes true when you put hard work. Hardwork is the most necessary thing, if one is not willing to make efforts and still will think that he/she will fulfill their dreams in America then America is not some fairytale world. It's just a country where opportunities are available and if not then could be created.  I always wanted to earn money, Passive source of money, but i have seen many people going to UK Canada but not a single one in my relative or friend zone has ever gone to US. So, i cannot say that life is hard there but i can say one thing for sure UK and Canada's life is not easy. Many people are sleeping on the roads (talking about immigrants). I do not want to leave my country, because my dreams could be fulfilled remotely",

Because the population is just 300m, and the America land occupy 1/3 of the total earth surface area, that is lavish to everyone! But why land? Is land really matter? Of course land is the only real wealth that is natural, but idk why would capitalist like to create artificial wealth such as intangible stock, paper asset, intellectual property etc, they are all clearly wealth destroyer, yet they would not stop lying over and over again. When you look again how the rest of the continent and compare it to America, we have to compete with the rest of the 2/3 real estate on the earth surface area, which is highly competitive tbh.There isn't dream in anywhere else because most of the natural wealth have been completely monopolized by a few very influential families.",

Is it still achieveable or attainable?I will give a small example of a past story where I faced a lot of difficulties on my academic journey, from economic problems, unsatisfactory health, and some not so smooth. But honestly, life is about facing and moving forward to overcome current difficulties for a better future, and OP's problem is on a larger scale as far as I know. That term is synonymous with ideas such as freedom, opportunity, and equality. And I understand that under the difficult circumstances in recent years, things are not going in a good direction, but it is clear that the broader and more distant process, the current achievements are not the things we feel anxious about, instead try to get through it together.Quote from: alastantiger on August 02, 2023, 09:23:28 AMSecondly every country in the world has some version of their American dream, if your country does, what is its version of the American dream and does it still exist? Is it still achieveable or attainable? As mentioned above, freedom, opportunity and equality are what I believe any country is aiming for. And of course in the country where I live, our leader also had these views to develop the country through the stages, I am not in a country that is too modern in other respects. But what I see most clearly is our solidarity, after economic difficulties, or epidemics, the spirit of solidarity is always mentioned, perhaps that is the part that I think will towards dreams of a better life.",

      "body": "The \"American Dream\" that we know today is completely at risk. Everything that we do from this point on as a country (speaking of the US) is crucial to the preservation of this dream. The American dream used to basically consist of an independent life in a free country, someone who was able to secure some land and a house, and build an established business and income stream to provide for ones family. To be a success. Maybe have a farm, or a successful practice which one can do as he pleases, without having to rely on anyone else to make ends meat. It saddens me today when you look at the state of the US and how bizarre everything is now. People struggle all over the world to get a house, it is an extremely hard endeavor today in today's market with the rates where they are and inflation where it is. I hope that America can continue to be a beacon for freedom, and that the American Dream can be preserved! In its own right, a dream shouldn't even have to be an american dream, this is just your dream. What do you want? What are you willing to sacrifice (time, money, hardwork, etc.) to make that dream happen? I think that is whats most important, simply having a dream of your own and having the courage to see it through! Good luck everyone!",

For my generation the dream was to become an entrepreneur running our own company, helping employee, become 'the boss', it also closely related to fact that the industry is starting to developed, we thing we can make our own way there. While for generation after me, they have more varied dreams, most of the industry is already established people have more buying power. Now they can become musician, artist, modern farmer, designer, anything because people already have the money to buy a secondary thing like entertainment, hobby etc. Previously even we are struggle to meet our daily needs.",

You have free healthcare but how good it is? How much do you actually have to pay the doctor and nurses for everything in a hospital?
