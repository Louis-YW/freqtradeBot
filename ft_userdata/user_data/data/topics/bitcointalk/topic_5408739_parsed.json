  "content": "Hello guys, I've launched neusa.io service, where a trader can create a neuron sage, an AI based indicator, that predicts market. I'd like to hear your feedback. Thank you in advance.Registration: just fill in your email and click \"Login/Register\". Then open a signin link from the email. Maybe page refresh will be neededTraining: experiment with settings as you want and then press \"Train\". Greater date interval is selected, or rounds are set, then longer is the training process. Please be careful with settings that are marked with asterisk. High values on those can freeze browser and your PC if it's not powerful enough.Using: after the training process, the \"Prediction\" label becomes active and contains an indicator's output. The \"Confidence\" means how the indicator is confident seeing new data. The \"Accuracy\" means how the indicator performed during training. Consider the all 3 labels making a trading decision.",

As a first time user of these AI based trading indicators, don't you think some FAQs are necessary to guide the user to \"train\" the AI?3. What are the minimum requirement PC requirements to avoid freezing?If I have a 16 GB RAM computer with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, is it good enough to run settings marked with asterisks?",

So does the AI work with that indicators and then make sure that if there are maybe 2 out of three correlation with a specific indication whether the market is going to be bullish or bearish? Is it something like that?",

Is it something like that?One of the challenges that a trader applying many indicators will face is not being able to know exactly the direction of the market so Op may not be able to give you a directional answer when using such indicators because they won't correspond with each other and that can lead to confusione and more is that the indicators listed are lagging indicators that goes after the market. Stoch seem to be the one to show direction and Macd itself is complicated to understand.",

      "body": "Very thoughtful project but I do not understand it in terms of processing. You want user to fill up the data for AI and then get the results back based on the same input? How is it helpful in predicting the indicator (futures) if I am putting my own set of data to be used and ask to do what plot Future? How come is it going to work if I mistakenly put wrong market analysis in it. As far as AI concerned it should be able to fetch the data from market resources automatically and let us know results. What say?",

So why not train it raw trading data (big file of all tx in last months/years) and let it do its job? Let it develop the best strategy no matter if hft, short/medium/long term.",

The first is published: https://youtu.be/420OaRwLwEEI watched the video and I think it lacks some with the results that the video showed like from what I watched, you just showed that the history on the way you create a dead end, putting in different indicators that would be suitable for the trader or the user of neurosage. I thought it was going to be a tutorial since you said it was a tutorial, but you just showed the reason and the goal of the project, not the actual usage and how it can be used and how you are going to utilize NeuSa. By the way, I subscribed and liked your video.",
