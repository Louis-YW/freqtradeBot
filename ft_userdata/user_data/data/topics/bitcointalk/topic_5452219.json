  "content": "Looks like the salvo I fired at the mailing list caused an angry reaction on Twitter, and even news reporters are covering it (this guy is no reporter, but some random dude I scrolled past by):Funny how everyone including the news is trying to make it as \"Luke Dashjr vs. the world\" and conveniently ignore that I and other members of this community also stand against them.https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-core-dev-war-brc-20-ordinals-network-spam/Do you guys think I should email these bozos and tell them who's really behind the \"war declaration?\" ðŸ˜‚Anyway, the point being, there are now two groups of (crypto) people: One group (us) who believe that Ordinals and BRC20 are spamming the network and action must be taken against them to preserve its usabilitythis also includes miners and other users who like BRC20 for the fees but would be happy to support any network projects that alleviate the stress on Layer 1, as well as said developers themselves, and people who like the idea of Ordinals but are not happy with the backlog it's causingThe other group is comprised of the shit-token traders themselves, and also a legion of basement dwellers, shitcoiners, and FUD enthusiasts who are proclaiming loudly People have the right to spam the network with BRC20 and Ordinals but refuse to actually do anything about the problem except for bitch and moan like a horde of wild orc[-20]s.Will there be a fork? No.Will actions be taken to insulate bitcoin users from high fees? Yes. Should these blokes be taken seriously? No.But should they be challenged anyway? Yes, because if we don't, newbies will be caught in their disinformation net.We've already seen an exchange try to launch a FUD attack during this chaos (and fortunately they failed). I can see that nearly everyone on this website agrees with me on these points.So, it is time to challenge these claims on other platforms, particularly Twitter, which is still very relevant platform even though it has fallen out of favor. That's where all the post-news firestorms begin anyway.If you cannot code, or draft Bitcoin documents,Know that there are other bitcoiners like you fighting the word-battles over there.Help them.",

Kinda read the convos on that thread. Almost all are CTs and blue tagged people, whom have different opinion about it. Based on the thread they way more favor or bullish on whats happening on the ordinals but some also dont agreed since its affecting the majority. Its just that those guys have a deep pocketed purse that they can make this more longer. Until they are satisfied with the gains they would leave bitcoin nfts behind. Some retailers are takign action as the number of ordinals wallet are increasing.",

It's not a single dev that is against this crap. Most of the community is, and despite the fact that miners may like it though, the community is not only miners, it's all of us.And Luke, obviously should not be left alone fighting the \"civil war\". He was just one person coming up front and saying it out loud. Of course the impact if different because he's a well known and old member of the community and a dev, specifically. So, if it was on me, hell yeah, I would take action on behalf of Luke and any other well known member that may come under any type of media attack or any other type of attack!We are all Satoshi.

Personally, I find the central idea of ordinals quite elegant and true cypherpunk. It is somewhat lazy to evaluate the quality of the implementation, but the fact that this little project was implemented in the rust programming language and was able to compile is already a good recommendation for the quality of the implementation (if you know what I mean). I also understand the arguments against ordinals and some of them seem reasonable to me. But I can't stop thinking that a large part of the source of the resentment on the forum is the selfish fear of losing signature revenue from all those many mixers and casinos that seem to be having problems operating normally in the face of increased transaction fees. Fear is a good motivator and a bad ally. I'd like to avoid splitting and not trying to fix what isn't broken, but if I have to choose sides, I guess I'll take the side without fear.",

Probably Bitcoin itself seemed to be the same junk to an outside observer shortly after the launch of the network. I see the elegance of the ordinals idea in the fact that all satoshi in the block chain are initially implicitly numbered hard.

      "body": "It will be a tough war. On one side you have logic and reason who care for the greater good of Bitcoin with profits balanced healthily within their motives...and then you have the social plebs and profit hungry whales who are trying to make as much as they can out of this feature. Unfortunately, the ones who have the most power are the latter. I am glad that Luke Dashjnr is standing up for the greater interest of Bitcoin and those who look at it from an experienced and knowledgeable angle. Of course, those who are profiting heavily from Ordinals will speak against him.While I think that NFTs and Ordinals do have real use-case, Bitcoin is clearly not ready for it if the ability to spam the chain is as easy as the attackers are currently making it seem. Once this problem is alleviated and plebs wake up and stop buying ridiculous mass-minted graphics for even more ridiculous prices, maybe they can thrive. Until then I think the last few days prove that Ordinals need to be rethought and changed/removed. I think that we will have quite a debate running and problems with the usability of Bitcoin for quite some time. It takes time for things to pass through consensus, for discussion to happen and for the codebase to be changed. Especially when high powered interests are involved in the decision making process and the publicity side of things. Eventually though, good and reason should prevail. It will just take time. I have been wondering what might stop Bitcoin from rallying early before the halving next year, considering the banking turmoil that happened earlier in the year. I suppose this and whatever cascade comes with the height of this consensus problem is the answer to my wonder.
