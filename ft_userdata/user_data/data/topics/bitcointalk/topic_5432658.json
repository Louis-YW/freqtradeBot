People will not laugh if he is shilling it hard to convince them to buy. Bitcoin that time is pretty popular so this kind of comedian is using it catalyst to there joke. He is not a financial adviser but rather a comedian. Laughing at his words and proving him a fool only serves his purpose on what’s his profession. Find words of popular influencers and analyst not a comedian that making a leaving for giving humor to people.I’m not defending him. It’s just criticizing his words is nonsense because it’s a joke for his show.",

It's just a joke but people are going to brand comedians with their remarks about it. The beauty of being a comedian is that even if they tend to be wrong, they could just say it's a joke.  Another cycle will pass in 2025 and $6500 is way behind and this video will keep floating every bear market to remind people.",

I think that even today there are some extremely negative documentaries on that same streaming platform, and it does not surprise me personally.How many people believe what the famous \"Oracle of Omaha\" constantly preaches regarding Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a strong idea and not just an asset, and that is why it will always be a strong asset as well if you do not fix fiat world.The world we live in before bitcoin and after with fiat is not acceptable and it's a horrible place, and that terrible conditions propelled people into crypto and they loved it. I understand not many people may like it at first but that doesn't mean that we are going to end up with something like that forever. I personally would love to see something better but that is not going to change anytime soon.",
