  "content": "I have been forced to pay planned visits to the banks I operate with lately, due to failed transactions, renewal of expired ATM cards and of course to get a bank waiting experience, which I avoided all the while. It really wasn't easy as the queue had to be so full that under the sun was our shade. I kept asking myself what brought me to the bank and how I could resolve my issues without waiting in line for so long for a customer care representative. The network has been so poor that even converting crypto to naira and trading P2P came with risks of failed transactions, money reversals or even debited accounts without successful transaction.It however bordered me how my fellow men and women would bring infant kids they would have easily left at home or borrow thier neighbors or sisters infants or toddlers, just as excuses to gain access into the bank, or is it those customers who know persons working withing the bank. They now use the influence to gain access while other customers remain unattended to under the sun. I don't know what your experience has been of recent, but what I want us to discuss on is what other ways do you know that people use to cheat thier way into the banking halls to perform their transactions despite not being in queue or coming early enough?",

Physical presence in the bank is very unnecessary except for cases of document verification and maybe picking up some physical property like your debit card and the rest of those.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on March 14, 2023, 08:03:54 PMIt however bordered me how my fellow men and women would bring infant kids they would have easily left at home or borrow thier neighbors or sisters infants or toddlers, just as excuses to gain access into the bank, or is it those customers who know persons working withing the bank. True, serious and funny as well. Like, I've seen some women have to do this in other organisations am affiliated with and to my dislike, I rather see the stress they are having to put these infants through and it unsettles me. I can't say of they borrowed the child or something but it shouldn't be. All these struggle would be for a time and get washed up there after. Carry a child around and just any place is exposing the child to a whole lot and that's so uncool.",
