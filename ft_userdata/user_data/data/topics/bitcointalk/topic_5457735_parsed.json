      "body": "It's impossible to go back again to the ATH if there will be more tokens to be unlocked soon. You can see it through CMC if this time gala has 43% of its supply already distributed to the circulating supply. That means there are still 57% remaining to be distributed to the circulating supply (locked)It will be also giving impact to the price of gala in long term. You will be seeing the price will be adjusting its supply. It will be dropping even more with the unlock of more tokens. The new unlocked tokens will be actually distributed to the market. You must be careful when taking this as long term investment.",

I am fairly new so don't fully understand it all if someone could explain? You mentioned that the Gala has added a lot to its supply. It likely means that the total supply of Gla tokens has increased. So it will affect the price dynamics of the token, depending on various factors such as market sentiment, demand, and overall market conditions.Also, there may be other reasons as well.1. Market speculations2. Investor Sentiment3. Project developments4. Partnerships5. Regulatory changes",

The signal for the altcoins bull run is likely the sign that bitcoin bull run is approaching. But we don't know this time if it's going to be the first time to be seen or it's going to be the other one. As long as you can endure this market and you haven't sold and there's a good volume that you can see within it, there's still hope. I just wish you can recover from it.",

Those who bought in 2021 at 40-60 cents should be patient, because it may happen that this coin will never show the same price values again. Among altcoins, it is quite common to find assets that get stuck in a certain price range for a long time.",

Put more effort digging these information and you'll have a better idea where the project is going.Pure technical analysis doesn't do much if issuance rate is too high or has some messed up distribution model. Like i don't have any idea what Gala's dynamic distribution model is but from what OP said they added a lot of tokens lately. That can mess up any charts, like releasing all bounty hunters tokens, advisor, or developer tokens in a short time. There's no liquidity that could handle too much free tokens. No one wants to be a market maker when you know your limit orders are being eaten in a second while there's no bottom in sight.",

I just wanted to be realistic and not expect all time high prices if its unlikely to happen now.",
