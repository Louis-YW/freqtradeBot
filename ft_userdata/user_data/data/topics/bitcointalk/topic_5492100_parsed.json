  "content": "In theory as the bitcoin block reward keeps dropping transaction fees would take the place as payment to miners but If the fees don't increase miners would not be profitable and the hashrate would drop drastically.The fees from transactions pay for the miners so more fees equals more miners therefore the network security is directly proportional to transaction fees. So in theory having a bottleneck on the network via the block size/block rate creates competition for block space and increasing fees which also increases security. If this bottleneck is not sufficient, fees will be low and based on the current fee rate once the coinbase is gone the hashrate will drop to 1-5% of its current hash rate. granted by that time I'm sure competition for block space will increase but fees might still be so low that the hashrate will be a fraction of the current day. For the hashrate to remain the same without the coinbase block reward, transaction fees would have to be ~650 sats/vB.If for example transaction fees remained ~25 sats/vB in the future and bitcoin is 250k USD then there would be an average block reward from fees of 62k USD which would require 9mil USD a day to take over the network. If fees do get up to 650 sats/vB it would cost 234mil USD a day. 65mil USD a day is required to do the same thing in current day.My concern is if the fee rate doesn't eventually replace the coinbase then the network will become less secure. What would be the solution if fees don't increase? Should we reduce the block size/block rate? or flatline the coinbase at some point so there will always be a small amount for miners to gain?",

Or is there something I'm missing here that doesn't make this a concern?TBH, I don't think mining alone is a profitable business, but if you are farming with others then profit will still be made. Miners are already making good profits. Let's break it down a little, they make a profit from block reward which currently is 6.25 right? After halving they will make 3.125. Considering the inflation rate, and other devaluation of fiat and BTC price. We can deduce miners are going to make a lose. But I don't think they only have to depend on Blockreward or fee reward, they can make an equal amount of money if the adoption is doubled. If 2x people will start to use the BTC network, then there will be more tx in blocks waiting for to get processed. More miners will be in the network. Plus the price of one BTC is going to increase as well, if 2x people will adopt BTC than now. An increment in the BTC price and an increment in the adoption rate will still give them healthy rewards. Plus BRC-20 and ordinals are still functional, and according to some miners and CEOs of bitcoin.org miners are not in favor of stopping ordinal's functioning.",

In a worst case scenario, we could change the algorithm, or hope that bitcoin related businesses will take on mining on themselves, as they have vested interest in keeping the network alive.",

Or is there something I'm missing here that doesn't make this a concern?This question always comes up during halving period and the answer is always let’s wait till then. Many have worried in the past that at a reduction like this it wouldn’t be profitable but still we have miners. What will happen is miners who finds out that the process isn’t beneficial or profitable to them again will definitely quit, should it be large computational power that comes down then the difficulty target also reduces thereby inviting more miners too again. As for the concern of whether the network will be decentralized I think yes the only concern will be if the mining nodes each decide to censor transactions they pick but maybe a node will try to harm the network carry out an illegal transaction? It will not happen because there would still be need for consensus",

Bitcoin was less secure 10 years ago when hashrate was a fraction of what it is now, yet it didn't get attacked. It could be true that transaction fee rewards are sufficient to secure the network.Also, there's another variable that almost everyone overlooks. Number of confirmations. If the network is more likely to get 51% attacked, then those who who accept transaction can just require higher number of confirmations. Today we used to treat 1 confirmations or 3 confirmations as secure, in the future it might be 10 or 20. No one is going to pay for coffee with on-chain BTC anyway.",

Lower hash rate, higher risk of 51% attacks. Less decentralization, higher risk of 51% attack.Your thinking is wrong as you can see Bitcoin network hash rate does not go upward with a straight line but it has rises and decreases with time. Bitcoin transaction fee goes to miners each block increases or decreases too, it comes from demands of Bitcoin users and hypes on this blockchain.Latest hypes are from Ordinals, BRC20 tokens and Bitcoin miners got a lot of bitcoins in transaction fees, it's their extra profit in 2023. Recent months, the hype cools down but do you see any worse security on Bitcoin network, to prove your thinking is right?Inscriptions, Mempools and Miners",

It could be true that transaction fee rewards are sufficient to secure the network.Im not sure but I believe this is a good question. back then bitcoins market cap was probably only a few million so making an attack wouldn't be worth the effort. but now the market cap is 2 trillion, which is probably a million times higher which means the hashrate would need to be a million times higher to have the same security to value ratio as 10 years ago.So security of the network should be proportional to the total value of it or the total market cap of bitcoin.Also I think It would be better to look at the energy consumption of the mining network instead of the total hashrate because the hashrate increases from more miners and improvements to mining hardware. So looking at energy consumption cancels out the hardware improvement factor and would give a better estimate of difficultly to pull off a 51% attack.If energy consumption of the network remained the same hashrate would still go up giving an illusion of increased network security.",

The fee market and the demand curve will always have a point of saturation where additional fees and demands doesn't increase the total revenue. Lightning network is absolutely needed to offload some of it on the second layer while still maintaining on-chain settlement.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on April 09, 2024, 02:02:56 AMIt help indirectly because with less input cost for mining, Bitcoin miners will install more rigs, add more hashrate to the network, that makes the network more secured. It improves security.The cost is related of the revenue of Bitcoin mining, and thereby if your revenue of the miner drops, then the cost to attain X% of the hashrate decreases proportionally. The simple logical way of thinking is that miners won't mine at a loss and a drop in revenue equates to either a scaledown in operation or a slower growth. Even if your efficiency of ASIC gets ridiculously high, the cost of them would be a key factor in whether Bitcoin gets attacked or not.In addition, we go through this so-called renewal of ASICs when newer ASICs are released. Miners will not purchase them unless it makes sense, ROI is better than the current ASICs and that all of the scrap and cost overheads are accounted for.Block size increase, increased in demand for blockspace, etc. These are the key factors to consider. If Bitcoin doesn't go mainstream by the time coinbase rewards goes to negligible, then it would be an issue.",

Bitcoin can function without block rewards in the future. Let's assume that Bitcoin survives and will still be the mainstream currency in 100 years, when there will be no reward collected from mined blocks. If we assume this, then it automatically means that Bitcoin is a very popular currency, used by millions of people every day. If it's used by millions of people, we should also assume that Bitcoin's block size is way higher than just 4MB, it will probably be 64MB or something like that, or even flexible. So, now imagine, instead of 4K transaction per block, we have 200K transactions per block (don't forget that Bitcoin is popular and adopted). This automatically means that fees collected from blocks will be profitable for mining companies and on top of that, fees will remain low for users.",

I think having a dynamic block size with an upper and lower limit that adjusts based on fee rate would be the best answer I can think of.a dynamic size that has upper and lower limits that adjust..um going down in size is harder to control as you then have to do silly mile stones of accept 4mb upto X blocknumber(height) then only accept 3mb upto x block number if you want the size lower limit..its much easier to just SCALE(slowly progress) in a upward way not a constant yo-yo up and down.. and when i say scale(slowly progress) in a upward way.. no its not leaping to millions of megabytes in a month... and no its not move to a small increase once a decadebut it doees mean doing things like each difficulty retarget.. where every Xfew months, year or halving move forward based on high % fill per block over X blocks as the decision maker where code sets the blocksize target growth.. not dev politics of having to code and adjust milestones every so often manuallyEG if 52500 blocks(1 year) =X gb(of Y gb(95%)) then increase blocksize by Z%whereby current would be x=200 y=210where the code itself keeps the variables re-targetting/updated and not need devs to manually dictate/decide the next adjustment next year",
