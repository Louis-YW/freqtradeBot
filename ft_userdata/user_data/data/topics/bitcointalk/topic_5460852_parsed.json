  "content": "Naija nor dey hear word. I remember that MMM time how plenty of us rush shook head enter. Even after e close some other ponzi scheme still show face and we still shook head despite say our money still been dey hang for MMM at that time. Wetin make me dey write this na because say we don come a long way from the MMM ponzi era. One thing wey I don observe be say, Ponzi nor go ever fit stop. E go hard our government  stop am or regulate am. And lastly, we too get coconut head even when we sabi say na ponzi we go still shook head. Maybe why e be like this na because say e dey our nature as Nigerians and human beings, our present economic realities, coupled with the fact say we nor get strong agency to regulate am.History dey always repeat himself. Ponzi's don rebrand themselves...now na crowdfunding them be especially all these agro-crowding funding/ agripartnership. Them go tell you say una dey contribute money to fund agricultural projects like maize, fish, cassava, cotton, piggery, poultry etc. Some of these companies wey don scam Nigerians include - Farm Power and Payfarmer to Goldvest, Emerald Farms, Vestpay, HO Corn, FarmKonnect, Farm Sponsor. Dem go promise us 50% OR 100% ROI after some months or days. The point of this write up nor be do drop advice make una nor invest or make una invest. The point be say, I sabi say one of our mentalities be say na who enter first go cash out then run comot before e crash. Wetin I wan ask una be say how much of una income wey una go fit dey willing to risk for this these kind rebranded ponzis - 1%, 2% , 3%?",

      "body": "It would be good if you edit the OP and change it to rebranded ponzis, instead of speculative investment. Example of speculative investment are cryptocurrencies.Quote from: https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/speculative-investment/#:~:text=A%20speculative%20investment%20is%20when,and%20margin%20trading%20of%20stocks.A speculative investment is when an investor hopes to profit from a rapid change in the value of an asset, often one that's considered non-productive. Many speculative investments are short-term, and they can be made in markets such as foreign currencies, collectives, fine art, and margin trading of stocks.I have a friend that lost millions of naira on such investment two years ago. Finally he realized that he has been scammed. Not only him, but many of them.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gave me the opportunity to have full control over my money, I do not have to trust someone to invest for me.I can put zero (0) naira into such investment.",
