After completing all of my tasks for the day or week, I simply go to an online casino to play a game, search the site for new and interesting features or games, or read the blog.4) Extra cashEvery time I have a little extra money that I know I can afford to spend, I deposit it into my online casino wallet and play some games. It's been worthwhile thus far. When I stay away from online casinos1) Family/relationship or personal challengeSince we are all human, we face difficulties in life. On days like these, when I feel burdened by my family, my relationships, or a personal difficulty, I avoid playing at online casinos. I do not turn to online casinos as a coping strategy; instead, I address it head-on.2) Unhappy/ Over happyWhen I am overly happy or unhappy, I avoid visiting an online casino.

The timing doesn’t matter to me because I always focus when I’m accessing on the casino. I have a bad experience playing in the casino while I have someone in my back discussing about some personal topic. It makes me lost focus and made a huge bet by mistake that turn into losses, After that I never play gambling outside my gaming room with other people around.I don’t play when I don’t have enough sleep or in the middle of the night because this is the time when I have less patience on making controlled bets.",

When I saw it it made me smile because in such case it matters to you less if you have enough money to gamble or some free time. What matters is they're offering a bonus and you can't miss out on this opportunity. This really reads like a story from gamblers anonymous  I gamble on big events like the World Cup. It's not about whether I have time as it takes just a few minutes to bet. It also doesn't mater how much money I have because I can do with just $10. Any win makes me happy. I don't do it for big money, rather to feel some excitement and spike up the game.",

Although I myself find myself visiting casinos or Betting places whenever I go on a vacation. I always find time to visit casinos and I always feel like my trip wasn't complete if I didn't give myself the time to visit one.

Agreed, that moment when you just know from your gut you'd win, I always relish that, and I know it is a good sign that I should gamble or at least relax on a casino instead of wasting my life away in front of a computer, it's like a prompt in my brain that tells me I need to unwind and enjoy the fruits of my labor. Although of course, I don't gamble when I don't have extra cash onn me.",

And if I lose money, I might have a horrible day, which would affect my efficiency, productivity and output.Do you have a best time when you visit an online casino and when you totally steer clear from them?Overall, what you have to say represents my voice and perhaps that of many members of our community.To be honest, I have never defined the best time to play online casino or the time to avoid it. however, not infrequently the situation that occurs can be the opposite and what our mood is. in fact, often when we are having problems for example, family, work, or so on, we tend to look for other diversions and one of them is visiting online casinos to vent the problems we are experiencing. or maybe vice versa, when we have free time, I often spend time with my family and avoid visiting online casinos. for bonus points/promotions, extra money, we totally agree.But the only thing out of all the points you included is only point 3 which makes me completely avoid online casinos. (3)work/project. I always avoid visiting online casinos, as long as I'm in a work environment. for me, work is the most important thing and I must have responsibility with my work. after finishing, maybe I can channel my hobbies and visit online casinos. maybe, that's the best time for me.",

Besides that it's hard to see how anyone gets much fun out of clicking buttons, being distracted by side games after you've lost a chunk already and generally just losing money consistently as the house hoovers it all up. You should definitely try to find a baseline of your emotions and be aware of situations where you might be going in while very unhappy, as the psychology they put into these setups is very sophisticated. If you start losing and you're in a fragile emotional state, it's very possible that you will run up lots more losses as you chase it.",

According to him, he said he had everything planned already -- how he'll change his grade when he got 'em funds but unfortunately, one game ruined the whole plans for him -- that was his last saving according to him. The point now is; how's he gonna cope when he's utilized everything on something that didn't fetch anything back? He had major projects like you do buh gambling became his priority and his plans were thwarted automatically... This should really teach gamblers to atleast, have this self control atimes.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

I also like playing games when I am in the company of friends that are gamblers. As we are gambling, we also discuss some other personal issues, which make the whole thing very interesting. My worst time to gamble is when I am having health challenge. I would stay away totally for casinos if I am not feeling too well.

So if I have personal or financial issues at hand, then I will settle that first, otherwise you can gamble with peace of mind and might not enjoy it. Free time? sometimes I just want to take a rest and not to gamble even if I have free time. It must be a perfect combination of feeling right or lucky + money to start my gambling.",
