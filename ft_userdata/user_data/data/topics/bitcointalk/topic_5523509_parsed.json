On a more serious note Bitcoin is the king of all other coins, and it has a more solid and reliable foundations and at such every other coins bows where their performance solely depends on Bitcoin. However, you must understand that the only coin that has holding potential is Bitcoin hence anyone one holding other coins other than Bitcoin is at a bigger risk. But yeah no doubt the $100k Bitcoin milestone is indeed a motivation to Bitcoin holders as a prove for more confident in what Bitcoin can become even in the nearest future and at such increasing a wider spread adoption and many more investors are also coming in to the market.",

When we want to consider altcoins, it is because we have heard about how bitcoin all started and we think going for others too may give the same accurate results for us instead of us waiting for the bitcoin market to crash or plummet in other for us to invest, just as the default has been set, that bitcoin is the lead while all other coins follows in cryptocurrency, also, we cant deny the fact that each coins have their season, but in most cases, bitcoin determines for others.",

The effect is that many people begin to have hopes that their altcoins will do well because Bitcoin is doing well and this mislead people most times to invest into altcoins that'll be a regret when it doesn't meet their expectations. The success of Bitcoin would rub off other cryptocurrency but we should not use that judgement to make our decision on what to invest into because some time not all altcoins get impacted. Bitcoin has made more investors to become hodlers and they no longer hold only Bitcoin but they extend this behaviour into altcoins including memecoin that their future isn't known because of their uncertainty. Many investors now hodl coins that would not see a new all time high again because they think since Bitcoin is doing well that altcoins season will be the next thing to happen.",

Bitcoin reaching that height shows that there is more to still be achieved, and it has made way for other currencies to also have their own fair share, which most have broken to their ATH and create new ones too. We can say that this is one of the influences and effects of the Bitcoin price increase.",

But do remember, when Bitcoin falls then the same will probably happen to other cryptocurrencies market because of the sudden decline in trust rating. There will always be weak hands that will definitely sell without thinking twice when they see a sudden spike down. Especially those who invested lots of money and didn't want to end up being poor in the process. The Hodlers on the other hand, they will probably keep it without even having the idea to sell for a long time.",

It's positive effect.There are unfortunately some negative effects. It causes more greediness in investors and newbies so they will spend their money more carelessly in this market. It causes altcoin developers of projects launched in previous market cyles, can abandon their projects, to create new ones that are more trendy in this new market cycle.Altcoins are risky, they can die or can be abandoned by founders and developers.",

So what effect do you think the BTC growth added to other currencies? The growth of Bitcoin is driven by the interest rate that is willing to buy Bitcoin at any time because when it can continue to grow every year of course there are other effects such as the increase in the price and value of Bitcoin itself so the same thing can also happen to other coins when the community of other coins can continue to grow. But from what we have seen now is quite real where there are many coins that have experienced a price drop including Bitcoin when there was a rate cut from the FED although I thought it was just a coincidence.",

Simple since the beginning Bitcoin is the parent and every time bitcoin moves up or down it will affect the altcoin market as a whole without exception. Because altcoin liquidity depends on the price of bitcoin, I mean every investor and crypto developers stick to the main asset bitcoin in terms of profit, it has been proven that when bitcoin experiences a rally and provides profit then altcoin projects get funding.",

If you don't want stable coins, don't want cash, the best choice for you is Bitcoin, not altcoins. Bitcoin is my favorite choice when I feel that it can have a big movement especially if it has risk of correction is coming. If Bitcoin has a correction, altcoins will have much deeper corrections, and your examples are true. Bitcoin is down 10%, altcoins are down 20%, 30% or 40%.Like when Bitcoin breaks $100,000 and moves above $110,000, altcoins did not move up too much, they are side way and during these days, when Bitcoin is down 1%, altcoins are down 10% because people are fearful that Bitcoin bull run completes and bear market will come soon.",
