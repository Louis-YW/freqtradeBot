You can transfer cryptos to your contacts on WireMin. They support multiple wallets, making transactions between close friends much easier. Everything can be completed within one app, the talking, the copying wallet address, the notification, etc.",

Anyway, i just have 1 question for now. How well WireMin compared with non-centralized social media/messanger such as Matrix, XMPP or other option which can be categorized as Fediverse (such as Mastodon and Lemmy)?I am not here to promote WireMin, which is why I haven't provided any links. If people are interested, they can search for it on their own.  As for your question, I believe its strength lies in its resistance to censorship. While off-topic posts can result in bans on platforms like Mastodon and Lemmy, it appears this won't happen on WireMin according to their FAQ. Additionally, users can remain fully anonymous; no email or phone number is required when creating accounts.",

If you're trying to encourage people to use or discuss the app, maybe moving this thread to Service discussion is better.Quote from: Kimsha on October 11, 2023, 09:18:37 AMWhile off-topic posts can result in bans on platforms like Mastodon and Lemmy, it appears this won't happen on WireMin according to their FAQ. How would they handle spam then? Do they expect the user to manually manage their social media feed and block each spammer? Sounds annoying to their users imo.",
