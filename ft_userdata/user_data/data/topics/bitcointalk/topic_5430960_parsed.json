Do you have any address that was noncustodial means you have the private key of the address and you deposited some amount from that address? If you have the case resolving is easy since you will have very strong support to prove the ownership. If you don't then may be communicate with them using the email that was used to register with them. If the email address is changed then you will need to tell them which was the first email that you used to register with them and send them a test email from that email account.",

Everyone is passing through a lot in this time, including companies. It may be that their support use to formerly be five stars but have now changed. Slow response from support may be an indication that they have reduced their support team by dropping off some people, or that the issues been handled by the support team they have is too many for them. Maybe you should just exercise some more patience, I am sure you will be attended to or as you have been advised, try contacting their representative here.",

I am not saying OP is doing this, but I would say it's a common problem across casinos and thus why it can take longer than a genuine person would like to ensure we are absolutely returning an account to the correct person.This is a fair response. I once worked in a customer service setting designated in unlocking accounts that have went dormant for months, or are VIP accounts (in a retail setting) that has a lot of perks and bonuses. Every now and then we will have some random bloke claiming to be the owner of the account, says they forgot their password, emails and all that stuff tied to unlocking the account. However, they have some IDs that can provide verification that they are indeed the true owner of the account. I guess since this is related to cryptocurrencies, it would only be fair if a signed message from previously used address is obtained. However, knowing the habits of a lot of people in crypto today, it is possible that the original account holder may have used exchanges to transfer funds to and from the gambling account.. but who knows?Quote from: bobstone on December 22, 2022, 12:09:15 PMI would say a few days in such a case isn't a fair amount of time to make public accusations that are not well evidenced but it seems the norm for us here, we provide a good and clear service and fringe cases like this are the ones that appear on the forums and not all are genuine (again, not making claims about OP i really am going into this blind but there is a pattern out there that is clear to see of and i might need more coffee )Bobstone,DuckDice Live Support Given how things are mostly online nowadays, I think OPs concern regarding turnaround times in-between emails is just valid. Fast replies are needed in these kinds of requests as it gives the OP and you a lot more time to discuss things if there is a constant and timely stream of messages between each parties up until the issue is resolved.",

Therefore, they won't consider it as the way to verify the ownership of an account. In the other thread, you have said that you got the access of your Binance account and Stake casino account by submitting KYC details. Can you show us the proof of the conversations with those platforms support team. You are a high roller in casino, you had more than $100k in your wallet but it is questionable that you had no backup of your accounts & wallets!",

OP is doing the same thing now.Well, we like to be fact-based do we not I suppose such is perhaps in the subjective area, but as i say, it's a methodology that is attempted time and time again not just in our casino but across the business sadly  Whether OP is or isn't doing this is by the by to my comments i guess but that was a very particular good example of why we have to be so careful.--- as to regards on being quick and efficient in communication being a must, of course, you're right  it's always the goal just I can't speak to this individual case as I do not handle account security personally, as I've been made aware he's been given all the relevant information as stated earlier as to what we will require for proof of ownership and as said KYC isn't really always one of the things that can help such a case as pointed out by other posters and as another poster also stated i am aware it's not always so easy like for example depositing directly from an exchange to do so but it's why it's very important in all areas of net life to protect your data and accounts carefully so such situations like this can be avoided when genuine. ----",

Now, about what you say why they get 5 stars, maybe they have paid people to do a review about their platform and they will rate it 5 stars, it's that simple. But I don't think all platforms do that.

But not sure if they can transfer all of that to the new account though.The OP is back to square one.",
