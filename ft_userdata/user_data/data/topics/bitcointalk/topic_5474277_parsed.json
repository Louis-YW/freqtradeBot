Never say never.Slot games are thoroughly based on luck and not how much you know about the games unlike sports betting, for slot you have to rely on luck and if it's not your lucky day yet in spite of how much you might want to be unperturbed by trying more you just keep losing more money. So when it's not your day it's just not your day.",

I won this spin 2 days ago and I thought that betting history still remains for a long time. I didn’t manage to share the post here immediately since I close the game immediately that time when I won since I’m very happy that time. The good part is I purchased my winnings when Bitcoin drop yesterday and gain more profit out of it.Quote from: Amphenomenon on November 16, 2023, 08:26:12 AM probably with the same $0.25.

I just become motivated when I watch this specific slot game due to graphics and the streamer win huge multiplier. You’ll never know when luck hits us hard so it’s important to keep trying but not in addictive way.",

So I try to replicate and play that game and used that buy bonus. Although I didn't win as huge as he his because he has more capital than me, still though I won big and I'm happy for that. And same thing as well, I told him that I won in mahjong slot games and he tried and he showed me screen shots on how much money he won. Perhaps we could connect this as what the OP tells us. He watch some streamers and so he is entice to play the same game and motivated to get a big win as well and so it does happen. Not saying that it will always bring us good fortune, but I guess staying positive might end up with a good results.",

But bonus buy can make the probability of that to increase if compared with other bets, bonus buy helps gamblers to win more. But in the process that some people want to win huge and they use bonus buy, more money is required and this can lead to more loss. So we can still say that is his lucky day.",

After winning big, did you submit any withdrawal and did they approve, proceed that withdrawal for you?If they are legit, they will allow you to withdraw your money. If they only give you big wins from bonus and use it as a hook to convince you deposit more money to your account to bet more, with hope to win bigger and can withdraw a massive big win from your own money, it can be a scam platform.At the end they might refuse any withdrawal and you lose your money deposited in your account on their platform.",

Maybe OP was really lucky that day so he could get a win with a large enough amount in my opinion. Honestly, I have never watched stremer to be able to motivate my gambling, because before I never thought of doing that and also never felt that by watching stremer I would have higher confidence to win, yes that means everyone has their own way in every gambling, if indeed that way is effective enough for you then do it but also must be with a full level of caution, because of course it is not unusual if the final result does not match what you expected.That's right, even though it works for them, it doesn't mean that it won't work for us, it's possible. And for myself maybe I will just enjoy gambling with my own beliefs and ways, I will be able to enjoy my gambling more in my own way, because I come not too much hope for victory but more for entertainment. I don't think there is a single accurate strategy for better results because of course everything will go randomly and only luck will help us to realize such hopes.",

Highly doubt I'd even get lucky even if I started watching one as well.
