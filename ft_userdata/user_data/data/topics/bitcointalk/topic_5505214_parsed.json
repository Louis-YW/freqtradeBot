More people will have their own full node if it is it is rewarding. It can be an amount of bitcoin that is lower than mining reward. But with node runners not having any reward, the network is still decentralized.",

Then who's paying for it? Taking a cut from the miners is going to discourage a lot of them from mining.

It seems Bitcoin Core has embraced the digital gold narrative, which fails to achieve the original goal of P2P electronic cash. Do these developers really know better?Lets just say that when Satoshi created bitcoin, he or they never imagined that Bitcoin will become what it is today, they created it with a goal or idea of it becoming an internet medium of exchange where users can send value abroad to different parts of the world easily, fast and at a very minimal fee, instead of having to spend a huge sum of money in fees, just to send a small amount of fiat abroad, and at the same time, the reciever will have to wait days and weeks before the money is received.The person or group, Satoshi nakamoto never expected that Bitcoin will become as big as it is today, so let's just agree that Bitcoin, aside the fact that it still can serve as a medium of exchange and transfer of value abroad, it's also have become a digital gold, one who's value have appreciated greatly and made lots of early adopters multi millionaires and billionaires.",

I've seen this happen one too many times with a lot of people who assume that just cause they've invested in cryptocurrencies, they're already bound to be rich or whatever.

Bitcoin adoption has increased over the years. The currency has become a key player in the global economic and political space. However, some conditions have slowed the speed of adoption..Price volatility could be one of the reasons why many people are not using it as a medium of exchange. Unfavorable government policies such as bans, fines, and other restrictions have also affected the spread of the use of Bitcoin.

The idea was to provide an alternative, decentralized form of money that couldn't be controlled by governments or banks. However, as Bitcoin has evolved, it's leaned more towards being treated like \"digital gold\" rather than a practical day-to-day currency. This shift has frustrated some who see it as a move away from its original goal of being peer-to-peer electronic cash.",
