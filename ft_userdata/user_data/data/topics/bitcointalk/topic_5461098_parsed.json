Merit source should be by application, not nomination. Maybe nomination is not the right word that I should use, but you people understand what I am implying. Any established member can come up as long as he/she is able to look for ten good posts that he/she can use to apply.But theymos has sent PM of merit source offer to some of the members of this forum before which are good posters.",

The merit source approval has to be with application first, there’re some criteria needed for a person to become a merit source, I don’t think if they don’t have that criteria they’ll just be given the role. Merit source as a I know is a selfless and voluntary service to the forum, it requires you to go through the post of others for the best posts that needs merits but lacks enough merit. If one does not show concern or commitment that they want to be one, I don’t think they’ll be granted just like that.",

Quality and meaningful engagement is what matters now as to pave way for the process to scale through successfully.
