Every crypto platforms need different kinds of professionals to operate, so there are programmers, designers, advertisers, support team, financial analysts and advisors... All these people can live from crypto income, working for one or several companies at once.On this forum, thanks to signature campaigns, it has been a reality for many members. The tendency is that the number of spots available in crypto industry rises in some years, as we enter a new positive market trend, so more people will be able to join this sector and earn a decent income from it for a living.",

      "body": "Yeah, like any other industry. The only difference is there's less jobs available simply because of the currency being new, and therefore the companies are limited, and even when we do have established companies they aren't recruiting a massive amount of people, when compared to Google etc. You can pretty much make money any way you want in this world. Obviously, complying to local laws goes without saying, but if you have the skills required for cryptocurrencies you likely have the skills to earn outside of cryptocurrency, which isn't exactly always the case visa versa. I personally wouldn't class mining as a full time job, but then again we do have people that are running multi thousands pounds worth of hardware, earning above the average yearly salary of their company. I guess it could be considered a job. However, as a average individual, probably not.",

But when you realise that it is stated that the campaigns could be stopped anytime, you will understand  that campaigns are not permanent jobs. It’s a reality that people these days are not looking for small but stable income, but rather jobs that will give them higher compensation even if it means they are only considered as gigs or side income. And people have found it in crypto community. For me, you will really make a good way of earning from crypto jobs, but relying on it for the rest of your life might definitely be a risky decision. Security of your jobs is not certain, as some jobs are only offered only for a month or two, or less than a year, after that you will struggle again to find another job. The reason why it’s best and more secured if you have a real and stable job outside crypto.",

Crypto is still new to us and we’re not even sure if it’s staying for good or not, as it can be gone anytime and we will lost access to our jobs eventually. So the risk is certainly high. That is why it’s better to find a real job that will sustain your way of living, and just consider crypto jobs as additional source of your income. Though crypto offers well compensated jobs, but it’s always safe to only consider them as your side jobs.",

But o can also confirm it to be yes, many people have a crypto full time job nowadays and work remotely and comfortably more than other regular jobs.I will be highly happy to secure a full time crypto job because it will give you apple time dor yourself.

For me, the typical answer is Yes, because thou crypto may not be as old as the oil company, banking film and other well known white collar jobs, but it has got a high potential of staying forever due to its massive adoption in most countries. And if you can remember,  Binance is a crypto company that have been in the business for quite a long while since 2017 (i.e 5yrs now), and has got a lot of people working  for Binance in different parts of the world who are been paid very well with a very huge sum of money, working as either customer service personnel or any other job",

But if you are skillful, probably my answer is yes, it would be profitable if you will work hard in crypto as a full-time job.
