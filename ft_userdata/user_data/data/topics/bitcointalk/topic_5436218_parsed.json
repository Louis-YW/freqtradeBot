One of the reason has been pointed out by @OP where he get mocked by other people (I assuming it's his friend) so you will lose your confident and your emotional will play more than your logic. Even if you're successfully stand with your choice e.g. holding your coin, not convert it to USDT, after then you will mock them back and they would mad to you.There's a chance your friendship will ruined and they might attack you when you're already success.",

They will say anything to get the views and subscribers. I hate to burst your bubble but this is isn’t a bull run, bitcoin is still at 20-21k range which is very far from its previous ATH. Like you said you’re a newbie in profits and its quite understandable you term the current price as a bull run.

I would check my wallet every chance I got to know if I’m in profits or not. It’s not healthy at all, and I will advise you focus on accumulating for long term gains, if you’re not selling anytime soon there’s no point checking your wallet everyday.",

Some may have been surprised, others not - but the beginning of the year began with very good economic results on the stock market, as well as predictions that the central banks will not be too harsh in raising interest rates this year.This is definitely not the big bull run that comes after the halving (at least it was like that in the past), but for those who took advantage of the opportunity and bought cheaply like the OP, everything that is happening seems like the beginning of a beautiful story in the financial sense.

That might be great news for you unlike most people that are still hodling when Bitcoin was still in its all time high. So you won't expect people that got their Bitcoin when the price was Approximately $50,000 to $60,000 to be celebrating because the price of Bitcoin has risen from $15,000 to $23,000. Not until the price get to $40,000 or more I still won't consider it has a bull run.But I still have hope that we're going to see the better side of Bitcoin before  the year runs out.

There’s a high chance that Bitcoin bear enter again once bulls show some exhaustion with this rally. The number of Bitcoin short position is very low and this is the reason why there’s no hurdle for the price to pump.All that buyers aim is to have profit. I’m sure they will take profit at some point once bulls weaken. Enjoy and secure profit as always.",
