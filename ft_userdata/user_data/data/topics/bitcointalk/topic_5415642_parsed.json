The activities of the Indigenous People's of Biafra (IPOB) can be attested to be the main starting point leading to the major challenges of insecurities in Nigeria. This challenges emanated due to several defaults concerning the political Leadership of Nigeria such as Corruption, Nepotism, problems of ethnic pandemonium, religious crisis, regional crisis and so on. Security being an essential prerequisite for true and lasting economic growth of a country, without it can lead to disruption of economic activities, decimation of consumer confidence, decrease in foreign direct investment (FDI), increase in brain drain, decline in productivity, etc.This article will only be confined to emphasis on the issues of Corruption and Nepotism as the main Cardinals leading to the major factors that pose a threat to the challenges of insecurities in Nigeria.HISTORY OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE INSECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA SINCE INDEPENDENCE.Nigeria has faced a number of insecurity concerns since gaining independence in 1960, caused by several factors constituting Corruption, Mismanagement of Public funds, Embezzlement, problems of ethnic pandemonium, religious crisis, regional crisis, nepotism and political instabilities among others. Nigeria also experienced an upsurge of military rule shortly after independence as a result of so many factors including, politicization of the army, lack of free and fair elections, regional and tribal based political party, regional differences, Corruption, etc. However, even with the coming of the military, the problems of insecurity persist. This is because the military has likewise failed miserably in tackling the major issues behind the country's insecurity challenges, preferring instead to exploit power for personal and selfish benefit. The major issues connected with the insecurity challenges of Nigeria are very much numerous but this article will be confined to talk about Corruption and Nepotism as the basic elements constituting the state of insecurity of Nigeria.        Taking the definition of Corruption simply as the inability to do the right thing, at the right time and within the right position and also Nepotism as the giving of an unfair advantages to your own family if you are in a position of power, especially by giving them jobs, the government has always been prioritizing these elements of both Corruption and Nepotism thereby leading to unfair treatments of some fractions of the society that can easily lead to conflict grown out of grudges and dissatisfactions; a case study of the Indigenous People's of Biafra (IPOB) who out of having the feeling of being marginalized begins to agitate for a secession. Although the IPOB movement threaded the wrong path in the cause of fighting for their position in the heart of the society by waging war against the government and without any doubts requires the government's urgent response to tackle them as insurgents who are trying to debilitate, destabilize and harm the peace and security of the country but the issues connected to the cause of all the violence shouldn't be completely neglected. These elements of politics of Corruption and Nepotism as continued to play a major role to the even recent challenges of insecurities especially in the Northern parts of Nigeria.POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE INSECURITY CHALLENGES BEDEVILING THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA. Without deflecting, the government must ensure to take serious actions to tackle the problems of insecurities in Nigeria ranging from strengthening the security agencies, improvement of possession of sophisticated arms and ammunition and consequently recruitment of the State Policing to ensure a grassroot eradication of insecurity in the country. The State Policing must be taken as a core foreign policy objective to facilitate a drastic measure in tackling the issue of insecurities as bedeviling the political economic development of the country presently as an avenue of the government to correct one of it's default in the fight against the problems of insecurities in the country.  Conclusively, without failing to point out the overarching problems of Corruption and Nepotism in the Political administration of Nigeria, the government of Nigeria must shun every act of Corruption or Nepotism especially in the areas of dealing with the problems of insecurities in the country.",
