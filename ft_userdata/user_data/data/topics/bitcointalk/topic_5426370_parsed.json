  "content": "Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) denied claims that he was the culprit for the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. FTX experienced a liquidity crisis shortly after Binance's founders announced to liquidate all FTT tokens.According to Binance's CEO, CZ, he was not the cause of the FTX collapse, but FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) who designed this, CZ also said \"SBF as one of the biggest scammers of all time.\"CZ claims that SBF intends to establish itself as a hero in the destruction of the FTX exchange, as well as maintain the narrative that he made a mistake.Interestingly, Binance's CEO was accused of being responsible for the fall of the exchange after the announcement of the liquidation of FTT, FTX's native token. However, Zhao said \"if FTX's business model is healthy, it won't collapse in a single tweet\".Binance's CEO revealed this in response to a Bloomberg report trying to link the FTX collapse to CZ's twitter.Read more => https://trynews.id/ceo-binance-mengatakan-pendiri-ftx-sebagai-salah-satu-penipu-terbesar-dalam-sejarah/",

FTX's model was bad, but the timing of the liquidation of the tokens was not innocent.

Just wanna clear out that CZ/Binance are for sure doing some shady stuff that we have no idea about, but I doubt that he is so stupid to use users funds in massive way to cover his other businesses, like SBF did. And if he is indeed doing that, truth will be revelead soon.Quote from: Husires on December 07, 2022, 03:23:31 PMChangpeng Zhao (CZ)'s attempt to appear as the \"meek lamb\" in this story is very funny.

Related to SBF, its unbelievable that this guy is still freely walking around like nothing happened but I guess all those millions he gave are now doing its work. Looking how situation is developing, I doubt that he will see any prison at all.",

While CZ and Binance is still standing up, for sure that there would be other competitors that wants him down and will sure to pull him down. Well, this is like the politics that we see at all times whether it's in crypto or not. If we change the situation and CZ was the one that has gotten down, then he'll sure to be called out as what's the shoes fit in with SBF right now. I'm not on either side but for sure with such fund and money from their users, it's just a matter on how they're handling and managing it and SBF caught misused it.",

He's a criminal and yet he's been giving interviews around as if he didn't commit anything. Why is he still a free man until now? It certainly pays off to give millions to powerful people.",

Anyways blaming one another is not going to compensate the loss made by the users so this should atleast be a lofe lesson for upcoming traders who uses centralized exchanges.",

How can a leading exchange with the 2nd largest trading volume in the market, and before that, they claimed to have 10 billion available and ready to buy back 500 million FTT if CZ sold it, collapse so quickly?",

This can be avoided if they have terms that protect them on moves like this by CZ. Clearly Sam trust that CZ will never gonna pull out there assets due to the profit that they are giving. It’s too bad that CZ decided to cut lose with them to dominate again the market.CZ is part of the collapse of FTX because he knew that will happened before he decided to stirred the issue about Binance pulling there asset. This bullshit claim of CZ is just an act to clean his hands but destroying FTX is part of his plan. The crypto market is just a collateral on the war between the 2 giant crypto exchange.Quote from: trytrades69 on December 07, 2022, 09:10:51 AMInterestingly, Binance's CEO was accused of being responsible for the fall of the exchange after the announcement of the liquidation of FTT, FTX's native token.

Only no brainer will believe that CZ didn’t plan the fall of FTX. Possibly he knew how rotten the financial status of FTX that’s why he knew when to press his attack for a sure damage.Quote from: trytrades69 on December 07, 2022, 09:10:51 AMRead more => https://trynews.id/ceo-binance-mengatakan-pendiri-ftx-sebagai-salah-satu-penipu-terbesar-dalam-sejarah/It will be better if you will share the source in english since you are posting in global discussion board.",
