They will not choose wether its for charity or not, as long as they can get money from that they will grab it. Who the heck give a copy of their key to anyone? That’s not advisable and you should not do that at all cost.",

If he knows how to secure that wallet, most probably hackers wont get it easily but incidents already happened and probably it will be hard to recover those money. This is why we should always protect our keys and our system, if we have the money better to avail the highest security option available in the market to avoid this kind of problem.",

Stop using Bitcoin, Windows, Linux, phones, the internet etc.Something as simple as a yes/no vote for approving funds being moved wouldn't be exploited unless someone with your understanding programmed it leaving a back door to be exploited.Sounds to me like you didn't even read HOW these \"smart contracts\" were exploited before talking like an ass hole. Did you buy your forum account or something? How does someone who is as active as you on this forum make a post that ignorant while trying to call someone a \"newbie in the space\"?  Learn at least the basics of smart contracts before you talk, noob.",

In case we accidentally leaked our private keys then we should act quick and transfer the amount into a fresh wallet and then totally abandon the old one as hacker may hack it anytime if they haven't started yet. Quote from: Guessti on September 05, 2022, 10:12:06 PMNow that Ethereum is suppose to get cheaper to use, will people instead of maybe giving a few people a copy of your key, Cheaper in terms of what? Fees? I think this isn't confirmed yet but we will observe it, these coming days if there's really an improvement in terms of fees. Private keys should be kept in private, that is why its name is private keys. I think those people who gave it are newbies or out of their mind if they aren't really a newbie after all.",

When ever they get a change they would distribute it amongst themselves.Aren't the migration from PoW to PoS supposed to make the Ethereum blockchain to scale better, and with that better scaling I think it will affect the gas fee because then the Ethereum blockchain will be processing more and faster transaction. At least that's what I understand, so maybe not directly but it will still affect the gas fee.",
