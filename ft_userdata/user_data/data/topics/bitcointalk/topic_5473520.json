  "content": "Let me give you my first experience joining this @Bitcointalk.org.As a beginner sometimes my posts are considered spam or come from Ai,I'm here trying to straighten out what happened, basically I'm a beginner, but before I create an account @Bitcointalk.org I often joined my friends in discussing the this forum discussion live, taking place at home (reunion) while having a chat, sometimes in a nearby coffee shop, sometimes in a magnificent & beautiful cafe, and there are still many places we visited.For a long time, my friend taught me how to discuss on the site, my friend said that discussions on this forum can be done using laptops, cellphones and the like, the important thing is that the posts must be useful & quality. Incidentally, I only rely on my cellphone.To post or reply to posts I always look for information from:       • CHROME      • GOOGLE BARD, and similar. To be more accurate.but I didn't copy it, instead I read the related information first, and I digested it, then I wrote it in a way that was important and useful, then I uploaded my post on the forum.The tools I use:     • WORD Counter : Using an Internet Connection     • Post Topic        : available on this forum.     • Mobile Notes         : Available on mobile (Offline)However, what I often use is Mobile Notes, because it doesn't use an internet connection, and it's comfortable for me to write, if I use a direct internet connection like in WORD Counter or  Post Topic. Errors often occur (error for various reasons).Sometimes I am considered not a beginner, but rather an expert at this, maybe before I registered an account, I had studied it first.Even though I am a beginner on this forum, my experience in trading and cryptocurrencies is quite good, because around the beginning of 2019 I entered the world of trading, and my writing style is honestly, I work on freelance (write), and so. Sometimes my writing is also considered, like a robot (AI). My advice for beginners is to be careful when posting, you should CLICK HERETO AVOID UNWANTED THINGS. Like me recently , I have worked hard, but my content is considered 90% generated by Ai robots.How to use it is quite easy:In-Site Appearance1. Click the Clear button then Copas2. Click the button SubmitThe minimum writing is: 750-8.192 characters.For BEGINNERS... I hope this can help.Thank you 🙏🙏🙏This post is also available on: \"MY LOCAL POST\" The goal is to make it clearer and easier for beginners to understand.Because when I write the original version (Local Indonesian) and then enter it into Google Translate (Indonesia=English), sentence errors often occur. (Perhaps because the phrasing of the sentence is difficult to interpret accurately).So, I made the original version of the post.",

As a newbie it is expected that your time should be spent more on Reading and understanding the forum before dishing out advice two others like yourself. Desist from this act.",

I had to check the profile to see how long the op has stay in this forum that he wants to advise newbies. Sadly, I opened the thread and there's no single motivation here. Before you motivate someone, you also need to be familiar with what you are motivating people to. The reverse is the case here because someone who is acquainted with the forum will never write like this with unbefitting and unnecessary emojis.

Yes, there is nothing that forbids you from giving motivation to anyone, but I think it is quite strange if you often discuss bitcointalk offline with your friends even though you have just joined this forum. Do you study forums without logging in? In my opinion, if we type our own writing/posts in our own language style and from our own thoughts, it will very rarely be considered as writing created using AI. I've never experienced itI think I also need to tell you not to use too many colors, bold letters, and emojis because it makes the writing unpleasant to read. One motivation that can be encouraging for new members is that in this forum we can make money just by discussing, often this motivation is more effective than others.",

Nobody cares about what you and your friend are discussing or where you and your friends are having the discussion, all I can say you are looking for is attention. Your friend told you that discussions about the forum can be done on laptops, cellphones, and the like? I will like to know what your friend is talking about. Seriously, the post that you just created is really of no use, and it's too obvious that you are hunting for merit. If you think you will get merit from posts like this, you are just deceiving yourself, you won't be getting any merit, even if you create multiple threads.I didn't see anything useful to me in your post. Also, a newbie that's supposed to be seeking advice is the one advising other forum members. I don't know if the advice is for newbies like you or even high-ranking members. It's better to come up with a post that will be more useful to the forum, and if you don't have any, just keep on making contributions to the forum by making comments. If your comment is useful, you are still going to receive the merit that you are looking for.",
