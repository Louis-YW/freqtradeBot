Your decisions will be more considered after a rest.The results are really good from $ 4000 to be able to multiply it bigger but it looks like the OP started his greed even though he was sure he would win the bet how would it happen if he lost the bet then he would regret it because he didn't enjoy the results of the money.It was the OP's decision to let it go.Quote from: NAPK1NS_RA3 on June 02, 2023, 06:32:24 PMYou may not post references in this forum because it is prohibited by the forum, it's better to delete this referral and just display it in your account profile.",

FRANCE LEAGUE 2: GRENOBLE - GUINGAMPWow!Your doing it big man, nice one. Though, that's some risk your undertaking and I wonder what sort of assurance you've got on the game.Am not a big fan of the smaller division leagues but, I've had stories that it often goes down good there with the goal markets and more than often, the stronger team always wins.Even with all that, this is still gambling and as it is, anything could be the outcome of the game, little mistakes could occur and the dynamics would be changed completely.I just did a check and it's one goal already and there was a penalty miss. You could have been 90% close to getting your win. You've got 4minutes more to hope for 2 goals. Goodluck with your bet.",

If he's making 200k a year, betting 90k might not be such a big deal. Still risky as fuk, but not the end of the world. Someone like me, who barely makes 50k a year would shit himself betting that much and my wife would probably kill me if I lost, so I'll say it again, it depends on who you are, how much money you have, how comfortable you are betting this much. I'd at least split that into multiple smaller bets. Good luck OP, you have about 30m left. Don't chicken out before the end",

FRANCE LEAGUE 2: GRENOBLE - GUINGAMP Welp. Congratulations on your previous wins, I'm looking at the game now and it seems as if you're on to something here as the goal's already 2 with chances of going for three in the next couple minutes or so. Good luck man. I must say though this type of bet is risky and is not something that I would recommend everyone to do. But it looks like NAPK1NS here is a high-roller so he can stand to lose a couple hundred thousand dollars or so.

Not really a bet that you'd be willing to play let alone recommend to everyone. Just pure risk and the payoff's real fine if you win but for the average joe that's just a death wish. QueenVera's a little cranky bout this guy's betting behaviors, but from someone who strictly opposes belligerent gambling, I can get behind that.",

FRANCE LEAGUE 2: GRENOBLE - GUINGAMPUPDATE: A MISSED PENALTY AND A LOSS. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. Forgive me for being cynical but it's hard to believe such screenshots, when anyone is able to produce them very easily with a bit of HTML manipulation or simple graphics editing. Greed is the downfall of every poor man, so if you did just throw away $90,000 and it is a sizable sum for you, then you should be ashamed. That is a very sizable sum of money in most parts of the world and you really need to ask yourself what your end goal is here. Maybe this is a tiny, throwaway amount for you, but when is it enough? You're not helping anyone except the bookmakers and look an utter fool. You could easily have kept $80k and simply started again from that point, but I highly doubt you'll get another winning streak like that for a while, but you will throw away many thousands attempting it again.",
