You can visit the  github link mentioned on the site.  Most likely, the website meant that there isn't a single database. There are no logs because there is no central database, and all chat messages are client-side encrypted.Quote from: PX-Z on December 26, 2022, 11:58:22 PMAlso, why it uses \"first anonymous decentralized P2P marketplace\" when its not the first one.?It's probably the first anonymous, decentralized P2P market I've heard of.

Buying on your marketplace does not guarantee anti-tracking.By the way, I've heard the term silkroad with the same orientation before. So I think yours is not the first.I have been using darknet markets since the original AlphaBay. But similar principles applied to Silk Road. Both Silk Road and AlphaBay are essentially custodial centralized markets. Users had to transfer coins to the wallets owned by market. You could make purchases only after transferring your coins into AlphaBay's wallets. Nothing is anonymous in these marketplaces. These centralized marketplaces function essentially the same way as a centralized exchange. As you may already be aware, centralized exchanges are bad because they maintain logs of user interactions, messages, transactions, etc. The use of Tor to host a hidden service is what distinguishes darknet markets from other online marketplaces. You might not be aware, but AlphaBay was compromised twice. Hackers published every chat message on AlphaBay twice. Even my conversation with my tracking number was leaked by these fuckers. Haha, I remember that. LibertyTown is, as far as I can tell, an unstoppable decentralized (peer-to-peer) marketplace that accepts anonymous payments. It's not custodial. Blinded moderators are unaware of the addresses of the buyer or seller's address or the amount transaction. So, LibertyTown is a truly decentralized anonymous marketplace, I guess.Quote from: fortifiedmischief on December 27, 2022, 01:42:20 AMIt's probably the first anonymous, decentralized P2P market I've heard of.

      "body": "Quote from: hugeblack on December 28, 2022, 09:52:27 AMI didn't dig deep but what is the difference between PANDORA CASH and Monero and what supports the claim that it is the best?According to what I understand, Pandora Cash uses a new privacy cryptocurrency innovation. Although there are three key differences, the end users experience the same functionality  as in monero. 1. Pandora Cash removes chain analysis for multiple inputs. Monero uses UTXO unlinkability while Pandora Cash uses account unlinkability. Due to the fact that the utxo system in monero demands a ring signature for every unspent input, using account unlinkability is significantly more anonymous. Consider that you receive five payments, each is worth $20. Each payment is from a different person. Monero requires you to create 5 ring signatures in order to spend $100 (the sum of the 5 inputs). For each input, one ring signature is required. One ring signature takes up about 20 kilobytes. Due to the fact that you have more ring signatures, it is possible to perform a chain analysis on monero. This is due the fact the wallet consumed multiple inputs simultaneously. 2. Anonymity sets larger by a factor of 16. Monero this year updated the anonymity from 11 to 16. Pandora Cash has 256 anonymity sets. It means that every transaction with Pandora Cash is 16 times more anonymous than with Monero! 3. Pandora Cash syncs your wallet in 5 seconds. You don't have to scan the blockchain. In order to maintain your privacy in Monero, you need to download the entire blockchain and run your own full node to scan your balance. Did you know that doing so using a third party remote node breaks most of your privacy? The scanning in Pandora Cas requires only 100 bytes of data need to be downloaded. Basically, Pandora Cash is 16 times more anonymous than Monero. It is faster to sync your wallet and easier to use.Quote from: hugeblack on December 28, 2022, 09:52:27 AMYou have a link on github, but there is no indication that the code is open source.This project is not mine. The project is listed as open source on the landing page. I discovered the source code when I looked at the github profile. Maybe the code can be examined by cryptographers. From what we can tell, the protocol appears to be very open.Quote from: hugeblack on December 28, 2022, 09:52:27 AMHow does escrow mechanism work? Since the site does not accept deposits, how do you ensure that scam does not occur?According to what I understand, the protocol will have a desktop application that can be downloaded and executed locally. Consequently, the desktop version serves as a portal to the dark web market. To run the business, you use the software. You can already access the public gateway or download your own gateway from github and install it on your machine.  There are some links how to access the gateway.I can tell you how the escrow mechanism work from my experience. I bought a product last week. I ordered some Xanax pills from the US. Here is how I have conducted the transaction. I opened a public gateway. The search through the listings and found the Xanax pills. I checked the reviews. I texted the vendor. The chat messages are end-to-end encrypted as it works in Signal. The seller explained me the steps on the chat. The vendor generated an encrypted invoice listing the Xanax pills. I checked the final price.  After that, I filled in my shipping address. The encrypted invoice included my shipping address as an attachment. My order was approved by the vendor. After that, I was given a Pandora Cash address. I transferred from my wallet $350 worth of Pandora Cash to the specified address. My understanding is that I locked the money into a multisig address that requires a multisig approval from me, the vendor, and a chosen moderator . My payment was examined and approved by the vendor. The next day, I received the tracking number from the vendor. My xanax pills arrived two days later. I then wrote a brief review and clicked \"Confirm goods\". All done.Quote from: hugeblack on December 28, 2022, 09:52:27 AMWho owns the thought mechanism of encrypting messages in the event of a dispute between the seller and the buyer?I'm not sure how to answer your question. I'm not a developer. In my transaction, the escrow was not involved. I suppose the escrow will get in touch with each of us before making a decision. Refund the purchaser or py the vendor. Perhaps you should look at the code on github and figure it out. I simply looked to see if the word \"encrypted\" appeared in the source code, and it does. You might want to join the Discord group and post your queries there. They might have more information to answer your inquiries.rezin778",
