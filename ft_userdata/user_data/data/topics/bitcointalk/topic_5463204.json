Does that refer to instant buy/sell? Because it would be a mess if it applied to spot trading, suppose someone bought up to the limit of the allowed value and then immediately placed a sell order at a higher price that exceeded the limit. On the other hand, the value of the portfolio can grow beyond that limit.",

This is true. I had to do more kyc for to be able to use p2p on Binance KYC is a must in Binance especially if you're using P2P. Binance is the only intermediary, that's why they have to make sure that both senders funds are safe. If ever there's a problem about the number of tokens/coins that is being sent by the seller, the sender must confirm first before it will be able to transfer. And if there's any problem that both of receiver and sender cannot fix, that's the time Binance will join to fix it. Generally, we must be KYC approved to maximize the use of the CEX.",

      "body": "Yes coinbase is a centralized exchange platform but I don't think they would use KYC for the withdrawal limit. Coinbase is international exchange platform and not National exchange. KYC is required for you to deposit and withdraw without any obstruction and not for limit. It is only Fiat Banks set withdraw limit for daily if the KYC has not been updated to verify the account. Exchange Platform asks your KYC for identification and not for withdrawal. From what wiwo said and I read OmegaStarScream link and I see that there is no KYC for withdrawal limit and the limit was caused by account settings. Once you know how to set the account then, you can increase your withdrawal limit. You can submit your documents in any exchange for KYC request for identification and not for withdrawal limit. They can stop you from withdrawing, and performing other activities from the platform and not for limit. Withdrawal limit is from the account settings. Binance use KYC for identification and not for withdrawal limit. So these are two different things.",

So these are two different things.As to binance, I remember I received an email few years back for account verification and they also stipulated the daily limit withdrawal and the rest on that email. I can't go back to that now but I know there are limits to withdrawal in binance.  You can check this  Quote– Crypto withdrawal limit: Binance daily withdrawal limits will be adjusted to 0.06 BTC for accounts which have completed only Basic Account Verification. For KYC Verified accounts, Binance withdrawal limit is 8,000,000 BUSD per day.–Fiat Withdrawal limit: For KYC Lever 1 Verified accounts, Binance withdrawal limit is 50,000 USD per day. Lever 2: 2,000,000 USD per day, Lever 3: unlimited transaction per day.There are are some regulations that also follows KYC despite being verified and the reason could also not be far from money laundary etc.",

Coinbase Exchange account holders have a default withdrawal limit of $100,000 per day. This amount applies across all currencies.SourceHowever, you can request an increase of the limit and usually have to submit additional documents, e.g. proof of income. By the way, Coinbase also limits FIAT deposits to a certain amount per day. However, this limit does not apply to cryptos, BTC and co. can be deposited as often as desired and in any amount.",
