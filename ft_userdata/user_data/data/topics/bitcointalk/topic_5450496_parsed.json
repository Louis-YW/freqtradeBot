Results are, therefore, not 100% guaranteed to be correct every day. We are not magicians, and we do not have any \"black information\" about the events we are posting. By spectating, studying, analyzing, and using our instincts, we are trying to lead you to the correct betting decision. You are forced to use our bankroll management. In any other case, you are responsible for any outcomes, good or bad. In most cases, not following good bankroll management will result in a bad outcome.

Portfolio tracking is done by Bet-Analytix. The service has been running since 2018 on Discord. Never banned. My Discord never got banned either, all these years. My main profile on another big forum, from which BetSteps (old SharkTips) started, is 7+ years old. You can find that on Discord too. The fact that my profile on Bitcointalk is newbie doesn't automatically mean that I am trying to scam anyone here. I already asked for a highly reputable member to come test our service's legitimacy. Big players with years of service can scam too. A newbie's profile doesn't automatically mean something in this case. Things are very transparent and well explained on our site.",

It could hurt their \"business\" eventually, assuming this is a \"legitimate\" one.Free accurate tips would be the same that free money and that is not a profitable model.

Likewise, if you are making a guess and you have two option (like with Tennis)... let's make some practical examples:50 groups have option A // 50 groups have option BAfter first match only 1 option is a win... so we have just 50 groups able to play... and so on ... it means that after 4 matches... you have just a couple of groups with ALL wins... after 6 matches  it ends with all groups have posted a loss ... it is not easy to explain on a forum (also not in first language  ). but in general those who do not have a certain constancy can be seen immediately and not even a scammer can simulate this kind of results (of course if results are tracked and not created/simulated)",

I get access to their discord VIP. And I have verified bet posted here https://app.bet-analytix.com/bankroll/494446 (Downloaded and edited from CSV)Following OP rules posted in FAQ I have counted bets win/loss with a fix amount played 75 USD (it's like a median value of 3% of stake to be played).With this rule in 23 months he has realized ---> 798 USD as net profit = 34 USD per month.He informed me that 3 subscriptions of 49 euros (about 165 USD) were required during these 23 months.Subtracted from the total we reach a profit of 633 USD which becomes = 27 USD of net profits in a month.As you can see from his stats he plays very often odds at 1.40 (71.4% probability of winning)From the total played he achieves about 14% (real odds 1.14) so no \"magic\", he gets \"decent\" results for a bettor, in line with the chances of winning.Now, we don't know if this percentage will be maintained in the future or if he will cheat with his service.Or he is able to make bigger winnings. These are the numbers he provided and this is my analysis of previous bets.Feel free to ask me for other details, I'm not expressing an opinion on the service itself but I'm reporting the data that I was able to analyze.edit: Total number of subscriptions needed in 3 years was 5 so 5 * 50$ = 250$",
