  "content": "Please Be Careful With The Doctors And Hospitals You Visit.According to the Leadership Newspaper, a housewife known as Kehinde, the wife of a Jos based business man Alhaji Kamal had a severe stomach ache in 2018 in the City of Jos, Nigeria. They visited a private hospital owned by Doctor Noah Kekere who diagnosed the woman and said that she had a ruptured appendicitis and must be operated upon immediately.After the operation which took 8 hours, the pain became worse and she continued to visit the same hospital till 2023 when the husband decided to take her to Jos University Teaching Hospital where they discovered that her kidney was removed. He reported to the Police and Doctor Noah was arrested. Currently it is being reported that Doctor Noah has turned to a Lunatic while in custody. Turning to a Lunatic could even be a trick he wants to use to gain freedom. That's my own opinion though. But please we all should be very careful out there and also raise alarm when it's necessary.If Doctor Noah didn't remove the kidney, how come he didn't discover that the woman's kidney had been removed?",

In addition to this kind of case of unauthorized harvesting of organs, they can also do swapping of children at birth and even sales of children. Many terrible things can happen in the hospital where you go to get help. I am even very careful with some doctors, because in one visit, some can prescribe both drugs you need and the ones you do not really need for you to get from their hospital pharmacy, so your bills can be higher. Be careful of hospitals and doctors that you visit.",

So, get yourself on over the the doctor and hospital, even if nothing is wrong with you, so that they can realize their American Dream of getting rich... at least a little faster than if you hadn't given them some of your money.Then, after the doctors and hospital have made you sicker than you might have been before you visited them, get yourself on over to the nutrition people to make you well. Because the nutrition people have their version of the American Dream just like the doctors and hospitals. They need you money, too.",

It is unfortunate you didn't send the link for more information but the story is not far from what we see and hear of. Some \"hospitals\" are disguised for other hidden business like exchanging and selling of babies, being involved in child trafficking through motherless homes etc. Some shaddy owners of motherless baby homes encourage teenagers to get pregnant for money. So these are all crimes perpetrated in hospital circle and government need to be strict about punishment.",

This will enable them contribute properly. Some doctors are in the hospital to commit havoc and they think that nobody will be able to know because they are doctors. Image Doctor Kekere killing his patient gradually, someone who went to him for treatment but instead he has worsened her condition. I am not surprised at this because we have evil doctors that have turned hospitals to a business centre of human parts and baby swap. I know a doctor that sold out a newly born baby and lied to the mother that the boy died and that he has buried the remains of the body. This triggered the father of the boy and he got the doctor arrested,only for the doctor to call his evil doctors gang that they commit these astrosities today and they went to kill the man in his house,while he was still in police custody.",

I'm not really familiar with medicine system in Nigeria, but I hardly imagine such kind of situation happening in my country. But I guess that stories like this one happens quite often in poor countries.I'm not really doctor, but from what I know apendicitis surgery doesn'ttakes 8 hours, so, probably it was first red flag. But when it's urgent situation and you need help, you simply don't pay attention to such things.",

What a hospital for being irresponsible and what type of ethics do they have for doing that? Honestly, when I was reading, this incident came to my mind (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lucy-letby-sentencing-british-nurse-murdered-7-babies-life-in-prison/).Comparing them, there's no difference between being unethical and they're being trusted by their patients but then, they're doing something crazy beyond the thought of these innocent patients. I think that there's something behind that hospital like they're after the organs and sells it to the other patients and much likely the richer ones or even the black-market.",

All you need is trust them and you can't do anything, it's trial and error, just pray you're not get a bad doctor.Do you think you will not visit a hospital when you're sick due to your skepticism?That is partially correct. If you focus on the medical, that is what you will find. The thing you need to do is search for other things than medial, like nutrition.Nutritional ideas, and 'radical' procedures and processes are available. If you search on the Internet for them, much of your search will only bring you medical ideals and propaganda about these procedures and processes. Why? because the medical realizes that stuff, that really works, is taking foothold. So, they have joined the nutritional industry as sleepers and 'spies' just to thwart good nutrition and good non-medical ideas.For example. Have you heard of intravenous H2O2 and O3 procedures? You can find doctors who do them. But the medical outright blasts these doctors and ideas. Why? for two reasons. Some of the doctors that do H2O2 or O3 processes, don't know what they are doing, and can hurt people. The other reason is that when these processes are used correctly, people find great health, and are healed from almost everything that anybody can be healed from.Another is a 'fringe' doctor (according to the medical) whose name is Max Gerson (deceased). When his methods are used properly even with a healthy person, there is better living and health. There are people who have used his methods who, after a while, noticed that they were getting all kinds of pinkish blotches and marks all over their bodies. Finally, it was determined that their scar tissue was being replaced by healthy, normal, original-like tissue.The first thing you need to do is change your mindset. The medical is out there to make money, period. All they want to do is keep you healthy enough so that you come to them with your tiny illnesses so they can make money. Check the statistics as to how many people die from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes each year (almost 2 million people), at the hands of doctors and hospitals. Do you really want to continue on with these killers. Change your mindset.Then search everywhere for things that work. After all, you can barely live with the medical, so LIVE without them.",

It is a very good thing.In today's world, after drug business, it has become the biggest business. Business with human organs is not a matter of today but a long time phenomenon.There are many reports of money greedy doctors stealing various organs without following the right path and saying it is wasted.Kidney theft in particular is happening so easily now that we can learn from the story that we should be very aware otherwise we end up dying prematurely like this.***These incidents occur mostly when the unconscious education rate is low and ignorant people are caught when educated people are caught.Not only does it happen to underdeveloped countries, but it is facilitated by various groups of people in the developed world because they are the ones who want to buy these organs by paying huge sums of money under the lure of high greed.So it is not only the doctor who is to blame. In our society, there are many people who later say that it is bad. It is not right The main lesson is to be aware for yourself, for the nation, for the country, for the people of the world.",
