Polkadot is trying to design an ecosystem which every blockchain can transact data with each other. In my opinion, you should not be afraid to look for something new, and perhaps through a search and in-depth analysis of the project, you can find a new Ethereum competitor. Now the main competitors of Ethereum in my opinion are Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana, Tron, Tezos and Cosmos. There is a chance that the real “Ethereum killer” has not even been invented yet.",

Well, ethereum is a network tokens and ofcourse the best way to make profits in the bearish or bullish period is to invest in network tokens. Ofcourse there are bad / failed projects that does not discredit the majority that has succeed, the binance smart chain, the polygon chain, the avalanche, fantom and cronos chain. Trust me, the network tokens are one that you want to invest into. And mind you, they all emulate ETH",

Polkadot is trying to design an ecosystem which every blockchain can transact data with each other. Well i only partly agree with your advice here. In the end Ethereum was the first blockchain ecosystem that brought the smart contract functionality to the crypto space and that changed pretty much everything. Without smart contracts we would not have real DEX's like Uniswap or Pancakeswap, we would not be able to yield farm or stake or assets in single asset staking pools or to provide liquidity for pools. Without smart contracts there would be no Defi which is the biggest selling point for cryptos at the moment.Blockchains like the Binance Smart Chain for example or almost 1 to 1 copies of Ethereum with the little (but important) difference that the fees on BSC are way lower than on Ethereum at the moment.",

That doesn't make sense if you are prohibiting others to invest in what they are interesting with. It's better if you are dealing with your own DOT. This gonna be your own decision.",

I am more preferably on avalanche or fantom itself as the next ethereum since they are really achieving some lapses on eth network. Might be not perfect but compared to scalability its more of arvance than eth I guess. Yup I’m on same thoughts too. Change is always important to overcome the current problems and accept the better systems. I see avalanche and fantom as the better one, with lower fees and high speed transactions. ETH is obviously the first one and made its perfect time in the crypto space however it’s getting too congested since long and highly impossible to keep up with the fees and stuff. The thought of not investing into such projects would be lame man. Let’s not get into sink hole of ETH.",
