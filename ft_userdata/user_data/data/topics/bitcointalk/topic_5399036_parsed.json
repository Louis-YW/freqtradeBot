Now days K is not only secure random 256 bit but hashed to make sure get valid 256 bit random.Exactly; it's also known as nonce reuse vulnerability.Quote from: https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/06/11/ecdsa-handle-with-care/Therefore, not only does a signer need to keep their secret key secret, but they also must keep all of their nonces they ever generate secret.Anyhow, for a good while now, we've finally transitioned to Schnorr's signature scheme anyway, so I'd focus on that instead.Interestingly, it has the same flaw.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signatureJust as with the closely related signature algorithms DSA, ECDSA, and ElGamal, reusing the secret nonce value k on two Schnorr signatures of different messages will allow observers to recover the private key.[2] In the case of Schnorr signatures, this simply requires subtracting s s values:s' − s = (k' − k) − x(e' − e).If k' = k but e' ≠ e then x can be simply isolated. In fact, even slight biases in the value k or partial leakage of k can reveal the private key, after collecting sufficiently many signatures and solving the hidden number problem.",

For example \"function(privkey,message)\" can be used to produce 256-bit pseudorandom value that will be strong enough for everyday use. The simplest thing would be just \"k=SHA-256d(privkey||SHA-256d(message))\", but I think we can do it better than that.",
