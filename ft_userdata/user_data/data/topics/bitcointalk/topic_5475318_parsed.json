There is no point in buying bitcoin, and holding it for decades, and does not have a plan to sell it. If someone buys Bitcoin and their Bitcoin grows in price, they are not in profit until they sell and cash it out. They are in profit, but it's unrealized gain. They must sell to gain the profit. So, it's just they want to encourage others to hold Bitcoin for a long time. I don't want to blame them for such statement.",

I even feel that accumulating bitcoin is a two angle venture; it could serve the purpose of maximising profit in the future due to increase in it price and also be used as a saving or investment you can rely on in times when uncertainty might set in.",

Isn't it to make profit? So how can someone say they won't sell their bitcoin, even if the person doesn't want to sell their bitcoin after making some profit from it I think that will be a higher risk because i feel that despite the volatility of bitcoin, it's future cannot be predicted yet despite making a head way since it was introduced but I feel bitcoin is still very young and requires some more years to be fully recognized as a Legal asset across the globe. Moreover, hodling a volatile asset like bitcoin for a very long time without exchanging it to fiat or using it to make transactions doesn't make any sense at all as the coin can only be more valued if it is being spent or use it for exchanges.",

If you know someone who is buying Bitcoin, try to ask them the reason why and you get the answer. In fact, the price of Bitcoin continues to grow because of active trade -buy and sell demand. Never selling means that we are not helping the market to grow but stopping it.",

Because the potential of Bitcoin is way too far ahead and if you are tempted to cash out whenever you seem to feel bullish then you will be the guys who sold their BTC in 2014 and 2017 yet we are here at 2023 and one who sold at that period they thought they made huge profits which are true but if they are looking from today's perspective they missed it.",

But most of the time this statement will come out from people when there's good thing happened like this speculated event to come like halving. People usually hold their bitcoins for that reason so provably they would provably hold until next year for thinking that they can earn huge from its upper growth activity that could possibly happen in future.Maybe other reason is they believe on bitcoins future but its hard to find those people hold for long term without any worry since most of people I meet is trading bitcoin for short term because they are afraid on its sudden market changes.",

We have such statements before mostly by parents keeping the funds as inheritance for his offspring so there is I am not the one that will spend it, this doesn’t mean that the money or bitcoin in question will not be spend but he will try his best that it is not done by him. This is one of the reason why we have people time locking their bitcoin to a certain period of time.

I feel skeptical if someone says they will never sell their BTC, it seems to me that these words are just words that never come true. Bitcoin has a high price, maybe in the future the price will be even higher. It is impossible for those who own Bitcoin to never sell it, especially when the selling value is calculated, they will get a large amount of money. In my opinion, these words apply when the price of Bitcoin is cheap, when the price has reached its highest point, they will sell it and will wait until the price is cheap again to buy again.",

If there are reasons I would like to discuss them.   Individuals could see Bitcoin as a precious asset that can be transferred from one generation to another, so they can decide to keep it for a longer period. I have read about families that own some amount of precious stones which they inherited from ancestors. These assets may be kept for days of uncertainties or emergencies. Nations also keep assets like gold in the national central bank as Reserves. These countries have held these precious stones for a very long time with no intention of selling them. People could also keep Bitcoin as Reserves or as backup for emergencies. But most Bitcoiners who have held the coin for a long time usually have investment plans. They sell some of the investment at targeted prices and also refill their hodling when the price goes down. Some hodlers also sell to take care of their needs from time to time. Keeping or selling coins depends on the choice of every individual.",

If there are reasons I would like to discuss them.   From what I understand by \"never selling\" it means not taking profits at the top to buy back at the bottom as many people advise here and outside the forum. They're hodling for the future and not interested in the short profits people make with each Bitcoin cycle. We can never hodl forever unless we have well paying jobs that can take care of all our needs and wants that we won't have a need of the profits that we would have made from Bitcoin and even though, at a point we'll take some profits but the frequent selling to rebuy won't be done. Even pure maximalist also sell Bitcoin when they're in need of cash. People are investing in Bitcoin for many reasons and some of them is to secure their wealth, this set of people's don't have to sell whenever there's any corrections in the market and they can are the set of people that'll live by their word of never selling Bitcoin as they keep using it as a store of value. We also have those that are investing in Bitcoin for generationally purpose (generational wealth that they'll pass down to their heirs). This set of people will also live by their words that they'll never sell but for the rest of investors buying Bitcoin for capital gains, they'll sell at some point in the future so their hodling won't be forever and there's nothing wrong with that.The whole phrase of \"never selling\" for most investors is associated with their emotion as they don't mean it because a majority are selling and that's why we keep seeing Bitcoin taking a dip as if there was no selling pressure ongoing, Bitcoin should have been holdings strong and not getting dump.",
