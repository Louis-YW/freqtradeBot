I hope you're not using money to buy bitcoin that you might need to eat. As long as you're doing it with money you won't need in a few years, keep buying small amounts regularly, it's called DCA, as iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 says.",

It may be a very small amount to many people, but sometimes it means a lot to many people. I know what you said didn't mean to offend him, but you will probably disappoint him because he is DCAing every time he has money, he never said he would stop with a $50 investment in bitcoin. For someone who doesn't have a lot of money, but if they work hard to accumulate it for a few years and when bitcoin increases in price, it becomes a decent amount.",

I was talking about finding another source of income (online freelancing something like fiverr.com) or improve skill by making a forklift course, excavator course, welding course, english school (if he is not english native speaker). something that will help him get better job and safe 100$ monthly instead of 20$. That way after a year of DCA he will have 1200$ invested instead of 240$. If BTC will pump 5x its 6k$ profit instead of 1200$. I can't give an exact answer because I don't know where he lives, what he does, how old he is, and what his abilities are.Or even get more active here on forum and get a signature campaing that pays 50$ weekly.",

With the condition that you still have to continue buying when you have money or when a correction occurs, and you don't need to force yourself to do this because you can do it according to what you have.Because that kind of thing would be much better than you keep forcing yourself to invest but you have to refrain from buying every other important need in life.

History has proven this for Bitcoin and that is why I would buy Bitcoin at any point I have the funds, especially during bear markets periods like this. The price might fall after you bought and if you still have spare investment funds, buy some more at the end of the bear market or even a small relief rally, you would have made some profits from some of your buys as you have noticed.",

Indeed, that's what we have to do if we want to invest in bitcoin and don't panic if the price drops again because it's only temporary. We should consider adding more bitcoins so that the profits we will get later will be even greater.Continue what you have been doing @OP, keep holding your bitcoins until the price reaches the highest price again, and sell your bitcoins at the highest price to get maximum profit. And you still have plenty of time to buy bitcoins because the price isn't going to increase that fast yet.",

If you really want to see some good profit with those amount better start trading it and sell when you are in profit(day trades) since from this you may have a chance to make your balance grow more. If you let its sleep for long time you might realize that waiting for pump is not really worth it for you.",

Based on the interviews from veteran investors, what gives them more profit is by buying and holding or buy to to store it as savings coz overtime what you bought whatever the market price is, in the end if the price moves up, you already profited from your purchase, either it will rise or fall you will still gain even a small percentage as your profit.It'a also best to learn more about the market while you are storing your purchase. Some will advise you to do different kinds of trading, but whichever you will choose what's important is that you earn. In the process of learning the market for sure you will encounter more opportunities for you to buy more for your investments.",

You must have sound financial management in investing, you must prioritize the basic needs of your life and your family so that your investment will be calmer if all your basic needs are met.It's okay with small value to buy bitcoin it's a good step and I really appreciate it, especially if you make the next purchase with DCA strategy (scaled purchase of the same amount) you will get a lot of bitcoin if you do it consistently and DCA also reduces mental attacks when bitcoin is down, I highly recommend that you do that strategy, especially if you are new to investing in bitcoin.",

All you need when it comes to bitcoin investment when it comes to holding is just the patience to hold for a long time. You don't have to sell just because your scared based on the FUD that is being past around. FUD have been around as much as bitcoin have been around but still, the coin still pumps when the time comes.You saying you don't have funds to buy, might be immediate but still, you could always buy, just as you topped up your portfolio of $14.55 with a $50 investment. Just try to have other streams of income to divert your focus from your holding and you don't have to ne looking at the charts often.",
