The brand is finally focused on BTC. All the newest tech will always first be in a Poly btc note.",

All the newest tech will always first be in a Poly btc note. a very wise decision in my opinion - makes polymerbit even 'stronger' in my eyes if it is 'Bitcoin only' from now on i think this is a very thoughtful move and also makes the upcoming notes and the technology behind them even more valuable.there is only Bitcoin - nothing else",
