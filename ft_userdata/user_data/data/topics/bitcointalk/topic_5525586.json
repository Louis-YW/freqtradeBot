But it seems that predictions vary, with the highest probability being 60%. I think that Trump has other more immediate matters to attend to once he becomes president, and a decision like this would require support within his party and perhaps within certain US institutions, so it's not something easy to pull off.",

Polymarket gamblers analysts are giving this an estimated 28% probability  of the U.S. creating a National BTC Reserve within Trump’s first 100 days in office.How about you? What do you think? He already said that he wants to create a Bitcoin national reserve. But the problem is that Powell disagree with him,QuoteFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank has no desire to be involved in any government effort to stockpile large amounts of bitcoin.\"We're not allowed to own bitcoin,\" Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, in which policymakers cut rates as expected while signaling a less certain path for monetary policy in the months ahead.https://www.reuters.com/technology/fed-cant-hold-bitcoin-not-seeking-change-that-powell-says-2024-12-18/So most likely Poly or those who bet against it or that 28% probability is holding that statement from the Fed chair. So there will be a power struggle between the two. And I think the only way that Trump can force his way is to direct the US congress to create it for him.For now, it is still open so it's hard to predict whether it can be done in his first 100 days in the office.",

It won't change after Trump inaguration and take the White House back.Yes, US politics is very polarized and any bill needs support from both parties in Congress, Trump cannot decide on his own even though he is the president. But in addition to his victory, both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans this term, which will give Trump maximum power and make it easier to pass bills. But the real question is whether he is serious about this idea or is it just a random statement on his part to win over voters during the election campaign? Besides, this is not a very important issue and as president, he has more important things to deal with in the first year of his term. So we should not expect too much.",

Polymaket's close predictions of the US elections have made them popular and one can say they have shown some level of fairness. But these centralized gambling companies are not immune to manipulation so we cannot fully trust the outputs. Trump has made some promises that is hard to believe that he can accomplish. But there are strong indications from his camp that he is interested in making Bitcoin a reserve currency. His appointment of people who are pro-crypto in his cabinet is a positive sign and his son Eric Trump also affirmed his father's willingness to do it. But he would face some challenges like how to convince or coerce Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to change his negative stance.",

Will Trump establish a bitcoin reserve policy? The chances are on the high side.  Will that happen within the next 100 days in office? The chances for that are slim; 100 days in office is too small for him to get that into effect; there are things that he should focus on in his first 100 days before the promise he made to the bitcoin community will come afterward.  I believe by now everything should already be in place, draughted, and edited, just waiting for it to be presented to Congress. If he wants to get it as one to do things within this first 100 days in office, he can make that happen, but the speed will depend on Congress's approval too.",

Wow, so Trump did actually say all these things. When I read them, I take them as rumours packaged the rise the price of bitcoin. I mean, did Trump actually advise people to hold their coin and did he actually say that he will create a bitcoin national reserve. Where did the idea come from. I am sorry to say, if Trump did actually promise to create bitcoin reserve, he will do so. The dude likes honouring his words to maintain his prestige.

I don't know for sure whether it will be done or not, because politics always contains ambiguous words that can always be changed.

Indeed, from the beginning Trump was pro-crypto, so I think there is a great chance that the promise will be implemented.",

American politics and economics don't work that way and don't depend solely on the president. Each department, agency, and agency has its own jurisdiction, and national reserves are not under government control.Trump can propose and appoint Fed chairmen, and he appointed Jerome Powell in 2017, but he does not have the power to fire him or dictate what Jerome Powell should or should not do. National reserves are a very important issue and need the approval of the Fed and Congress, Trump has no right to decide on this issue.",
