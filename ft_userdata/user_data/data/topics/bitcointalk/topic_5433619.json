  "content": "I'm trying to verify my bitcoin core 24.0.1, but the verification instructed by bitcoincore.org for MacOS implies to search for GPG Keys in a github bitcoin repository that no longer exist. I'm a novice with this type of things, so I am not really able to search into the bitcoin github for myself. Can anyone help me find GPG Keys to verify?ADDITIONAL:I've asked ChatGPT for some help in the process, and it mentioned me of a way to verify the bitcoin core software, which I have performed, and resulted in a supposedly non-official bitcoin core, altough I downloaded it from https://bitcoincore.org.Here is the process mentioned to me by the AI: In the Bitcoin project on GitHub, the developer keys are not stored in a specific folder. Instead, they are included in the code commits and signed with the developers' GPG keys.To verify the authenticity of your Bitcoin Core download, you can follow the instructions on the Bitcoin.org website:    Download the source code from the Bitcoin GitHub repository: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin    Check the code out from the repository:git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git    Navigate to the Bitcoin source code directory:cd bitcoin    Check the Git tags to see which version of the software you have downloaded:git tag    Check the signature of the tag:git tag -v [tagname]    The output of the command should indicate whether the signature is valid and made by one of the project's trusted developers.__The first tag after the \"git tag\" command resulted in \"noversion\". ChatGPT suggests to type the command \"git describe\", of which output resulted in \"v21.99-guixtest1-7105-g39363a4b9\". ChatGPT suggests the downloaded software is not an official release. It then suggests to try checking the hashes, which I suppose is the standard verification, instructed by bitcoincore.org.Does this have any relevance?",

The main issue is that of key distribution. You can figure out what the necessary keys are by attempting to verify the signatures and then getting the fingerprints of the missing keys from the result in order to retrieve the keys from a keyserver or using WKD. Most people have uploaded their keys to a keyserver. However it's also useful to have all of the keys posted in one place, which is what this part of the git repo does.In terms of \"reliance on github\", the previous solution was just as bad.",
