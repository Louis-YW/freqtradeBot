Are there any known collision data with public keys, and if possible, with private keys as well?Some scientific progress has been made (https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/285) but it is still very far from a simple every-day use. In other words - RIPEMD160 is still secure.",

Definitely.Most probably this is not a coincidence or a collision for that matter. Considering the addresses you shared were never spent from they could be categorized as addresses that were created from the hash like some sort of silly puzzle not from a public key. In other words nobody can spend these coins because they don't have the key, they just did what you did (hashed 2 characters and then created that address).Something like this:Code:for (chars from 0x10 to 0x1f)Â  hash = compute(Base16.Decode(0x+chars))Â  address = encode(hash)Â  if (address[1..2] == chars)Â  Â  print (address)Â  Â  burn_coins_by_sending_to(address)",
