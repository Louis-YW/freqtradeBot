Of course, a lot of times, who wouldn't get worried or afraid when the money you invested is decreasing? even if you believe so much that in the end, you'll gain profit from investing in Bitcoin, those feelings will probably come from time to time probably during a bear market.Quote from: JamesBorn on April 20, 2023, 08:47:34 PMIs holding for too long OK?yeah, I mean it is ok as long as you know what you are doing and the risk you are taking, but then again, holding for too long could also make you miss on potential profit because of hodling.",

But as one keeps having more experience in hodling and gets familiar with the market the fear to lose won't be any longer.  As an experience investor If one keeps having fear of hodling it is either the person is not into the right investment(shit coin) or investing with the amount he can't afford to lose. It is only when you are not hodling bitcoin the fear to lose will always be in the mind because when it is not bitcoin it is always assumed things can go wrong at anytime.",

Holding crypto/bitcoin assets for a very long time is not an easy matter. Many people are tempted by a small increase, then sell it. After selling it they regret it, because it turns out the market continues to increase. So it's true, investing in the long term, you have to be really unanimous, your determination must be strong, your calculations must be mature, you must be mentally strong and don't forget that investing in crypto/bitcoin for the long term, you must have a steady job, with monthly salaries. Because if you only rely on investing in crypto/bitcoin, you are afraid that before the target price has not arrived, all the assets have been sold, it is still better if you sell when the market is rising and you will have a profit, but what if the reason you are selling these assets is because there is an urgent need, something like that is very inconvenient. So when you are going to invest, the point is that you have to have a steady job, that's for provision, while waiting for assets to experience a high increase, so you can be more calm in investing.",

And it made me learn to overcome my fears and worries to be able to hold bitcoin well. And it has worked so far that I am no longer afraid or worried about holding bitcoins.It takes courage to hold on to bitcoin when the price is dropping, let alone dropping drastically because most people are not ready to see it. The crypto market will always be up and down, so we must prepare to hold on firmly.If you are a bitcoin investor, don't be afraid to hold onto your bitcoins when the price is corrected. But precisely, those are the best times to buy bitcoins because you can have more bitcoins.",

Only a few may not be concerned with the daily price movement, but keeping up with some news and updates will always make you check the price. After all, we are all humans. There is fear, and there is determination. I can say that someone who is really aware of Bitcoin has already killed the fear in them before they decided to put their money into it. When you fear price manipulation, that means you may not have the zeal to invest again, but before they invest, they are already aware of how volatile the asset can be. It may not be certain, but I invested in Bitcoin because I know I will make money from it and that it will not crash overnight and that it cannot just crash so easily.The greatest fall of Bitcoin was in 2011, when it fell by -99%, but after that, it struck its ATH in 2021. I have killed my fear, and I will be holding and also selling fraction by fraction when I see a tempting price that is favorable to selling. Fear I had in Bitcoin was just in my early days into Bitcoin.",

This calls for the person to decide whether to sell their BTCs for a short-term gain or a long-term gain/loss depending on the amount of his initial investment.Personally, I would HODL 50% of my BTCs for long-term and sell the remaining 50% as a short-term investment and re-invest my profit in order to maximize my holdings for the future.",

And that's based on the feedback that we get from the community and those sad stories about how they've gone wrong with their funds. Either, misused, lost, hacked and other unfortunate situations. But eventually, I'm also reminding myself that there's nothing to worry about. It's a mix feelings that we're able to combine all of our real life problems and our investment problems and that adds to the worry that we're having.

Fear can be overcome by knowledge.  Knowledge gives confidence that is why I believe those who are still holding their BTC tights are not only smart but has wisdom about the Bitcoin economy.  I admit that before when I lack the knowledge about Bitcoin trend, I also get shaken but as I learned about Bitcoin and its cyclic path, the fear just fade away.",

It's good to be fearful but when we are talking about investment and you have fear, it means you lack the knowledge about what you are investing your money on, if you understand what you are investing money on there will be no reason to fear, knowledge is power, knowledge kills doubt and fear.",
