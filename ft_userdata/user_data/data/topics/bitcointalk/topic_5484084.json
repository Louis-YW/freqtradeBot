He's probably just telling things that when you buy bitcoin then you're obviously going to hold and be patient with it. Even the meme coins investors, they don't just buy and don't have any plans at all. They've got a lot of plans and that's why with that, they're aware that it is coming not easy as they need to exert effort and time for it. And the same goes with what Robert said, it's like he's guaranteeing people that have bought bitcoin that you'll make a profit but you need to wait.Quote from: Hewlet on February 04, 2024, 03:38:34 PMAt what point can you consider to have made profit in your bitcoin holding journey?When you're above on the buying price. There's no need to complicate things with that, as long as you're above with that price you've bought it then you're already in profit.",

I think only those who purchase on peak or above 45K are still at loss now but they will surely recover once the price fully recovers or if they DCA when the price goes than to 15K to be on breakeven or in profit.Michael Saylor is the living proof about my statement that you will never lose if you will never sold at loss. Bitcoin is one of kind investments. People values it a lot that’s why the price keeps recovering no matter what the FUD throws against it.",

There's something wrong with people who repeatedly tell you how to get wealthy. Either their advice sucks, or they gain a lot from you; or sometimes both. If you're a badass rich man, why the hell do you try so hard to convince brokies you're right in YouTube shorts? Why do you choose to spend all this valuable time of yours in random podcasts? I don't want to sound absolute, maybe they have helped some, but I personally find these advice and talks obvious after a second thought.",

Read my first sentence above.You should also take into account inflation and the purchasing power of money. That is, if you bought bitcoin 5-10 years ago, then during this period, to date, the value of the current money is less than the last money. I am writing this because it is not enough just to calculate the difference between the purchase and sale prices, and also to index the value of money (received from the bitcoin's sale).",

Accumulation 2). Bear 3). Bull in these phases one is accumulation where you have to fill your bags with whatever coin you are interested in. Then you have to wait for the bear run to go away and bull run to come and in that bull run you have to make a profit and then again repeat the process. By doing this you can guarantee that you will make a profit.Besides that, there is no way to time the market, and I have learned this from many senior members, even with full analysis, one might not be able to judge the market, that's why we all should have some plan ready to book our profits in this bull run. And investing in BTC does not make it loss prove, you can still make lose by investing in BTC, if you behave carelessly. I think Robert kiyaski is 100% right, but we gotta book some profit otherwise what are we investing for. So don't take his words for guaranteed that you should not book the profit and only should invest in it, because if you will not take the profit and do some productive work with it then why are you doing this all!",

And, if anything, I think that sell point is more important than buy point. Maybe you bought at $17k in 2017, which was a bad time to buy, for instance. But if you then sold at $60k, you've made a great profit, despite the initial mistake of buying near a bull run peak. Of course, it's better to buy the dip, but with Bitcoin, I don't think it's necessary. If you make a mistake when you buy, you just might need to wait longer.",

Let's take the current scenario, as an example. It looks a very good moment to purchase Bitcoin, because we are coming from a bearish season to a halving event, which is well known for boosting Bitcoin's price to new ATH levels. Even though it can't be considered a guarantee, I believe it indicates a strong bullish market is ready to start, so I go for it, full of confidence, expecting a decent profit margin between 2024 and 2025 by investing in Bitcoin. I can't foresee the future with certain, but I'm pretty sure this is the most likely scenario to take place soon.In this crypto market, that is the best you can do, because if you keep waiting for guarantees, you are actually not going to invest at anytime soon, just like many people who have been always complaining they missed the train or that they can't buy Bitcoin now because it's already too expensive and they should have bought it earlier.About Robert Kiyosaki's thought, he is correct by meaning long term investments are more interesting than selling your BTCs always you have an opportunity to make cheap profit on short run, as by doing this, you are risking to not be able to purchase Bitcoin once again for a cheaper or same price you sold it for.",

Buy the dip is more of a joke than a legit strategy. What you should do is simply buy when the price is right for you. Each of us will have a different price target in mind for both buying and selling.What many people don't realize is that you make profit even if somehow you're even on the price. For example if you bought bitcoin in 2021 at $40k and now it's back at 40k, you made money by saving yourself from inflation. If you held fiat money you'd be at a loss by at least 15% in 3 years.",

Then at some point later I listened to a podcast episode of his when he was interviewing Saifedean Ammous (actually it was an episode of Saifedean's podcast I listened to but he just played the audio of him being interviewed on Kiyosaki's podcast). All I can say is Kiyosaki is a lunatic. The entire time he sounded like a belligerent insane person. And he supposedly was knowledgable on Bitcoin yet sounded like he didn't know anything at all about Bitcoin. Closest thing I can relate it to is it reminded me of whenever I hear Trump speak, just felt like it was giving me brain damage just listening to him and you get the very clear impression that the person you are listening to is a hostile crazy person with severe mental/emotional problems.So, Kiyosaki claiming you make a profit the moment you buy Bitcoin, yeah that's insane so sounds about right for Kiyosaki.No matter when you buy Bitcoin you're going to make a profit long term, but you're only in profit when the price is up. You're not in profit when you buy it. And obviously buying low gets you more bitcoin than buying higher, and therefore more profit. Ask anyone who has ever gotten into Bitcoin for the first time during a bull market and didn't know what they were doing and sold for a loss during the following bear market (I think that's probably most of us haha).",

As a retail seller, you make your profits when you buy your stuff from the wholesaler. As I see it, Kyosaki treats btc like goods and that makes sense from a merchant point of view. A merchant only buys his stuff low and sells it high and he only sells the stuff which are in demand. The stuff people don't want become overstock and overstock gets dumped for any price. That's exactly what Amazon, Walmart and Homedepot doing. They buy the stuff, they buy a lot of it, since they buy a lot, they buy it cheap and they sell the stuff after they add their profit margin.We saw the merchants point of view, now let's look at it as a customer. Don't you want to buy your favorite stuff when there is a discount going on? You want to buy it cheap too right? And when does that happen? When these big retailers dump their excessive stock... or on Black Fridays. Why do those huge retailers make huge sales during Black Fridays? Because they make huge discounts and people wait for a year for that day. People ain't stupid. They don't pay $100 for a basic hosting plan when they can buy it in November for $10.",

A little more context would help. Is he suggesting buying at the top doesn’t matter? Because that would be stupid. There are people who made the mistake of buying bitcoin at ATH and haven’t recovered till date. Anyway, I tend to disregard anything Kiyosaki says. The man wrote a good book but that does not make him a financial expert. His recent interest in Bitcoin is surprising because he’s always preached physical assets. I think since his counterparts Warren Buffet and others are anti bitcoin, he’s trying to be the unconventional one and increase his popularity by recommending bitcoin as a solid investment.",

I totally disagree with Robert Kiyosaki's thought because he says only buying Bitcoin at every point is a profit synonym, but this is just speculation. And speculation can be wrong. Besides that, this is also the reason for my disagreement. Because in the case of a lawsuit, if we look at things comparatively, it is not like that in reality, and the justification I have for this thing is whether the price of Bitcoin is going to rise straight and not fall down. The answer is yes, of course, there is a bull market and there is a bear market. So it means that buying Bitcoin at every point can't give you profit every time because evidently, when the bear market comes beyond any doubt, it can organize your profit if the price goes up, if the bull is at its peak, and if the next move is Bitcoin's bear. As for the market, buying Bitcion at this time can do nothing but harm you. So it's mean to say that according to Robert Kiyosaki's, buying Bitcoin is only profit marketing. So i why people always prefer to buy Bitcoin at bear markets, despite the fact that real traders or investors often buy in bear markets because they know that buying Bitcoin at every price or point cannot give a profit every time. And I think Robert Kyasaki would be good at writing books, but that doesn't mean that he would be good in the crypto industry. Understanding the crypto market is hard.",
