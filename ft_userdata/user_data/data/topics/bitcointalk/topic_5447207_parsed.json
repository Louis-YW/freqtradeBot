      "body": "As a succesful predictor myself, i can give you guys a nice advice and a insightful analysis. A lot of teams have a higher odd of winning as the bookmakers predicted, but in my opinion you should check goalscoring stats. Teams who score more goals than their opponent, have (in my opinion) a higher chance to score again the next match. So instead of choosing a striker of a team who should win (following the bookmakers), choose the best scoring striker or penalty taker of the better scoring team out of the two. Besides the stats, you should follow your guts and don't forget to check for injured players! Haaland is probably not starting agains liverpool, so be smart and don't choose the guy. Goodluck picking your majestic 7 and dont forget to thank me when you followed my advice My picks:Phil FodenIvan ToneyMartinelliJames MadissonDaniel PodenceMarcus RashfordHarry KaneKind regards,Thomasvdp",

      "body": "We have seen both sides of this Liverpool team in the last few weeks. There was the euphoria of their 7-0 thrashing of Manchester United, but they followed that by losing at Bournemouth. The Reds have failed to score in 4 of their last 5 road games, if you include the 1-0 Champions League loss against Real Madrid. However, they have won on the road at Newcastle and Tottenham, despite struggling against some weaker teams. City should be expected to win whether Haaland is available or not, but the Reds can play their part in an entertaining game and a positive approach from the visitors should motivate Pep Guardiolaâ€™s team to find an extra gear, so there should be a few goals too.CITY TO WIN , over 2.5GOALS",

      "body": "Lets start with Arsenal who gonna do what they do the best and that is winning, we also have something to keep eye on, thats Guardiola VS Klopp, although there is big differences point wise its always big competition between these 2. As 3rd match we have animal derby between Eagles vs Foxes or if you would like rather call them Crystal Palace vs Leicester, game probably without any goals so make sure you charge your bateries on phone.Lets not forget about Lossers derby between Southampton and West Ham, how they play probably both teams gonna lose this game, which is WIN WIN situation for them.We have also 1 more derby left between Uniteds, Devils vs Oil, although Devils are spending as they are oil they aint doing so good till now.As last interesting match we have 2 lions at least they are on logo, 1 is being led by Europe League expert and another one by clueless englesh man, its up to you to decide who is who.Rest of matches are that type of matches that making intro is just too much cuz even their fan base would rather watch any of those up there mentionedðŸ¤·",

      "body": "Manchester City Vs Liverpool :Julian AlvarezÂ Normally i would pick Haaland without a thought but having seen the news that he is still recovering from injury in his groin and has not participated in team trainings up untill today i will choose Julian Alvarez, he is in great form and will probably be the lone striker since its doubtfull Haaland will play, as for the match i see a confortable win for Man. City and both teams to score.Brighton Vs Brentford:MitomaFor this match there are several good picks as the likes of Mitoma, Ivan Toney , March and even Mccallister, however in my opinion Mitoma is in the best form of them all atm and for that reason i will pick Mitoma for majestic 7 , as for the match i see a win for brighton with both teams to also score.Arsenal Vs Leeds:Buyako SakaThis match for me is straight foward, i will pick Buyako Saka and i believe Arsenal should get a confortable win at home, would not be suprised if they put 4 past leeds.Crystal Palace Vs Leicester:Harvey BarnesThis match is probably the hardest to pick a player for MJ7 since both teams are not great and i dont see this match having a lot of goals , as far i see i would not be suprised with a draw and since i have to pick a player i would go with Harvey Barnes which is the best inform player atm from both squads as i see it.Nottingham Forest Vs Wolves : Raul JimenezNottingham Forest are going by a rough period and after losing both of their starting strikers in past few weeks i believe it will be hard from them to create chances and finish them, and since Raul Jimenez is a high class striker which is on a draught right now i would bet on him to break it this week against a bad team , i see Wolves winning this match even though they have a bad defense atm since Forest have not got both of their strikers.Newcastle Vs Man Utd:Marcus RashfordOf course this match shouldnt be much of a suprise even though newcastle have been playing decently this year , they have real problems up front even though they have a solid defense , i see a small win for Man utd probably by 1-0 with Rashford scoring it , the best english striker.Everton Vs Tottenham: Harry KaneWill be a tough match since Everton are parking the bus since Sean Dyche joined the club as manager and parks the bus every game and plays on the counter , however Kane is in terrific form atm scoring in his last 4 matches in a row and i would give him as my pick for MJ7 this week as i see a 1-0 win for Tottenham",

      "body": "Man City vs LiverpoolWith Haaland doubtful you can't really be sure what front 3 Pep chooses because over time he's proven he is unpredictable in big games with his lineups and subs so my intuition tells me to stay off City players for Majestic 7 pick. On the other hand, Liverpool coming off of back to back Ls vs Bournemouth and Real Madrid, you'd hope the players are more than motivated to put on a good shift vs one of the best teams in the world which will help them massively getting closer to the top 4. If Klopp has any intention to at least get a point from this game he'd make sure to ban Joe Gomez from the team bus that's traveling to Manchester. Also you can't really trust Liverpool's horrible midfield to put up much of a fight against the juggernaut of a midfield City has, so Id look out for Liverpool to try and attack on the counter and catch City off guard. This season for Liverpool, goals have been hard to come by but Salah has got 4 G/A vs City in last 3 encounters between two clubs. I can see him scoring in a close 2-1 victory for City. Goalscorer: Mo SalahBrighton vs BrentfordThis will be heaven for neutrals who like attacking football. You feel like both teams can beat each other in this game which, imo, will come down to who is more clinical in front of the goal. This game can easily go over 2.5 goals with both teams scoring. I am a big fan of Mitoma, whos been in a tear all March, with 6 G/A in 7 games for club and country while creating so many chances with his scintillating dribbling and runs. So Ill confidently pick him to score vs a middle of the park Brentford defense. Birds vs Bees bring it on.Â Goalscorer: Kaoru MitomaArsenal vs LeedsLeeds manager Javi said on his presser that they'll be ready to defend more than attack. That should tell you the intention of Leeds coming into the game. Meanwhile Arsenal control their own destiny in this title race. In Premier League they have been firing on all cylinders after the defeat vs Man City. Saka, stand out player of the season, coming off playing heavy minutes in both of England games (90 min, and 85 min) I think he could use some rest but knowing how intense the race is, he will probably start with Trossad and Martinelli with Gabriel Jesus off the bench. Since Saka might be a little burnt out from national duties my pick for any time goalscorer is Martinelli, he is well rested and could take advantage of a Leeds backline with his pace on a comfortable Arsenal win. Goalscorer: Gabriel MartinelliCrystal Palace vs LeicesterWell Roy Hodgson is back and no Palace fan knows why to be honest. Shocking appointment from Palace board it's like they're trying to tank like Houston Rockets in NBA. Anyway, the new manager bounce ain't gonna happen when your new manager is 75 yrs old and can't bounce. My prediction for this game would be Draw or Leicester City win with Harvey Barnes scoring. Leicester are in a desperate spot right now and they will look to prolong Palace's 13 games winless record further.Goalscorer: Harvey BarnesNottingham Forrest vs WolvesBoth teams are dreadful, Forrest no wins in over a month and Wolves with only 1 win. Forrest got so many injuries at the moment, Serge Aurier, Andre Ayew and Brennan Johnson all doubtful so they will probably be down 3 starters in a must win game for relegation battle. The creative duty will all be on Gibbs White who had excellent display with England U21. Keylor Navas will have to produce a magnificent performance to keep Forrest alive then again Wolves have scored the lowest amount of goals in the league. For Wolves, they simply don't have any player in good form outside of Ruben Neves whos their best creator and goalscorer this season. Matheus Nunes could be back in the starting XI. My prediction for this game would be 0-0 but simply because I have to choose a goalscorer, Id bank on Neves to score in a 1-1 draw. Goalscorer: Ruben NevesNewcastle United vs Manchester UnitedNewcastle are favourite to win despite their form dipping as of late and rightfully so. Major disappointment for Man United as Casemiro is set to miss out because of a suspension from red card. I cannot write enough how big of a miss he is going to be for Man United on that midfield because Fred simply isn't good enough defensively neither is Scott McTominay. They are more vulnerable than ever without Casemiro. And Newcastle will surely be looking to take revenge for the cup final that Nick Pope missed via suspension. How the tables have turned. Rashford clearly the most inform British striker at the moment. Even in a loss I think he will find the back of the net so Ill pick him as my Majestic 7 pick.Goalscorer: Marcus RashfordEverton vs Tottenham HotspurThis will be the game of set pieces and crosses. Sean Dyche will be ready with his low block to annoy Spurs for whole 90 mins. Freshly off the sacking of Conte, we don't know clearly what the interim manager gonna do but one thing is certain tho, Harry Kane will be looking to add to his tally of goals as always. If Everton make the game more scrappy I think it will suit Kane even more as he is excellent with headers from set pieces. Speaking from my past experience, this will probably be one of the worst game to watch this week for the neutral fans and maybe even for Spurs fans. I reckon Spurs win 2-0 with Kane scoring both.Goalscorer: Harry Kane",

      "body": "City vs LiverpoolThis game will be a match of the round and first after the European qualification in the Premier league. We can expect good game with fantastic atmopshere. City will play without Erling Haaland and Phil Foden. Liverpool needs the points to secure their spot in conference league or even in Champions league as Brentford and Brighton are close to them. On the other side, City needs points in race for the 1st place in the league being 9 points after Arsenal.Brighton vs BrentfordBoth teams have 42 points, but Brighton has two matches left to play against United at home and Newcastle as away team. As Brighton plays this game at home, I give them little more chances to win. Overall, I expect game with less goals and Mitoma to score.Arsenal vs LeedsArsenal is 1st in the league, despite not qualifying to the next stage of European league after losing at home against Sporting after the penalties. Â They would with victory or draw against Arsenal, achieve important points to get further away from the relegation zone. As Arsenal plays at home, feel like it should be comfortable win for them with all their amazing player that they have.Crystal Palace vs LeicesterCrystal Palace is slightly in better position with 27 points and Leicester has 25 in the match to escape from relegation zone. Last time when Palace played at home, they lost with the margin of 1 goal against City as Haaland scored penalty for the Citizens. It will be a good game and small details will decide, who will be more successful.Nottingham Forest vs WolverhamptonThere is nothing much to say, game of the bottom teams in the league. Wolves arent playing bad and have a lot of good players. On the other side we have Keylor Navas, who is really good goalkeeper and will try to disable players from scoring goals with his fantastic saves. Wolves are going to win this match.Newcastle vs UnitedIt will be another exciting match to watch as we will see the clash of two teams in top of the league. Newcastle will try to get to the spot that leads them to the Champions league and United will try to secure it. It will be over 1.5 goals in the match and Rashford will score almost for sure.Tottenham vs EvertonThis will be the game of the teams from top and the bottom of the league. Totenham will try to secure a Champions league spot in the match against Everton. It should not have been a big deal for them and Harry Kane will try to score a goal again.",

      "body": "Manchester City vs LiverpoolGoalscorer: Kevin De BruyneWith Kevin getting back into form recently, i'm deciding to go with an underdog as for this match's goalscorer. I think Kevin has what it takes to hit a stunner versus the Reds - from a few yards outside the box right into the top bin corner. Mark my words!Â   Nottingham Forest vs WolverhamptonGoalscorer: Emmanuel DennisI think the Nottingham guys are going to claim ground at home, facing the Wolves in a tough form as well i'd give the home team a slight advantage in this matchup. With Emmanuel Dennis's experience, and years of playing at e.a. Watford & FC Cologne - I think he has what it takes to score a goal in this game. As each point is extremely valuable down the table in the Premier League. Margins are super tight, each point counts!Crystal Palace vs Leicester CityGoalscorer: James MaddisonTo be completely honest, this is quite a biased pick as i'm a huge fan of James Maddison's play on the pitch. The difference when Leicester has to play without him and when they do play with him is huge imo. He brings so much life to the team, can create opportunities out of no where - and has a deadly long-shot! His free kicks is something to look out for as I think James's surely getting a goal in this match!Brighton vs BrentfordGoalscorer: Solly MarchUnlike most, i've decided not to go with Ivan Toney for this one. I personally think Brighton will be dominating this matchup and result in a 2-0/3-0 win therefore I had to pick a goalscorer on their side of the squads. I've decided to pick Solly March who seems to be in great form recently scoring and being effective in many of Brighton's recent games - i'm hoping he can keep up this form and put one in the back of the net this weekend!Arsenal vs LeedsGoalscorer: Gabriel MartinelliIt's time for Arsenal to show some dominance after this international game break! If they want to take the title home at the end of the year - now is the time to show up and show what you can bring to the opponents! I'm expecting Arsenal to win with big numbers (3-0, 4-0, 5-0) and think that Gabriel Martinelli with his pace and freedom in the winger position will definitely get some opportunities to get a goal in for Arsenal!Newcastle vs Manchester UnitedGoalscorer: Marcus RashfordAs a big Manchester United fan myself, I can't justify not picking a Manchester United goalscorer, although I think it could definitely be a very tough game for us. Newcastle has some strong names in their lineup nowadays and Manchester will have to play their A game in order to get the victory here! If there is one to do it for us - it'll have to be Marcus Rashford to bring in the goalÂ  Everton vs TottenhamGoalscorer: Heung-Min SonAlthough this game may look on paper like an easy win for Tottenham, I think it'll be a rather close game in which Everton are gonna have the upperhand in terms of creating the chances, but I feel like Tottenham will walk away with the win (1-2). Heung-min Son will score on an assist from Harry Kane in one of their deadly counter-attacks is my feeling!There we go - that concludes my Majestic 7 predictions. Goodluck everyone & may someone be having the weekend of their life and taking home the grand $10,000 jackpot!",
