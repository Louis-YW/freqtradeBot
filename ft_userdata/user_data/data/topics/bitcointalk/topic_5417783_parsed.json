People would specify if they want to bet low or high, what is their algorithm etc, submit their \"scenarios\" and then your server would execute 100/500/1000 rolls - the person with the highest ROI would win the contest.",

      "body": "Here is suggestion for a Dice tournament. There will be an entry fee for the tournament. The players that sign up play in a league against each other. Football style with groups where everyone plays against everyone. Home and away fixtures.   Let's say you get 4 groups with 4 players per group. That's a total of 16 players.After all group matches are over, the 2 best ranked players from each group proceed to the knockout stage. 8 players participate in the knockout battles. That's the 1/4 finals. The winners advance to 1/2 finals and Finals in the end. Each knockout game will have 2 battles per fixture. Rules:- A match consists of X dice rolls. 5 or 10 for example.- Each roll has a fixed bet. You can't bet more or less.- The winner of the match is the player who predicted the most overs/unders and with the lower overall win chance parentage average. So to win against your opponent, you need to have predicted more overs/unders than them and placed winning wagers on lower win chances on average. (I will provide examples below).- There will be a maximum win chance where you can't wager above that. For example, no bets over a 65% or 70% win chance per bet. There is no lower limit. Bet on a 2% win chance if you want.- Rewards can be paid out only to the finalists where the winner gets more obviously. Or everyone who qualifies for the knockout stages could also get a reward.- The winner of each match gets 3 points, the loser gets 0. In case they draw, (same amount of correctly predicted overs/unders with the same average win chance percentage) they each get 1 point.- There are no points in the knockout matches. The aim is to record more wins in 2 matches with the lower total win chance percentage.- The two players with the most gathered points at the end of the group matches advance to the knockout stages. If they finish with the same amount of points, the winner is the one with a better total win count throughout the entire group stage. If they have the same count, the winner is the one with a lower win chance percentage on average. - In the knockout stages, Winner of Group 1 plays against the 2nd placed in Group 2. The 2nd placed of Group 1 plays against the winner of Group 2, etc. A few examples of winners and losers for 5 rolls per match.- Player A ends the match with 1 win and 4 losses. Player B ends ends the match with 2 wins and 3 losses. Player B is the winner no matter what the average win chance percentage of the rolls were.- Both players successfully predict 3 out of 5 rolls. But Player A had an average win chance percentage of 47% while Player B had one of 51. Player A is the winner.  It would be best if the participants wouldn't know each other and had to sign up via a Google spreadsheet with alternative usernames to prevent them from colluding. The results of the other party wouldn't be known until both players complete their sets of X rolls. Maybe a bit complicated, but that's it.",

You need both, i.e innovation and tradition and I guess this is what Neodice attempting right now. I like this completion and may contribute if anything strikes in my mind. Good luck Neodice!",

      "body": "Your Neodice username: AgbeMy idea to promote Neodice is that, Neodice should have some ancient dice methods that is different from present day dice. Like setting a specific number (that is writing the number down) in the Neodice site and throw 1,2 or 3 dice and when the number on the dice matched the number he has written down then he became the winner of the game.  If the person wrote 1 as a number then he can pick one dice and  throw to match the digit if it is two, he can still pick one dice, or two dice all depends on him. In this method, it not roll as it is now in the site but to throw on the ground and let it roll on the floor just like physical dice game. Real dice should be roll on floor for the player to see his performance. Adding with this now the players that visit the site will choice which one to play.And also, Neodice can add shorting games like shorting flying bird if the player short and kill the bird then he wins the game. In addition there should be blindfolded game. Neodice can select the number of players in the game probably 3 or 5. The player will be blindfolded the the one that is blindfolded will pursue the rest people if he catches anyone, the played has won. But if he did not catch anyone before the given time he has loss. This are some interesting games that needed to add in online casinos.",

Thank you!Dice Lotto/Bingo. IIRC Primedice has this kind of contest before but I don’t know the exact mechanics so credits to them if the mechanics is identical.You will give a certain winning number in sequence for each week that needs to be hit on dice result consecutively to become eligible for weekly reward.Let’s say 5,10,16,20 and so on depends on how many winning numbers that you want. The players need to hit that numbers consecutively to win. You can introduced consolation price depend on the number of winning number hit consecutively. The more number hits is the higher the price.",

Then try again to reach 100.Or You set what number to be hit.Ex. For this round players need to hit 6 for 6 times if they got that they will be declared as a winner.There just trying to share my wild ideas out of nowhere, also don't know if this one also exist everywhere so credits goes to them if they own this.",

      "body": "I came up with a simple contest/giveaway type of idea that would take place here in the forum.You can simulate a dice roll by taking the hash of any given bitcoin block and use the last letter of that hash as a corresponding figure of a dice.a = 1b = 2c = 3d = 4e = 5f = 6At the beginning of the contest, everyone choses a side of the dice, basically a number from 1-6 and then a chosen block will reveal which number will stay in the game.Here's an example:Looking at the hash of bitcoin block 756000:000000000000000000073cdaa0c1e5f91707f7b3217a4b3265d2e783f2fa83dbb would be the number 2.Everyone that chose number 2 would stay in the game and the next round would begin. This can go on until there's only one person left who will take make 1mBTC as a reward.Having to chose a new number/side of the dice every round makes it a fun game and not a simple guess 1-100 of the next block hash type of thing.edit: adding my Neodice Username: sam00",

      "body": "How about trying to have ROI/profit contest? It is rare to see such contest, this contest can be suitable for most players starting from small players to whales since it will be based on percentage of profit not based on how much our profit is. Of course you have to make some rules such as minimum starting bankroll and minimum wager to be eligible. It is simple contest where players with the highest ROI in the end of the contest wins. Example: User A start with $10 and his final balance is $20 so the ROI is 100%User B start with $100 and final balance is $170 so the ROi is 70% User C start with $50 and final balance is $75 so the ROI is 25% In this case user A wins the contest since he has the highest percentage. (ignore the percentage of above ROI if there is mathematical mistake, just example).",
