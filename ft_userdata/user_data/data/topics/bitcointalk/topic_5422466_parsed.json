  "content": "Hey guys I’m coming to y’all bc I’m at a loss. I’m looking for a company that will make high quality, mirror proof, silver and gold plated coins. This seems like an easy ask but I have googled, BING’d, facebooked, and all around searched for this for hours on end and I get either a “coins for anything” style challenge coin company or silver plating companies. Can’t seem to find one that makes silver plated proof coins to custom order. Any advice or info pointing me in the right direction would be hugely appreciated. If you recommend a company and I end up using them I’ll give you a free piece from my next release. Thanks guys",
