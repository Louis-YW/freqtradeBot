  "content": "The past year has shown the potential of play-to-earn games. Unfortunately, these games typically place such a heavy emphasis on the \"earn\" aspect that the gameplay suffers. Ethergy is a 2d Multiplayer game, originally inspired by diep.io. The gameplay involves a 2d, top-down view of your spaceship. You fly around in a multiplayer view of space and mine resources from asteroids and attempt to return these resources to the space station. These resources are then used to craft upgrades, build new ships, or can be sold for the in-game currency which can be withdrawn as a token. The twist is that ships are NFTs that when destroyed in space are burned. Rather than using money to incentivize people to play, we hope to use the integration of tokens to add a new dimension of gameplay with interesting risk/reward mechanics. We've been working on this project for a bit over a year and we recently completed our playable prototype. We hope to launch our public alpha towards the end of the year. If you want to play early and provide feedback, you can register your email on www.ethergy.xyz - or join us on Discord https://discord.gg/2GKxgPW33w",
