  "content": "We all will agree that most countries around the world have had a misconception about bitcoin which has lowered the rate of Bitcoin adoption globally, various countries with their own mode of Bitcoin view the authoritarian states like china will have a total ban on Bitcoin even though it is an impossible thing since bitcoin is decentralized uncontrollable and independent.Even with all this, Bitcoin has continued to consistently thrive to pursue its true mandate and even though a few numbers of Bitcoin adopters and bitcoin have been perceived as illegal, and public display of Bitcoin can be prosecuted through states laws that ban Bitcoin authoritatively e.g china and other countries in Africa and other part of the world that have one or two regulations.WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU WILL DO IF BITCOIN BECOMES GLOBALLY ACCEPTED JUST LIKE THE INTERNET?For me I will open my Bitcoin mining farm that will be public with a website and registered under the law for clients that will want third-party services that will align with global best practices of cryptography and digital asset management.",

Now already I spend fiat money first if I have enough on everyday purposes (and it could be one of effects of adoption). I'm sure I could spend bitcoin directly in most cases years before it will be globally adopted as different stores are starting accepting it all the time. So I have no exact plans on that day.",

That is not profitable at all...I suggest you focusing on the call center which will allow people clearing their doubts out and acquiring knowledge about the best crypto and financial practices. Mining farm is a risky investment and many people willing to do this have already lost money, due to the costs of the mining operation being superior to the income made mining cryptocurrencies, so be careful.",

With the acceptance, there will be lots of persons who will be seeking for how to learn more about bitcoins, I will try to fill in that gap by providing free lectures and seminars around me where people can learn the basics and also basic safety practices with the bitcoins they have. I understand scammers can take advantage of those seeking to learn about bitcoins and buy bitcoins, so the free lectures and seminars can help in reducing the number of victims. This is another action that can be adopted by other forum members when bitcoins become globally accepted.",

Like the US. dollar which is a global currency but maybe you won't be able to use it at every location globally.correctto refine your pointbeing legal tender mainly means its treated as a currency which means a nations government can apply its currency laws to it. this means they can then regulate ityep bitcoin 2009-2014 was defined as private property. much like for instance pokemon cards that could be swapped without hassle from government intervention. as soon as countries declared it a legal currency. government stepped in with their regulation of businesses/services that were swapping btc. by defining those businesses as money service businesses thus those businesses needed to get licences and follow policies and such.yes you dont need to get a government to determine btc is legal tender for btc to \"go global\"however the laziness of accelerating global use by being an legally acknowledged currency in a country, comes at a cost of allowing that government to underpin some rules of using said currency",

I don't know where you live, but is there a government agency there that can prevent me from sending BTC to an address you give me? Is there one in China, Afghanistan, Cuba, Nigeria...? No one needs to give you permission to accept bitcoin. The code and software gives you the needed access rights.",
