The lead investor in the funding round had withdrawn due to market conditions and disagreements on terms.Marchants are to withdraw all their money in fiat or crypto before 30th April.https://twitter.com/njokuScript/status/1646531643371585546?t=XMULGkOrX7GpvSpfa2r5Sg&s=19",

Finding investors this date while crypto is in bullish form may sounds like assuring, but talking to terms-related issue is the most problematic one.I checked their site, looks like they are just offering payment gateway. For a payment gateway only service offering is not new to investors, having more service/features is the one they are looking for (i guess), i'm comparing it to the crypto payment-gateway here in my country where they offer, paying bills (internet, electric, water),  as exchange too, sms prepaid loads, game credits, loans, tv vouchers, cards, so many more that's why they can get more investors when they are offering seed funding, sounds like everything lol.",

Dollar card has even been existing before the ban and it has higher withdrawal limit at the time too.",

The list in the Op is about countries that support withdrawal, this could mean that they allow transfers all over the world and one can receive the payment, but only in designated countries can one withdraw to their local currency.For example, someone in Kenya[a listed country} can receive and send to someone in Spain[not listed], but only the person in Kenya can withdraw to their bank account, while the person in Spain cannot.

I mean, they are trying to solve different problems. Those P2P services are closing because it is no longer profitable since that is the only thing that they do. If anything, I believe competitions from other payment gateways are quite strong, not to mention there are open-source alternatives out there. In this case, the reason given is also quite clear. Market conditions and disagreements on terms, basically mean their investors believed injecting more money into them with the terms that were discussed at the time was not profitable for them. At the same time, they failed to find another investor and can't lower their demands since that was probably the minimum level to run their operations.",

Other cryptocurrencies I could understand, as they would all probably require full nodes in order to keep systems functional. Failure to raise capital sounds like a pretty poor excuse to shut the doors. If the business was functional and making a profit, it should be able to survive without it and with more usage, should come more resources to expand or at least maintain. It sounds more like they have given up if lack of business is not the reason for shutting down.",

It sounds more like they have given up if lack of business is not the reason for shutting down. Not a poor excuse, in such difficult market conditions and also the deteriorating economic situation in many countries, there are many famous payment companies that have closed their doors due to lack of business and bad market conditions.Also, do not forget that the economic situation in Nigeria is bad, banks are suffering and they set very difficult conditions for withdrawals, in addition to the strict laws that the Nigerian government imposes on crypto companies.",

I don't think so, their very reason is not about having regulatory problems since they are just payment gateways unlike the other p2p exchanges that shut recently. This is a common problem of startups not getting enough investors to continue their business",
