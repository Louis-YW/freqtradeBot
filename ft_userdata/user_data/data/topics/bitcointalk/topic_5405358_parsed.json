Hopefully you get the copper membership in order for you to post graphics of the actual gameplay on the site, as your site requires people to connect their wallet first before they can take a glance of the action. I don't really like the NFT aspect of this casino, and upon checking the game itself, nothing sets it apart from other platform apart from those fancy die that you get on the NFT side of things. This should be marketed more as an NFT collection and less as a gambling platform given how evident the platform sells as their own token.",

Kindly check and let me know your Answer The site's domain name was already on the title and to play the game you need to go to their dApp site, if you visit their main site you'll be able to find it. Kinda interesting on how AVAX dApps work but I guess as most of the gaming site dApps out there, they'll be just playable using personal wallet. The interesting part for me was the NFT but they're already sold out and secondary market is the only choice.",
