You might want to start with that next time.  It's not just that hypnosis is rare, it's only supposed to work on a very small percentage of individuals. The basic idea is that you believe it will work, and therefore it does. So, it's pretty clear that hypnosis is not something that you should worry about. So the next time you see a movie, don't believe everything you see. A lot of it is just a work of fiction!",

Normally asking for directives to some place, proceeds to haven't came with some goods from abroad and offers a proposal, then come along some random transport agent and the next you know, your complying to there every suggestion. You might be aware of what's going on but, you find it difficult to back off. They claim to have used some vudu charms on you and so, you don't get to tell or risk your life and shits like that until, the scheme is complete or your awoken to the reality of what is going on by a friend or family relative who observes your discomfort or finds your behaviour to be abnormal as these guys go as far as sending you home to get stuffs.Do we think this could apply in robbing users of there privacy/security in cryptos..., really!",

But I will make an amendment: there are people who do not succumb to this. Here, I agree with FatFork: it all depends on the person's propensity for the suggestion.Methods such as Erickson's hypnosis are a set of several tools for gaining trust from a person, having a confidential conversation, and, as a result, gaining their submission, provided that, in their subconscious, the person has already accepted what was discussed for himself. The person will perform actions automatically, as he will be in a state of trance. An example of such a trance is when we experience regularly thinking about something while being distracted from everything that is happening, and then \"waking up\" and returning to reality.There are people who get such a suggestion without any education. If you are familiar with gypsy hypnosis, then these people have strange abilities. Therefore, when observing the behavior of strangers diligently trying to become \"useful\" to you, you should always be on the alert and understand that you can be manipulated.",

OrYou should already know this that people can be talked into doing financial transactions they don't intend to, no I don't even mean a girlfriend talking the boyfriend over some financial transactions or the wife doing that to the husband but for certain times some partners in relationship can classify such spending as being hypnotized  when they can't give account of how they have suddenly become spendthrift lol. Seriously what you are saying is very possible and in Nigeria talking about this act, I have heard some stories where people came to their homes to take out valuable properties including electrical gadgets to give to strangers at the stranger's instruction waiting for them in a certain place. Some stories in same light involves emptying their bank account to strangers while some of these incidents were intercepted by neighbors when they see you could be acting not in your volition, so this is possible.Quote from: CryptocurencyKing on November 30, 2022, 05:20:58 PMMaybe, have there keys or seed phrases exposed?Account passwords and more.Just some hypothetical thinking...I will like us to discuss the possibility of this if it is possible at all.I suspect this could be a green area for crypto scammers but it is also related to wallet hacking because the aim is to have hold of the wallet password or phrases by whatever means to displace owner. The ground information is we have to be cautious and careful when dealing with people regarding our finance both fiat and crypto.",

That's clear enough for me and hopeful it goes both ways.Now the thing is, am not saying someone would just jump you or something although, I don't doubt it's possibility but,Isn't it possible that some sick individual, needing therapy could subject himself to some therapy by hypnosis with a whole different intention  at heart and then, without any suspicion during the process, the administrator digresses to fraud?That's just one way I've chosen to think of it.",

Tapping into one’s subconscious isn’t an easy thing to do, monks fast and sit in silence for weeks just to learn the art to strengthening the mind, and to understand the true nature of oneself. As far as I know, one has to allow the hypnotist or hypnotherapist before the hypnosis can be carried out, I have seen this in magic shows and movies, frankly I don’t believe in the science or even regard it as a science. It is a magic trick that works on people who desperately need to believe in it.",

It is also possible that if you are hypnotized and told to forget about the incident totally by the hypnotizer, you will most likely not have a knowledge of whatever you did. The best thing is just to hope and pray for you not to cross lanes with people who use their hypnotic skills for criminality, so we don't become their victims.",

Well, I don't. I think books are a far better at that. When I think of movies, I think of escapism, mindless entertainment, something to pass the time on a rainy day or when you have nothing else to do. Books are usually more in-depth, and they're often written by someone who knows what they're talking about. For example, many well-known science fiction writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke were also scientists, and they used their knowledge to predict what might happen in the future.
