  "content": "I recently bet on Duelbits promotion on Chiefs vs Raiders match over 6.5 touchdown for 3.2 odds. I have no ide on how touch down counts on sportsbook. Does the 6.5 touchdown includes all types of touch down (passing, rushing & receiving) or just some specific touch down. I read the terms of the promotion but it doesn't stated what touch down counted. I'm planning to watch the game tomorrow morning here. I just want to make sure that my expectation to win is right.

      "body": "All touch down in form of rushing and receiving is counted on the total TD bets. Passing touch down is simply an assist to a TD that means it’s nit counted on the total TD for your bets. Each game has a game summary including the minutes when the TD happened. You can use that as reference to count TD for your bets in the match you bet to avoid being confused on counting the total TD made. You can easily count it when you are watching the game because it will display on the screen for the score count.Best of luck.",

I though assist on this game will be on the stats and not on touch down. I’m using the summary to check the total count but the touch down count on each player record is what makes me confused on the counting. I get it now why there’s more touch down count when I manually count on each player record compared to the summay of the game touch down count. I really appreciate the help!",
