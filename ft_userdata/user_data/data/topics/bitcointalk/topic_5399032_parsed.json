Im willing to split the nft 70/30 and give you the money back for the fee because i really need the money to pay our rent.",

How you can be sure that you will sell your NFT in a short time? even if you get a loan, you have no guarantee that you will sell it before the time comes to pay the rent.Also, you don't offer valid collateral, so this will not be able to happen to someone who has just registered, only to ask for free money. I suggest you try to find other sources to pay your rent.",

You think selling an NFT is similar to selling the usual tokens that have value that you can just deposit in an exchange and trade?Who do you think is going to buy your ugly monkey NFT in the shortest time possible, more over at even a higher price than the gas fees?You are not going to receive that money. Try somewhere else.",
