Banks don't have the dollars you see in your account, and your broker doesn't have the gold you bought. As long as you don't withdraw, the exchange can do anything they want. The moment you have your Bitcoin in your wallet you know for sure it's real, and that's something you can't do at your stock broker.Don't use shady exchanges that don't allow you to withdraw.Quote from: stompix on June 19, 2022, 12:40:49 PMLet's be honest, most so-called long-term holders are right now thinking \"I could have sold at 60k buy now 3 times more BTC\"You read my mind!",

It'd make sense considering the amount of data exchanges have available to just increase the gap between lowest asks and highest bids and make the market buyers buy something for slightly higher but keep the funds for the company (especially when people are panic selling and volatility is expected anyway - exchanges certainly aren't arbitraging with forex either for some reason).",

However, if you offered me the opportunity to make three times more Bitcoin, without any uncertainty at all. I'd bite your hand off for it. Obviously, you can't guarantee it. However, there was definitely long term holders who were holding for a few years, that sold, and recouped much more Bitcoin during these times. Also, I don't think long term holders should be seen as someone who keeps absolutely everything in Bitcoin no matter what. Most long term users will be doing trading every so often, especially when the market presents itself like it has now. Bitcoin almost has absolute guarantee of volatility in the short term. So, it somewhat makes sense. I imagine a few long term holders sold a percentage of their coins during all time highs, and then bought back in at lower prices, essentially increasing the amount they hold. Doesn't that make sense to do? I didn't. Probably because I'm not much of a speculator. Do I wish I did now looking at the price? Absolutely, I would've jumped right back in, and accumulated at least double of what I sold. Sometimes, you've just got to make the most of how the market is reacting. For example, I'm willing to sell anything in my house that's just been lying around now, and the reinvest that into Bitcoin at its current price.

Therefore, you aren't increasing your fiat reserve necessarily, but you're increasing the amount of Bitcoin you would hold. I've never traded Bitcoin for profit in fiat. I've used it for things I wanted at the time, trips etc. However, if I was offered the guarantee of buying 1 Bitcoin, then later selling that for a 3x profit in fiat, waiting for Bitcoin to drop, and then reinvesting that entire amount back into Bitcoin to turn my one Bitcoin into three Bitcoin.
