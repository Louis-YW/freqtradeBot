I don't know, but it is stupid to invest in such tokens that have no value outside the platform and have no real use and do not represent the value of those sports teams, although I am puzzled how binance manages the legal aspects of such tokens/NFTs derived from real things.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/manchester-united-shares-rise-after-elon-musk-jokes-about-buying-the-club.html",

As you can see,  its like Binance have some sort of season where same classes of tokens pump and also dump so its kinda scary to ride it without associated with such high risk attitude. Some probably are taking advantage of it and gonna do a massive dump after they got their profits straight.",

The Word Cup will not a big event and gives them big reasons to pump fan tokens.Fan tokens will be very good for your portfolio this year but I don't advice to buy them now, today after they pumped crazy already. Wait and find other opportunities when they are in red and accumulate them.",

This seems reasonable since seasons in 2020-2021 are all plagued with covid, low revenue reported from many teams. And since all soccer tokens are the low cap coins, very easy to pump it up if there is a strong interest in the coin.",

Bought the rest of football shitcoins hoping they will pump too as hard as santot did. Just like when doge pumped sooner or later all meme coins pumped. We've seen it played out many times. Buy a little bit of each shitcoins of the same type. Pump one of them thanks to low liquidity and take profit on all of them. I would not touch it.",

As we know that the big leagues in Europe have started, and this is the real driver of the hype. There is no reason to have more faith in various fan tokens, these tokens have no clear utility.",

Lazio may did another break out but this is a very huge risk as investment. How lucky those who have been buying santos at the bottom.WTF it was going even more than 400% instantly. What a pump from the whales. Yes, I thought so too, this hike seemed unnatural and like being pumped on purpose by the whales. Should be more careful to invest in these coins, because the price could drop significantly.",

This fan token is useless which I can’t find any reasonable explanation why people are still buying this token without considering the risk involved. There’s no way that they are buying just because they are a fan of that sports team but rather they are just riding the hype and it cause a ripple effect to all fan token. Don’t ever consider buying this ticking time bomb coin because they will surely suffering huge loss on the upcoming days once there’s no new buyer fueling the hype pump.I purchased once of this tokens but during the IEO on binance and I never do it again because the value sharply drops within a day after listing.",

Usually with soccer token pumping have good news about their soccer team it self like Santos maybe have new recruitment on window transfer. But I don't see about Santos as favorite soccer team and not really famous, I think with drastically pump and dump not really recommended for trading or investing with soccer tokens and looks very risk when you try buy one of soccer tokens. Today I checked all soccer tokens have been dump although with soccer token support by Binance Lazio coins, I think keep away with soccer token is better than taking risk and afraid price drop again with all soccer token.",

I am not a fan of this token investment because usually if they are not worth it to invest in the long term. It seems you gamble your money, it is very risky because the price of tokens usually suddenly pumps and when it has a correction, it will never come back, and that ios a start they will become a scam.",
