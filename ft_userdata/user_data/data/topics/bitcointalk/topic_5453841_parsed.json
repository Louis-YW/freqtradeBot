You just need to be sure and know how to define all the conditions.I see that you are somewhat more active in gambling, I have to say that I think that it is not the smartest thing to deal with lending, to keep someone's funds, and at the same time have a tendency to gamble. It seems that things can go wrong very easily.",

Reputation can not be built overnight. Even the current lenders u see today once had Newbie accountsYou have to get involved in the community, help other members. Over time, your reputation will grow as you interact with members. An Escrow holding collateral is the way to go right now though it will affect your interest fee as you have to cover the escrow fee as wellYou will also get trusted community members who will seek no collateral loans. If the member is genuine and trustworthy, this will be a good deal for you as they will pay full amounts in time",

The only point you can potentially scam as a lender is if you refuse to send the collateral back after the you are credited with the loan given. This can be solved by using a reputable escrow who would hold the collateral funds and return them to the debtor once they return the loan.After months of no issues with an escrow-ed service you can gain the trust of forum members and not need the escrow anymore.- Jay -",

Since you have both of them, you're good to go. Reputation and credibility are not built in one day. As people start dealing with you, your service will determine the feedback or the rating you get. If you are trustworthy your client will recommend you to other members. Visit the lending board and study their operations. There are also well-established lenders in the forum. Their wealth of experience can be an asset to you. You can identify and reach out for some business advice. They might be willing to give you some important tips or trade secrets of the business.

Due to an exceptionally high incidence of scamming, this is generally no longer the case. You generally MUST put up some form of collateral (usually some type of alternative cryptocurrency, like Litecoin or Quark). This depends heavily on the lender, and physical collateral may also be accepted (motorcycles, watches, PMs).Please refrain from requesting unnecessary \"confidence loans\" (a loan you don't need, but want to take out simply to show you'll repay). This was an issue a year or so ago, where scammers would take out incrementally larger loans, pay maybe .1BTC in interest, then take off with a 1BTC loan. A history of so-called confidence loans inspire more hesitancy than confidence.This subforum has an exceptionally high amount of trolling. Legitimate lendees are scared away or simply don't care to subject themselves to unjustified degradation. Skepticism is okay, but please try to be civil. Either way - if you request a loan, be prepared.Almost all loans issued in this subforum would be at rates considered to be exploitative in most countries. We're talking about something like 5-15% monthly (there are some more favorable alternatives, such as seeking out the Islamic Bank of Bitcoin). Use short-term loans responsibly, do not use loans for naked market positions or otherwise attempt to arb, and you should only use short-term lending from strangers as an absolute last resort. Also the lending business especially in the crypto-currency sector and also not collecting collateral can be a very risky business which you should also secure yourself, I think you should atleast learn more about the lending scams and this post can help you on that.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?,topic=119896.msg1291483#msg1291483I have been on the forum for a while now and although there are many lenders people rather go with those who has good reputation for me my best option is Darkstar, well you can always try your luck in the business.",

You could look at the threads of popular lenders like Darkstar, Shasan and observe their process and how each manage their business. There are a lot of shady characters that frequent the lending section, you will have to learn how to use the trust system, how to identify accounts that are high risk (these are accounts with a negative tag, hacked/sold accounts that just woke up), I suggest you should only give loans to reputable members for now until you’re more familiar with the forum. I believe this advice from Tomatocage will help you come to a decision. Quote from: Tomatocage on October 23, 2012, 03:50:07 AM0. Newbies, NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH OTHER NEWBIES, EVER. There are plenty of veteran members to do business with and ALWAYS use escrow. If you're a newbie and you're doing business with another newbie, there's a 100% chance that you will get scammed (or you're a scammer yourself).",

If his rank is still newbie it's up to him if he'll grant those loans to random people but I'd be picky to begin with this service.
