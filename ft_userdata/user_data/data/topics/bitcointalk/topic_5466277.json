It might have been crushed amidst a heap of other refuse, or perhaps its components no longer function as they should.He seems utterly fixated on that lost balance, even disregarding the ramifications of sifting through the accumulating trash.If I were in his shoes, I too would likely harbor profound remorse for what transpired. 8K BTC is no trifling sum in today's context. It would undoubtedly impel me to act irrationally, diving headfirst into that landfill, meticulously scouring every fragment of refuse in search of it.",

The guy would have at least stored his private keys/seed phrase in a piece of paper inside his house.This guy is blaming someone else for his own mistake. It's like forgetting a bag with 1 million US dollars in the subway and blaming the city council for your own stupidity. Some people really lose their minds, when it comes to money. Yeah, I know it sucks to lose such big amount of money, but the only thing to go is to just try to continue living with the regret and move on with your life. Those Bitcoins are gone for good.",

You can see how impatience could cause someone to loos a whole lot of fortune. I still don't know why he blames the local council and want to sue them because in First place, he was the one who trashed his hard drive. He should come to reality like for over a decade now, that drive definitely would never be found and if possible it must have been crushed and damaged.  Being a Bitcoin holder teaches us the importance of patience. Bitcoin's value has gone up and down a lot since it started, and it can be unpredictable. But, we can learn from this story. Patience is the key to being a Bitcoin holder. If you hold onto your Bitcoin and don't get worried when the market goes up and down, your 1,000 Bitcoins today might be worth a lot more, like a million in the future. We can't be sure what will happen, but staying positive and HODL onto your Bitcoin is the key to success.",

      "body": "It sounds like a broken record, but \"No backup, no mercy!\" has its justification. By the time the harddisk disappeared it was very likely a legacy Bitcoin-GUI (now Bitcoin Core) wallet, no HD wallet. So there were individual random private keys in a keystore of certain size in that wallet. Making backups was kind of mandatory. Having the backups on the same storage device is like no backup at all, if you consider the risk of a failure of this particular storage device. On that part the owner has to blame himself.AFAIR by end of 2012 Bitcoin was around 10$, by midth of 2013 somewhere in the region of 15$, thus having no separate and redundant backup for a value of 80,000-120,000$$ is completely irresponsible, to say the least.I heard years ago about this story but can't say that I know the whole truth of it. If I had a harddrive with valuable data on it, I'd put it in a clearly labeled harddrive protection container that screams \"don't throw me away\" to my partner or anybody else. On that part the owner has to blame himself, too, I guess.Though harddrives have a pretty sturdy metal frame, I doubt the harddrives from the era of around 2013 and earlier were sealed against water and much pressure on the thin top cover. If moisture gets in that's going to be a problem over the long time it can do its bad on the surfaces of the drive's platters.Then the owner would also have the problem to remember the wallet password/passphrase and that it's not an easy one, if a data recovery company manages to scrape the data from the (corroded?) platters. What if they say \"Sorry, pal, we couldn't recover your data, it was too badly corroded! But you have to pay the attempted data recovery anyway.\" while a malevolent recovery technician indeed managed to recover the wallet and now continues to break the wallet password/passphrase.(Yes, I know, it's not going to work out for the technician because he can't move the coins without the owner getting to spot the lie. But after more years passing, more value, this might be a risk to take and prepare for.)",

He intends to use equipment such as robot dogs and other Artificial intelligence tools to carry out the search and discovery.
