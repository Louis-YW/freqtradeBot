      "body": "Hey there, PrivacyG!I don't know if you are aware, but there is an avatar campaign running right now (and which is still open for applications): [OPEN| AVATAR OPEN Reward $20/w] SINBAD MIXER Signature & Campaign. Up-to $130/W. By quickly browsing through the campaign pages I see that you were part of it a while ago. Now you left it, but I believe that you can still apply only for renting your avatar. As far as I see, they pay 20$ per week to those renting solely their avatars.Besides, there is also Betnomi's campaign, which also offers the possibility of renting only your avatar:  [FULL] Betnomi.com | Signature Campaign | Up to 0.0025 BTC/W. In this case, the payment is 0.001 BTC/week which, at current value of BTC, represents about 24$. However, this campaign is full at the moment but it won't hurt to keep watching it until a spot will be open again.I hope this helps.",

Same is available for your personal text  Seriously now, it is very nice and generous from you (I say that as I believe you are doing it either for free or for a minuscule compensation -- most likely for free) to promote the very nice contest organized by RickDeckard! I may be wrong, but I think you are the very first user promoting this contest through the avatar (and, so far, I only saw RickDeckard promoting it through his signature).Now seeing your support for the contest, I can't think anything else than inviting you to participate as well  come on, let's see your pie-baking skills! (Needless to say, the prizes are also very appealing!)",
