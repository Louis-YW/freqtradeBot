      "body": "Bro e no easy Sha, all this things wey you don list here na the problem most of us find ourselves inside. But trust us as Africans, if Dem tell us the Truth e dey beater for us. Sometimes when person try to advise us we go dey complain say the person wey dey try to advise us wether him way pure? Say you don change your life before you wan come change another. But no be so. Bad things always dey easy to learn than good thing. Like this your number three to dey always borrow money I been dey in that shoes, when I been dey work for one company, the payment wey dem dey pay me no reach anything and I dey with my family, we bearly cope with the salary wey I dey reacieved. Before month go end responsibilities don pile up and then no go pay money early before you know I don go borrow money to sustain my family, and the worst part be say na with interest so when the salary come I go settle dept finish, wetting go come remain no go still do me and family so I come dey leave that life of borrow and pay until I come get a higher paying job wey I come use the salary com clear all my dept come still get money to take care of family responsibilities. From there I come balance.So wetting I wan let you no be say sometimes no be our fault Sha na the situation nature push person enter naim dey cause am. Just like the parable wey d say na \"na condition make crayfish bend\" if situation hole you wella you go turn to another version of yourself. So wetting I wan advise be say no matter the situation just try to be the best of yourself. Sometimes e no easy because some of the Addiction you mentioned here na prayer and self decipline go fit change am.",

If we examine carefully, we can see that the treasures in our mental lives are found in the way that they govern our physical lives. If our mental lives are well-managed, we have many opportunities to take advantage of in those lives. When you can overcome a fear that arises when you want to accomplish something, it is a sign that your mental health is improving. For the first point you are making they said two heads are better than one, getting advice from people is not really a bad thing, and any information you get you can think it through and finalize.family and good friends have helped a lot of peoples succeed because one thing people don't understand is that everyone is important and have a role to play in everyone's life, even the time you spend with family and friends have its effect on us. and don't feel too important in life we are all as important as everyone and the issue of other people's opinion is true listening to people is good and you know after money the next thing is women and if the taste for women is not controlled then you have a lot of challenges even financially everything we do should have control.",

I know say sometimes we dey lie but make we know come take am to another level. Wey be say people go come dey fear you. If your lies making people dey fear you proffering you influential being, e still good because lies low on a competitive space makes you look inferior.Lieing as to influence the masses get better roles to play in a marketing or strategy because at times, you or your products need to be verbally attracted by the people.But basically... Lies way no bring favour no gel at all but at all.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMLife of always to dey borrow money: most homes wey don break today,  na because of borrow borrow. To they borrow money with any slightest opportunity wey cash no dey there hand. Sometimes na because of smoke or sure odd for bet wey no even sure. Las Las the game go cut.You go owe gbese together with interest. When money come your hand instead of you to use am do better thing na loan and interest you go use am pay come be like people wey no even see money. Borrowing of money with no productive intends normally keep one either on a stagnations or returning to zero levels because it either give you no room to invest your growth because there is always debts to pay and ur inabilities to payback belittles ur personality and ur irresponsible borrowing lifestyle tarnishes ones image in the society.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMSelling property with small challenge: some people too with small thing, Dem Don sell property. Until Dem go sell even foam wey Dem dey Carry sleep come dey sleep for ground, before you go buy those property back you go pay times three of the initial money because 9ja economy bad. So like this your life go just dey go front and back naim make some people never achieve anything since even say them dey see money. Na gamblers, drugs addicts and those flexible to pleasures such dey mostly happen to.Most of them literally acquires properties with a way forth say if e choke them fo sell am use the money hold sides and them dey usually sells out like distressed person's which mostly them no get choice than accepts whatever the buyer could offer them. This single acts na em dey bring the comments... \"I get am before\" while we all believe say... \"I get am before no be property\".The worse negative effects of this acts be say one them don sell all them get, na to dey look out to thief others properties for sell fo be the next version of their buying and selling journeys.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMAlways staying away from friends and relatives:  in as much as we dey find money make we dey take other people's affire serious too. sothat when e reach your turn people go also get time for you.some people always get that habits say nothing concern me. If you do wedding non of your family come e get as e go be to you. Or say you get emergency and nobody comes for you.  Successful life leaned on networking of person to person where by you rises through a relationship with someone and so, clear rd too for people to rise through you.One-handed no dey wash the hand fine but two-handed is just the best for better tidy. Na so life be.Charity begins at home and if you abandones your grassroot basically you are erasing your original footprints where u would have no trace about your social reality life We come world with nothing and we dey fo back with nothing na why them say the riches of the earth na vanity upon vanity so make we no decline from adhering to peoples potential existences.If them give one person all the treasures of the earth with no one to exis with him I believe it would be a living hell.So... Tend to show love and concern of your people cus if run pursue you from, outside, na them go be your shields s d defenders.Other hands... Na who knows you go kill you or plan evil against you so taking protective measures is a go because we know the wickednesses and the jealousies of our friends and families today.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMAlways seeing people's opinion as trash: every time your own naim be the Best. you dey always see your own as the best, if you no take time that your best go disappoint you. You go always like your own to be final in every aguement or sudjestion you dey do. One is entitled to him opinions but doesn't make sense seeing others as trash even if it is not a workable documents by you cos no be the way \"M\" na \"W\" at who stand opposite you meaning na still a workable alphabet.However, best work done easily, quicker and more professional is the one of team work because there are differs of opinions in a sane field.However, it is unwise trashing others opinions because we came knowing nothing so we live to learning from others so if we get to live by ignorance, we are definitely living in a blackout feeling we are at the best epic but na when results comes out your eyes go clear then you would have yourself to be blamed.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMAlways thinking say you classic. Always dey think say you dey classic pass every other person near you. Anything wey Dem wear na okirika na only your own be Gucci,Prada and givenchy. If you dey do this kind things your friends go dey hate or run away from you. and the funny part be say you no go even know wetting dey possue them.  The side effects of this be say you personally dey live blindedly competitive life by acquiring expensive wears and spending on liabilities whereas, there is no one competing with you.Such is living a fake life because you dey position yourself at where you no reach living a flamboyant life way dey give you heavy tasks before you fit acquire am just to creat public attentions while others are humbled.This is a draining lifestyle instead of a raining lifestyle to bring you productiveness.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMUnfinished projects/lack of focus: most of us don dey from year to year without plan. If them say Dem wan do something, na only mouth e they end. This one na lack of focus. Because if you dey focused you go try achieve at least one thing for your life.  Unfinishing project or unrealistic projects na one of the things way dey make one either spending unprofitably whereas... You lives by having in touch with whatever chances that you are attracted on and doesn't consider if it is Worth spending on or if having knowledgeable idea about it. You are just so eager to get on the and a half way it because a nightmare because you are either unplanned before indulging or you basically have a zero idea about it.The word...\"using one stone to kill two birds\" is usually a call of aftermath of plan \"A\" but some  person's had lived to have a stone to kill two birds from a plan \"A\" which definitely ends them having the stone untouched or having no birds on a right target and then they Invests all of its efforts woefully with no tangible accounts to give and no profits in returns.Quote from: Pi-network314159 on November 16, 2023, 07:55:46 PMCronic womanizing: if your love or lust for women dey very high e go affect you negatively because that one na na 1 serious problem wey ona no go even want me to talk about, but naim be that so try Chang if not hmm. Woman na central bank of no return oo.If any of this things I mentioned don master you e go hard for you succeed if you no stop am. Even say you no fit stop am at least try reduce am and you go get positive results. I don't understand why you think this one would be unacceptable to all here. However, I am taking this for pleasures so if pleasures are considered before your goals of productive earnings that is potentialed to buy you those pleasures, then there comes a time where there would be no earnings and no pleasures for you because it is said that money brings pleasures.Tend to life to prioritically chase money before chasing women and after catching up with the woman, do not lost the aids of keep chasing money because money is the magnetic intenses that attracts and archetecs them (women). Mindfully, they (women's) bring love and grooves but are certainly drainers so... Consciousness of taking selfcontrol should be admitted if one must attain to its goals.",

Sometimes they say your association has an effect on your personality. And again evil communication corrupts good manners. We just have to be careful when relating with people. Yes not everybody is easily influenced or pressured but still there's still this little effect that relationship with people has on us.    For negativities, it's wrong to get associated with these set of people, they'd only cause more harm. Even though some can be changed when they come in contact with positivity, some are just bent on being negative and rather they'd try to change the positivity. In some cases, the negatives may be our last resort and we just have to give in to being in a relationship with them but that doesn't give us the leisure of bending to their will. There ought to be difference in our dealings with them. If we can't change them, we should let them have their way. That's the least we'd be able to do and learn from their experience.",

This includes family, friends, and community people. By developing important connections, you may form a support network that can help you reject harmful influences and encourage good change. Strong relationships also contribute to a sense of belonging and identity, which may be an effective motivation for change.

You are totally correct, in this life living a truthful and upright life is the key to succeed no matter what life throws at us, we know living in this kind of country where things got worse everyday is not really easy, and meanwhile we can't please everyone because if you are doing what is right, some people will not agree to it while someone will agree, there is nothing you will do in this country that people will not talk about whether good or bad but it's left for us to choose doing good or bad, so for me I will say let's continue doing good because it yield our good results or will I say u will reap what u sow and it's very rewarding, so let's be positive about life.",
