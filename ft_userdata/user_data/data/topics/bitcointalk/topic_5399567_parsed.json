I’m impress how they have everything connected these days through social networks, in app chat windows and linking all those LN together. Any thoughts from experts how this works and is it worth trying?Definitely easy to play in app game but there should be vouch from someone experienced before we can risk our money. Interesting though.",

There are other more varied games that are more entertaining and even if the odds are always against you, you can access bigger jackpots (in exchange for winning less often).I imagine that people who play this game expect to get something out of it by using the martingale.",

Let me explain the problem.

There should be proper justification on how Game works, what is the algorithm behind this which is making sure it’s probably fair. There is no tech so far which run in app game on blockchain technology. Reverse is also not true. To make the platform you will have generate entire seed on the blockchain in real time.

      "body": "I've tested your bot. First suggestion: can you add a QR-code to the deposit feature? I use Telegram in a VM, and have a LN-wallet on Android.Depositing works. The game works. Withdrawing says \"Invoice is being paid.\", but it doesn't arrive. The balance hasn't changed. LN sometimes can't find a route instantly, so I waited a bit. Then I tried another wallet, and it arrived after a few seconds. I think my own wallet was to blame, I couldn't send a small amount myself when I tried either.Quote from: shasan on May 26, 2022, 11:22:44 PMYour house edge is enough good but I have a doubt about the gambling on telegram. Also, you are accepting only lightning network of bitcoin. I think you should increase the limitation by adding more coin and also by adding other network as well with lightning network. Also, please answer if it is possible what will happen if anyone deposit with mainnet of bitcoin.No need to add altcoins, Bitcoin LN is fine. For anyone who hasn't tried Bitcoin LN yet: try it! Get a wallet, add a small amount, and enjoy low fees. Many instant exchangers and more and more \"normal\" exchanges offer LN withdrawals.Quote from: seoincorporation on May 28, 2022, 03:38:21 AMAnd since the server provides both seeds, then the game is not provably fair because those seeds could be tested before the runs to warrant a looser seed for the long run.To make it a provably fair game, users should be able to change the client seed before the bet.So you're saying the server could get a seed designed to only give \"heads\" or \"tails\"? That's possible, but if the server tries to cheat that way, you can also use it at your advantage so that makes it a risky game to play.Quote from: kotajikikox on May 28, 2022, 06:48:05 AMwhy telegram as we have so many bad experiences on this platform .Dealing with untrusted people is what causes problems. Telegram itself isn't the problem, the platform works fine.",

Though the hash can be verified by the user there is a doubt about using this telegram bot, so that is why I also prefer to use it if there is a website not on Telegram. Nevertheless, LoyceMobile comment above was right, just try it and I will try it later, good to see many platform using LN right now is the answer of what we are looking for the fastest BTC transaction.",
