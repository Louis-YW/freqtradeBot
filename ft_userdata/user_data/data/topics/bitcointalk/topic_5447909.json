The US and Canada has super economies and high employment rates. People can afford to buy or use Bitcoin in these nations. Many bitcoin service providers operate in these nations because they have a wide range of adoption. These numbers are encouraging, hopefully, it will keep increasing as more people keep adopting bitcoin.",

Because about a month ago, a software defect was discovered in one of the largest servers for these devices in the United States, and it caused a large number of these devices to stop.Came here expecting someone to talk about this event. Not only did they stop working but General Bytes - the largest maker of bitcoin ATM's - claimed that at least 56 bitcoins were stolen before the patch was applied (around 15 hours after the attack started). The reach of the attack was also quite frightening:QuoteThis resulted in the following:- Ability to access the database.- Ability to read and decrypt API keys to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.- Send funds from hot wallets.- Download user names and their password hashes and turn off 2FA.- Ability to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.Quote from: hugeblack on April 07, 2023, 11:50:07 AMIn general, it is great to have an ATM like this, especially in airports and tourist areas, more than the traditional places visited by the local population, because it will enhance the decentralization of Bitcoin and the lack of the need for conversion to dollars.The last time that a friend of mine used a BATM he was asked to provide his taxpayer identification number and a phone number. I seem to remind that it was on a machine made by General Bytes but I suppose the information is requested by the cryptocurrency service that provides the bitcoin to the machine. Both information can be easily circumvented though as I don't believe they check if the taxpayer identification is valid and one can use a burner number...[1]https://www.generalbytes.com/en/news/general-bytes-statement-on-the-security-incident-that-occurred-on-march-18-2023",

The hack didn't cause General Bytes to shut down their operation completely, but they closed down cloud services, and their customers, or the companies that use their machines would now have to operate using their own server:QuoteGeneral Bytes notified readers that it would be closing its cloud service. From now on, the ATM provider will require its customers to access its ATMs via stand-alone servers.

The availability of digital coins has been expanding at a breakneck speed, thanks in large part to the Bitcoin ATMs.Count ATMs Radar's data shows that there were only 14,016 registered locations offering automated teller services on January 1st, but now, crypto teller services have spread to 76 countries and operated by 630 operators! The crypto industry's growth is an interesting subject.It's impressive to hear that the Bitcoin depot is expanding its network in your country and now has the largest network of 5,314 units, accounting for 18.9% of the total global units. The other top 9 crypto ATM operators are also worth noting and play a significant role in the industry.Overall, the significant increase in Bitcoin ATMs indicates the worldwide adoption of cryptocurrencies. This growth is undoubtedly exciting, and it's just the beginning! We can expect further advancements and expansions in the crypto industry in the future.",

The data comes from CoinATMRadar which makes it very simple to have a look at where the ATMs are. Out of 33817 ATMs, 31 thousand are in the USA (or perhaps the North America, including Canada, since the grouped numbers can sometimes be a bit inaccurate in this regard). In contrast, there seem to be less than 50 ATM on the whole continent of Africa, and around 1500 in Europe. The distribution is incredibly unequal to talk about Bitcoin ATMs as a global phenomenon. They are very much tied to the North America, just as they have been for many years now.",

This is a good sign as in the UK the number of BTC ATMs has decreased from around 200+ to around 90 ATMs and no Political leader is running these types of campaigns even.

But still, in April almost 30 plus atms were implemented by Bitacess, Genesis, and general bytes.",

      "body": "OP, thanks for starting up this thread.  I've always been interested in BTCATMs and have used a few of them (for very small amounts, as I'm always afraid of getting scammed somehow)--and I posted about the first time trying one almost three years ago.  But even though they seem to be in every gas station and convenience store in my area these days, I often wonder how many people actually use them, and I haven't seen any data on that.If I had to guess, I'd say most of them go unused because of the huge markup.  There aren't many folks so in need of crypto while out in public that they have to pay that markup with cash at a BTCATM; why would anybody use one when they could just buy bitcoin or one of the other altcoins those machines offer on an exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, or whatever?  It's not like those ATMs offer anonymity.Anyway, cool thread.",
