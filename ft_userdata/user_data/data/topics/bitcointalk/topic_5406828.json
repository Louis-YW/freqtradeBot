      "body": "As far as I know, there is no way to directly embed your website within Decentraland. I believe the current implementation discourages that from happening, so the only thing you can do is to only embed the link to your website. Anyway, I don't think people want to directly see a website on Metaverse, though.For embedding your website link, you can refer to their documentation: Outbound links #External links.",
