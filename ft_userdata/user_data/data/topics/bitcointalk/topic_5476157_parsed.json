  "content": "Imagine having to giving away your kids to be adopted, now think about donate your sperm away, which is more degenerate and immoral?We are failure if we failed to afford foods for the child, and having to give away kids to affluent family, it is very distasteful decision, because the kids would be grown in abusive environment, the mum-in-laws would give less attention to the adopted child, the dad-in-laws would be biased too, the adopted kids would be living in isolation, unable to assimilate with the new family, isolate with non-blood related brother and sister, non-blood related parent. So under all circumstance, the peer pressure forcing married couples to must living frugally, must take full responsibilities and obligation to provide to raise the kids to 18yo, no matter how much efforts and how much money, not knowingly they are benefiting the rich get richer while chasing the goal set up by boomers, go to school get married get kids get job and invest in well diversified portfolio.But what about this? Donate your gigachad sperm away to non-blood-related couples, are your parent gonna do the same to you and scold you for not taking full responsibility and raise your offspring? Or is it different because sperm is not yet a living creature, it is told that chicken egg is vegetarian food by some confused monks, they religiously tell the worshipper chicken egg is not living thing thus it is safe to eat for the monks. Btw sperm and egg is vegan food, it is not carnivorous, (teehee egg is made of plant cells it is vegan okey!) because the religion say so, you gotta accept it, and it is perfectly morally acceptable to give away your seed and taking zero responsibilities and obligations to the outcome of your donated genetic. DOUBLE STANDARD!",

I don’t agree with it but I can see why some people might do it. Donating sperm is totally different, it’s just a way for some people to make a little money. Also it is for a good reason because infertile couples are able to have children that way.",

      "body": "Donating sperm is completely wrong. Why? Because it is like having sex outside of marriage. It's like committing adultery to impregnate a married woman who is not your wife with your sperm. This totally places another crack in the organized scheme of life in general.Failing to support your children is subject to two major points:1. You voluntarily didn't do the support;2. The ability to support was taken away from you by circumstances (often government).The best way to live family-wise, is the way found in the first 5 Books of the Old Testament in the Bible... the Torah of the Tanakh.",

      "body": "I have never seen or head of a case where a parent gives out her own child for adoption when he or she is still alive. I have only heard of child trafficking and case where the child is giving out to work as a house help to take care of another person's children, doing dishes, cooking and so many house chores which some certain amount is agreed on and paid to the parent of the child where else the person promises to train the child in school all out her years of service to them. Adopting a child means, the child now answers your name and it is to be done legally. There are other things outside just providing food for a child, where else all this are not met the parents are forced with the option to give out the child for trafficking  and if caught the parents is severely punished by the government.",

Donate your gigachad sperm away to non-blood-related couplesThere are stories like this like for some folks that can't bear a child, they're asking people to do it for them. They buy these sperm/egg cells that they have and they choose to whom they want it from. Yeah, it's like a livelihood in some dark places of the world but I don't know if it's already vulgar because it seems to be when it's documented. They're just making it as if it's a donation but it's actually a sale. While the loader of the sperm/egg doesn't really care at all as long as it gets him/her money. While for the couple that struggles to have a baby is happy because they will have it. There are instances that it is the other woman that will carry the child through his womb and the sperm was loaded to her through an operation so, there's no intercourse that has happened and it is with consent.It's also another way for them to make money. I am confused with what's happening to this world but the point is that, one couple or family having problem specific on this and the other one is a problem solver.",

      "body": "In the middle ages you'd give your child away to serve under a lord and it was considered an honour and a privilege. Often when a lord had a child, he'd look for another child of similar age. That child would be taken from a peasant family and raised in the lord's family, to serve as a personal servant of their child. Kids would play together, but it would be the peasant child that would do all the work, like bring back arrows shot by the lord's kid, lead his horse and other such things. IMO adoption isn't bad as long as it opens more possibilities for the adopted child. I will not donate my sperm if you're asking about that, but I have nothing against people who do. I want my children to know if they have any other siblings.",

I hate to say this, it is a suicidal move to follow the same advices, you would work indefinitely with unclear retirement age, you would also work for minimum wage in a warehouse, pretty much set yourselves in a very unfavorable circumstance where getting divorce rape is inevitable! Also it would soon become the chicken or egg discussion again where there would be more and more concession made, more and more usual band-aid fix to the broken system. More and more mental gymnastics on all the trivial things, and finally come to one common solution, divorce rape or bite bullet like a real man, thank for playing the game. Quote from: Obim34 on November 09, 2023, 10:41:18 PM...never seen... parent gives out her own child...Well, you would not seen one because the babies have been aborted, pulling out piece by piece directly from the womb, it is bloody gore! However it would be more common to see new born babies getting thrown out alive on the park rather than getting adopted, not all guys are law-abidding and take responsibility after having fun!Quote...child trafficking...It is the most common phenomena, it happens every single day all through social media, nobody ain't got time for doing all the tedious task of weeding out every single one trafficker, there is also high profile politician involved in the scene.

Quote...loader of the sperm/egg doesn't really care... get him/her money... other woman that will carry the child through his womb...This is all very inhumane, unethical practices, but joke aside it has to eventually become part and parcel in life, there is no great reset, the life never goes back in time. The house never stop winning. The nature never changed.Quote...I am confused with what's happening to this...family having problem...Ahahahaha, we had ignore the menopause for too long, it eventually have to denote, just like a time bomb that explode and it is inevitable. I know economist keep yapping about time bomb bubble recession and all sort of threat, they are hinting just like woman keep hinting non stop for attentions. Confusing, yup, because it is the alternate (darkness) knowledge that we are unfamiliar with.Quote from: darkangel11 on November 09, 2023, 10:41:18 PM...middle ages... your child away to serve under a lord... honour and priviledge...Absolutely, it is definitely better off living in that castle than living on the street full of beggars, homeless, alcoholic, gambler, robbers. At least you could have clean house and cooked meal.Quote...peasant child that would do all the work,... lead his horse...Doesn't it sound like modern day concubine, escort, or servant, butler, immigrants, foregin talent. Don't get me wrong we might have to get treated a lot worse in modern day after the market pie getting so much smaller and smaller. While we laugh at concubines fight each other in the castle just to get chosen by the lord, try looking at the mirror and reflect on ourselves. Quote...I will not donate my sperm... to know if they have any other siblings...Very typical setup, folks thought siblings would treat each other better than strangers or friends, idk may be they are thinking just like priviledged society where preferential is given to closed siblings, not meritocracy, in every aspect of life such as education, job opportunity and even electing political candidates. For peasant like us, we have to survive under the fittest circumstances.",

There's nothing bad when it comes to donating sperm, I see it as a way of helping couples that can't give birth.",

And understand that if love is connected to material things, it will not be sustainable. Do you think that people live in harmony and help each other without any personal gain?So who do you think our ancestors are? The things you can find in realist theory cannot clearly explain the origin of humanity. And from a scientific perspective, I want to express what I know about life, it is not formed simply based on the combination of ovary and sperm, there is another factor that, according to The language of science (soul) determines whether an embryo can develop into a life, which is why artificial conception never achieves a high success rate.And when it comes to religion here, I think you don't fully know why they have a view on vegetarian food, including chicken eggs. There are some religions that accept it, but there are also religions that do not consider it vegetarian food. The main problem with religions that consider chicken eggs as vegetarian food is when that chicken egg has not been combined with a male chicken, as you can imagine. The main problem is that religions recognize the issue of the soul when talking about life, so there are many viewpoints that make people outside religions not understand and judge ignorantly. Similar to other foods like cow's milk, understand that these are all vegetarian products.",
