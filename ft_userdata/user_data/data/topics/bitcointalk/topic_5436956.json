This asset represents ownership and proof of authenticity of that particular NFT, and it can potentially have value based on factors such as scarcity, demand, and utility. In the case of The Greedy Machines, these NFTs are backed by real computing power, which can allow the holder to earn BTC through mining. Additionally, the power of each NFT can grow as new collections are issued, and holders can participate in game functions through their personal account on the \"Mining Farm\" page. What other earning opportunities do you know?",

Now they might start with AI based projects which will be more innovative and peeps will start thinking that if they invest from the beginning then they might be able to gain good returns in the future. All the attention will divert towards such things. Now I am not adding this comment regarding AI out of nowhere but it is from the fact that it’s the most searched stuff right now and NFT is already going out of trend soon.",

I have just asked google to provide me with some images of \"GMT's mining farm and unsurprisingly, there is no results or realistic images. I'd suggest people not to involve in any kind of that. Make sure to pay some time to DYOR before entering any project",

The description that you've just give isn't different from the other NFTs that has been launched in the market. All of them gives you ownership and authenticity that you own them and of course through buying it.Quote from: Velisunde on January 27, 2023, 04:26:07 AMIn the case of The Greedy Machines, these NFTs are backed by real computing power, which can allow the holder to earn BTC through mining. Additionally, the power of each NFT can grow as new collections are issued, and holders can participate in game functions through their personal account on the \"Mining Farm\" page. Seems like a cloud mining and is just using the sales of the NFT. So, for the devs it is one stone hitting two birds at the same time. I've seen projects that do have that feature and didn't managed to stay long.Quote from: Velisunde on January 27, 2023, 04:26:07 AMWhat other earning opportunities do you know?Mining(real), trading, holding, etc.",

I guess people really need to consider their safety investment because not all hyped will remain in the next years and it could be their worse nightmare if they bought some NFTs from huge prices but ended up losing their price in the future because of tight competition in the market nowadays.",

A real mining project which has a real mining farm and can prove it to their customers can't simply keep running the farm and pay all the costs while trying to cover their real business with a NFT project on the front, waiting for NFT collectors to pay for NFTs to gain mining powers; this sounds like an absolute joke to me honestly. The company would run bankrupt soon if they don't get enough buyers there onward.",

In this case it seems like an NFT gig connected to mining?  Might as well set up your own rig really instead just to be sure. There are probably a ton of people willing to offer their advice compared to using this NFT to \"mine\".

It was so much hyped that even south park had 2 part movie where they mocked it. Now it is not as hyped and it's pretty much boring.",
