I think it has it pros as well but the only problems are those flaws that exploited by scammers and resulting to scam and stolen funds. What is more important are those defi genius created some ways for us to have convenient ways for transfering. Theres always a flaw on a system its not like weve had a perfect place for something just trying out for few years.",

If you dont use blockchain and only invest in projects and hope for pump then yes ... in your perspective bridges are useless. But for person who needs to switch from 1 blockchain to another from time to time there is only 1 alternative which is a centralized exchange which is even bigger vulnerability.",

Why does many people still believe in CZ? I think they're just blindly trusting someone without thinking twice.",

There are utilities of blockchain bridges but technology and security must be developed and enhanced so that transactions through bridges will become safer considerably.Without bridges, you will have to sell one token on one blockchain and use money to buy it on another chain. It is uncomfortable for people but if taking into consideration about risk of exploitation via bridges, I would like to do this. Also bridges charge high fee, not cheap.QuoteAnd also Blockchain bridge makes things more centralized. And currently BNB 600 million dollars hack indicates that we should stay away from this. Only Bitcoin is decentralized from founder's disappearance to decentralized full nodes and mining farms. It can not be shut down by a single person or company.

However, the hack occurred due to the blockchain bridge. This worries us in the use of Blockchain bridges, or generally used to convert coins from different blockchains.",

But the main target is speed and avoiding heavy traffic. My thoughts? Well, it helped and I got thru without any problem with hacking or anything. Did they achieve the goal or was it successful? Yes, it is. Right now, every player of the game is using the new chain and we don't have any problems with our transactions. It is fast and cheap. There's a good and bad side to it, sadly there are those who took advantage of the low security it has.",

Blockchain bridge is here to provide an alternative for anyone, but it can be useful for those who really need it or like you who blatantly say it is useless. Simple if it's useless, then no one will force you to use it. Blockchain Bridges have helped those who are underpaid to fulfill some delivery requirements but all always have risks as these risks are beyond the control of Blockchain Bridge providers. They also strengthen the system, but that is by no means completely secure and you are free to use them for free. This requires maintenance costs.

It also only adds confusion to most crypto enthusiasts.And it even became a bridge to steal assets as far as I know.That's why it wasn't popular or enjoyed by the community here in the crypto world to be honest. And I've noticed that it's a bit less talked about in the cryptocurrency industry and it's even better.",

They make a great target because they hold billions of dollars in coins/tokens.
