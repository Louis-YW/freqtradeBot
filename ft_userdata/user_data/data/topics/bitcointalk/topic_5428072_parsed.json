  "content": "In the fallout of the FTX exchange, the importance of Bitcoin self-custody is more apparent than ever. However, self-custody comes with its own set of risks such as uninsured loss and theft.To this end, we've designed and developed BSPO (hosted at https://bipshuffle.com), a free and simple method of securing BIP39 seed phrases. This method is applicable to most hardware/software non-custodial wallets, such a Trezor, Ledger, Exodus, MetaMask, and many others.The overarching theme of this tool is that storing seed phrases in plain-text on a piece of paper is risky. You probably don’t feel comfortable storing a large portion of your cash savings at home, so why should you feel comfortable storing your Bitcoin savings in a single location?Existing solutions to this dilemma generally require seed phrases to be digitally entered, which is also risky. BSPO provides a method of encrypting a seed phrase through simple tabular look-ups, which can be accomplished completely offline.For more details, please see the whitepaper available at https://bipshuffle.com/whyusebspoThis is the first iteration of this tool. Please consider leaving feedback.",

But, it's on paper which is vulnerable to a lot of damage.Not a hit against what you are doing but IMO more secure seed storage is going to be better then a more complicated way to write a seed. -Dave",

Compromise of one back up is insufficient to steal your funds, but compromise of one of each back up will lead to your funds being stolen. This is identical to a seed phrase/passphrase combo (which should have two back ups of the seed phrase and two back ups of the passphrase), or a 2-of-2 multi-sig wallet (which should have two back ups of each cosigner).However, with your system, if an attacker finds your encrypted seed phrase or a decryption table, they will know they have found something to do with a seed phrase but will not be able to access any wallet at all (given an only 1 in 256 chance of randomly passing the checksum with a 24 word seed phrase), incentivizing them to either keep looking for your other back ups, or to just attack you directly.With a seed phrase/passphrase combo, if an attacker finds a copy of your seed phrase, they can access a base wallet which you can set up as a decoy, hiding the fact that you have a passphrased wallet at all. If they find a copy of your passphrase, you can easily deny it has anything to do with bitcoin at all (bonus points if you use that passphrase as a decryption key for some encrypted volume full of plausibly \"sensitive\" material).

However, I disagree with this analysis. Consider the seed/passphrase combo with two seed phrase backups and two passphrase backups. Let's call the seed phrases S1 and S2, and call the passphrases P1 and P2. Assuming you mean that the \"backups\" are replicas of eachother, if an attacker found S1, in order to compromise the underlying funds, they could also either find P1 OR P2. The same could be said regarding the discovery of S2. Alternatively in BSPO, let's refer to the encrypted seed phrases as E1 and E2 and call their corresponding decryption table D1 and D2. If an attacker finds E1, they MUST find D1 in order to compromise the funds (D2 provides no information).  The 2-of-2 multi-sig wallet is also a different arrangement, one that is essentially equivalent to applying a single round of BSPO (which the simplified statistical analysis provided in the whitepaper shows, is a poor way to secure a seed phrase).Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 13, 2022, 12:38:14 PMWith a seed phrase/passphrase combo, if an attacker finds a copy of your seed phrase, they can access a base wallet which you can set up as a decoy, hiding the fact that you have a passphrased wallet at all.

The problem is counting on users to choose secure phrases and come up with clever ways to secure their own funds. This problem is not as trivial as it might sound, choosing a cryptographically secure passphrase typically means that passphrase is not easily remembered and should be written down. Once the passphrase is written down, you're effectively creating a similar setup to what's mentioned above (2-of-2 multi-sig equivalent, or if replicated, S1, S2, P1, P2 scenario). What BSPO offers in comparison is the ability to derive multiple unique pairs of information where a full unique pair must be obtained to compromise the underlying asset (as opposed to being able to access funds from any two pieces of information of differing types). It's a subtle difference, but one that makes some difference in security. BSPO attempts to make the process of secure seed phrases relatively simple/fool-proof, but admittedly likely falls short in some ways - which is why this feedback is highly appreciated.

That's precisely what makes it advantageous. In both cases, four pieces of information exist in relation to a single wallet. In the former case the four pieces are seeds S1 and S2 and passwords P1 and P2. In the latter case the four pieces are encrypted seeds E1 and E2 and decryption tables D1 and D2. In the former case, finding (S1 and P1), (S1 and P2), (S2 and P1) or (S2 and P2) will result in compromised funds. In the latter case finding (E1 and D1) or (E2 and D2) results in compromised funds. More generally, without BSPO - as the number of backups of seeds/passphrases increases the higher the probability that an attacker finds these pieces of information and funds are compromised whereas with BSPO, though the chance of theft does increase, it's not as dramatic. Ultimately, which method is \"better\" depends on what you assume the relative prior probabilities of theft vs loss to be for each piece of information (following the basic statistical framework discussed in the whitepaper - and assuming the passphrase protected wallet uses a secure password.).Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 13, 2022, 07:58:20 PMQuote from: bipshuffle on December 13, 2022, 04:18:15 PMThe 2-of-2 multi-sig wallet is also a different arrangement, one that is essentially equivalent to applying a single round of BSPO (which the simplified statistical analysis provided in the whitepaper shows, is a poor way to secure a seed phrase).Hard disagree.

Apologies for the annoying captchas.

At very least, i think font size of BSPO full should match BSPO lite's. And google reCAPTCHA before downloading the PDF is mildly annoying.Noted. Thank you.",

However, it's worth noting that the difference is that as you increase the number of backups, you're potentially making yourself more vulnerable to theft. Yes, you're decreasing the likelihood you lose your seed phrase, but you're increasing the chance someone stumbles upon it (any phrase and any password). With BSPO, you increase redundancy with each pair of encrypted seed and table created, but the chance someone finds the specific pair is less than the chance of someone finding any pair of the former method.

Multi-sig wallets in particular are a solution I hadn't previously explored to much depth.",

      "body": "Yeah, true enough. I guess everyone has to figure out for themselves their own risk profile, and whether they want more back ups providing greater redundancy against loss, or fewer back ups providing greater protection against accidental discovery. My own feeling is that if your back up is in a position to be accidentally discovered, then you have chosen a poor back up location and should think again. Anyone finding a back up should be doing it as result of a targeted attack, rather than random chance.I would have some concerns with your system that someone would be tempted to store E1 and D2 in the same place since they are useless together, and E2 and D1 together for the same reason, to minimize the number of secure back up locations they need. But then if they lose just one back up location, such as due to a fire in their house, then they've lost everything.",

Assuming a risk profile can definitely be used to determine the best storage method, though it's very difficult to accurately quantify. The hypothetical framework outlined in the whitepaper is admittedly overly simplistic; though I feel it provides some useful insight into a modeling approach that could be taken to a greater depth.",
