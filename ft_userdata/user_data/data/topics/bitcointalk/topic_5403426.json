There's no fight between the dominance of these two. Bitcoin will always have the highest dominance then next is Ethereum.Quote from: Gayong88 on June 21, 2022, 04:51:28 AMWill a new king of the cryptocurrency market willcome?No. It has been asked for so many times for the past years and there will be no new king in the market. But bitcoin will remain as the king of the crypto market.",

There will be no new king of cryptocurrency. The competition in the market dominance was just a common thing and you shall not over reacted this thing. Bitcoin is bitcoin and ethereum was also remain ethereum. Both are different thing and just because the market dominance from both were going up and down and then you were taking a conclusion if there would be a fight between both.Moving to the POS didn't mean ethereum will be more successful than the current condition.",

Will a new king of the cryptocurrency market willcome?There was a time in which the dominance of ethereum came awfully close to the one of bitcoin and some people even predicted that bitcoin and ethereum will flip positions and ethereum will become the top coin in the market, and as you can see that never happen, and when we take into account ETH will eventually become a POS coin then the chances of that ever happening are as close to zero as they can be, so I am not optimistic about ethereum becoming the new king of this market.",

Will a new king of the cryptocurrency market willcome?I don't think that BTC and ETH will stay in the top 10 in 2023. There are so many better projects that have been released since Bitcoin was founded and the tech just hasn't been able to keep up with things like Hedera and Candle Chain. Newer chains remedy all of the problems older chains had, like slow transactions and high gas fees and they add more utility, like enterprise usecases.",

From the data it seems ETH valuation is already 1/4 of that BTC. Maybe someday ETH could overtake BTC thrones but then again the dominance of BTC could always increase so fast.",

Will a new king of the cryptocurrency market willcome?Thats unlikely to happened. Eth is good but bitcoin is the most decentralized among the cryptocurrency. Also it will take a lot of funds to surpass the btc marketcap. There are lots of speculation about the eth merge wouldnt damn solve a lot of issues. So I guess its likely impossible to replace btc on the throne. There are lots of L1 who have a lot of potential than eth so there ar eother choices by the community to use.",
