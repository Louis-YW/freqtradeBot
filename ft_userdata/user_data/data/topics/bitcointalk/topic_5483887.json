If you use centralized exchange to store it, that exchange can be hacked, your account can be hacked. If you use close source wallet to store bitcoin, developers can have backdoors to steal your coins.If you use non custodial, open source wallet to store your bitcoin, but if you have weak password, don't have backup, you can lose your coins.",

Have you every seen the news?Even the story you mentioned showed that btc was stolen, even when it was through an exploit.I mean what are the most common ways for stolen btc. Most I guess would be fake wallets for example. Like making a copy of an existing wallet, fake a homepage or an appstore site. Once somebody downloads it and deposits btc, it's gone.People can also get their phone, computers infected with any form of malware and where their seed phrase is just stored somewhere on the device it can easily be found and used to access the wallet and transfer the funds.I think most things that could happen can be prevented if you are careful. Only download wallets from original sources, keep your see phrase secure, keep your devices secure. If you follow these rules you should be good.",

This discussion was discussed already in the past.Here’s the explanation of @Blackhatcoiner on the probability of hacking someone’s private key.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on November 04, 2023, 02:48:41 PMThe odds of guessing someone's private key... Let me put it in this perspective. There are estimated to be 7.5 quintillion grains of sand in the Earth; that's 7.5 x 10^18. Now ignore the shape of our solar system, and make the hypothesis that there are a trillion clones of Earth, spinning around the Sun. That'd make the total grains of sand in our Solar system about 7.5 x 10^30. Stupidly large number there. Imagine if I told you to guess my chosen grain of sand, across this uncountable set of grains, and that I picked one at random, maybe at some corner of an ocean from Earth #623,546,123,002, or at a replica of Egypt from Earth #881,239,303,566. Guess what. The number of these grains are not even the 0.0000000000001% of the total valid Bitcoin private keys.",

      "body": "Your question is confusing, but still, the answer you are looking for depends totally on the kind of stealing you mean.If you are talking about hackers hacking the bitcoin blockchain and stealing bitcoin from there, then I would say it's impossible, for if it was, it would have happened a long time ago, for I believe that hackers have with all efforts tried to hack the bitcoin network, but they have never succeeded.On the other hand, if the stealing you mean is like, hackers or scammers getting into a user's wallet and stealing his or her bitcoin, then \"yes\" is the answer to your question, if you loose your guide and expose your bitcoin wallet seed phrase or private keys to anyone else aside from your self, the person who finds SP or PK may likely use it to get into your wallet and move your bitcoin to their own address.Or if you have your bitcoin on any centralized platform like exchange or casino (this is highly discouraged), and you allow scammers or hackers to gain access into your exchange account, then they are likely to steal your bitcoin by withdrawing it to their private wallet.So if you don't want your bitcoins stolen, keep your private keys and seed phrases private to yourself, and keep the login details to all your accounts private as well..",

And I also want to say that Bitcoin is not safe from hackers in all public hands. Because there are many people who are connected with bitcoin holding or bitcoin trading but they don't browse safely while browsing, their bitcoin is definitely not safe from hackers. Because currently there are reports of huge amounts of bitcoin stealing through phishing attacks like clipboard hacking etc.I have lost funds from myself due to phishing attacks. So in real life, just like our physical and virtual fiat currencies can be stolen, cryptocurrency or Bitcoin can definitely be stolen if we do not follow enough security. I would like to mention a proverb here, 'not your keys, not your coin' or wallet, whatever you say. And if the private of your wallet somehow goes to someone else, then the second person will be also the owner of that wallet same like as you.",

For example, if you put your assets or bitcoin in a scam wallet or if the security of the application is compromised and hackers or people with malicious intent could get all your assets, they can be stolen physically. I remember seeing a topic about him being afraid of his boldings, and because of the people around him, he is afraid that they might do something to him just to get his asset or bitcoin. Well, it can happen. Like I said, there are many reasons for a bitcoin or cryptocurrency to be stolen, but those things will happen if the owner or investor is not careful about what they are doing. You know that anything that is connected to the internet is not safe, so it's up to you to make sure your assets are safe.",
