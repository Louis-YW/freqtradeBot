  "content": "As we all know the transaction fee continues to get high as the mempool remains congested for almost a month now due to reoccurring ORDI tokens on the bitcoin blockchain. This has left some people a bit furious and some newbies making costly mistakes of setting high transaction fees. A transaction that was in block 818087 had actually paid a whopping sum of 83 bitcoins as the transaction fee. I would say this is a costly mistake but for someone having that huge amount of bitcoin in their possession I don’t get it. The transaction was first broadcasted with a fee of 70 bitcoins and then later was replaced with that of 83 bitcoin as fees. My guess is the sender was probably trying to set is fee as 70 and 83Sats/vbyte and then mistakenly set out that high fee. The block was mined by Antpool, hopefully they would treat it as mistake and return the funds. 1. TXID for the 83 bitcoin fee: b5a2af5845a8d3796308ff9840e567b14cf6bb158ff26c999e6f9a1f5448f9aa2.

Wow I’m moved and this is actually one reason never to give up and to continue hustling because I can’t even imagine how much will be left in his holdings and there might also be possibilities that the error wasn’t noticed immediately but nevertheless I think this mistake was really expensive and I hope this is treated like a mistake and the money be refunded.",

Please contact us for a refund!This is a unique take that I had not thought of, though I think that's a pretty lame and ineffective FUD attempt. Surely people wouldn't shy away from Bitcoin because of someone elses obvious mistake? It doesn't really say much about bitcoin but more about the sender. Overall, it's a very interesting mistake and the likelihood of it is generally is quite low....it's hard to believe that a wealthy individual holding such large value in Bitcoin could be so ignorant or careless as to not see/incorrectly set the fee amount as a mistake. I feel like there is a reason or purpose for this that only the sender could know.Quote from: EL MOHA on November 23, 2023, 10:23:43 AMMy guess is the sender was probably trying to set is fee as 70 and 83Sats/vbyte and then mistakenly set out that high fee.

Also the most shady thing on this news was the fee is originally set high with 70BTC which is too high not to be notice. Also this kind of huge fee surely be immediately included in the block since it’s above average.Is it possible that this kind of transaction was use by the miner to set the mining fee high for the average?
