      "body": "Hello! Just an advice though. I think that this is the best time for us to learn more about bitcoin. We have to educate ourselves on how it works, how to be secure when using it etc.You said \"I was directed here and have learnt alot and i will no longer call it a hasty decision if i were to get my own btc in my own wallets but i haven't gathered enough finance to do that\". That is totally reasonable and I understand the financial factor.However, you must understand some basic info about wallets. There are many types and subtypes of wallets, but if you wanted to classify them regarding the key management we could say that there are:custodial wallets: you don't own the keys to your bitcoin. e.g Binance, Coinbase etcnon-custodial wallets: you own the keys for your wallet, most often in a form of 12/24 words.Now, the second category is the one that people here have directed you to go to. But, you misunderstand something here. Getting a non-custodial wallet doesn't mean you have to pay for it. Non-custodial wallets can be split up in two categories:Software wallets (hot wallets) : the keys live in a device that is connected to the internet. Hardware wallets (cold wallets): the keys live in devices that don't connect to the internet. So, going for a non-custodial hot wallet could be a very good option to start without spending money. If you decide to get there, a good wallet to use would be Blue Wallet (easier for beginners) or Samourai Wallet (good for customisation etc). There is a great variety of hot wallets to choose from. Note: I am suggesting those wallets to be used as on-chain bitcoin wallets and not as lightning wallets.Ultimately, you will want to choose a hardware wallet, but until then, my suggestion is: get the coins off of the exchanges!",

      "body": "There are many expectations for bitcoin this year after we had a bearish year in 2022. I also just checked bitcoin price and bitcoin is above $17.4k, which could be a positive sign for this January bull run. But be careful, as this is not a real uptrend yet, I am pretty confident that this is just a short term bull run, and bitcoin will have corrections any time. But anyway, let's hope that this bull run will be able to last as long as possible after bitcoin's string of net bearish days. This is still a good time to invest, but please be careful, don't get too excited when bitcoin increases in price, and assume that the uptrend has arrived.",

Selling them to buy bitcoin is a wise investment as they are no longer in use. They can serve for conversion to cash then as cash you  use it to purchase bitcoin online via p2p or through your bank as the case maybe in regards to your country regulations regarding bitcoin. As you have said, there's no difference from the truth as it is eleven (11) days already and bitcoin is doing just fine. This calls for reflection on the last year experience on bitcoin and how one was able to manage the situation of the bear market. Most investors bought at high price without them knowing or having idea the bear market would last this long. Although the current market situation now is good I must say but one can not tell the next direction of the market.If you can, hodle till you see a big good better and significant amount of profit but DYOR first. Like you have said about removing Coin and funds from exchange, that is a good idea as nobody knows who is the next to experience any funny situation hence the phrase \" not your keys, not your coin\" which I prefer more to keeping my assets with a third party.",

In short, the current positive signals still make people full of patience for the bear market. I know who said a word, a positive person is like the sun, who will illuminate the haze.

I was thinking for him to help me purchase the BTC when I have the funds but I think learning the whole process here will be better. Just to be on a safe side so your advice is noted when the time comes for me to buy I will definitely make more enquiries on it.",

All it takes is more bad news for the economy to send Bitcoin and the market as a whole further down. The only time confidence can increase, is further toward or after the halving. Which is still some time away. Stack your sats in 2023, and reap the rewards in 2024!",

Sure, there's a bit of positive movement, but for now it's just tiny fluctuations, not worthy of serious considerations. Bitcoin can still go down or stay at a current 1/4 of the maximum price. 2023 might be a good year, but a year is a long time, and what if it gets better closer to its end? It's important to keep calm and be patient, prepared for a continuation of the bear market. In that case, you'll be mentally prepared for bad times but pleasantly surprised if it's suddenly over.",

Besides it will be very hard for governent to fully backed crypto for there people due to the high risk involved of crypto due to it volatility.
