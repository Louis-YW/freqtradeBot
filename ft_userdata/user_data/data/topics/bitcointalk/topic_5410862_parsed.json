Is guess if you use notify, receive emails but don't click on them and just find the topic then you might end up with them just being sent to your spam folder (or equivelant).My notifications weren't working for a few hours yesterday but I think that was just me having bad signal and my email provider not downloading them when I had good signal.",

That has always been the case with my previous email and the current one. It depends on the service and how they weight spam. Are they just using a few blacklists or are they running SpamAssassin and Cyren and Message Sniffer while using the reputation of other IPs in the subnet? Do they run enough tests to say, 1 to 4 fails it's delivered 5 to 10 it's put into spam and 11+ it's blackholed. Since you are getting SOME I can see them running some word / pattern matching and if it fails it's either bounced or dumped.I would ping out to theymos to see if he can get you the SMTP logs from the delivery server, if it shows as being delivered to your provider then you can reach out to their support, if not then theymos / staff have to fix the problem anyway. We can talk about it here but we can't really fix it....-Dave",

You should receive an email whenever a reply posts on the specific thread. If OP locks and unlocks the thread, you will also get notified. Two days ago, I was checking Hodlonaut Trial thread but didn't understand what people were talking about. I didn't have spare time to read the reference provided on the OP, So I tried the Watch button. Later, I started getting emails whenever people replied on that topic.

I created a \"fresh\" one just to be sure that no spam will pollute the notifications and add just another security tier, random generated password stored in the password manager. So you want to receive only emails? Telegram notifications are very quick in response and you can watch/unwatch a thread very easy, ( thank you @TryNinga) and telegram working in background do take some battery life but for me it's worth it.I love Seiko too  love watches in general, don't like the smart ones, they are useful but no charm like the ticking sound of the movement of the REAL watch. But the way of living is pushing me to have a smart one that's why I only have a smartband.",

But when I received the notification in the email, they normally warn me that if I did not view the link I would not receive notification from BTT again so for that I always view the comments from the notification link. That is the only notification that I am seeing. I did that thing when I was still a member rank. And now I have even forgotten the steps I used in setting the notification to my email. So I even need the steps again to do others.Therefore, probably you are not receiving notifications because  you are not following the instructions of the email. Because if you follow the instructions of the email I definitely believe that you must have receiving the notification in your email from all the threads you registered.  So you can reset your notification or you can view the link from the email sent to you.",
