Are you saying that he set up his wallet at home, left the phrase on his table and another family member found it, knew what it was and used it to steal his money?Is 1k a lot of money to your friend, because the story suggests it isn't. I find $1k to e a decent amount of money, enough to buy a computer or 2 sets of tires for your car (summer and winter), or a pistol, if you're into guns... I wouldn't invest 1k in something that I don't understand.Your friend's problem is not lack of security but negligence and carelessness. You don't need proper security to put your seed phrase in a \"safe\" place, like inside a book, or an encrypted file on your computer. In my early days when my bitcoin wasn't worth a lot of money I used to keep my private keys in renamed txt files hidden somewhere on my computer. I'd take a normal text file, change the extension into something like \"infinity.dll\" and hide it somewhere. That's not proper security, but still many times better than some people, who store these on gmail accounts, cloud servers, or password managers.",

If it is then the physical seed phrase that was used to get access to the wallet then I wouldn’t call your friend’s case a case of lack of knowledge but carelessness because when creating a wallet every wallet even trustwallet will tell you the importance of seed phrase and that you shouldn’t let anyone have access to it.",

Did your friend really not know about the importance of seed phrase? If not, why would he write it on the paper? Anyway, if there is such indifference, then this kind of situation has to be faced again and again.Moreover, I would like to say another thing that only seed phrases or private key protection does not mean that you have been able to fully protect your fund. Because there is another issue here is that your wallet gets hacked, many times new users keep their funds on the device they browse unsafely, in this case, they are victims of phishing. So, to fully secure your fund, you have to turn off unrestrained browsing. Moreover, it is always better to use cold wallet for holding. You can visit this topic if you want, And later you can suggest your friend.",

This happens as a result of his carelessness. If not, how can you buy bitcoin worth two thousand dollars and keep your seed phase careless? So I will like to recommend and add to your post to say that instead of encouraging a beginner in bitcoin to know more about the security of his wallet and his private key, he will also not be too lazy to learn and perform educational research, and most importantly, he shouldn’t be as careless as your friend who misplaced his private key intentionally.",

The most funny thing is that he don't know anything about seed phrase but he wrote it down and kept it on the table why did he keep it on the table and how does he know that the seed phrase needs to be written down since he has no idea what it is about. I think op needs to come up with something reasonable because I believe technology is everywhere now even a layman will understand the importance of seed phrase before getting a wallet.",

I mean someone writes something, even if it is not a private key, then drop it like that?In any case I would agree that definitely security is very important. Some of us really learn it the hard way like your friend as our wallets could have been hack because we might have backup our mnemonic phrase and private key in the cloud and online. One thing though is how your friends go and invest with that huge amount of money without learning what Bitcoin is?Seems to me that there are more questions here.",

For a BTC or cryptocurrency investor who has some funds in a wallet or intends to acquire some, using good wallets mostly offline wallets with key phrases, should be safely  kept secure from prying eyes and criminals. Without a secure wallet or secure asset location, there won't be a need to want to keep up with an investment plan or even portfolio, because why bother when hackers or anyone close could easily have access and make away with the funds?",
