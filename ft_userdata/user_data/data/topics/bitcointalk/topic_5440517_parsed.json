  "content": "few months ago, yahoo62278  beg like homeless for donations with words to solicit empathy, such as: I need money for a heart transplant; my mom died when I was 17, i hope I can survive He used words from a text book. It is a. textbook.archieveYahoo never provided:- Evidence of treatment when people ask him.- Evidence of food delivery. Some fake user/alt of yahoo vouch that he talked with  yahoo in 2021, and he talked about the heart thing. This user is a piece of shit like yahoo  if is not yahoo himself.  examplensI notice pattren that whenever Yahoo need help/someone say bad things on yahoo this user always defend him right away.But this user made me feel guilty that if there is a 1% chance yahoo is a true member, I ruined his donation thread by reporting it. I felt bad for yahoo for a couple of days  and I was in bad state about all of it. So I donated yahoo 230$ here.here is proof of my transactionshttps://imgur.com/a/JQLjjk6https://imgur.com/a/TlHvBpeYahoo didn't say a word back to me after the donation. No thanks, not anything. He just took the money like a pig.If he had the honor and a bit of respect, he would say: I don't need your money. fuck your money.  after all the trash talk you talk  about mebut he just took it like the pig he is and withdrew it to his bank.Today I came to my senses and told yahoo is a dishonest member like I have been thinking all along. after viewing his posts history and noticed the same pattern when some people open a bad thread on  on yahoo. The same user  examplens responds to defend him right away.It is just alts/organized users who support each other with no truth or morals.And is not just him but mostly him. I told yahoo straight up today I don't believe your donation thread give  me a refund or provide proof.And yahoo is blackmailing me and insulting me to stop. He will cause me to be banned. https://imgur.com/a/eirTyuvI am happy that his donation thread was closed by me. But seriously, he blackmails me now? I would love to see this fucker account closed too.Note: I don't give a fug about refund regarding money. I have plenty of money.I give a fug about lying and deceiving, and this user is deceiving. I am sure about it 100% And I will never doubt myself again about him. The dude is a fraud.By the way some of alts of yahoo who are about to comment : examplens , NeuroticFish, Rikafip ,",

Even though someone have post an images if the money is used for good thing, there's a chance he doesn't use it all and took some part of the money without anyone know. After all, you need to trust the person you donated, in this case I trust Yahoo and he doesn't obliged to give any proof to anyone if he have a reason about it e.g. privacy concern.",

Why I donated him? For god and for myself. If there is 1% chance that thread donation closed and his heart problem  me is worth donating him so he will  not die. And it will be on my concious.  But I understand later that is madeup in 100%.With yahoo guy i will never make a mistake again my opinion about him is set in stone.  right now. When I opened META post  I see mods who post non bias comments.None of the mods support him. Is it strange that he is supported only by DT members? Maybe there is  curruption here?The users who comments are usually friends/alts bunch baboons. And to be fair  even if he had  heart problem (and he is not. he is lie ) I dont care at all. I am nasty now. I come to understanding that you should never   give empathy for someone based on his  serious medical condition. If he his piece of shit  to you and and has stage 4 cancer he should be treated like a piece of shit. The things is that yahoo62278 not only piece of shit he is a scammer/sociopath/narcissist and try to make money from fake donation. He knows that he is reputable here and helped  reputable members like Stake and Bitsler in the past  and wait to get 1 million dollar from them.What a better way to do it than to post thread that you need heart transplant.The guy is smart and knows what he is doing. He post the surgery that costs the most out of 50 surgeries. He could choose other surgeries like he blind in one eye and need 3k. But he choose the most expensive surgery out of them all the heart transplant (1.000.000$)",

And non of the mods support him. Is it an accident?The reason for this thread is not to get anything.  I am not signature campaign user, Dont get money from this forum.
