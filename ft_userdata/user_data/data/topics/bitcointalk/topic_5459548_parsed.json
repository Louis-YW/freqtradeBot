Miners can include up to 4 million weight units or 1 vMB of data in a block and they are free to choose any of the (valid) transactions they want from their mempool. They usually prioritize transactions based on their fee rate to maximize their profit.",

I was also expecting something new and unique as the OP said in title, \"Facts\". Well, after reading his post i can say one thing for sure, he is just visual or Kinesthetic learner. Because he just learnt the art of mining and understood the basic functioning of mining like how the whole thing happens. He obviously did not read about the basic architecture of Blockchain and of a single block. And to prepare what he learnt he just made a post here. Which is not bad. But also not very useful and i thought the links provided by the first commenter will be useful but they were only related to BTC only and i found nothing special and unique Facts about BTC which would contribute more. But still if OP find them useful then i should ignore that reply. (No offense).",

I think you should try to do more research about Bitcoin mining terminology and fact or better still about Bitcoin in general.I think you still a newbie and you haven't yet understood the terminology yourself, I think you should take a break from lecturing and first start to build up your own knowledge and after that you can definitely do this sort of post but you would be doing it kore effectively.",

I hope that will use it because it is very helpful to use that feature when you post and you want to highlight a word or sentence in your post to make it clear. I think it's okay if OP didn't even use it as long as the post isn't hard to understand. I am interested to read the thread after reading the title but to my dismay, I didn't even see terminology in op. I say, this is clearly a clickbait even though the content isn't spam.",
