Traffic on our sites mainly are from the following markets; USA, China, Singapore, Estonia, Vietnam, Dubai, Nigeria and Kenya.this sounds fantastic but how much is really realistic? can you share the statistics here, at least part of them? for example in August 2022? whether it is organic or paid traffic?I'm suspicious because the content on your site is quite outdated. the latest I've seen is from May 2022 and most of the others are from the 2018-2021 period. for such a topic, news that is a few years old is quite irrelevant.",

It was an error on the project side who went on to copy and paste content sourced from another party even without referencing the source. If I was being unscrupulous as you wish to allude I can open a new account and post such ads but that's not something I am willing to do.",

Who wants to pay for something that won't always be online?Hahaha! That's hilarious!OP, you're trying to rent banner space on your site and can't even afford cheap cPanel hosting for it? I know you're trying to make a big impression, but this makes it seem like you're cutting corners at every turn. You're probably using some kind of cheap shared hosting. If you want to make money from your website, then the hosting should be a priority. You can't expect people to view your site if it is offline most of the time or slow to load. It's not exactly going to make people want to do business with you.",
