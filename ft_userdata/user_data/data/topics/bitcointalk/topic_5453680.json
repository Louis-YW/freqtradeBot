There is none that I have heard of. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on May 22, 2023, 03:33:49 PMIt would dump the market of course.

I doubt it. What if the person send bitcoin from a noncustodial wallet to another noncustodial wallet? If traced to an exchange is when it might lead to bear market. Quote from: Doan9269 on May 22, 2023, 03:45:09 PMThe bitcoin market will turn centralized which is not possible, there will be manipulations by the giant whales in determining the bitcoin price.It can not centralise the bitcoin market, it will only cause price drop if the person send to different exchanges and exchange the coin to fiat. But the market will survive this. We should know that this is just not what can happen in reality, no wallet holds such huge amount of coins.  Binance which is an exchange that has highest bitcoin deposit in a cold wallet address which is not even for them but for Binance users, has 252597 BTC on the cold wallet address.",

I would make a little scare but that's just temporal and it will be back again to the usual.That's how these huge transfers are making a noise whenver they've been broadcasted by the media as if it's the one that moves the market. Maybe but the least and that's what I think what will happen but it won't be that much.I know this is just like an \"IF\" situation and matter but who's gonna have that huge transaction aside from satoshi?",

In coinbase you can transfer 1,000 dollar with $10 , with P2P maybe you do less fees. If you are ready to allow miners feeding fat from the amount you will see fast transaction, lines will collapse for you and ants will lick your sugar",

I believe it doesn’t change anything about how centralized Bitcoin is either.. after all, for what we know maybe today there already is somebody owning a million BTC but in different wallets.",

Also not convinced there is anyone (apart from Satoshi who wouldn't do that) who has that many Bitcoins. At most Binance have around 400K across a few different cold storage wallets. But unless they went into liquidation then this wouldn't hit the market anytime soon. I otherwise just checked and the largest ever transaction appears to be 161.5K Bitcoin ($1.1 billion at time of transfer), although this may well be by dollar amount as opposed to Bitcoin domination.",

If the network cannot process this amount of data efficiently, it can lead to delays in transaction processing and longer confirmation times.The data associated with a transaction is unrelated to the amount being transacted. A transaction of $100 worth of BTC can have a higher transaction size than one of $1,000,000 worth of BTC.What determines the size of a transaction are the inputs primarily and also the outputs along with the type of wallets used.Quote from: MIner1448 on May 22, 2023, 08:41:58 PM2.Such a large transaction can take up a significant amount of block space. If the block size is limited (as it is now in the case of bitcoin), the transaction may not fit in one block. In this case, the sender may be forced to charge a higher fee in order to attract the attention of miners and ensure faster processing.Again, the amount does not determine the transaction size.Quote from: MIner1448 on May 22, 2023, 08:41:58 PM3.Typically, the time it takes to confirm a transaction on the bitcoin network depends on the number of confirmations the transaction receives from miners.The time it takes to confirm a transaction is the time it takes for the block it is in to be added to the blockchain and it is averagely 10 minutes per block. The size of transactions in a block does not affect the block being added to the chain.- Jay -",

There is none that I have heard of. Eventually the biggest stake holder of bitcoin ever is Satoshi who is owning about 1 Million bitcoins but its not in a single address if I am not wrong and also I don't think he will ever come and use those bitcoins cause he vanished from being existence for over a decade.So for now anyone apart from Satoshi can do such transaction and 1 million bitcoin can't be spent in 1 transaction technically cause one block will not be enough to hold that much weight so that's the effect we can see on the network.But talking about price then surely it will shake the market and create FUD and that's it because its not going to make any long term effects.",

      "body": "The circulating supply is 19 million coins, and some coins are likely to be lost, so let's say 1 million is 7% of the total. It's a huge transaction, for sure, and a transfer like that would make the news and cause a lot of speculation. But if it's literally just sending BTC from one wallet to another (which doesn't have to mean that someone's selling the coins at all), then I only imagine it would congest the network, maybe cause a spike in transaction fees (ChatGPT says this assumption makes sense because a larger transaction occupies more block space, but I see some in the thread have a different opinion). In any case, there's no reason for the price to go down in this situation because the movement of coins doesn't mean they're being sold. I think the impact on the price depends on the details and how the news is framed. If it's framed as some old legendary address suddenly getting alive, people can get excited rather than feel panic over it, but if it's framed as a huge dump of coins by a whale, then it can lead to panic.",

Fee rate is chosen by the sender or receiver if you need to use Child-Pay-For-Parent. Transaction size depends on inputs and outputs, and type of transaction (address type too). Transaction size does not depend on how many bitcoin is sent in that transaction.One problem is if you have 1 million bitcoins, you don't care about transaction fee and can use very high fee rate to troll others. However, if you only do it with one transaction, it won't create issue in mempool because your transaction will be only one of many other transaction in one Bitcoin block. It won't create any problem in long term.Transaction fee on Bitcoin blockchain won't be charged like bank transfer like if you make a bigger transaction in value, you will be charged more bank transfer fee.",
