  "content": "QuoteZenith Bank has written a two-page letter to one of its customers who watched over N4 million vanish from her account in 20minutes. The tier-one bank insisted that there was little they could do and offered to help her recover a small percentage if she obtained a court judgment. The missing money went viral on Tuesday, 13 January 2023 with the victim captured in a video crying at the banking hall.The Nigerian banking sector is awash with stories of similar incidents with many unresolved. As at December 2021, Punch reports that only four top banks recorded a total of 477,405 unresolved customer complaints and most are related to fraud. The banks are Zenith, Guaranty Trust Bank, United Bank for Africa, and Access Bank. The reports also revealed that the number of unresolved complaints carried forward by the banks in 2021 grew by 172,399 from 305,791 recorded in December 2020. For Zenith bank, a total of 166,314 complaints remained unresolved as of December 2021. This figure is almost double the amount recorded in 2021 (83,899).https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/money/1514076-court-zenith-replies-customer-cried-missing-n4m-account-pages-letter/ The banking sector is failing us, more than we know it. You go to any bank on a Monday, you will see a long queue of people with complaints at the customer care section. Everyone here has had one problem with bank transactions regardless of what bank you use. It’s sad to know that there is no reliable bank, crypto is the safest solution to this problem. You don’t have to buy bitcoin, you can use the money to buy stable coins and hodl them in a non custodial wallet. It’s like a fixed deposit account only better because you’re the only one that controls it. And you keep the rest of your money that will be used for daily expenses and business expenditures. Imo storing all your money in the bank is a bad idea. What happened to this lady could happen to you.",

Whenever, I want to withdraw at an ATM or a POS I was say a silent prayer never to have a debit alert after a transaction declined notification or any other issue. Nigerian Banks have given me PTSD. So many persons have lost money to them and truth is, this is not a matter of having your funds in crypto. Other countries where these sorts of issues are resolved without stress didn't fall from the sky. I know we will get it right. But before we do, have more than one plan financial plan so that you don't trend on Social Media.",

And most time the bank manager or others in the bank are involved in that particular act. The dramas displayed in the bank is getting out of hand. This internet scam issue is cased by Nigerian bank system because if someone scam another fellow, the scammed should complete to the scammed account and immediat action should be taken.

These days I see those bank attendants incompetent of their jobs, when complain is laid,they can't resolve it immediately, they will make you get paranoid and even deprive you access to your funds in their custody. Banking system in Nigeria is becoming worst and nothing is done about it. Digital currency na e sure pass fiat o with the way bank dey go,I see them as failures in the next twenty years from now.

You go to any bank on a Monday, you will see a long queue of people with complaints at the customer care section.More of this type of incident will occur frequently in the future unless banks improve their security. The day I thought of this incident that is happening in the bank, I came up with a suggestion: banks should set up a facial recognition, SMS, and email verification system that customers must pass before spending a certain amount. a security measure to further verify the identity of the account holder before spending large amounts. Let's not be surprised that one day the press will release a report telling us that most of these bank fraudulent activities are being pioneered by some bank staff; that's just the risk of trusting our money with third parties. And the worst part of this is that after losing money in your bank account, if you visit the bank, they tell you to start some legal proceedings that will even require you to pay some money, while your money has just been stolen under their custody.Quote from: Igebotz on January 17, 2023, 09:36:33 PMif you give out your sensitive information to scammers, the banks cannot help much, but if it is due to bank-related system errors, you will always get your money back;  From what Igebotz said here, he's correct, but you can imagine how long it will take to get that money back with the long delays in the banking system these days. What if it's not that individual's money? What if the money was for a contract job? The thing is, all this is no longer funny; let the bank look for a proper solution. They can as well enable a security that allows people to freeze their money so that only the individual will be able to unfreeze it through some security means when ever they wish to spend some cash.Quote from: Merit.s on January 16, 2023, 09:25:04 PMsnipMahn, it's not only Nigerian banks; NAB also have some reports concerning fraudulent issues. Banks will not fail in 20 years like you said because you will still need them to spend your local currency, and digital money is not yet accepted by the mass..There is also no 100% security in holding your money in Bitcoin because you could also get hacked or lose your password or mistakenly release your phrase to a wrong hand.",

If a person cannot safeguard his 4-digit bank pin from fraudsters, how can he safeguard his 12-digit seed phrase? An individual who is negligent with their sensitive information runs a significant danger of losing assets. And by the way, if you want to hold something for a very long time, you should go with bitcoin, it has high volatility but is the best option for long-term hodl. If you must hold a stablecoin, make sure it's a decentralized one that's pegged to the real value of the dollar. Even though USDT is excellent, I won't suggest it.",

Na the truth be that. Some coins no really dey distinct in the sense of fiat. You know, the truth be say, out fiat na central bank issued or mint and backed by them. When it comes to some coins, those once way dey centralised and depend largely on the investors dey operate 9n the same base being that, this person get some kind influence on the coin and even at that, most of this stablecoines paged with dollar no get actual dollar for bank on each of there coins. You directly face almost the same risk!I dey like tell myself say, money no fit actually lose for online so, if the banks wish to check or track this frauds, them fit but them  no go like do am.
