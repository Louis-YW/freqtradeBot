      "body": "There should be a good reason you want to generate a bitcoin address that starts from 1, they are legacy addresses, you can follow what nc50lc posted about it, about how to use Electrum desktop wallet to generate it, but you can not use console on mobile device, instead you can use mycelium wallet that Edwardard suggested. But if no good reason to use legacy address, know that you can save up to 42% fee while making transaction with segwit if compared with legacy.You can even generate it with iancoleman html, https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases/latest/, using BIP44 derivational path and import it on wallets like Electrum or Bluewallet and select legacy which is also P2PKH when the derivational path is listed for you to click on one. But going for Electrum console or making use of mycelium wallet directly would be advisable and easier for people that do not have much technical knowledge about it.",

P2PKH - starts with the number \"1\"2. P2SH - starts with the number \"3\"3. BECH32 - starts with \"bc1\"All this three different types of addresses are also controlled by one private key..And I also think there's also a bitcoin blockchain explorer that has that feature which can show the user other types of bitcoin address that is associated or shares the same private keys with the address they are at its transaction log at that time, took notice of this one time i was exploring a transaction on the bitcoin explorer, but didn't take note of which explorer in particular.",
