Lol.Ninjastic.space explais it allEdit: merited for the laughoutSandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞Great idea bud, but on the other hand, dont you think users will start using reactions instead of smerit to appreciate or show how they feel about posts, which also could stagnate the growth of a lot of users, most especially , those who are not all that capable of creating really really quality posts?Anyways, still a great idea, and thanks for the merit by the way, I wasn't expecting that ¬†, happy you find the post amusing ¬†.EDIT, i dont think there is anything important to discuss here anymore, so i am locking the thread, thanks guys.",
