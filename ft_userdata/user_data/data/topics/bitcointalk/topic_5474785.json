      "body": "Your presentation of your campaign is very confusing although I can see the payment system of each member.so my question is are you selling the whole bluecoin project or what is it you are offering?And my other question is, what is the guarantee you have the money to pay participants of the campaign, are you going to escrow the funds to show your sincerity or not?In addition,perhaps you should address most of the allegations against your project before advertising, right you won't attract more members.",

      "body": "How about you get a campaign manager, fix the rates so that it's competitive and not a stupid money burn and then not only save money but make a campaign that is a lot safer than current.Not only that, there is a lot seriously wrong with this thread:- You have seemingly unresolved disputed based on the thread you posted.- You are asking also about currency exchange in this thread which is completely unrelated.- BlueCoin has unresolved matters with its community which must be resolved before any advertising is done.- The ANN thread is locked - until further discussion is enabled you can be sure nothing is being advertised.I know, I am preaching to the wrong person...however if you really want to do right by your community and advertise this project, you need to make everything right first.Good luck.I see the thread is self moderated. I have given you legitimate criticism. If you don't like it and delete it. I will continue to repost it. I'd prefer us both not to continuously waste time deleting/reposting and instead reflect and act on the constructive criticism provided.Reposted as OP is deleting critical posts it seems",
