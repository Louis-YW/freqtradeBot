  "content": "I can not say companies in Nigeria are dawning to know about Bitcoin, but that this initiation can be the beginning of hotels and many other companies in Nigeria starting to get involved in bitcoins usage as reserves and as a form of payment methods. This hotel located in Lekki, in Lagos State will be the first of its kind to make a decision of moving towards accepting bitcoin as a form of payment and as the hotel's major reserve. Quote from: https://1stnews.com/george-residence-becomes-first-hotel-to-accept-bitcoin-in-nigeria/George Residence, a frontline player in the hospitality sector, has announced its decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary reserve as well as a form of payment.George Residence is a luxury shortlet which came to the forefront of the Nigerian hospitality industry in 2020. Chief Executive Officer CEO, ‘Yanju George,  made the announcement in a statement released to the media. Further, he disclosed that the decision to make Bitcoin their primary reserve asset is to hedge against fiat inflation.‘‘We have allocated around 50% of our cash reserves to Bitcoin…We hope to increase that as time goes on,’’ he revealed. “Bitcoin is the currency of the future and it is only right that we are strongly positioned so we do not get left behind.“Bitcoin permits our guests a faster and more secure way to enjoy the comfort we offer. Our residents desire simplicity, and we are excited to be able to offer that to them,” the CEO had stated.I am thinking this is just the beginning of hotels in Nigeria to beggining to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, and as a reserved asset.",

It might as well be the center of a new world for the Nigerian crypto enthusiast. This tells how backward the government of Nigeria in its CBN ban had decided to place the nation a while ago. Bitcoin is the future and in order for Nigeria and Nigerians not to be left out in this development, they ought to encourage and promote developments such as these through fair and just policies.Products and services in that hotel are going to be sort out for and paid for in full using the most convenient means and in that means, the citizen has bought Nigeria and in turn, adds to the Nigerian economy as these goods are readily taxable and so is the hotel. This is a good one.",

Adoption is on the move and it wouldnt be a surprising thing if things like these on other countries would happen as well but that would always vary if crypto is really on the positive side on that particular country but if not then expect on what would be next.",

Sometimes, it needs one entity to change the usual path of business. They will be remembered to be the one who paved the way for crypto to enter in the payment system in this industry. And later on, we will see other businesses to follow thru and so with the neighboring countries that are not yet open to crypto payment.",

Peer to peer networks facilitate Bitcoin transactions and it cannot be restricted by financial agencies.But isn't the p2p transaction the same than using an exchange from the bank perspective? The bank will be accepting money coming from a bitcoin transaction, like the exchanges do.For an example: you sell me bitcoin and I pay you with fiat (through a bank account). As long as the bank doesn't ask for the money's source it's probably fine, but then if they want to know the origin they will know it's from a btc trade, and unless both parts involved on the trade lie, it will be considered forbidden by the country's rules anyway, no?",

There's only the minority out there that would actually spend Bitcoin on paying or buying for some stuff, I myself rarely do it. Plus, I don't think small businesses could handle the volatility of the coin, and probably even see implementing such a system towards their hotel a waste of money (no matter how small or big it is).",
