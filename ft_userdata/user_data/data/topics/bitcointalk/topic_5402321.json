But still, it's okay if you already use stop loss to avoid even bigger losses. Hopefully, the price will not fall deeper and sadden investors and traders. But if that continues, investors and traders will have to prepare themselves for deeper bear market times.But rest assured that this situation will not last forever and will be replaced by the bull market so that the price will reverse direction and increase again. Or maybe if you're in doubt, it's best not to try to buy coins and just wait.",

While starting on this journey, I made that same mistake of thinking that I could get out of the market and be profitable without SL because it would seem that price would get to my SL, offset it and then revert to my TP. It was always happening. When I didn't place a SL manually, it would get to the point I had in mind and zoom pass it instead of reverting. So, it would take me days and sometimes months too to revert to entry price. In some cases, I would eventually had to close in greater loss than I would've done if I had placed a SL. That's after days, weeks or months. I've realized it's pointless trading without SL. SL gives you rest of mind. Just don't place it too close. Give it space to breath well.",

QuoteIt seems some wild prediction of Bitcoin giving those who missed the early opportunity of buying is coming alive. Yes, this opportunity is giving those people who missed opportunity to grab at lower prices. but, it is also a fact that at this time there is lots of fear, and because of that majority of new investors don't want to buy. But when bitcoin goes back to its all-time high, they start regretting again like they always do.

To avoid been caught up and trapped  by the market volatility stop loss should be as useful as every other technical or fundamental tool you can think of. It is better to risk a small fraction of your assets than losing it allStop loss orders are important tools for short term traders. We can all make wrong decision and a stop loss helps us to limit our losses. The problem is that in times of high volality the positions can be closed out way to fast again. Today bitcoins dropped 10%, which means that most of the stop loss would have triggered already. Another problem with stop loss is that it doesn't take general market movements into considerations. Over the last few months all of the big crypto coins lost in value. If we sell our positions through a stop loss where will we invest then? Switching into a different coin will likely trigger the next stop loss. Maybe selling right now is not the best option, because why didn't we sell when bitcoin was at 40 or 35,000? At such low levels now I would just sit out the storm.",

Understanding stop losses is important, however, I'm a part of those who share the opinion that this is best time to play it safe and instead of concentrating on setting stop losses or how to go about it this season to still limit your losses. Enough losses have been made already, I'd say just lay off trading for a while till the market is doing better, it wouldn't make you any less a trader. A big and an also very important skill in trading and a factor in becoming a successful trader is knowing when to trade and when not to trade, IMO this season where the market is crashing remarkably without prediction, trying to best secure what you have left is the best strategy.",

It is better to risk a small fraction of your assets than losing it allAs the others have said, this might be a good time just chill and enjoy your tea/coffee without getting stressed out from the bearish market at the moment. Sure, stop loss is very important if you want to be a good trader and also to minimize your losses as little as possible. But, there's will come a time where you just need to step out from trading. Since we don't really know until when the bearish market will continue, so entering the market now is very risky, tho it is always risky. The best option would be just stop trading for a moment, and just wait for the right moment to get back in the market. It's a lot better than losing more when you think you could buy cheap and hoping the price to bounce back up but its price trend says otherwise.",

But having any stocks or gold compared to that? They do not really go down %50 that easily, maybe some stocks could, but not the market in general. This is why there is a big difference between the two. I still say you should go with crypto though, because you donot make x100 with stocks that commonly, but doing x100 in crypto is not unheard of, in fact it is quite common during bull periods.",
