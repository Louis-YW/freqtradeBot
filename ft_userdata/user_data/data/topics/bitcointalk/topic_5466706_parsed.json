As it is now, scams are very much on the increase and as such everyone wants to be sure of what they are getting involved with.

Also, this should be moved to Services or Digital goods (since it's premade, finished software).Thank you for your interest in dApp game script. I will try to answer your questions as best as I can.- We built this game script our team, using our own skills and knowledge.We are the sole creator and owner of this game script.- We are one of the primary coders/developers of this game script. we did not re-sell or acquire any work from others. Everything in this game script is original and authentic.-We do provide a service for technical/code support, patches, etc. after have sold to someone. - The game operates via a combination of backend (mongo, API,s ,..), frontend (ReactJs), and smart contract (solidity). The backend handles the logic and data of the game, such as the rules, the scores, the rewards, etc. The frontend handles the user interface and interaction of the game, such as the graphics, the sounds, the buttons, etc. The smart contract handles the transactions and verification of the game, such as the payments, the ownership, the fairness, etc.I hope this answers your questions and gives you a clear idea of what my game script is about. If you have any more questions or want to buy my game script, please contact me via Yahoo at xwebking@yahoo.com or website : cashcode.store. Thank you for your time and attention.",

Absolutely, I think that this board is not the appropriate board for this topic as it has to do with service rendered and it therefore should be forwarded to the appropriate board as listed above. OP is yet to give hints on his or her escrow services as it pertains to this platform standards but however, it would be nice we allow OP decides on his or her opinion for the time being. I would advise OP to not be ignorant of the fact that this platform and her members are watching so therefore OP must be of good delivery. he or she must excel here in his or her business. I checked and found out that OP has been a long term member here so he or she can attest to the activities of the platform.",

      "body": "I just visited the demo version of your web3 casino but it took like a minute to enter to it, maybe the issue with the hosting server of your demo or the script itself. Beside that and talking about the script itself with that price it’s really and abuse price seeing that most of the pictures and icons used are copied from other casinos like bc.game, the quality also of these pictures are so bad and the example is with the roulette game the rolling picture is very low. When i clicked on connect wallet nothing happens and I’m not sure if it’s because of the demo version or it’s not working on mobile.This is only my opinion an I would like to day that with the price mentioned you should upgrade a lot of things, and add a smart contract auditing with a trusted service or company to verify if there’s no malicious codes with the contracts as it’s the most important thing with web3 casinos and applications.",

As it is now, scams are very much on the increase and as such everyone wants to be sure of what they are getting involved with. S ok therefore I believe members here would want to opt for an escrow for transparency and accountability which I believe you know that otherwise nobody would be comfortable to pay for anything here when they do not know whom they are dealing with. And this website or yours too has no one to vouch for it and possibly I guess it is a new website and lastly, just as you have been asked before by a poster here, It would be nice you tell or make known your connection or stand with what you are introducing here to the community. Thank you for your feedback and your interest in my website and script. I appreciate your concern about the payment aspect and the reputation of my website. I understand that scams are very common and that you want to be sure of what you are getting involved with. Let me address your questions and doubts.We are willing to use an escrow service for the payment process and have no problem with that. we want to ensure that both parties are satisfied and protected. Also can use any reputable escrow service that you prefer or suggest. Accepting to use an escrow services for your business is a good decision as far as this platform is concerned. Deals of this nature are very much sensitive coupled with the scam activities. So one needs to protect their interests as well. I believe  you know already that escrow services exist here so therefore it would be nice engaging the services of an escrow from this platform and I suggest it should be a reputable member with a long time existence on this platform before you think further to engage.Lastly, I will advise you quote reply on one post instead of quoting one for one on different post which doesn't go down well here and does not make your thread look coordinated otherwise you could be seen as a spammer of your own thread.Thank you for your advice . apologize for quoting multiple posts separately & did not mean to spam or make our thread look uncoordinated, just trying to reply to each comment individually and address their pointsPlease answer if you are willing to use an escrow for your potential buyersIt is important that you choose or support an escrow, that way the setup is secured by them until the buyer is satisfied with your installation. It's one thing to have a demo, it's another thing to setup according to someone else's infrastructure. Again, you should move your thread to the appropriate section by using the \"Move\" button in the bottom right of the page, and moving this thread to Services, or Digital Goods. Selling gambling software doesn't belong in the gambling board. Absolutely, I think that this board is not the appropriate board for this topic as it has to do with service rendered and it therefore should be forwarded to the appropriate board as listed above. OP is yet to give hints on his or her escrow services as it pertains to this platform standards but however, it would be nice we allow OP decides on his or her opinion for the time being. I would advise OP to not be ignorant of the fact that this platform and her members are watching so therefore OP must be of good delivery. he or she must excel here in his or her business. I checked and found out that OP has been a long term member here so he or she can attest to the activities of the platform.Appreciate your concern about the board - Topic moved",

      "body": "Quote from: GxSTxV on September 14, 2023, 01:06:26 PMI just visited the demo version of your web3 casino but it took like a minute to enter to it, maybe the issue with the hosting server of your demo or the script itself. Beside that and talking about the script itself with that price it’s really and abuse price seeing that most of the pictures and icons used are copied from other casinos like bc.game, the quality also of these pictures are so bad and the example is with the roulette game the rolling picture is very low. When i clicked on connect wallet nothing happens and I’m not sure if it’s because of the demo version or it’s not working on mobile.This is only my opinion an I would like to day that with the price mentioned you should upgrade a lot of things, and add a smart contract auditing with a trusted service or company to verify if there’s no malicious codes with the contracts as it’s the most important thing with web3 casinos and applications.Thank you for your feedback and your interest in web3 casino script.  - First, the slow loading time of the demo version is due to the use of the developer server, which needs to upgrade resources. - Second, the images and icons used in the web3 casino script can be customized and changed. - Third, wallet connection feature works well on mobile devices.You can see the functionality and functionality of the web3 casino script by testing the demo version on the  website.   (In the future update of the script, WalletConnect v2 will be integrated) - Fourth, we have tested it extensively and rigorously on different platforms and devices.Coding best practices and standards have also been used to ensure that the web3 casino script is clean, efficient and reliable. - Fifth, smart contracts used in the project can be audited (Contact for more information)I hope this answers your feedback and clears your doubt.",
