One thing that only sure here is that all Crypto gamblers are Bitcoin users or at least for once used bitcoin to gamble  but asking what percentage a investors to be a gamblers? sorry but this seems to be impossible to answer , because there are no data asked in KYC verification about how much we invest in bitcoin or if we are investor. and I think this will completely violate privacy , when majority of crypto gamblers hates KYC what more if being asked if they are investor?",

Most people who hold Bitcoin,the majority of them are sure gamblers.The reason is simple,the gambling industry being the most widely accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment and only few other industries are as open as gambling platforms to accept cryptocurrencies in general.That is why I think it is in the 70-80% of the users not just 10-20% as most people who hold a large amount of Bitcoins,also have some set aside to entertain themselves and what better way than gambling to have some fun.Investors are people who invest in different businesses and I doubt Bitcoiners are also investors.",

Do you mean bitcoin investors who gamble with bitcoins specifically? or just bitcoin investors who gamble via the conventional means?It will be difficult to get an accurate figure, but by my assumptions, the number of bitcoin investors who gamble with bitcoins is less than the number of investors in bitcoins who gamble with fiat.Quote from: arhipova on November 14, 2023, 07:56:10 AM Also, it is possible that most of gamblers are still not bitcoin investors ? There have always been gamblers even without bitcoins, but I take it that you mean to say it is possible that some people who gamble with bitcoins are not investing in bitcoins for the long term. I agree with you, but it is a very small number because not everyone has bitcoins for investment reasons.",

I think it will be somewhere between 10-20% ?I actually have done any study on this subject before so I guess we could say that there are a high chance that bitcoin investors are gamblers and also some that despite them having been around for a long time haven’t gambled once and don’t even own a single account in any gambling site before. Btw, does owning a coin accounts that one must have been involved in gambling? Quote Also, it is possible that most of gamblers are still not bitcoin investors ? I see  less chances of the later happening. We still have people that are still using casinos that don’t support the use of cryptocurrency and some that have never used an online casino ever in their life; so I believe those ones could count as gamblers that ain’t investors.",

And you'd have no way to verify if they're telling the truth.  So were left to speculate.  Maybe 10% of investors dabble in crypto casinos? 20%? 50%? Impossible to pin down an exact figure.  But it's clear there's significant overlap between the crypto investment and crypto gambling communities.",

The fact remains that we cannot get the specific data because it will be hard to do so, since there id no possible way for one to know who gambles everyday online with their bitcoin.In the land base casino or fiat casinos, it is also hard to get the total number of gamblers that uses fiat to gamble daily. What I know for sure is that gambling is something that new people keep on involving themselves in it everyday. Although in my country only few bitcoin investors will use their bitcoin to gamble because they see it as an investment that will yield profit for them.",

The acceptance of Bitcoin payment is growing every day so many more stores and businesses will start accepting Bitcoin, I believe that more new gamblers will prefer to use Bitcoin over others as their favourite digital currency for gambling.",

There's no data regarding the percentage of users of Bitcoin that gamble at the same time. We can only assume that most crypto users have been into gambling as there are many ads that promote different gambling sites not only on this forum but also on other websites. We can say this because in crypto they can have the things they want. Like anonymity, having a safer transaction for online gambling, and such. Gamblers love freedom and privacy nowadays, they will always look for a way to have it and crypto provides what gamblers are looking for.",

Most investors are rather hidden or respect their privacy so I reckon you couldn't really easily make a connection even if casinos tried to connect their accounts to the wallets of well-known investors. I guess casinos can provide a survey but that would only amount to their user base and nothing more. As for gamblers not being investors, I reckon they were at some point since, well, most early crypto gamblers were only able to use Bitcoin. But now with a lot of other alternatives (together with fiat), I reckon we have gamblers who don't even give a damn about crypto. But I'd say it's more likely for a crypto gambler to be a bitcoin investor than an investor being a gambler.",

We don't know how big the percentage is because many crypto gamblers still don't do KYC or they gamble secretly. It is possible that most gamblers are not yet bitcoin investors and use their bitcoins for gambling but that will depend on how they treat their bitcoins.

There's no available data on this as centralized gambling platforms don't provide such information. To estimate the answer, we rely on a simple formula. First, we need to determine the total number of Bitcoin investors. However, this is challenging as Bitcoin transactions are inherently anonymous. While we can access data on the number of generated Bitcoin wallets, it doesn't necessarily reflect the number of investors, as one could create wallets and abandon them or create multiple wallets to diversify their investments.",

But that is just a personal perception I have with the time I have invested within this community.Also, it is reasonable to believe there are gamblers who are not actually interested in Bitcoin as asset at all, but only as a tool for them to gambler without relying on them having a bank account or a credit card (we all know there are more than only one reason for any gambler to avoid credit), if I had also to guess on that percentage I would say it is about a 12% of gamblers. I am aware there have been scientific studies published by psychologist before on the percentage of the gambling population in certain communities, but I doubt they have gone as far as classifying those who specifically wager satoshis.",

You can know it because you can not know many bitcoin users that are living s private life. Another thing is that there is no such research done in the past like to be using IP to track. No gambling site will want to tell researcher about the IP address of their gamblers unless if regulators or government ask for it. So this can not be known.",
