  "content": "This is a fiasco, Nvidia. GeForce RTX 4090 continue to melt and burn, and this is a patternAfter the first case of a GeForce RTX 4090 fire was described, there were suggestions that this was not an accident, and everything would not be limited to this. Indeed, other incidents followed. And in all cases, the same weak point is the connector for connecting additional power and / or the branded adapter cable included in the package.https://gadgettendency.com/this-is-a-fiasco-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-continue-to-melt-and-burn-and-this-is-a-pattern/",

      "body": "How many of those pins are actually +12V. Just like the PCIe 8 pin connector, there are only 3 +12V and the rest are GND and sensing connectors. I had once of those dual Radeon 6990 GPUs which was basically 2 of the Radeon 6970 and it only had 2 * 8 pin connectors. That beast can pull 600 Watts if you overclocked it, I think it used like 450Watts in some high intensity games or mining. I assumed the connectors would burn but they never did. My guess is that its not the GPU but the adapter which is causing the melting. They need to use better female pins.",

Especially when they know that heat is a big issue with this product. I haven’t seen a whole lot of complaints about these yet, but I also didn’t know they were getting into people’s hands already. What is your advice? Holding off on purchasing for now?",

I hope that AMD will not use such a connector.Except for the 4 tiny sensing pins it looks just like the old 8 pin connectors but with more pins. The problem is the poorly designed and builtadapter. It's the shitty riser issue all over again but at much higher power levels. It's Nvidia's fault for poor quality control of their outsourced adapter.Edit: The right angle connector may solve the issue simply by being better built in addition to avoiding the stress of bending.",

      "body": "it is ridiculous to use that cable on a card with that wattage, I can understand on an 80 series but on a 90 that has out-of-standard consumption they should have inserted at least 2 to avoid such risks. A cable operating under optimum conditions at 95% load that can handle the slightest change (whether it's a badly ventilated case or a PSU that drops the voltage 0.1 from normal) can lead to disastrous results. without considering that by doing so you limit customization, preventing you from buying third-party cables to change the aesthetics.

Never had this happen before to know. The service center will not accept melted connectors on the power supply under warranty and will write an act where it will be denied repair or replacement. In most cases, this is the user's fault. That's why I don't buy top graphics cards, and I read reviews carefully before buying.",

The AIB partners may cover PSU damage to please their customers then try to recover the costsfrom Nvidia. End users may file a class action with Nvidia and/or the AIBs. It's unlikely the PSU providers will cover it themselves.EVGA must be relieved they dumped Nvidia and have avoided this problem.",
