Draw 1-1 in the first game and lose 3-1 in the second against West Ham.Public Stamford Bridge hopes that the Blues can get full points in this match. Luton Town, which is not favored in the betting, will definitely appear with all their might against Chelsea.Give your best analysis and predictions for the Chelsea vs Luton Town match.I will lock this topic after the game ends.",

      "body": "Luton offered lots of opportunities for Brighton to score, 27 or so, and showed they won't play conservative against better opponents on paper, that they will go and attack, and probably should lose by many goals.On the other hand, Chelsea always invests like 100M to make a great team on paper, and in practice they struggle, like their last year 12th place and their 14 games with a single win and low scored goals show us. They last defeat against West Ham raises some concerns, but play West Ham at their home is tricky and they sometimes cause upsets, and Chelsea did dominate the game in the first half, with their missed penalty being a turning point for the worst for them.In the end of the day, it is a game to be observed, not to make bets on, in my opinion. Will Chelsea keep disappointing their fans and giving crap results again even after investing a fortune in the team? Will this game be a turning point for them?Or will Luton cause an upset and maybe even change tactics and be more conservative against the big teams? The small teams that get promoted sometimes do cause upsets, and Aston Vila did re bounce  after their thrashing against Newcastle in the first round.If Chelsea plays OK I might add one of their players in my fantasy team since they have some easy schedule ahead, but I will observe first.",

You can transfer this topic there if you want. I don't think there is any need to discuss here separately.Chelsea and Luton Town have played two head-to-head matches in the past with Chelsea winning both matches.  Chelsea has a 79% chance to win tomorrow's match.Stamford Bridge, which is Chelsea's home ground, is as strong as ever. Therefore, experts do not think it is reasonable to give a team like Luton Town more chances to win than Chelsea at this ground.",

Luton is also not a match for Chelsea when I saw Luton Town who was beaten with a big score by Brighton and they were only able to score 1 goal through the penalty spot towards the end, there is no way Chelsea won't win.But the English premier league is always full of surprises even though Luton is not a team that is predicted to win.Chelsea's temporary line up that I see, it is possible that 2 midfielders who were recruited at a high cost will be played simultaneously by Pochettino.For players who bet on a draw, they will get odds of around 6.20, but I believe the result will not be a draw.",
