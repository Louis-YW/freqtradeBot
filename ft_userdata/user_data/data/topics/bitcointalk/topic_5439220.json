      "body": "Are people in your community interested in Bitcoin? Cause that is how bitcointalk would benefit them. If there is interest and they are looking for a reliable means of learning about it, then you can try various means of introducing them to it, word of mouth, fliers, online circular among local digital communities etc.Such approach would not be very effective and I can guess that a lot of them would either not be interested or not last a few days here.My honest two cents is that there is no need marketing the forum to others. The admin does not run any ad campaign on other social platforms to attract users. You can try getting those you know personally and feel they would like it here interested, but a much wider audience would not be as effective.- Jay -",

There are some people, regardless of all the tuts you explain, they tend to find other places for resources of information. I told my sister to register in bitcointalk if she wanna learn something and ask anything in the forum, but all she did was go to youtube and reddit.",

Spoon feeding them with a lot of info that available on the internet will just gonna make them more reliable to you rather than understand the technology by themselves.Quote from: Belarge on February 09, 2023, 04:00:38 PMDo you think it will be of advantage or disadvantage to my community?It depends on what kind of community you have. It’s an advantage if you have an open minded community that willing to learn and disadvantage if the community you’ve got is very toxic. You will just be subjected to criticism and blaming once they lose money through Bitcoin even though you gave them a disclaimer. Choice is yours since you can freely enjoy Bitcoin investment without the need to disturb your personal life.",

Telling them about this platform is very much appreciated because this will do them good and advance their knowledge about bitcoin technology and  blockchain industry in general. It would be nice knowing their state of mind I really they are interested in learning or not so as not to  waste your precious time with the wrong people. You can just take through the platform for them to see, telling them about the rules and regulations governing each board, how to make post, appropriate boards for the post for which they want to post. Atleast all I have stated above can guide them through. Allow them to do the rest of the others by engaging in Research so as gti gain more knowledge about the platform.",

The answer to your question: it will of advantage to the people you are about to introduce because they will learn from experience members and expertise in there respective Field. It could also be a added advantage to the forum when they come in with full sincerity nd showcase there talents and specialty. They can also be harmful to the forum if they come in with bad intension and flood the forum with cheap post, which they will probably not last long.",

One might ask why newcomers who barely understand Bitcoin always feel that they have an obligation to tell the whole world about Bitcoin, that is, their society.I have always assumed that the training should come from someone who can answer all my questions. O.P., are you ready for this? Maybe you still need to show an example of what you have achieved, and only after that can you start accepting the role of a coach. Sometimes our good intentions have unintended consequences. If you understand correctly, the phrase \"cause good\"",

In this way, we stop false information about Bitcoin and enlighten them from the doubts and too negative. But expect opposing ideas and negative words from them. Because I will tell you that it was hard to convince people if they already have a bad experience like being scammed. You really need to be strong and extend your patience to handle them as this is not an easy task. And I suggest you having at least 1 person to accompany you to strengthen their trust in you.",

If yes, just spend more time learning about bitcoin, its technology and features, how to keep bitcoins safe, and understand the basics of investing. Make yourself fully equipped with the knowledge and at the same time experience. You will feel it when you are ready to spread bitcoin knowledge in your community. Hopefully, you will do it for free. I hate it when some people are trying to exploit the innocents by telling them about the potential to earn big by investing in bitcoin but asking fees for their services on how to do it.",

I believe this is a good ideas specially if all of us will do same small act to help Bitcoin. This is a hard task but this can be easily by doing a powerpoint that contains summary and key feature of Bitcoin.

There's a plethora of choices to go for when you want to sell bitcoin's idea to the public. I find that the most effective way of letting people know about Bitcoin is through incentivized seminars. For instance, a guy from this forum set up a seminar about bitcoin and its benefits for his community's housewives, given the fact that these members are the ones responsible for managing money in the household. It was a success, and I only wished he gave those people a reason to come back by maybe giving them awesome trinkets that relate to bitcoin and have them follow up on him about their progress. That being said, I think it will serve you well if you do the same. If you have a knack for speaking in public, or you know someone who does, this is the perfect and the most efficient way of letting people know about bitcoin.",
