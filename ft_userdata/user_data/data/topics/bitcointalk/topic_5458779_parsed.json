Previously known to be a skeptic of crypto, Fink years ago suggested fans of the asset class heavily used it for “illicit activities.”Fink continued: QuoteInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.From this fact I can notice with not very clear expectations, how the independent or external financial world, becomes every day more interested in bitcoin increasing its projection and even change its perception of it, however I wonder how the environment of the most important cryptocurrency will react, out of what is obvious as a small rise due to the positive opinion of a \"big fish\", rather in terms of its market and relative, especially considering facts such as:Under Fink, BlackRock has attempted to launch a spot BTC ETF with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase acting as a surveillance partner. It’s unclear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the investment vehicle, given its track record of rejecting all previously filed spot BTC ETF applications to date.I woul like to know what its your opinion about this fact, ¿Do you think, tihis time is the right for the Fink Purpose?, ¿Could be there another interesting thing?, Even ¿Is the Fink Purpose a good way for bitcoin currently?, Honestly , im a litle excited for the posible results butim not pretty sure if this is the properly thing to do.Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-international-asset-black-rock-ceo-bullish-remarksSource: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/05/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-bitcoin-could-revolutionize-finance/",
