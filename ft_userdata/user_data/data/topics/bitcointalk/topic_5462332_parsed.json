  "content": "Before now, I've seen some forum members argue that bitcoin is not meant for everyone.However in their own right, they have some point, but on the other hand, let's look at it from this angle.For some of us that are from developing countries, is not easy to convince someone about bitcoin or educating somebody about it at first instance and you expect them to accept it wholeheartedly.They need lots of education and convincing because they do not have an idea of what your saying or what bitcoin looks likes especially for those of them above middle age, because the semantics of bitcoin is a bit different and the approach towards accepting new idea's that is  different from the conventional ways they know of, always comes with some level of resistance.To a large extent you can even argue that some of our leaders in government don't have an idea of what this innovation is all about hence the few restrictions here and there. So for me, no amount of educating people about bitcoin is enough, if an individual has the energy to go round his community to talk to people about bitcoin, I think is a welcome development, as long as his giving them the right knowledge on bitcoin education.In telling people about bitcoin, even if they don't seem to accept it at first, you will see a good number coming to pick interest much later. Just because a person didn't accept your idea presented to him immediately doesn't perfectly mean he has totally rejected for at some point in life he might find reasons to give the idea a try even without you knowing about it. Let's keep the ball rolling bitcoin is here to stay.",

      "body": "When members say Bitcoin wasn't meant for everyone, they don't mean that we should stop spreading the word of Bitcoin to others. I too do stand with that motion that Bitcoin isnt for everyone and there might be some good reasons.      In theory, Bitcoin was designed to provide a new means of financial system which anyone can access as long as they had access to an internet connection. These means everyone was included regardless of their age, location or knowledge. As long as there was someone to educate them about it, there is a chance of them learning and adopting Bitcoin. However, in practice there might be some certain factors that might be a barrier to their learning or adoption which includes. 1.Their access to technology systems like the phone or an internet connection2. some governments restrictions of which we all know may not be a baise for someone not to adopt Bitcoin because of its decentralized systems.3. Financial illiteracy and belief they already have about digital money to be a scam or means to loot them of their funds. With all these factors most people might just not be able to adopt Bitcoin and experience it's full peotential for now, and these doesn't stop us from telling anyone about Bitcoin. We all know that no matter how you tell someone about Bitcoin investment, it all depends on them to invest in it's technology so we shouldn't force it in them. Bitcoin investment is a choice, but with time they might just want to give it a try.",

As a result, everybody concerned about their financial future will understand how critical it is to accept Bitcoin. However, some individuals see it differently, believing it is a fraud, and they are unwilling to learn something new; instead, they prefer to give banks their money.QuoteIn telling people about bitcoin, even if they don't seem to accept it at first, you will see a good number coming to pick interest much later.

These factors are the reason why Bitcoin is currently not for everybody. Some of the factors are:1. Illiteracy: In developing nations, the majority of its population are illiterate. Most of them can't even read or write. So teaching such people about Bitcoin will be a waste of time because they would not understand anything.2. Preference: Using or investing in Bitcoin is by choice and not by force. Some people prefer using fiat and investing in other sectors. I have seen people that don't want to hear anything about Bitcoin or other altcoins. The reason is that they don't have interest. This set of people doesn't have any interest in Bitcoin, so it is not for them. 3. Government policies: If the use of Bitcoin is illegal in my country, Bitcoin is not for me. Some countries have criminalized ownership and use of Bitcoin. Persuading such a person to buy Bitcoin is like encouraging him to commit a crime.4.  Poverty: A poor man is only concerned about how to satisfy his basic needs and not how to invest. All he wants to hear is how to get money to buy food, clothing, or pay house rent. When his income is not enough to meet his needs, he will not listen to your Bitcoin lectures. Even if he listens, he has no extra funds to buy. Nobody is stopping you from engaging in a Bitcoin awareness program because the community needs all the publicity. But as long as Bitcoin is still not a global legal tender, it is not for everybody.",
