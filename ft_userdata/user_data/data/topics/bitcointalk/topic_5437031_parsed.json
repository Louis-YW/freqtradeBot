I want to know with Coinbase Commerce, do the user require a KYC or any identifiable information? Here is an example of a transaction  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4379af7def2eaa91ccdbd51c1eb4833915338cfcef27154d6df22c0716fbadcf  I'm trying to gather information that can hopefully lead to some type of identification, I know Coinbase is big on KYC.  Thank you in advance for any information. Have a great day everyone.",

      "body": "Have you purchased anything from a website that accepts payments through the Coinbase payment gateway. Due to the fact that it is indicated in the commerce, the transaction appears to be a payment getaway. For assistance with your problem, contact Coinbase support. I think accessing their wallet services, which include commerce, requires KYC. If still present, they might freeze the fraudsters' funds. Indicate in writing where you are making the transaction. Even though I can't guarantee that you will receive a refund, try it anyhow.",

I want to know with Coinbase Commerce, do the user require a KYC or any identifiable information? Here is an example of a transaction ~Sorry to hear about the hack. As for Coinbase Commerce, they usually require some identification information to be provided, like a government-issued ID, to follow laws against money laundering and prevent fraud. You should check out their policies and terms of service to get their exact verification process. You should also report the case to their customer support with as much detail as possible so they can advise you on how to proceed.",

So it is a non-custodial or fully decentralized payment gateway even if you are not KYC verified you can withdraw the amount to another wallet. And I tried to read the faqs but it seems Coinbase commerce doesn't require KYC verification.",

There are a lot of careless hackers out there that there's a small chance that the hacker might send the stolen funds to a KYC'd account. You already have nothing to lose anyway, and submitting a report takes just a few minutes.",

CB commerce has 2 types of user accounts where only CB-managed users can possibly be identified (the wallet is connected to the main CB exchange account based on their description)QuoteFunds settle into a Coinbase-managed wallet without you having to manage your private keys. Your Exchange account can hold crypto in addition to local currency (fiat)",
