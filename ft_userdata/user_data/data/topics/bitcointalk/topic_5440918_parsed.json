I've never heard of anything like this but there's gotta be someone out there doing it.What exactly do you mean by \"up your rating\"? Is it  To help make the business good/better/reputable in order to organically increase the rating, To add rating features for satisfied customers to give positive rating or You just want fake ratings?I will advice you to avoid the latter and go for the first or/and second which could cost you little to nothing if you know what you are doing. But if you insist on hiring, go for people who can make the business better, or/and add rating features for customers",

Once caught trying to scam Google, they'll remove and blacklist your business (and possibly other businesses you start) from the Google search. Google famously shut down Rap Genius for this sort of stuff about a decade ago, and it nearly crushed their business: http://tcrn.ch/1gXbVZN",
