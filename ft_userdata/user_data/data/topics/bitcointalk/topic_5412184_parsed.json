Or like the well designed ponzi scheme or hyip platforms in which the late investors will all lose. All high yield profitable investment is likely a scam or a means to lose money, only the low yield ones are the real investment.",

Rather than staking that you're risk too many coins, it's better if he's trading and learn how to understand the market. Though trading doesn't guarantee your will always earn profit, but staking is more like holding, holding altcoins for long time isn't good choice.",
