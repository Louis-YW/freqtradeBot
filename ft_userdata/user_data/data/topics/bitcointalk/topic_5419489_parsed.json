Yep, already suggested by lovesmayfamilis and I think OP ought to lock this thread lest it turn into a beehive of shitposters.  They're coming, I can hear them buzzing.Quote from: UserU on November 05, 2022, 08:00:28 AMNah, it's just a burner account. User probably gonna get nuked and return with another one.Yeah, that's the real problem in situations like this where there's no way (or will) to keep banned members from creating new accounts and just picking up where they left off--like naim027 and his alts.  Hopefully this jackweed will just get the message that he's going to be wasting his time and pick another forum where mods aren't as on the ball.",
