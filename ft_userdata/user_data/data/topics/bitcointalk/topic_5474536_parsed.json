Also the difficulty target plays a huge role in the block time and since it changes every 2016 block it will affect the estimate time. The average time might be 10 minutes or the estimated base on the two timers you use but it Could be way lower and higher than that. We have seen blocks getting confirmed in less than a minute which will affect the time significantly",

We have seen blocks getting confirmed in less than a minute which will affect the time significantly If you understand difficulty retarget, you will not say this.Difficulty retarget helps to adjust difficulty to fit it with network hash rate that is computational power of the Bitcoin network to mine new blocks. Block time within 2016 blocks can be longer or shorter than 10 minutes * 2016 blocks because the average block time within 2016 blocks can be lower or higher than 10 minutes. In this context, it is for a long interval from now till a halving block and average block time for a long interval will still be around 10 minutes. I used 9 minutes and 11 minutes because of this reason.Like you can not say one block can be found a few second after a previous block, it is true but it does not affect estimated time for a next halving too much. Because in average, block time is about 10 minutes.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin24h statistics: Avg. time between blocks: 9 minutes 13 secondsA chart for Average time between Bitcoin blocks (in seconds) https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/charts/average-block-intervalYou can see it in 1M, 6M, 1Y, average block time is fluctuating around 600 to less than 700 seconds.Last 3 yearshttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y",

I think you might be missing my point, the difficulty and the hash rate plays a role in the date and without having an exact figure for this two all dates will just be mere estimations because it will vary even if it is for at least two weeks. What I was saying is the best way to calculate the exact date for halving is by counting down the 210,000 blocks needed to be mined before it happens. If you look at other estimators by sites like Coincegko, Binance Academy, BitcoinBlockhalving, Coinmarketcap and others, you will see that they are constantly adjusting the date almost every 2 weeks based on average 2016 block time. So I still stand that the 9, 10, 11 minutes timers you used won’t give us an accurate countdown so as any number used by all Those sites, the only accurate countdown is, it happens after 210, 000 blocks are mined.",

Op has already stated that the result is based on the blocks that will be mined in different minutes, for example, a minute to 11-minute timeframe, and he shared that the website will calculate accordingly, so how can you say this result is based on assumption? It is based on proper block data.We are waiting for the halving eagerly because after the halving, a bull run will start, and we are going to make some money out of it. More money will be inflowing into BTC, and the overall market will pump. And the good thing is that if ETFs are approved, we can see the price will rise to a point we didn't even have predicted.Most of the analyst predicted that BTC can reach 100,000 dollars but the funny thing is many people still waiting for the dip",

This information is more valuable for the miners who will be more affected by halving. We will also be affected due to the rise in fees but I think the increase in prices of fees comes early for us than the time we have anticipated.I will keep an eye on this calculator and will try to make a good analysis out of it if there is any way to make one understand the nature of the fee but till then there are many blocks that goes without any transaction in them for example with zero transaction, what they have to do with having time or calculators like these.

I believe that next halving is going to occur during 2024 and if we see the yearly thing then there is no need to go with the exact date. By the way after halving it will still take Bitcoin sometime to go to it's ATH and that's why the halving is just an indicator for that upcoming ATH that we all want to see.",

You are missing between block countdown and time countdown.Even the site writes itQuoteWhen is the 2024 Bitcoin Halving?The 2024 halving will likely occur in April 2024. There is a small chance it will happen in either March or May. Our most updated estimate is displayed at the top of this page.My thread writes that I shared it not because it gives accurate estimated halving time, but because it is the only site I know that you can enter a block time (average block time of rest blocks till the halving) for estimated halving time.",

Some blocks are confirmed at a longer time and some, a shorter time. These variations are not put into consideration when calculating the halving time. Even if all past parameters and block confirmation times were considered before putting up the calculators, its still a wild guess as new developments might  spark up in the near future and possibly alter the parameters of calculation, leading to a wrong prediction. From my observation of the halving curves, there's little  or insignificant increase in prize of bitcoin one month after halving. The deal gets rolling properly like 6 months - 1 year after halving and investors tend to reap good profits at this time span. Hoping to get good profits at first month after halving is just like hoping to fully enjoy an occasion when you intend leaving just after the opening prayer.",

I can agree with you though about having to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible as soon as possible, you will never know if this is the last time that bitcoin will touch this price for the better and you will end up with regret not having to buy at this price when bitcoin finally has $100k as a price floor.",
