You might want to get yourself involve in something that gives you income(probably tech related or other businesses), so you can accumulate a good fraction. Let's be honest here, you need money to do things.Just don't care much about the 100K you're seeing now, instead, find ways to join the train.",

While it's true that the price has appreciated significantly over the years, there's always an opportunities to buy.. Personally, I sometimes wish I had invested in Bitcoin earlier, but I'm still grateful that I got on board when I did. Watching my investment grow over time has been an incredible experience.If you have the funds to invest, I recommend using the dollar cost averaging method to reduce market volatility risks. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance.Don't let FOMO, fear of missing out or feelings of being 'late to the party' hold you back. Bitcoin's potential for long term growth remains promising, and every investor's journey begins at a unique time.",

For sure, the biggest opportunity was before 2020 but I'd say that it's not late even today because I think that Bitcoin is a revolution in financial system. We had barter, then coins, then paper money, then fiat and now cryptos, this is truly one of the biggest financial revolution during our existence. So, Bitcoin is only 16 years old and humans have been existing for such a long time. So, no, it's not late to invest in Bitcoin. I also think that if governments really save their strategic reserves in Bitcoin, that means that it's not late, it's only beginning.",

Just because Bitcoin is priced at $101k (by the time of writing this post), it doesn't mean you need to have $101k to be able to trade it or buy it. Bitcoin has eight decimal points, which means that you can even buy a small portion of it. This is the beauty of Bitcoin: you can start investing in Bitcoin for as low as $10 or maybe even less if a platform allows it.Since you are new in this space, you should know that the market usually moves in a cyclical pattern. There are bull runs and bear runs. During bear runs, the market goes down, which is generally the best time for buying, and in contrast, the market goes up during bull runs, and that is when people sell the cryptocurrencies they have bought during the bear run.Buying low and selling high is the basic principal and strategy, but you should try and get as much knowledge as possible before you make your first investment.",

I am not going to lie to you. You are late. Or at least in comparison with others who were able to purchase bitcoin at a price lower than $1000 USD. Every passing hour, bitcoin may be rising more and more and for every passing hour that you have not invested in bitcoin the more you are being \"late\" to bitcoin. QuoteIs my being aware of Bitcoin now too late or do I still have a chance?Yes you are late but hope is not all gone. If you think you are going to be making the same profit as those who had bought bitcoin at less than $1000 USD with the same amount of money then your expectations will be ruined soon. However, you can definitely still make profit with bitcoin. It is quite unfortunate that you found bitcoin when it is already at $100k but you still have a lot of options. You can wait for the bearish season or you can wait for a dip even so miniscule just so you can take profit at the end of this year. It depends on what your preferences are and goals with bitcoin.",

I can say those days are over and it's too late to do that. But if your goal is just to make significant profits then as everyone said above, it is never too late to invest in bitcoin. We are no longer in the early stages of the bitcoin revolution but it is not too late to start now because for an asset that is only 15 years old, and compared to assets that are thousands of years old like gold or silver, it is still too early. Or compared to the traditional financial market, it can be said that there are still many opportunities for us to take advantage of and opportunities will always exist as long as the market exists.",

But if you just do a research towards future development that might happen then provably you will get an idea about possible good growth with this coin and other opportunities that you can take advantage then you won't say anything that you are late about buying Bitcoin at this point. Also its good that you acknowledge that you can buy a little fraction of Bitcoins and this is already a good indication that you can start your journey by doing that.Also there's a lot of good suggestion here and hopefully you can learn from those words given by people since actually we are not late when it comes starting up our Bitcoin investment since anyone could enter at what price they want to buy.",
