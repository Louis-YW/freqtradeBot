I really don't understand these things can someone give me some details please? Guides are above but as a newbie, you don't need to learn about it first.Learn about Bitcoin as it is more important for why you are in Bitcointalk forum.Next you can learn forum rules as you can be banned by breaking rules.With Trust, trust feedback, if you don't trade with other members, you don't need it. You will not be banned by Trust or Trust Feedback. It is less important than forum rules.List of forum rules.",

I really don't understand these things can someone give me some details please? Others have sent links wherr you will learn about the trust system feedback, but I want to explain little to you based on your question in OP so that you will have a tip of what you will expect in the links.Green feedback means the trust is positive and it goes to the left side of the + 0 -. You give someone positive trust if they have transacted with you without issues and if you feel they are not likely to scam. The Red feedback is negative which goes to the right side. You leave negative feedback is someone has scammed or cheated. The last is the neutral tag. You use it when the feedback is neither positive enough nor negative enough.",

I really don't understand these things can someone give me some details please? The feedback is a way of telling how a user should be trusted, for the people you saw green, it means that they are trustworthy people and you can trade anything with them, you have nothing to fear but you should still put caution when trading because it doesn't justify what happened in the future.Similarly, a red trust person who have negative in their profile, the feedback should tell you what they did and a link as reference will be there on their profile why you should not trust them or even trade with them but again, you need to check the reference link to see if the accusations is justified or maybe not, there are instances where red trust and feed back are later change to neutral tag.Quote from: _act_ on October 02, 2023, 07:51:50 AMIn addition, if you want to be a DT2 member, someone in DT1 must add your to his trust list.

You can't be a DT member if you are not in trust list of any DT1 member. For being a DT2 member, you need to be in trust list of at least 1 DT1 member and the number of DT1 members who have included you in their trust list must be bigger or equal to number of users who have excluded you from their trust list.",

I noticed you joined the forum back in July, but it seems you haven't been too active in terms of posting. My suggestion would be to get involved in discussions and get to know some fellow forum members better before diving too deeply into the Trust system. It's a good way to ease into things!",

If you're indeed a newbie to this forum, i will suggest that you have less concern about the DT for know till you're able to get familiar with how the forum works and you've gained a good stay with the level of your knowledge on how things work as well on the forum, i don't expect a newbie to put more concentrations on that when they needed to know other important things ahead, when the time comes, everything will work perfectly as expected, you will understand who to add and not after you would have been used to some reputable members of the forum you think deserve being on your trust list.",

We write the post and now we have to provide a source which needed to be searched first, and then we realize a couple of members already posted. I have seen some topic in wallet software board and I wanted to write, after finishing the writing, I realized a couple of members already posted before me and the meaning of my post and their is almost similar. Most of the time I do not post them anymore.",
