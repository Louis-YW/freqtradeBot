  "content": "Marathon Digital will use landfill methane to mine Bitcoin in Utah pilot projectThe BTC miner has partnered with startup Nodal Power for a green, off-grid project that is a small start for a potentially big advancement.Marathon Digital has begun mining BitcoinÂ  using power generated from methane gas siphoned off a landfill. The 280-kW off-grid pilot project is operating in Utah.Marathon teamed up with Nodal Power on the project. Nodal Power was launched in November 2022 and produces energy from landfill gas in the southeastern United States and Texas. It raised $13 million in a seed round in August to operate two sites, one of which includes a data center.https://cointelegraph.com/news/marathon-digital-landfill-methane-mine-bitcoin-utah-pilot-projectIs this a working technology or is it a reason to get permission to mine under the pretext of doing useful work by burning methane?",

Methane has a higher impact on the greenhouse effect than if it was burned, which turns it into CO2 and water. The issue with this is that it's very hard to capture methane en masse and therefore it wasn't considered economically feasible to capture methane at large scale for energy production.The other issue is that even if we manage to capture methane and burn it on the spot it would require large upgrades to the electric grid's infrastructure in order for the grid to be able to distribute this power for consumption so we could actually utilize savings. So installing bitcoin mines in places that produce methane sounds like a good idea because the extra monetization acts as good incentive to continue the activity of capturing and burning methane (instead of letting it escape and harm the environment) at times of low electricity demand.

In the US there is a lot more hydro power then can be used in certain areas. And this is the crap part there is not enough power transmission infrastructure to move it to where you would be able to offset coal / oil plants. Being able to generate an extra xxMW of power is great. But if you don't have a way of getting it someplace it's pointless.Back to mining & methane. Yes, burning methane is better then releasing it and if you can set it up near the local landfill (where nobody wants to be anyway) and still make it profitable then why not.But if there is a way to economically feed it back into the grid then that might be a better option. But I can see local power utilities not wanting to have to deal with a bunch of small methane plants for very little upside in terms of additional power.-Dave",

There are a ton of different chemicals in every single plastic thing, some things that would be released in a fire are deadly, we have a ton of them banned in Europe, as the fumes of those things would kill you 100 times faster than the fire itself.",

Plastic Straws, food utensils, and plastic bags usually cannot be recycled again since they are small. Plastic bottles might be recycled. Cardboard/Paper, Glass bottles, aluminum, Steel, and organic materials are recyclable but the only ones left are small plastic and small paper that can be burned and turned into energy. There is no option left I think because burying it needs a massive landfill over time but burning is also a not pretty good solution.Oh and I watch this videos as well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0vvKxKNzo",

At least in Michigan most of the larger landfills are required to have methane capture/monitoring piping already in place so it's a no-brainer for many of them them to use that gas to power turbines to feed a few MW or even 10's of MW into the local grids.edit: turns out that in the US,QuoteThe EPA has established rules which require monitoring and installation of gas collection and control systems if emissions exceed a certain threshold. Thus, many large landfills are legally obligated to capture the gas, but have a variety of opportunities when it comes to how to use it.Gas can be flared (rendering it less potent by conversion to carbon dioxide and water), used directly on site or nearby, or upgraded for sale as renewable natural gas, among other uses, according to the EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP).Electricity generation is the most common use by far: according to the NWRA, 74% of U.S. LFG projects generate electricity. Nationwide, about 2.44 GW of capacity are currently installed, enough to power more than a million homes. Good article about it here.",
