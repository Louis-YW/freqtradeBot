  "content": "Another good news is that Bitcoin is slowly being accepted by most merchants in what is now known as bitcoin Island(Boracay)It's just funny to think that on this occasion one of the well-known influencers in the world of social media platforms tried to challenge this couple that within 24 hrs everything they will buy, and pay is only Bitcoin and not the physical fiat that they have.You can see in the content that they did that they tracked and found the merchants that accept payment with bitcoin. And they survived breakfast, lunch, and dinner.And some of the merchants they have tested and found to accept bitcoin are as follows:1. Accommodation Hotel`2. Transportation3. Variety store4. Coconut vendor5. Corn vendors6. Water Sports7. Barbershop8. MassageThe good thing about what this couple did is that they showed that they didn't take out even 1 peso, except that they only used bitcoin. This is a good point for the country of the Philippines to all the crypto enthusiasts here. And this is showed also that bitcoin is not just an investment form but with this bitcoin island called now became one of the payment options here as well.
