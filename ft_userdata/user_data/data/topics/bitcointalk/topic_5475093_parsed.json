Whenever we're approaching a bear or bull run, there's always some force and events that happens that starts the scene. But on this one, these are seems to be said as manipulations. But for me, these are way normal things being scene on the market just like the old times that when the bull run is about to come, some news explodes be it negative or positive.2) I have already made a decision and that is to jump from one to other and this is the survival kit that you need to stay longer on this market.

But don't look at those, they're just like another factors that will make the bull run because it is still centering to Bitcoin's halving.",

Remember bittrex was once at the top, so the same can happen to the top exchange stoday.Now that the reliability and test of time of exchanges are no longer a yardstick to determine whether we will remain with them or not, it's better now to move from one to another if the need arises. Binance leadership changing hands from CZ to Richard Teng, if their visions don't align or Richard, doesn't bring on board a better innovation, then binance, might just go down. Bittrex, a reliable exchange shutting down doesn't speak good of depending on one exchange, remember the issue with FTX, I think it's better for crypto owners to be very informed about the happenings in the exchange of their choice, so they'll know if it's still safe to remain there.These shakeups in exchanges could be manipulation from governments as is being speculated in some quarters, so they can fully regulate and control the top exchanges. It is still speculations, so the important thing for us is to be vigilant about the exchange that we're using.",

There are lots of possible reason but the clear fact that they wanna control crypto is now crystal clear. Why would SEC want to turn down example such as Binance? Because its an enemy of US market. Surely thry will favor all US exchange only and we knew CZ or Binance is only strong on other countries especially Asia.",

Have you made any decisions regarding your future exchange of choice?Migrating to anothee exchanges does not guarantee success. Exchanges are alway a try and error attempt. which you will never know the next in line. My advice is just to only focus on one CEX. all your Coin should be on a DEX wallet. Whenever you need to sell your coin, you can send an amount you just need to spend to CEX and exchange it rather than hording it in a centralized Exchange because there is a higher risk in CEX than DEX.",

For that they would need to slowly destroy the exchanges which after complying to the government boards are still getting charged hefty fines. After sometime these exchanges would halt operations and then the government would use big financial giants to control the cryptocurrency. What you have said is also correct.

Crypto dudes should stay informed, diversify their holdings, and adapt their strategies based on the evolving landscape. Firstly, I totally agree with your analysis, it is a clear explanation and embodiment of the recent happenings in the CryptoSpace. A deeper analysis is needed indeed to decipher the current happenings.Secondly, the prerequisites you've mentioned for choosing a new crypto exchange are the ideal things to consider. Being in the CryptoSpace which is still a growing sphere, the issue of security and regulation should be taken seriously. Due to non compliance to regulations, exchanges have been shutdown hence the Bittrex issue and a host others.Choosing exchanges now should be a meticulous procedure, since the platform announced closure, I've taken time to thoroughly look at other worthy platforms. With respect to security and regulatory compliance, Platforms like Bitget fit the bill.In a nutshell, I feel the crypto Space will remain in existence no matter, considering how users are inclined to it, I'm optimistic we'll overcome all these.",

Regardless this shouldn't have any impact on Bitcoin or Crypto in general except exchange tokens, it's just a matter of time and few negotiations because out of court settlement is what SEC is currently expecting to fill it's coffer.This shouldn't be impacting price and also the fear will be vanished as the time goes on. But, we need to learn why suddenly they are going behind exchanges? is it because they miserably failed in creating fear which they tried with ads from banks and ATM asking us not to deal with crypto at certain point.",

There are lot of good exchanges these days and having DEXs as well will compete for that. Fear not DEXs are getting lot of improvement and they are getting great everyday.3. We may never know about that but I will be always bullish when it comes to crypto, no ETF or not.",
