  "content": "Hi,I am new to lightning. I just finished installing c-lightning on my full node, but I cannot find any sensible mobile wallet that can connect to it using an onion address? It seems that Zap is defunct according to GitHub, Spark has serious security issues according to the reviews on the Google Play Store, and Zeus does not seem to be in a working state. All the other wallets I have found seem to only support LND? Is there a practical way to use C-Lightning with a phone?Thanks for your help!Assuming that there is working mobile wallet for C-Lightning, how do people use it in practice? Is it through RTL?So initially I thought that wallets could connect directly to CLN, but after coming across RTL, I learned that the CLN's REST API is required. Another possibility would have been through CLN's JSON ROC I assume? RTL uses the REST API to control CLN. My Zeus wallet is now able to connect to the REST API as well.Moderator's note: multiple posts merged",

One reason was the much better performance and efficiency of CLN.",

Quote from: dkbit98 on December 08, 2022, 09:21:12 PMI am not saying Core Lightning is bad but there is much more things built on top of LND at the moment, however you can use anything you like more.Yes; I know. They pushed a lot to get included in platforms like Umbrel to be the default Lightning node and such, but objectively speaking, I find CLN the better software. Besides the little WEF story, they've also actively pushed back against stuff like BOLT12, without a satisfactory response.Quote from: dkbit98 on December 08, 2022, 09:21:12 PMThere are pros and cons for both of them, and Core Lightning is much better if you have low spec hardware for your node.Even with good hardware; if you ran a large node, LND started to get dodgy. When the database got too large (few GB) - no matter if you have terabytes on hand - it slowed the whole node down to a halt. I believe by now, they support different databases, but it was a serious issue even like a year ago.Quote from: dkbit98 on December 07, 2022, 10:34:24 PMQuote from: Jodmapht on December 06, 2022, 05:47:33 PMAll the other wallets I have found seem to only support LND?

And - at least last I checked - CLN was objectively better than LND.Sure, we may not like not everything Blockstream does (similar to Lightning Labs), but the software doesn't have database issues, runs faster, is easier to extend through plugins and the Core Lightning developers don't do weird stuff (unlike LND with its custom / non-spec stuff, stopping BOLTs etc).",

Good that you bring it up again! Maybe we should start making a list.. One more addition from my side is how they opposed (or still do?) https://bolt12.org/ for no comprehensible reason and other (in part privacy-related) protocol suggestions in a similar fashion (which I hinted at earlier). Meanwhile adding custom stuff that is only supported by LND.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 17, 2022, 06:46:33 PMWEF is funding this development for a yet unknown reason. Smells fishy, because they're the same people who encourage on transitioning to CBDC.Are they actually funded by WEF? To my knowledge, they added Lightning Labs to their website, after which LL claimed they've just been 'mentioned' on the website. Later, I figured out that they 'received an award' by the WEF and even did workshops & interviews with Lightning Labs.",

In detail,1. Zeus wallet already mentioned by OP.2. Zap desktop wallet use LND, not C-Lightning. See https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop/blob/master/docs/ADVANCED.md#lightning-network-daemon-lnd.3. BlueWallet use LNDHub, which is wrapper for LND. See https://bluewallet.io/lndhub/.4. Breez wallet also use LND. See https://doc.breez.technology/Overview-for-Developers.html5. Wallet of Satoshi is custodial wallet, so obviously there's no option to connect to your own LN node/server.",
