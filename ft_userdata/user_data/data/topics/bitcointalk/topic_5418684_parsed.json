Almost everything is powered by electricity. Without electricity there would be lack of basic services such as mobile communication, internet, lightening, water, heating, etc. Industries might would produce nothing, which would lead to lack or insufficient supply of food and other consumable. The health sector would be a total mess because electricity is needed to offer medical services. Bitcoin would also be affected because mining would be affected and transactions would be hampered. Just imagine how life would be when the power source of your town is cut off for a whole week and you might get some some answers to your imaginative questions.Quotewhy are the investors of this great technology not celebrated globally in a particular day to mark their great achievement, the date is only set on the 9th of January but the awareness isn’t known by most people. This great achievement by this legends are indeed special and needs more recognition I assume that your question is why are the inventor's of electricity not celebrated. Although there are diverse argument about the discovery of electricity, but it is generally agreed that Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity. Several efforts have been made to immortalize and celebrate his achievement. There is a Benjamin Franklin Medals awarded to people that distinguished themselves in science. A science museum named Franklin Institute was also established to celebrate this great achiever. Public awareness are carried-out mostly by professional bodies and non-governmental organizations. You might not be aware of these programmes except you are a member or connected to them. It is possible that people in the electrical engineering field might be more conversant with this awareness.",

But we will not just settle for a blackout, unless technology goes out with electricity, there will always be alternatives and ways to provide power privately. There are solar panels, generators, wind turbines etc. which can all be easily set up domestically. If all technology becomes fried like we have seen in some movies, then we will pass through a temporary difficult time trying to adjust to it, but we finally will and then the period where we enjoyed electricity will become like a fairytale to those the younger people who did not witness the electricity and technology go out.",

Ironic that some folks in the developed world can have so much food that they eat themselves to death that they rely on the healthcare infrastructure to keep them alive.The only time people do a bit of self reflection is when these luxuries are taken away.",

I know that we would even survive and make an alternative way replacing electricity with other energy. In some places in the third world country, they don't even know what electricity is.Electricity isn't celebrated because not everybody in the world is benefiting from it. Therefore only those benefiting are those that are suppose to celebrate it but it is done not too loud. Only people in that sector celebrates it. Better till OP since you have known the date,it will be unfair for you not to celebrate it.",

They could have destroyed Ukraine long ago. But, they are holding off doing that, so that they don't cause any more loss of life than necessary.Much of Kiev without power and water following latest round of missile strikes from RussiaQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-10-31-kiev-blackout-no-water-attack-russia.html#There is no more electricity or water in many parts of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv following the latest round of Russian airstrikes against the target.We are told that the Russian military launched numerous “successful” strikes on multiple key areas of Kyiv’s vital infrastructure. Here is what Russia’s defense ministry had to say about the hits:“The Russian Armed Forces continued to launch strikes with high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons against Ukrainian military and energy facilities.”Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal later confirmed direct hits on 18 sites across Kyiv, most of which are tied to the nation’s energy supplies. Many Ukrainians are now in a panic as the cold winter season approaches.“The goals of the strikes were successful,” Shmyhal said. “All assigned objects were hit.” (Related: Three months prior to the appearance of “covid,” the U.S. Department of Defense [DoD] awarded a “COVID-19 Research” contract to Ukraine.)“Missiles and drones hit 10 regions where 18 sites were damaged, most of them energy-related. Hundreds of settlements in seven regions of Ukraine were cut off.”Ukraine calls targeted Russian attacks “war crimes”The Ukrainian military says it was able to intercept some projectiles launched over the Lviv region of the country, sparing this western part of Ukraine from similar damage.Reports do indicate, however, that the areas of Cherkasy and Kirovohrad were attacked just like Kyiv was. There are now power outages not just in Kyiv but also in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions.Below is a closer look at what transpired:...",
