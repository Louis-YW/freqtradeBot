  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community member and Bitcoin art collector I am creating bitcoin art since 2017. This artistic journey is going to be a bit different. I'm an artist who deeply values community and people. I've made a conscious decision to embark on a thought-provoking art series. However, I ask that you read everything carefully because my art is all about connecting with the community. That's why this will be a unique collector's edition.With each piece in this series, I want collectors to feel like they're a part of its creation. It's about forging a deeper connection, and each collector will have the opportunity to become a part of the story behind every piece.Nr. 1, Nr. 2, Nr. 3Nr. 4Nr. 5,6,7...Let's dive into this journey, my friends. The core idea behind this artwork series is that collectors who acquire my pieces will have the opportunity to shape them. After purchasing, each collector can reach out to me to request modifications to the artwork - whether it's adding specific elements, lines, symbols, or any creative idea they have in mind. I'll infuse it with my unique artistic style, making each piece truly one-of-a-kind.Every piece of art I create is a window into my life and journey. It's not just art; it's a reflection of my life's experiences. That's why I've decided to make this series more thought-provoking and incorporate the community that has supported me as an artist.For over seven years, these incredible individuals have followed and bolstered my artistic endeavors. As an artist, I want to extend an invitation to collectors to join me on this creative journey, regardless of where you're from. Together, let's make this collector's edition of 12 artworks a piece of history. You'll also have the opportunity to contribute to each upcoming piece. Let's create something truly remarkable together.Artwork Name:\"Guardians of Support\"Availability: \"Guardians of Support\"1. SOLD2. RESERVED3. SOLD 4.

Some people are even dropping a few satoshis on a couple of my artworks just for fun. Because if the owner doesn't destroy the artwork, there's no way to access those bitcoins, which only makes my art more valuable. With NFC, it's easy to check the balance of the artwork.

Let me think on this... Is that hologram from verisart? That's even more amazing, I just noticed it!  Thanks!Yes, this is also a collaboration with Verisart. I did the same thing for the artwork \"BITCOIN ROOTS!\" This method is a high quality way to verify the artwork, and also everything timestamped using Bitcoin blockchain.This works the same way like we I did with \"BITCOIN ROOTS!\" These elements will stay the same until number 12 in the series, making it special for those who collect early, because that's also direct timestamp into the artwork itself, that's makes almost every number in the series unique.People often ask two things about art, what the artist wanted to say and why they made it that way, and how the artwork makes them feel. And that’s very powerful because I’m sharing something special through this artwork. At the same time, with these edits, we create a much deeper connection. For me, it feels like some kind of 5th dimension.",
