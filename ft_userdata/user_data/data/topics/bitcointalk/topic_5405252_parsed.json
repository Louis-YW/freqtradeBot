Also are the Chinese even allowed to trade on Binance considering CZ claims they are taking measures to protect their customers?If nothing else, this is good PR for the company, at least judging by the comments I read from delighted users who expressed their satisfaction because they are safe",

The buyer won't be the only one selling to others, they'll be selling numerous copies I imagine. Much more money in selling to 10 different third parties for 10 BTC, then trying to get 50 BTC from 1, probably a bit easier as well. Then buyers who bought for 10 BTC can try \"launder the data\" and quickly sell to 50 companies for 1 BTC.There's so much money in data these days it's insane. If sold, which it probably will be if legit, it'll get repackaged and resold a hundred times over until it becomes public information.",

It seems that the details of Chinese people has no value! Jokes apart, this is some nonsense ongoing and people with multiple apps on their phone, are more prone to such things. Especially beware from some apps that promises you to give you money on ad clicks. Probably that's how the hacker has done it but it's upto the investigation authorities to find it out. If the hackers receives the ranson, he can simple push the coins through some mixers or from some coinjoin services to hide the trail. It's easy!",

Like in my country, there are certain transactions and registrations you can’t go through with less you present some ID. Mostly bank related transactions and enrolling in some government spearheaded parastatals. Eventually, there could be leaks such as in this case and your compromised already.What is more disturbing about this for those of us that aren’t Asians is the choice of payment being cryptocurrency as this would reflect negatively and the Chinese government is likely to react in ways that would spread FUD coupled with the fact that, we are in a bear market session. What should we be expecting I wonder!",

      "body": "In my own opinion, 10btc is small compared to the number of compromised data. The hacker can use mixing tools around the internet to launder all of that and spread it out to different addresses. I don't know if there's a analytic technology that can counter the mixing tool. There would be a change that the hacker would be caught before the Chinese government pay that hacker. The country where am I living experienced such situation that the registered voters information is leaked, Thankfully the hacker was caught before asking for any ransom or reward, we do have much smaller technology offerings compared to china that's why I think Chinese government will resolve this without paying the demand of the hacker. One awful thing that could possibly happen is if the hacker leaked the database to deepweb, It could greatly affects the victims and the government integrity.",

They are likely looking for any other country who might want access to this data, if it exists, which might be very beneficial to certain intelligence agencies in piecing together information in future. To the average person or company, this information is mostly worthless anyway because it's very hard to make money out of this enclosed ecosystem. If it's real, this person likely has a target on their back from every Chinese police service and will be highly vulnerable to backlash if they are ever identified in future.",

Exactly my thought while reading the op, those who have been FUDing against Bitcoin will definitely use this incident as another thing to base their Fud on, but my joy is that this is not the first, Bitcoin have survived every fud that came its way in the past since its inception, if this turns out to be a source of fud against bitcoin for some persons, Bitcoins will still continue to survive.And for the hacker, I honestly don't think its a good idea if the government decides to pay the hacker 10 bitcoins, like you said, hackers can not be trusted, there is no guarantee anywhere that the hacker would hand over all the record to the government without keeping a copy, if the government goes ahead to pay for it, I think the government should rather look for a way to catch this hacker than succumbing to his or her demands.",

Or maybe the hacker only wants to get a buyer as quick as possible before disappearing?Also, it is interesting he/she  did not ask a coin like Monero as payment, keeping in mind she/he will likely be hunted down by Chinese authorities, one could have guessed opacity would have been a priority.
