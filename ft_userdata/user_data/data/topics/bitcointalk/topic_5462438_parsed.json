(when Satoshi \"moved on\" to other thing)The person is very much alive today and is still working in the technology industry.My question is this.Would you reach out?  What would you say?Thanks in advance.",

And I wouldn't like to blow his covered. So I will approach him and give him a bug hug but won't tell him the reason for the hug or just say \"keep up the good work\".
