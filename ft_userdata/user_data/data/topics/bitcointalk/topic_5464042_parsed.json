The most advanced form of deterministic wallets is the HD wallet defined by the BIP-32 standard. HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of children keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchildren keys, and so on, to an infinite depth. This tree structure is illustrated in Type-2 HD wallet: a tree of keys generated from a single seed.",

The question is, how does this work?Magic  All modern wallets work like that to preserve some privacy with good address management.One seed phrase can generate almost unlimited number of addresses, but you can still use previous address for receiving coins if you are getting regular payments from same source.btw Ledger Live is bad piece software and I wouldn't use it anymore.Quote from: a298b112 on August 21, 2023, 12:37:48 PMI always thought that an address is public key and since I have a private key, I can spend the BTC on that particular address.

As for your wallet generating new addresses for you, using the same addresses too many times gives you away, thus it is not the best thing to do if you are privacy conscious, but you can keep the same address if you wish to do so.",
