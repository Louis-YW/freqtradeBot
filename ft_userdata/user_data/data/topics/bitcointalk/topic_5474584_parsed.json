I knew Bitmart is not a huge exchange but they exist few years ago which means they are not the typical blatant scammer exchange.I’m curious what’s their reason behind their accusations because they will surely hold an evidence before they freeze your account. They probably share you with that when they ask you to deposit that amount. But ofc don’t deposit more because this not the right way on handling money laundering accusations. They can just simply ask for the source of income instead of depositing same amount of money on exchange.",

I guess it is not BitMart. If it is BitMart, then we can ask for the proof. BitMart can not be referred to a small exchange because it is a huge exchange and presently rated the 20th on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchangesBitMart also has a huge 24 hours trading volume.",

This email couldn't be official one. You are using fake/phising exchange or your exchange data ha been leaked. I am using bitmart for two years and doesn't face any issue so far. Could you kindly gives some more details so that we check briefly what is real issue.Kindly update these details:Which app/sites you using for bitmart access?Your withdraw frozen screenshot?Email address you received and also email screenshot if possible? I asked your problem in Bitmart official telegram and admin ask for live chat support",

By the looks of it, you are obviously not dealing with the real BitMart (bitmart.com) exchange, or it's some form of phishing attack. Hold off on any impulsive actions, like sending them money, until you figure out what's going on.Can you share more information, such as a screenshot or the full email message? You can redact sensitive personal information. What exactly is the url address of the exchange in question?",

More importantly, you should share which website you have been using and deposit proof as well. So we may give you a clear idea.",

Through the live chat of the exchange, through mail or through social medias accounts? You should look carefully at the email address which sent that email and check if it's the real one because only scammers would ask money to unfreeze an account, no matter the reason why it has been locked. Many scammers impersonate exchange customer support on social networks, especially on Twitter and Telegram and steal money from desperate users trying to fix their issue.",

That is why BitMart asks you to deposit an equivalent amount to be able to withdraw.Or possibly if you use a bank to deposit maybe the bank made a chargeback?",

And as per trustpilot, https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bitmart.com, they don't have a good review.Just interesting though if you can show us the screenshot of the website so that we can warm others as well.",
