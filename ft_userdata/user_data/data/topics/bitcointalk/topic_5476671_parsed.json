  "content": "I have noticed that most times, we're busy and overwhelmed with a lot of things we have to do. We often have a lot of tasks to perform at work, home, social settings, mentorship and a lot more. Most times, the challenge of getting all these done leads to a burnout and at the end we end up not  being very productive. The fact is that most of us are just busy with Lots of work and never productive.Being productive is all about how much value you were able to add to the system or setting after a period of time, what and what could you deliver?. For example, let's say you've five (5) things to do at the office like attending to 200 mails, contacting some clients, doing some paper works, supervising some junior colleagues and having two scheduled meetings online with your superiors. Its possible to try attending to all at the same time, or jumping from one task to another and when its time to give feedback to your superiors, there's nothing tangible to account and its as though you never attended to any as there was no tangible value added or handed over to the next person despite  all your hard work and stress working for hours.The key to being more productive its breaking down several tasks into little blocks that can deliver a value to the next person or department. Prioritize your tasks and set milestones that must be achieved before moving to the next important task. Do your tasks one after the other in order of their priority in your list. There are tasks that should come before others as finishing them will pass value to the next person or department who will continue from where you stopped and boost overall productivity.The MVP(s)  (minimum valuable product) can help you to think in a more productive manner. MVP its simply to identify the little set of features of a big project that can be delivered to your superiors or inspectors which can satisfy the early consumers/clients/processes within the shortest possible duration. So the little things that can add value should be outlined and concentrated upon.Do things one at a time and always try to finish one task on your priority list before moving to the next. This is the way to delivering value wherever you're and makes you productive instead of just being busy without achieving anything spectacular.We should try at all times think and act in a productive manner as success and positive impact is a measure of your productivity and not just how busy you're.",

Most times, the challenge of getting all these done leads to a burnout and at the end we end up not  being very productive. The fact is that most of us are just busy with Lots of work and never productive.To me the reason why some persons are unproductive is because they don't give in their best in what they do like they don't really care whether it turns out well or not their concerns is just on how the job can be done without checking if the job was done thoroughly. Just like here in bitcointalk forum there are persons who rushes to make comments on posts without checking if they are really passing out an information to the next reader and people that does this most are those of us that are working under a signature campaigns. You will believe with me that some persons here just because they wanna meet up the weekly posts target that will enable them to get paid by the signature they are representing have made most of our members here to care less about making quality and constructive posts all we want is just to rush posting so that the weekly target can be met.For someone to become productive, you need to have an overview of a work you have done like analyze the work and check if there are things you still need to add or corrections you need to make in other to pass a comprehensive information to the next person that is assessing your performance. It is necessary for us to give more value to quality rather than quantity as those are the ways one can become productive and also been seen as a productive person by others because whatever thing you're doing in life, eyes are watching so if you do good they rate you good then if you decide to do bad they will also rate you as a bad and unproductive person.",

You need to still understand that these posts of yours should add value to the forum and not just to complete your posting target. You're trying your best and I commend you because it isn't easy at all. You need to break the total posting down to sections of the day you'll be making them. Like spread it across the day, set alarms to remind you of completing those tasks before you do any pleasurable thing like chatting, going online to watch videos and other things we do for relaxation. I tell you honestly, if you analyze your daily activities and see how much time you waste, you'll be shocked. Try maximizing your time to accommodate your quality activities in the forum. I tell you sincerely, I had that challenge starting up my campaigns cos I wanted to still be making quality post, but target no gree me, I struggled and it made me default in my post count which led to @cryptopreneurbrainboss removing me from his first campaign. I've now spread my posts across my morning and night schedules to be able to meet up and also do quality. Set milestones and achieve them accordingly. That's productivity at its apex.",

This life no be who they busy pass they achieve more. We fit they they do things from morning till night but if we checkout we no achieve something serious. Ah done work for one design company like that. Wey i suppose do case study for their portfolio, my brother i work on one project for complete on month and you say the manager say all those things wey i do no they right because ah no use the right company document use do the thing. Normally e pain me well well because i get to start afresh they do am again.But you know wetting i understand nah miscommunication cause that thing. E they very bad wey be say we wan do something and we no get the right information or direction we fit end u doing wetting they no go accept. This topic done bring us up to the matter of being inquisitive and making more findings on whatever we want to do so that we will do the right thing at the end. Because i know say if we achieve only one thing correctly e better pass 5 things wey no they in line with weting we suppose do.   Having the right information's is necessary for being productive.",

It'll only drain you more time than expected.You cannot be really successful by engaging in many activities at the same time, there's no such thing as jack of all trades and master of all, it's almost not possible, concentrating on many things will lead to loss of dedication to any of them in particular, like you will just be floating on them all. If you try giving your concentration to one in order to maximize your returns there, you might find out that you're immediately distracted by another process, which will lead to abandoning the present task and focusing in another entirely different one and reducing your productivity in the first one. It's high time we know that jacks of all trades are masters of none, you need to just select few careers to concentrate fully on, if not just one and you give it your all and all. You will likely see more positive manifestations in it rather than focusing on many things and being grounded in none.Quote   You can't be productive when you're not majored in something, no one beats about the bush and expects a positive outcome. One should set his compass and walk in the right direction too.It is called specialized knowledge. It is never enough just knowing the surface of a career or business, you need to dive deep, learn the thing as if everything depends on it, become expectational and be able to increase your value in it. Specialized knowledge is not just any type of knowledge, its in-depth and undiluted knowledge about something. let me remind us that a lot of people are into virtually everything we set our mind to do, but the measure of the quality of services delivered differentiates average people from specialists. Strive to be a specialist in your field and the reward will immediately start locating you. one thing you should know again is that you are not paid for what you know, instead you are paid for the value you add with what you know, so the relevance of productivity can never be denied in all reckoning. with specialized knowledge you possess a great value and that value will be rewarded every time you dispense that it on things you handle.",

But since I don realize my mistakes, I don dey focus more energy into very specific activities with the aim of being net productive in those activities in the long run. The issue of busyness vs productivity dey very similar to the talk about person fit wey dey build in silence fit still dey build nonsense. Incase anybody is wondering how I managed to fix my busy vs productivity problem.It's simple. I used the good old pomodoro technique.The time varies as most times I do 60 minutes focused work time and 10 minutes break afterwards. Or 30 minutes in with 10 minutes break. It doesn't really matter as long as you get work done in whatever time period you set. If you do it long enough till it becomes a habit, it's a real gold.",
