No, it is not allowed, even signatures are not dynamic on many browsers and many of them appear broken in some browsers, so you cannot get animated signatures. Absolutely no animation since there is no [img] tags.In the past, BTT was sold some ads space ---> https://bitcointalk.org/ad_design.php , but it stopped now, and therefore there is no way to advertise using animation.",

If you read several posts in this thread, less than 20 because it has only 1 page so far, you would know some factsAnimated avatars were allowed but disabled years ago. Because forum members saw animated avatars are annoying and the core admin (theymos) had the same opinion. He stepped in and code to detect all animated images for avatars and reject such images when people try to upload for their avatars. Only grandfather members still have animated avatars today. But if they take their avatars off, and upload same images again, forum will reject it.Animated signatures would be more annoying than avatars so no chance to see allowance for it.If you are curious, this one is for you.Quote from: yahoo62278 on November 04, 2019, 06:40:31 PMAvatar space is not negotiable as I lose my animated avatar if I remove it.",
