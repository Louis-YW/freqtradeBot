      "body": "Are you talking about not having money or not wanting to risk any? Either way, you could start looking at faucets and other ways to make small amounts of money to invest (but they might not be/feel that worthwhile). Most giveaways large crypto companies do normally expect a deposit so those might be a bad starting point but maybe something to look into in case there are some that give a few $ just for signing up.It's probably better off to start in crypto without investing anything as you're less likely to fall for scams and can also learn about what you're actually doing before/if you invest more.",

That reminds me of some sites that more or less lead you to believing you are earning free BTC, but then when you want to retrieve the funds, oh surprise, you’re asked to send them some BTC in order to be able to withdraw, with one pretext or another. Obviously you eventually end up not being able to withdraw (aka scam).In any case, it may be better if you provide an example of what companies you are talking about. Note that, if you provide a link to a site, since it may be of a dubious nature, it may be best to make sure it’s not clickable (i.e. place it inside a BBS code structure, or replace the dots and colons for something else).",

In fact, you will have two options for how to acquire a desirable asset. You either earn it directly from investing in mining hardware or indirectly, which will involve economic interactions with other people making offers in bitcoin. Even if you find a resource that offers something \"for free,\" you will still, at best, be exchanging your precious time and effort for this almost free, rotten cheese. Do not fall victim to mousetrap like that, train your skills instead and learn how to transform honest work and time into something equally valuable.",

That sounds new to me or it's just another term of those people that have said it to you or that you've read for the term bot in trading. Well, actually, it's possible to really earn even if you don't have capital but you have to remember that nothing comes free now in the market unless you're willing to trade for something and it's like trading your service for crypto. And once you're all set and you have money now, that's where you're going to start either in trading or investing.",

You use some expressions that are not common in this area. You mentioned \"zero wallet account\", \"zero robot account\", \"audio money\", ... What is that exactly? Bitcoin is not \"audio money\" but electronic money or digital money. One of the easiest ways to get bitcoins into your wallet is to buy them at one of the online exchanges. Just like buying foreign currency, you exchange your fiat currency for bitcoin.",
