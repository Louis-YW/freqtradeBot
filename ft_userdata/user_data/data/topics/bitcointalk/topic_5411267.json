Both the two can be changed but you need to be careful because any loss of access to either you new mail or password will render your account under serious danger, as you may not be able to recover your bitcointalk account when new device is used, you also need to be aware of mail phishing malwares that intends in stealing user's data, it will do good if you avoid any irrelevant links to your mail address and downloads, many newbies have benn hacked through related matters, and if you must change your email and password, then make it confidential.",

You just need to visit Account Related Settings and there you will have option to put a new email and then click on Change Profile option.Its very simple as I said.",

If you want to ask about changing your username then it is possible when theymos approved your request to change your username but theymos rarely approved such requests. There are forum users who changed their email addresses on Bitcointalk and you can change it anytime you want but changing email address many times will also bring negative side which many people will think that the account is sold or hacked.",

Is this possible or only passwords for account can be changed after?. Both password and email can be change. You can do it through visiting your account related settings on the profile tab. Before you proceed to change your email, I think you must be aware that your account will have be noted/tagged as \"user's email recently changed\" something like that, I believe this is just for memo purposes. But nothing is wrong with it.",

AFAIK, this is not correct. You only need the correct password to be able to change the email linked to the account.A notification email would be sent to the initial email used to open the account, but that is not about a code to \"confirm the change\", it's a security measures with a link to lock the account, if there was a hack.",

Before you have changed password then you change the email address. Then if you have any problem you can ask anything and solve your query",
