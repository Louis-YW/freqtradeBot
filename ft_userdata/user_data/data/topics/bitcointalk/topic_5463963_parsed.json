You can minimise the screen for each pair and you can monitor them. I hope that is what you are referring to because I do that myself if I don't want to close a chart totally.",

I tried searching for it again just to put it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EFXviQJPWwI'm hoping one day a crypto exchange will really be using this to integrate cryptocurrencies but so far I can only see BTC. With it though you can see 1hr-4hr chart, daily, weekly and monthly at the same time which is quite helpful in 3 ducks trading system.Metatrader can display 4 charts at once but it will be smaller especially if you have a small screen monitor.  What people may suggest is to buy VGA splitter and connect 2 monitors to your computer so you'll literally have two screens.",

Multiple charts is best only for using one pair with multiple timeframe.Having multiple charts on the screen looks fantasy but it is not advisable for traders and if you are an amateur trader, it is not recommendable.Because looking at a chart too often is not good, it will affect your emotion that is a biggest enemy with a trader. Now, you are doing it with multiple charts on the screen, imagine how your emotion will change quickly but dramatically with many charts and many different price movements.QuoteHowever, this idea is not advisable for beginners in trading especially if you only have a small funds.

Trading is not for them and the more indicators, more charts they use on the screen, the more likelihood they will make bad trading orders.",

So in the same time, I can assess prie action in high time fram in lower time frame. The problem is in subscription or in premium plan.What I do in my own experience is I download Vivaldi brwoser paltform, there I open my trading view. In that way I can organize my charts in many tabs and different places I want. Sometime, the delvery of price action is better on MT4, so I also watch it in there.",

Also, you can hide or modify each and every tab. The best advice is to have multiple screen. One for trading, one for chart and one for analysis. This will give you the best multitasking experience. You can focus on the thing that is important, and you can put others to the side which are less important. And if you really are limited to only one screen, the first option is better, I think. Being able to manage it manually will give much freedom and flow to the work.I don't like being stuck to the limit of platforms. Modify according to your preference and it will be much interesting.",

Most of the time people who use the multi-chart trading view trade in a shorter time frame.Besides that, I think most of my fellows already answered the Op with better suggestions. I would recommend TradingView for that and Binance also offers the advanced Trading View interface as well as Kraken.",

It is no longer difficult to monitor all crypto assets and create portfolios, monitoring in one screen with price comparisons on each exchange.Not only that, it comes with the latest crypto news which helps in Fundamental monitoring. And it's also available as a mobile app so it's multi-platform. I would say this is the complete package I found and you gave a good recommendation. But about coupling EXchange with Cryptowatch, I haven't done it yet because this is my first experience and whether or not it is safe to connect to my personal exchange.",

I think it's quite important to end up with a situation where it's not going to end up being that easy, there will be trouble here and there and we should be more careful about it without a trouble. I know that it's not that easy and we are not going to end up with a big deal just yet but we should be careful about it no matter what.I understand that some situations requires you to have multiple screens but most situations do not have that. I think it should be important to remember that multiple charts on the same screen means that you are doing some advanced stuff and if you are not there yet, then you shouldn't do it.",
