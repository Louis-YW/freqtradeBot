Where is the proof you have been trading for 1 year? . We can't believe with your words, especially someone got scammed by them.

They are not afraid whatever happens to their accounts because they can always create another one. The exchange had a review campaign and maybe that was the purpose on why you and other newbies are here in the thread to give a positive statement?But, I think a legit review campaign should also compose of negative feedback. Sure there are some negative feedbacks here but that only came from higher rank members and I do not think they are participating on the same promotion. I noticed that the op do also get a negative feedback. This isn't good.",
