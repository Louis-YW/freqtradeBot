Like Jawhead999 said, this will no longer happen to you as you rank up on this forum.@Asta124, you have gotten the answer to the question that you asked, it would be better if you lock this topic to avoid other people to be posting the same thing that has already been answered. To lock a topic, go down this thread, you will see lock topic at the left side. Lock it.Edit: Quote from: Asta124 on September 17, 2023, 02:30:58 PMYou can see that I attached 2 links, and only the one from CNBC was removed which is strange.

Even though Zenp has mentioned that mistake, I would like to add that link again (the real link) which is here:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/survey-finds-one-third-of-crypto-buyers-dont-know-what-theyre-doing.htmlThe problem is when I quoted the post of the OP that he referred to. I found out that some suspicious tag was written on it. IDK (I Don't know) why. Maybe, it was tagged by some moderators as they can edit your post but will not do so until they have a valid reason. Let's see after posting the reply, whether my link works or not. And OP please confirm that isn't the same link that you tried to post there. Edit: I just noticed that, in the above picture, there is \"zenp\" (who is the first poster of this thread) is written when I quote the post of the Asta124. Why the username of zenp is there?",
