  "content": "Disclaimer: this topic serves as a reference for my neutral feedback on mr.relax, since trust ratings have limited spaceIn the German section, mr.relax has pushed multiple times the wrong claim, that \"trading by technical analysis is a reliable source of income (if done \"right\")\". His strategy to \"prove\" his claim, is to make multiple, often contradicting predictions multiple times a week and after one of them is happening, he's pointing out that he was right and technical analysis would be a working \"strategy\". Here's an example for this: On September 8, he made a prediction that it's a general trend to trade the Merge (from Ethereum) to increase sats while prices should increase due to the merge and the fork (I don't disagree here but it's still highly risky. He then continued, that his technical analysis is suggesting that it's a good idea to speculate to sell ETH for BTC short-term. The price of ETH compared to BTC than dropped for the next day.  After being right for this prediction (he's making multiple predictions every week) he pointed out afterwards, on September 9, after BTC gained compared to ETH that he was right about this signal and therefore, (his misleading conclusion) that technical analysis would be a reliable way to be better than HODL. We all know that his prediction was pure luck and by picking that one afterwards, he's brazenly misleading readers, especially Newbies. And another example from his misleading strategy by making multiple, contradicting predictions (translated): Quote from: mr.relax on September 07, 2022, 06:33:48 AM At the moment you could bet on the technical setback with betting long in the short term, but that's too risky for me.   The general trend has been declining on a large scale since December, and in the medium term since mid-August.  To bet against these trends in the short term means increased risk , even if the possible reward would not be bad at the moment.   The next mark that should not be lower from a bull's point of view is the low of June 18 at 17613.  I still see the price trend until December falling.   But because we are already close to the presumed ground for the long term - and never catch it exactly anyway - you could get in.   But I prefer to wait until a clear reversal trend is confirmed. Quote from: mr.relax on September 07, 2022, 06:33:48 AMMomentan könnte man kurzfristig auf die technische Gegenreaktion mit einem Long setzen, mir ist das aber zu riskant.Der generelle Trend großflächig geht seit Dezember runter, mittelfristig seit mitte August.Gegen diese Trends kurzfristig zu setzen, bedeutet erhöhtes Risiko-auch wenn der mögliche Reward momentan gar nicht schlecht wäre.Die nächste Marke, die aus Bullensicht nicht unterschritten werden sollte, ist das Tief vom 18.Juni bei 17613.Kurstendenz bis Dezember sehe ich immer noch fallend.Weil wir aber für Langfristige schon nahe am vermuteten Boden sind-und den sowieso nie genau erwischen-könnte man einsteigen.Ich warte aber lieber noch bis sich ein deutlicher Umkehrtrend bestätigt.The problem of mr.relax' predictions is not the prediction itself (that's completely fine), but that he's saying, technical analysis is a \"reliable way\" of increasing profit. He's pushing this nonsense claims every day. The problem of his \"trading shilling\" is that he doesn't reflect on his wrong claims about trading and his misleading way of presenting how he was \"right\" an therefore pointing out that technical analysis is \"proven\". Quote from: mr.relax on September 10, 2022, 06:55:35 AMAll of that (my prediction) is based only on technical analysis, that's not from fundamental analysis or the MergeQuote from: mr.relax on September 10, 2022, 06:55:35 AMDas ganze beruht nur auf TA, und hat nichts mit Fundamentalanalyse und Merge.That's just a wrong statement and highly misleading to Newbies because technical analysis of the charts is pseudo-science: While most people know that trading is high risk because (not) surprisingly, there are no billionaires from technical analysis or there are no bots which can trade reliably according to technical analysis, mr.relax is still insisting on it. After being called out on this, he's now attacking me personally because I have called out his strategy as presented above.  The claims of mr.relax are openly misleading to Newbies and luring them into risky trades. Therefore, I have sent a neutral feedback to mr.relax to make aware of this fact. Please take the statements about trading from mr.relax with caution!",

Have you ever seen any of these guru to market the trade that was failed? They always market the ones that won. It's their marketing technique. And I doubt any of those traders actually make money from their trading. Increasing followers, making a name for them is their business. It eventually help them to earn their revenue buy selling advertising, BS course they make, BS PDF they make etc.If I have good winning rate and am able to make constant money from my trades then why don't I compound my money from it without letting the the world to know my secret. Why would I spend few days to produce a video, hire a team, invest money to build up a channel or a community in any platform? There are no secret. If there are any secret then it's the product they are selling. Other day I reached out to a YouTube channel for a 30 second video promotion and their demand was $25k for it LOL. They make you feel they are angels in the crypto industry but they are just looking after their own pocket. Tomorrow when something else which is more lucrative then Crypto they will just dive into there.Anyway, I do not think mr.relax is doing something wrong. He is promoting a business idea that he has so that he can benefit from it. May be you are overlooking his idea.   Quote from: 1miau on September 11, 2022, 04:32:33 PMPlease take the statements about trading from mr.relax with caution! Trading with statements by any technical analysis guru who have massive followers in YouTube and other social media or selling the analysis with a price should be taken with caution.

I did it though, as I believe that anybody trading with this person is at high risk of being scammed.Since I'm always trying to solve such issues with exposing the fallacies (and hoping that maybe some sort of review process starts from their side), getting a separate topic in Reputation requires extraordinary written bullshit. But pushing the same bullshit day after day, again and again, while the strategy is getting more insane everyday, because he has no arguments left for his misleading \"TA shill show\" is crossing the line. The same wrong statements were already exposed by qwk way sooner and still, mr.relax is repeating his same, disproven claims from that post some days later. You really can't make that up.  Feel free to translate the whole story, it's so tiresome...Some time ago, I've even created a Meme about trade risks to expose his fallacies: Quote from: 1miau on September 09, 2022, 10:24:41 PMQuote from: mr.relax on September 09, 2022, 08:08:02 AMAs said before, for BTC/USD since 2017, the result (from trading) is approx. 3-7 times better than HODL BTCIt's nice, that you have been that lucky that far.    While scrolling, I've found that bullshit from him, where he was implicating that Hodling is similar to a pyramid scheme (German: Schneeballsystem). What?   I'm always hoping to initiate some sort of review-process but very often, time for betterment is wasted, indeed.  Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on September 13, 2022, 03:40:12 PMI think that 1miau was too gentle, by not giving this guy a negative feedback. I did it though, as I believe that anybody trading with this person is at high risk of being scammed.He isn't offering a service or similar, that's why I've left a neutral feedback with a detailed explanation about his misleading statements. It's dangerous for Newbies to believe his repeatedly posted claims about trading. While his claims are wrong and misleading, he didn't scam anyone so far.

It's a pity that nobody had this idea before him.Actually, you'll be surprised, but Romanian board is full of \"tech savvy\" users (/s). I am not sure if you are aware of bekli23's case, another illiterate (he was even more illiterate than andulolika or hacker-millions-of-zeroes-and-ones), which claimed he can decrypt any Bitcoin wallet. As you can see in the second post of this linked topic, bekli later said that he even moved those unmovable 50 BTC from Bitcoin's genesis block (however, for some reasons, he \"moved the funds offline\", whatever he meant by that). Later on, he created even a topic where he tried to convince mocacinno that he can obtain the private keys of all BTC addresses.While mocacinno was somehow reluctant, NeuroticFish was more supportive, though Quote from: NeuroticFish on April 01, 2020, 07:52:53 AMQuote from: bekli23 on April 01, 2020, 06:53:43 AMmy address was not foundAnsweryou will still have to wait for the database update, as I said every day, new addresses are generated.OP is 100% correct. The only problem is that we just simply cannot live that long.

I am sure that 99% of these forecasts will not match.Yes, and even a single one is difficult to predict, see recent giveaways. In general, I would expect that a bet on rising BTC is more likely but that's based on Bitcoin's fundamental characteristics (Halving, limited supply, more adoption) and not on TA. Still, some people think TA is reliable and suprisingly, all these professional traders are frequently offering tutorials / courses \"How to become a succesful trader\" and I don't know why these traders are not just trading, getting rich and buying a Lambo when they have the knowledge.  Quote from: DaveF on September 17, 2022, 01:40:12 PM<shrug>I know I have said it many times, but once more with. \"You can't fix stupid\"It's not a surprise.
