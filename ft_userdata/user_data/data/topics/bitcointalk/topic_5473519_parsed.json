We are not in 2009. We are in 2023 and a lot of things have changed since then.Yes, a lot has changed now. Among all projects, 70% offer to buy their unnecessary shitcoins, 20% are aimed at a few days of existence for a pump&sale cycle, 9% slip malware into their wallets. Don't be surprised by the lack of confidence in your project.@miningrelease",

This procedure is free of charge there. This will be at least a plus for your project. And when you have complete information about your coin there, you can post a link to your coin on CoinGecko.",

So, you should try contacting them first.Just for your information, I’m not new in cryptos. I work in cryptos since 2012 and I have participated in many projects. As project manager, marketing manager, project owner etc. Listings are not free. Yes they claim in their websites that listings are free but this is not true. They don’t list you if you don’t find an unofficial listed to pay him and list your coin/token. Maybe they can list a project for free if it has really big liquidity and volume. The last weeks, CMC has changed their listing terms and now they write that listings cost $5,000!You didn't answer my question. Did you try to apply and was rejected? Or did they require you to pay a fee to list your coin with them? It doesn't say anything on their website about requiring large liquidity and volume in an asset. About CMC, I know that.",

You are very funny, really. I'm laughing.I understand that you are a crook who uses the legendary name Satoshi Nakamoto to promote your coin. But for a beginner who is not yet familiar with the history of the creation of Bitcoin, such statements can be misleading and he may really think that this shit coin is really the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto, especially since the name of the coin confirms this.https://web.archive.org/web/20231124205113/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473519.0",
