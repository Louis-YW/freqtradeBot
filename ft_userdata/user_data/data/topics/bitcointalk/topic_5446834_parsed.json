  "content": "Historical backgroundManufactured in the USA by legendary GekkoScience (Sidehack). Currently the most efficient USB miner ever manufactured. The NEWPAC Compac features 2 Bitmain BM1387 chips (this is the same chip as in the Bitmain S5). The stock clock setting is 100MHz for 23GH. The possible frequency values range from 100MHz to 600MHz, which generates speeds from 23GH to 130GH. Please make sure you provide extra cooling (table fan, usb fan, etc) when running the miner because these can get very hot (especially when running over 100 MHz frequency)Features & detailsStock hashing speed: 23 GH.High Speed: 90 GH+ (Higher speed requires usb port above spec)Completely silent operation, requires a powered usb hub (10 watts per miner per port) to run.2 x Bitmain BM1387 chips.Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux OS using cgminer software.https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-opera-mini-android&q=Gekko+Science+features&oq=Gekko+Science+features&aqs=heirloom-srp..",

      "body": "Merits given for perhaps starting a nice historical thread.It should also be pointed out that a Compac-F found a block last year despite the pretty high diff at that time.  Wonder if any other USB sticks have ever found one?My intro to Gekko products was the IBM 2kw psu breakout boards and some mighty fine PCIe cables. Those were s5's running in the back, I had 10 of `em, technically 12 because still have 2 of the water cooled C1 version. Long long ago I donated all but 1 of the s5's to Sidehack to use their chips in his early Compacs",

      "body": "Personally - I'm a huge fan of GekkoScience. I had several S9i's once upon a time - but when i moved, i lost the storage unit in the basement i used to house my miners (it was very cold down there and the floor upstairs worked very well for isolating sound). When I moved, no more basement - so I started looking for something quiet, effecient, and something that would not turn my new apartment into a sauna and all signs pointed towards Gekko. Very unique, innovative, well thought out/engineered, reliable products. Very much appreciate the time, effort, and thoughtfulness Sidehack puts into his products!",

No difference between the OS, hardware is the exact same in my case.I think what you are mentionning, regarding to gekkos, is more a question related to your CPU than your OS. IMO Linux will be ok in any case, always better than with Windows for example, more stable, more safe in many aspects.You can save some (very few) electricity if you run a Ubuntu/Debian server without a monitor via ssh, or at least from TTY. I would not chose MacOS or Windows because of the updates and random reboots.",

      "body": "I do not believe all Linux systems are equally fast and reliable.After 30 years buying homes and Porsches with money I made servicing DOS and Windows customers, first in the early days of migrating mainframe-bound corps onto Novell networked PCs running DOS-based custom-coded accounting systems I wrote, then later, giving them GUI based systems, AND owning computer sales and service stores, it was always my hope&prayer Microsoft would produce just ONE operating system release that wasn't a crash-and-burn/blue-screen/lost-data/pissed-customer disaster. Windows 2000 was the only one a few mags suggested to be as reliable as a clunky UNIX system, but critical-operation clients like hospitals and a nuclear power plant required I build recovery processes in for daily disasters like frozen screens and some secretary calling me in tears. Finally, in 2010 I watched a long painful recovery/rebuild/reinstall of a Windows system crash and burn the next day (possibly a virus) and I said F-IT I can't keep recommending anyone use this half-baked junk and had better dust off my Unix/Mainframe skills and learn how to work w/ Linux, code, compile and configure for Linux, and deliver systems that don't crash.My criteria for \"a distro\" was a) reliability across a wide range of memory and CPUs b) speed  crunching large files c) availability of office apps (I don't want to have to code a damn word processor eh?) d) availability of multi-media apps like sound and video editors and e) ability to run some Windows/DOS programs without rebooting, which WINE and QEMU did, since a few of my early clients were addicted to DOS and Win 3.11 programs I had made for their biz.So I tested about 20 distros out of over 200 I found, ran speed tests, reliability, app availability etc. and finally figured I'd have to build one - and built two - which have served me well for 15 years...I do not believe all Linux systems are equally fast and reliable (I better put that sentence at the top).Yes, a few are almost as fast as what I built but none have that benefit AND are halfway easy to use AND can serve as an office environment desktop and boot easily from a USB, though that is more common now.Turning this learning process towards mining, I read the OS-BOUND CPU isn't really the bottleneck in the mining, so perhaps there's no difference in speed between a Windows/Linux/fast Linux system since the whole idea of mining moves the burden of calculating off to daughter-board chips, Since I am a total newbie to this world I can't say a screaming fast motherboard CPU and OS is going to make much if any difference, but as I get more experience I will (maybe) find out.Perhaps a plug-and-play LINUX distro built for mining is in the cards. But what I do know is the students (and a couple of clients) asked so I stumbled in here with a kinderkid's knowledge base to figure out what kind of hardware config to try first and liked Sidehacks USB approach and the \"theoretical\" possibility you can build a system off an old Atom motherboard using 10 - 25 watts in a little MINI-ITX case with some USB dongles and poof! A child can mine.That vision kind of evaporated when I saw the heat sinks Sidehack has on their products and I'll guess overall wattage is going to be smoking hot. I read somewhere people use mining rigs to heat their homes which leads this newbie talk to the subject of zero-cost electricity designs along with questions I have about pooled vs solo mining which I best save for another post.",
