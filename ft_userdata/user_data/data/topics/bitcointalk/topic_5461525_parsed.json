      "body": "So far as I know the oil goes to India and China which are quite large enough to use it all in theory.  Its only the logistics restricting their consumption really and the ability to buy through clearing not subject to sanctions.   UK is importing oil from Norway last I checked and would be in trouble if not for that quite local support from a small but friendly nation.   UK used its reserves mostly and is not searching to develop more, long term even Russia has a problem with developing its resources properly and efficiently.       The reason I say India is because they have only found a small amount of oil in a large expanse and populated nation.  Also India has a policy to import raw crude and make a business from refinement, in fact Indian companies bought UK assets to do so there also but India has a more friendly policy to Russia then many nations I suppose for long term reasons.    UK has literally suffered nerve agent attacks on its mainland from Russian agents, it would be surprising if they ignore all the possible avenues of oil from allies and then transported from so far away.  Anything is possible but sometimes improbable is your best guidance.    Russia might have already failed in its war generally if they had sold no goods outside its borders however they do find markets imo its on its borders mostly.",

But if the EU countries did not quietly or seek to buy Russian oil and gas through intermediaries, they would not exist today. All will be for their money and survival, but these things we will not see much in the media. War will continue until there is a loser, but commercial transactions between nations will never end under any circumstances caused by war.",

Despite this, the sanctions are slowly and steadily eating away at the Russian economy like rust.Sanctioned goods tend to rise in price initially because any such event causes panic in the market. The price of grain has also risen because Russia, after withdrawing from the grain agreement on July 17, began to deliberately launch missile and other attacks on the ports of Ukraine, destroying grain storage facilities as well. This causes a stir and additional panic.",

At first oil was shipped to Baltic ports, there tankers of the terrorist country transferred their oil into other tankers, which were partially filled, for example, with European oil...Voila - it is no longer Urals, but.... well, something else.And it was on its way to the nearest ports for sale.This \"trickery\" was quickly unraveled, and deprived of support (insurance, Britain is the main provider of the service) all tankers that play not according to the rules. Russia began to panic to buy back old tankers and create a \"shadow fleet\" of tankers. But. The nuance is that these rusty troughs cannot sail far and are not accepted by EU ports. And they all sailed to places - where they don't care about risks and ecology - China and India. And they have been buying it back for pennies for many months now.....",

According to the \"forge of lies\" - Russian official channels - oil sales have not fallen, prices have even increased...but the budget does not receive more than 50% of oil revenues, compared to the previous period. Question : 2+2 = 1,5 ? And it is very easy to understand why. India and China, very cleverly, and for their own benefit manipulate Russia and its oil market. Yes, prices are announced at 60 and even higher. But there is a nuance:- a high declared price is an excuse to fool their population into buying cheap gasoline (as they do in India).- A high declared price in DOLLARS, a small manipulation turns into.... half of this money gets stuck in India (friendship - what do you want !?  ). The rest - lies dead weight in Russia, as India does not sell dollars or critical goods for rupees )- Also, China's purchase - the price is announced, but in the end - a pile of wrappers (yuan) in Russia and .... ALL, no more revenues, just phantoms and commodities for pennies, which neither Indians nor Chinese want to buy",

And because of the war, Russia is selling its product at discounts so most countries are attracted to Russia's oil and gas. This war in Ukraine has thought me that every nation should seek peace with other nations because war is unpredictable. And relying on allies for assistance during conflict might be a big mistake because most of them have limitations, hence they can disappoint.If you don't blame them and know that the national interest must come first, you should not call them hypocrites, because they only do what is beneficial to the country and that is their responsibility. Although they are supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, they cannot leave their people alone for the sake of outsiders. It is citizens who are the main factor determining the survival of European nations, not Ukraine's victory over Russia more important. I don't support Europe for their continued support of war weapons but I wouldn't be surprised and support them if they buy Russian oil in any way.Yes, yes, yes, the voice of reason, finally! Would you give your neighbor, whose house is on fire, some water, knowing that your children are thirsty? Probably no, that's brutal truth. Strong national governments take care of their people and won't send more aid than they can afford. Weak, artificially installed (and remotely governed from the other side of the pond) governments spend billions on Ukraine and neglect their own people.",
