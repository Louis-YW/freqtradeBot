They lowered difficulty for no reason. They forced big blocks (by rejecting a block smaller than 1 MB at a certain height). They splitted hashrate (instead of using Merged Mining, and tracing the heaviest chain, if needed). They created replay protection, and they used incompatible sighashes (it was possible to split coins without such hard changes, purely on coinbase level, if someone needs that; also replay protection should not be forced, but fully optional: if someone wants to move coins on both chains, it should be possible with the same transaction).Quotewhat about embedding solidity scripts?Technically, you can do that. Even more: you can go far beyond that. I think we are lucky that most people don't know, how many things are possible, because then you would see much more congested mempool than you saw in the last weeks. Of course, it is possible that someone will misuse Bitcoin again, and will release something again, that will cause another wave of transactions.

      "body": "QuoteIf there is a better solution, then people will use it.The word \"better\" is subjective in this case. When Ordinals were created, there were some proposals, how to do the same thing in a different way. But people didn't want to use those alternatives, because their goal is not to have \"NFT on Bitcoin\" or \"Turing-complete contracts on Bitcoin\". People wanted \"cloud storage on Bitcoin\", so the whole concept of transferring value was implemented in a way, where ownership is not forced at all.Also note that nobody wanted to go through the whole soft-fork process to actually enforce things on-chain. People were interested only in storing things, not enforcing them. They don't care that full nodes don't follow the rules of their protocols. Not to mention that many such inventions didn't touch even testnet3, because if they would, then they could see how zero satoshi outputs could break their code. Another thing is that non-standard transactions are easier to perform on testnet3, so it is easier to test edge cases.QuotePerhaps the issue now is that there is currently no better solution.1. Sidechains: you can make a separate chain, then you are no longer limited by \"4 MB blocks\", so you can execute more things than on Bitcoin.2. Lightning Network: there are use cases, where you don't need a chain, you can have nodes that can execute many contracts completely off-chain, and only enforce the final result on-chain.3. BIP-322: you can sign any scripts off-chain, and many times by sharing a signature, you can reach the same effect: proving that some data is connected with some on-chain output.4. Commitments: you don't have to push data on-chain, many times you need to show that you created it, and connected with some address. It is also censorship-resistant, because you commit first, and reveal later, after reaching many confirmations. But it seems that some people want cloud storage more than censorship-resistance.5. Signet: if some altcoin is a federation, then it can be easily implemented as a signet. More than that: it is possible to create 1:1 peg with Bitcoin, because there are existing sidechains like Liquid or RSK.6. Torrents: if you need P2P storage, then you can use existing solutions, and even no blockchain is needed to share your files in a P2P way.So, there are many different solutions. However, note that the main goal is not to bring new features, but to get some attention, and then people skip testnet3, skip sidechains, and skip a lot of alternatives, because they want to put their things on-chain, so everyone will drop other topics and focus on their products.Another thing is if you create a new protocol, and you don't touch consensus to enforce that, then is it really better? Because I think if you have some altcoin, then at least those altcoin nodes can enforce your rules. But here, nobody enforces them, they are just huge OP_NOPs, and it is an accident waiting to happen, when some Bitcoin user will make a valid Bitcoin transaction, that will break some altcoin, because nobody thought about enforcing things properly.",

Opinions?The idea of embedding Solidity scripts directly into Bitcoin's witness data is intriguing, but it is important to analyze the consequences and practicality of such an approach. The scripting language used by Bitcoin is based on a stack-based language that differs from Solidity, the programming language used in Ethereum smart contracts. Embedding Solidity scripts would require considerable changes to the Bitcoin protocol and difficulty in obtaining consensus among network members. Additionally, Bitcoin was created with simplicity and security in mind, so introducing more extensive scripting capabilities may increase the attack surface and potentially jeopardize Bitcoin network security.
