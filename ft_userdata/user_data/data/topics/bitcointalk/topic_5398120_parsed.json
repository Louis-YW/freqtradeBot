  "content": "Come to Earn While Having Fun in PUGG Metaverse With Its Free-to-play and Easy-to-earn Mode! (Part 2)In the article of part 1, we have reviewed the main development stage of blockchain, including the stage of Token, NFT, Game and Social in sequence. The gradual evolution of blockchain also heralds the maturation of the metaverse concept. Currently, many technology companies such as Meta, NVIDIA, Alibaba are all making a series of arrangements for metaverse technology application and metaverse ecosystem. PUGG has also joined the metaverse rank early with its long-term vision and advanced game development technology.For DeFi and NFT, PUGG has improved and innovated their market transaction methods from the first step of making up for market shortcomings as mentioned in part 1. For example, PUGG has set unique invitation reward rules which allow players to get stable and unlimited passive mining income according to the output of their invitees in a long term, and its visualized NFT cross-chain transactions can greatly increase the market liquidity of high-quality NFTs.At the same time, while PUGG innovates the DeFi ecosystem and helps players get long-term benefits, it has also taken into account the fun and scalability of GameFi. The PUGG game part is developed by Metaborder, who developed Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed (and is one of the core suppliers of Microsoft Corporation Xbox and Japan’s Sony PSP). After one-year game development, the game on PC can have 4K~8K ultra-high-definition graphic quality with supported hardware as it uses the world's leading UE4 (Unreal Engine 4) technology. It has advantages including but not limited to excellent light pursuit and granularity and the ability of avoiding smear and frame drop. Thus it will bring totally new visual experience to players.PUGG has also made a series of pioneering design for the metaverse crypto pan-entertainment besides the achievements of the underlying technology of its game. In the game, users are allowed to get mining rewards by riding cycles, and they can have a date in the bar while they are doing NFT visualized transactions. After the game modes of Player vs. System, Player vs. Player and Team vs. Team are gradually launched in the near future, users will also be allowed to participate in more game projects with more fun and more challenges and experience more in the metaverse ecosystem in those modes... Many game projects such as inter-planet jump, creation of creator planet (task announcements) and the planet for athletics and competition have potential of combining earning with having fun.In addition to the horizontal expansion of the entertainment field, the in-depth upgrades are also in progress. First, the mission game (PVE) and the battle mode (PVP) will be launched. Secondly, new infrastructure will be built based on the original blocks. Thirdly, the mission game will be combined ingeniously with the battle mode based on DAO governance and they will open for a certain period of time according to the player's area. These upgrades will not only make the game experience richer but also make the overall layout of the game layered more. More importantly, no matter which field or stage it is in, a large number of rich bonuses and rewards will be available at the same time. Players can truly use their time to get fun and money when exploring more possibilities of the PUGG metaverse entertainment field, and the ecosystem will manage to have sustainable development.After talking about DeFi, NFT and the metaverse pan-entertainment based on GameFi, let’s return to discuss Social, the fourth stage of blockchain development mentioned in the article of part 1. Of course, Social is no longer the original simple Social as it is applied to the blockchain in the DeFi ecosystem but has become a decentralized SocialFi with crypto features.As we know, the Game naturally includes socializing, and so does the GameFi. What PUGG is doing is to make the social functions of its game get larger and larger and extend more and more... For the application of SocialFi, please refer to our previous article \"On How PUGG Takes Steps Towards Building a Social Metaverse Ecosystem Through SocialFi\", which contains a detailed explanation of the SocialFi application and the relationship between SocialFi and the metaverse.After providing comprehensive SocialFi services for ordinary social users, transaction users, KOLs, content producers and blockchain project parties, PUGG can help more businesses, IPs and creators monetize their time, knowledge and influence in a more diverse, extensive and interesting way.In PUGG world, we will surely be able to embrace the future of the metaverse step by step in a free-to-play and easy-to-earn environment.",
