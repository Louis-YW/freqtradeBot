Practice is the best way for you to have experience in trading. Because it is through your experience that you can know the strategy that you will use to trade so that you don't always run at loss and knowing how to manage risks in trading is also through experience. You tried OP for this list but trading is not all about theory but practical. Following the latest news on bitcoin is also needful.",

He now needs to know how to locate means to open an order , close the order and gradually he is use to the trading platform. The terminology doesn't matter as such for the new trader who of course would be finding it difficult to navigate the trading platform. The terms will be more attractive if the trader is making profit because he would be more willing to learn more useful techniques and techniques comes with terminology.",

Some people just comments its gambling and blah blahYou should mention them here too, for better reach. But it's totally up to you, which means it's optional to mention. And to be honest, I also tried trading once, and believe me, it is not only the buy, sell, and book profit. Because it seems easy, but it is not. Many people used to say other people's work is so easy to do and mine is very hard, while at the same time, others were saying my work was too hard but your work was too easy.The same thing is happening here. To make things more clear for them, you can ask them, Why are you not doing it? But then they will say we don't want to waste our money on gambling, etc. Their own words will not match each other's. At the start, they will say it's just buy, sell, and book profit, but at the end, they will try to change or end the topic by saying it's gambling.The best thing is to leave them on their own and not waste your energy on negative vibes. But be sure when you make profits. Just make sure to share them with those friends. heheh. Just to make them feel jealous.Just kidding; by doing it, there will be no difference between you and those tiktokers who just show their profits and hide their losses to gain more VIP members who can pay more money to them.",

At first, I thought it was some new post about new terminologies used in trading, but when I read some terminologies, I found no details along with them. Then I thought to read the whole post again. And it was totally not what I was thinking, but still, the terminologies are doing the same task.Bushdark really has a good point here. Because I, as a learner, or you can say pro-learner trader, have to not know about all of these terms because only technical and fundamental analysis is enough for one to start their journey as a trader. And if they are newbies, then they should trade using paper, backtesting, or demo trading.I will try to learn more about the terms you used here.",

You will learn how to deal with greed and fear. Read the first chapter and I guarantee you will read the entire book because its amazing. Its an old book and I read it maybe 15 years ago but its prinicples still apply to traders today. You can get it from your library or buy the ebook for cheap on amazon or ebay.You will read it and you will get the \"A ha\" moment and realise why you can't be profitable as a trader.",

Marked by excitement and anxiety as used here dragged my attention.Are you saying it’s overly exciting when one takes a trade and that be the marking of the activity and the anxiety be in the proceedings to the trade…?Well, for the anxiety I might agree but, when it comes to excitement;I think the only time one can be excited about a trade is when it starts reading profits for you and most of all, you happen to have the pips play into your trading plan just right. Other than these, there is just nothing exciting about trading as even in the event that, you still get to maintain your trading balance, you would have lost a great deal of time and data.Trading isn’t such an easy thing to do with the level of sophistication and how traders have advanced in skills over the years. You really get to master a lot about it that goes beyond terminologies to be a good trader.",

With proper preparation and time decisions, a person can really enjoy the effortlessness of today's world where all he needs to be make himself aware of what is happening and educate himself with a  particular skill, and there you go He can easily surpass a person who is making hours of physical effort to earn living is kinda sad but the reality of this fast-moving age.To trade, rather than much research practice works more efficiently as experience proves its efficiency in every critical situation where a trader finds it priceless. Emotional control and Risk management cant be developed by learning a few terms they can be mastered with the practice.",

If you know how to trade then you'll be used to the important words and you mightn't necessary call them what everyone is calling them but provided you understand what they're, you can make use of them in your own understanding.Trading is all about buying and selling of cryptocurency so if you understand that then you can start trading.

Getting all these terms memorized or even familiarize will definitely stress a beginner trader. So I cannot agree that these are all relevant to the success of one’s trading. Experience is the most important in trading. If you are knowledgeable but never got years of experience in trading, I’d say your trading may only be susceptible to more losses. However, it’s always a good decision if you are highly knowledgeable and at the same time highly experienced as well as that will attract maximum profits every time you decide to trade.",

Even professional traders may have not known all of these and yet, they still end up with decent profits every time they trade.

More or less I have a suggestion if you are coming up with the idea to trade or are already in as a beginner prefer the Fundamental and technical analysis for the Holding trades and for Quick positions going with the news and Sentiments is not a bad approach.Still, as buddy said knowledge of the trading platform is also a factor to be considered while trading, i.e A few days back there was a post asking a question about the funding rate on the position The answer was to read the fee structure of the platform and their term & condition because they vary platform to platform.",

I think it would be very difficult if not impossible for anyone to truly have all the mastery that the OP mentioned. And I also appreciate that, but in practice sometimes we find new things that we then apply in the trading that we do.If we learn it all before we trade, then it will take a very long time for us to apply it in trading, and maybe we will give up because there are too many theories that we learn. Theory is important, but practicing it directly will be easier to understand.",

And those using TA only add few indicators, like you said 2 or 3 indicators because too much of indicator will mislead you from understanding that market. To cluster your trading window with lots of indicator is problematic to follow, it is better to have maybe 2 and you are good, focus more on what trade is doing and not terminologies because the aim is profit and not what terms they are. For the purpose of learning the terms are good to know but the real business is how to use your knowledge to maximize profit.",
