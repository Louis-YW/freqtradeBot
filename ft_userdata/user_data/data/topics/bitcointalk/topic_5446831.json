Anyway we're sure of better 2023.Still early to tell, but if we are going to compare it with last year, yes, I would say that we start this year at the right side of the bed, January alone gives us that huge 40% increased. And this March might end in another green candle as the bulls might be going after $29k-$30k.What do you mean? it's not going to be pity when the price goes on a massive run next year, and for sure you will make a great profits out of it. So better continue to save and invest whatever and how much you can and be a long term investors, or at least wait till after the block halving.",

Anyway we're sure of better 2023.Currently, the price is $28,375, so if you saw the price at $23,000 in the last two weeks then you have to revisit it again. And for sure you are going to be impressed more with the sudden price spike in the last 2 days.If you have bought it higher that the current price, (assuming its' $30k or more), then the best thing for you to do is just HODL. And if you are looking for a long  term investment in BTC then you can still can accumulate at this price, and again don't sell and look for the bull run next year.",

In real terms I was very panicked to see the price of Bitcoin drop.  We have been in a bear market for a long time.All traders have one concern when we will see a Bitcoin bull market.  As the price of Bitcoin fluctuates hopefully we will reach a bull market by the end of the year.Many have bought and held bitcoins in bear markets and I myself have held some bitcoins.  If the Bitcoin market pumps up, I will profit a lot.",

My guess is few months after that, we'll be seeing greater news similar to what happened in the past. Of course, it could always go sideways but my 'most likely' bet would go to this lol.",

Anyway we're sure of better 2023.The reason you gave at the end for why you are not going to enjoy a pump is why it's better to do DCA and not buy the complete worth of your capital at once and then only keep watching when the price goes down more and more. Those who do DCA gets to buy even at the lowest price positions and get a very good average price for selling when it goes up.Also, I believe as you said, the price will be pretty high by the end of the year, I'm not expecting it to set a new all-time high as predicted by a lot of people, but I just have a gut feeling that it will be at least 70 to 80% higher than the current price.",

We're almost there in mid-2023. At this midpoint, we see the price of Bitcoin regularly fluctuate between $28K and $30K. This is very positive for Bitcoin price growth. At the time you said the market was going to go up soon if investors had invested in Bitcoin at that time they would have made huge profits.

Bitcoin will change our lives, don't be carried away and sell your bitcoin, you will lose so much. The strategy I learned when I was new in crypto is BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH and its totally good when you don't want a longterm but in bitcoin, bitcoin is a long-term I trust bitcoin no matter what happen. <33",

I don't like to deal with the marketcap or valuation of coins because they can be be manipulated.It's been a crazy ride so far, and I think we can still be bullish and overcome $30k at least for this year.Not unless something bad happen to the market, but so far the banking crisis is really pushing the price of bitcoin.",

Moreover, if we look at the current price of Bitcoin three months ago, it was worth half. So if we don't go long term we also have to say that Bitcoin has improved currently. Hopefully this improvement will continue and Bitcoin will be able to make its recovery as the next halving is not far away. And if a strong resistance is created around the current range, we can see 30k plus in April.",

Bitcoin goes up only if he has a mood and vice versa. At the moment bitcoin price is at 28000 $ and it seems like we will see bitcoin price touching 30000$ very soon but still one need to be careful before investing into bitcoin. Its a wild swing that can go in any direction. If you are looking to invest then better wait for a while before bears take over.",

It's more likely that we'll see some better years ahead including this year, 2024 and 2025. But this isn't a financial advice and I'm speaking based on my thought with how I've seen it before. The price is improving and the market itself because it's expanding through different institutions that wants to be involved in holding and trading bitcoin. While some wants it back to the bottom for them to have some slice of the pie but the majority of us like to see it get there back again, to its peak.",

While there are certainly many factors that can influence the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it's important to remember that there are no guarantees when it comes to investing.That being said, many experts and analysts do believe that we could see some significant price movements in the cryptocurrency markets over the coming months and years. Some believe that the continued mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as well as the ongoing development of new blockchain technologies and applications, could help to drive prices higher.Ultimately, it's up to each individual investor to decide whether or not to invest in cryptocurrencies, and how much to invest. It's important to do your research and to only invest what you can afford to lose, as there are always risks involved with any type of investment",
