The main problem is the new people who bought at the bottom will be getting the new tokens and im sure that those whales who have bought at the peak price will be getting less and less. The maximum supply for the new luna was around 1 billion. People will be getting small amounts of luna from the airdrop which have been getting so many complaints against it.",

Yes, and whatever the setup or reconstruction of the New Luna, there will still be losers in here. And with the new Luna having around like 1 billion in token, I doubt that the price will go up because of the huge max supply. Nevertheless the plan might look good for others, instead of losing all their money, at least they have something to compensate themselves and should be happy to at least get back half of the money they lost in this debacle.",

      "body": "I think that it can be know easily. There was proposal that already mentioned about how many new luna will be available in the market. It's up to 1 billion. So comparing 1 billion vs trillions supply will not be come true. The ratio is not yet published but there are bunch of assumptions about that. We shall wait for the further update that will be coming soon. Just watch the do kwon tweet and there are so many speculations. I think the calculation based on the ratio to be distributed to the community will be divided with 7 trillions total supply for now but remember it's only 25%. So many holders will get very small amounts of new token",

What most of us wants is to get back all of our investment not to receive a coin that has the same value as the old one.The only reason the old Luna was worth anything was the algorithmic relationship between it and UST which people *thought*, wrongly, was a valid stable coin. There were 7 billion or so imaginary dollars that people thought was tied in some way to LUNA. Once those dollars were exposed to be a sham, and UST worthless, all the value in LUNA was destroyed. It doesn't come back simply by creating a new shit coin that is a copy of the old block chain. No sir. No way. That value is gone. Only way it comes back would be if the original team manages to come up with enough cash to make everyone whole, and backs the new coin with that. I don't seen that happening. They have maybe, being generous, a couple cents on the dollar v/ where UST was capitalized. I dare say the whole thing was little more than a scam.",

I don't know but majority of holders are not having good impressions with the proposal. The luna developers team were doing shady things by creating the fork token and they are leaving from their responsibility to fix the problem in the old luna. Majority of people in the agora didn't even agree with the proposal that already published. I have been seeing that even the result of vote already removed as some people accused do kwon was doing another shady thing to the community. This problem will never be fixed",

Yoon Chang-Hyeon noted that Korean exchanges each reacted differently to the crash and he wanted to invite both Do Kwon and the exchanges involved to learn more details.....We should bring related exchange officials, including Terra CEO Kwon Do to the National Assembly to hold a hearing on the cause of the situation and measures to protect investors.”Do Kwon summoned to parliamentary hearing following UST and LUNA crashWe need to know the outcome because this is all about investors' protection and let's see if the plan will work for investors to regain what they've lost in the crash.",
