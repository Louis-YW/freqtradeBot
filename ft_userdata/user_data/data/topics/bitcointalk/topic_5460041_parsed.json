You mean the 2 signature must be from A? Meaning the A have 2 signature?Yes it's possible but take note that this A can broadcast a transaction without the other cosigners but it defeats the purpose of multisig wallet.Unless you talking about 1 signature all of the cosigner(parties A,B,C,D) have their own keys and must share the public key to A to create a multisig wallet(same goes to (B,C,D). Take note all of them can sign a transaction but since you said you have 4 co-signer and 2 signature only requires 2 co-signer(2 parties can be A and B or C and D) to be able to sign and broadcast a transaction.",

Sorry if this has been answered before.If I get you correctly you want to have 4 keys and during a transaction key A must sign, I would say there isn’t such a set up because every key on a multi sig actually holds the same capacity as the other. Moreover in a 4 keys set up more than 2 signatures would be needed for better security purpose.

(A1, A2 and A3 are all owned by one person.)This will actually be a good setup with an increased number of n, more co-signers (m) will be needed. But my problem in this case now will be having to back up all this keys and seeds. With A1, A2 and A3 being with just one person, that is he will have to back 3 keys and 3 Seeds. The more the number of these are there to back up the more I think it is easier to find at least one of them. If these 6 things are dispersed in different location (which is ideal for security reasons) then should the other three key (B, C and D) gets hold of one of these then they co sign in. I feel a lesser m-of-n will be better if one person would hold two or more keys for backup case",

With your question, I believe the person A is an important co-signer for that Bitcoin treasury. You want to add a condition that without person A confirmation through his signature, no Bitcoin transaction will be moved out of that treasury.It is good to control that treasury but it has disadvantage and risk too. Like if that important co-signer passes away, bitcoins in that wallet will not be accessed. It's very risky.The main reason we have multisig wallet is to avoid hacks, increase security and safety for our bitcoin, but it is not used to increase risk of losing our bitcoins.If you want risk, you can set a 3/4 cosigner wallet with 4 cosigners: 2 from person A, 1 from person B, 1 from person C. Because that multisig wallet need 3 cosigners to sign a transaction, if only two people B and C sign a transaction, it will not be enough without a signature from person A.Multisig wallets can keep your coins safer if you use them right",

That is kind of besides the point, since the intention of OP wasn't for one co-signer to have additional security but for the entire system to require the signature of one specific cosigner. Though, there is also a point in that, but the security being provided would be the same as n-of-m multisig, with m distinct entities.Besides, I do agree that using separate seeds would both improve security and reduce the complexity of having to track multiple derivation paths. Wallets like Electrum already makes use of their own versioning system to reduce the chances of user error. It isn't that much more complicated to store a few more seeds anyways.",

Should've caveat that it is probably not too good to mess with ScriptSig if you're inexperienced. Good to test with regtest before trying it out on mainnet with small amounts of BTC though. P2WSH/P2SH is pretty versatile in the sense that you can create redeem script with a bunch of conditions and customize it to your use case. I don't foresee these kinds of scenarios to be prevalent enough to warrant a standard though. Going by OP's question, that is the only way this can be achieved if you're mapping 1 key -> 1 entity.",

If it is false it won't even execute the branch under it which can be abused by passing a fake signature so that OP_CHECKSIG pushes OP_FALSE to the stack ergo the OP_IF that pops OP_FALSE is skipped.

Specially since you don't have any OP_ELSE branch. Even if we needed a conditional it should be preceded either by OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY or by an OP_SWAP to use the true/false value that the user provides in their scriptsig not the OP_CHECKSIG result.The correct redeem script that does what OP wants is:Code:<A_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 1 B_PUBKEY C_PUBKEY D_PUBKEY 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIGNote that the last OP has to be OP_CHECKMULTISIG not OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY since after evaluating the redeem script, the interpreter needs to check the stack and see at least one item* on the stack that evaluates to true.* At least one item left if it is P2SH but one and only one item if it is P2WSH.",
