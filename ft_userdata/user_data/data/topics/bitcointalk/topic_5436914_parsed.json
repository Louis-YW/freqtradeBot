Some of these features use data from BPIP.org, some others work entirely inside your browser. The extension activates when you browse BitcoinTalk.org pages such as threads or user profiles and inserts additional info about BitcoinTalk users and additional controls.For adding on PC web browser visit this thread- [β] BPIP Extension: user info & extra features add-on/extension, Firefox/Chrome1.

Then kiwi browser is currently very user friendly, you can go to the settings of kiwi browser according to your preferences and change the appearance of the toolbar, starting from basic settings and accessibility.  I currently have kiwi browser pretty much set up for me.QuoteIn my approach, I prioritize safety first, security first so I won't arbitrarily use anything if without it, I feel inconvenient, uncomfortable. Browsers, extensions, applications, I would like to ignore them and avoid to make installations on my mobile.Safety first, security first and being parsimonious with additional things on my device.I think you can believe kiwi browser from the side of safety and security. Because if you name a few good browsers then you have to put kiwi browser besides Chrome, Mozilla Firebox, Brave, Microsoft Edge. On the other hand, talking about the extension, this extension is one of the best extensions for data analysis on the BitcoinTalk forum. And it was created by a trusted member named suchmoon. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5224821.0",

If you're wondering whether Kiwi Browser is good or not, you can probably take a look at their code since they publish it on GitHub[1]. They are based on Chromium just like Chrome, and some alternatives like Yandex which supports extensions also based their code on Chromium. There is not many alternatives for Android browser with extension support other than Firefox afaik, so you can try them too since the extension is also available on Firefox.Quote from: Crypto Library on January 29, 2023, 05:30:22 PMBecause if you name a few good browsers then you have to put kiwi browser besides Chrome, Mozilla Firebox, Brave, Microsoft Edge. Other than Firefox, most of them come from the same root at least. I don't know how reliable Kiwi is compared to other browsers, but it is definitely not the most popular. Not that it matters if it serve your purpose. That being said, if you're worried that your account might be compromised if you use another browser/extension, you can also create an alt account for mobile usage. Then use that account to browse the forum with the extension/browser shared here.[1] https://github.com/kiwibrowser",

If you can not check their codes, you will have to rely on reviews that can be true or biased, incorrect so it's safer if you don't use extension.",

This is great, like bumping it up again was a great idea. I am also just getting to know about this mobile browser extension. I have not used the kiwi browser you used to explain how to add the extension to the browser but the one I am using (Mozilla Firefox), I am finding it add to add the extensions to it, rather it’s showing me something different from what you showed in the pictorial representation. Is it limited to some browsers only or I’m the one missing something out?This is what I saw:",
