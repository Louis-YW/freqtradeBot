  "content": "There have been controversies and arguments on how Elon musk has been a great influence in the crypto market. How his influence has been making waves to promote other altcoin like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu and some other coin unknown to me. I now start thinking that if his influence can skyrocket other coins. What more of his own coin. People has been asking about the best altcoin to buy or hold and nobody ever thought of eloncoin, So there comes to the thought that eloncoin will be massive when it lunches. So it's time to accumulate eloncoin. His name alone has given it a massive boom.I have tried to check it's total supply and exchanges which it could be operated, but I haven't seen. it's just a unique coin just as Elon musk always like his things to be. So I see it as one of the most important altcoin to hold because it future will be bright.What do you guys think about eloncoin?",

It would have been better for adoption if it had been a token on Binance Smart Chain, Tron, or Polygon. According to its announcement thread there are a few low volume exchanges where it is supported. That is something positive at least but if it was a BSC token it could've already been listed on some really popular DEXs with much better liquidity. Maybe it can be useful as a really cheap gambling coin if Lightlord decides to add it to one of his casinos.",

It is true that Elon Musk is widely recognized as a successful Enterprise, and he can greatly influence the cryptocurrencies markets. A notable instance is surge in Dogecoin's price from few cents  to almost 0.7- US dollar, which is very significant ,as it has no practical use case. Now the recently created \"Eloncoin\" bearing his name, observers are keen to see how it performs in the market.",

No one can predict what the future holds. many people thought bitcoin would worth or amount to nothing. But today bitcoin has stand so firm to the extent of reaching an ATH of about $69k, before this current price. I know bitcoin is never a compearism to any other coin. Even if Elon musk is not aware about his name behind this project, just as you u said, I still see chances of becoming reasonable arterall who knows.",

What more of his own coin. While the project enjoys the publicity please don't mislead the community and do your research properly before you participate in any Signature or Bounty campaign. Eloncoin has nothing to do with Elon musk as clearly stated on the project website. Eloncoin is a memecoin and just like other memecoin, it depends on hype to succeed. Eloncoin is an altcoin and altcoins investment aren't a guarantee so don't ask anybody to Invest in them but if they find the project interesting to give it a try then they can go ahead. All altcoins are a gamble (even the popular ones because they can have the same fate as FTT or other altcoins that has seized to exist).Memecoin are known for using popular names to create a hype around their project and this isn't the first of its kind. The project can succeed or mightn't succeed nobody knows but don't just think because I'm managing the bounty, it's a good investment option. Memecoin has become a part of the industry since the success of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepecoin and now Memecoin (just launched on Binance launchpad) and it'll stay this way for a very long time but this doesn't mean I endorse any of them. If you aren't looking to gamble don't chase after altcoins investment.

What I do is to provide the best managerial service to help the project achieve their marketing aims and for the participants to get the best treatment as employees.

You mean the crypto owned by lightlord? well we can't say anything good or bad for it yet since we don't see its performance but one thing is for sure here this is not own nor have any relation to Elon Musk and maybe they are just using its name so they can easily hype it. I also don't know the main point of creating a coin named after a famous personality since for me it really sounds shady. So you better do research first so that your first impression will get justified and since @Cryptopreneurbrainboss clarified already so for sure with that you will get enlightened for some words posted. But let see how Elon coin will perform since its to early to tell anything about it. If you want to invest go for it but make sure you know how to deal with risk and can accept that there are possibility that you can't earn with them. But who knows? It will pump and you became one of lucky early adopter who believe on their project.",

That's crazy especially for a proof of stake! That's a major red flag that you should follow your guts into not spend money on it. You had pointed out many key points to not spend money on it and I think all of this are valid since even elon hasn't recognized this or maybe not even noticed it. I started noticing this coin lately since there a bunch of members here who are wearing the signature of this eloncoin and my curiosity is being triggered but I didn't try to visit their ANN thread given that I know what am I gonna expect.",

The next is about the wallet as I believe it is still not open source. The last would be it's utility as being on the name of a billionaire doesn't mean that it has got any prospects for the real world.When the project was launched if the owners had continued working on development and marketing then it would have become a the next Dogecoin as the project was created only to encash the popularity of Elon Musk.
