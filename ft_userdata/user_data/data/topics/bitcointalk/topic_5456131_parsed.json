[image source] Thanks for the comprehensive information. From the link op provided and I checked the website. And when I read the article, men such can not happened. It is not possible to for someone has not gotten mining experience to just connect to internet and start mining. Dam men. Where on earth is that? There is no doubt about to be a scam. It is a full time scammers. Because in mining you have little if not average knowledge about before one can do that.",
