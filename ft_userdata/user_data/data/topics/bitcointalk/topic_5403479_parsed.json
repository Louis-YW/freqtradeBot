Consisting of a transponder, a transmitter and a radio receiver, these help to transmit digital data when triggered by an electromagnetic pulse from a nearby RFID. So with cases of wallets being hacked or stolen by cyber thieves and all that, can this RFID be used to help track them since BTC is a digital currency or is it's power limited?",

There are no tags or rfid data, localisation data or even ip's inside transactions or something, nothing like that gets included into the blockchain...IF you'd tag your physical hardware wallet (or cold storage device) and it would get nicked, you'd probably be able to localize it, but that's about it... at least afaik",

BTC is a digital currency . . .As you yourself have pointed out, BTC is not a device it's a digital currency. When people steal your bitcoin, they are not stealing a device. Therefore, there is no RFID (which is a device) to track.As someone else has already pointed out in this thread, if you tag a hardware wallet with RFID and someone physically takes that hardware wallet from you, then you might be able to track the movement of that hardware wallet device.If they \"hack\" your keys and then take your bitcoin (while leaving you the hardware wallet itself), then you will only find the hardware wallet that you still have. You won't find the bitcoins.If they physically take your hardware wallet and then use that wallet to send your bitcoins to a new address in a different wallet, discarding the hardware wallet in the trash, you might be able to track the hardware wallet and find the trash can it's sitting in, but you won't regain or be able to follow the bitcoins that are now in a completely different wallet.",

You cannot place a tag onto software (you can place a tag onto a DVD, but you're tagging the physical DVD, not the software on it).So your question makes no sense. Bitcoin, wallets and so on cannot be tracked with RFID. Hardware wallets (those are physical, yes), can have RFID tag on them, but that's to avoid shop lifting and cannot be read from a wider distance.I hope this helps/clears up things.",

But any other app works, too. Both Google Android and Apple iOS applications make use of so-called 'location frameworks', which means even if you use OpenStreetMap on your phone, the manufacturer of your device still knows where you are. Because the application has to request the location you're at, and can't access the GPS chip directly.",

You allow the application to access the GPS information, but your phone vendor probably knows it all the time. If you even allow a single app to use it, they know. Because just the GPS data doesn't help much; it's usually sent to Google / Apple servers to e.g. show your restaurants in your vicinity or for being able to find your phone if you lose it. Even if you turn off location access for every single app, and even though the Android kernel is a (open-source) Linux kernel, you probably have a ton of closed-source vendor stuff in there (iOS is fully closed, of course), so there's not really any way to tell that that GPS data never leaves your device.Best would be a hardware toggle or ability to remove GPS and WiFi (also used for location sensing) antennas, but I'm only aware of laptops that allow to do this.Quote from: Pmalek on June 23, 2022, 08:47:12 AMdkbit98 said Google knows my current location and shares it with anyone who asks.

[...]I believe the OP's question has been sufficiently answered, but I wanted to chime in, since you asked for it.. The original question is about RFID, not NFC; the two don't really have anything in common except maybe being both wireless communication systems. You can't track a NFC-capable wallet with RFID technology, but you can perform NFC tunnelling and other attacks (that's another story).However, it appears to me his question was actually based on the belief that since Bitcoin is digital, Bitcoin wallets themselves can be detected and tracked in the real world through RFID technology. This is absolutely hilarious, since a normal Bitcoin wallet is pure software. So it's almost as if I asked 'can I check if you run Firefox or Chrome by RFID-scanning your laptop?'.",

This is absolutely hilarious, since a normal Bitcoin wallet is pure software. So it's almost as if I asked 'can I check if you run Firefox or Chrome by RFID-scanning your laptop?'.That actually reminds me, if you set a passcode on a phone that has crypto wallets inside it and the phone is subsequently stolen, the thief is going to have a  hard time getting in there because practically all new smartphones make you wait enormous periods of time between unlocks if you keep entering the incorrect password. So at least the coins are as good as lost.Sure, they could connect an OTG cable (at least in Android's case) and attempt to clone the /data partition with dd, and find the crypto wallets with that, but a responsible phone vendor should be encrypting the /data partition before shipping it to users. It's quite easy to do if you use things like LUKS.",

      "body": "A little bit off topic but I see people trusting the soft settings on your devices. Don't blindly trust that! Or at least I wouldn't (and I actually don't). To turn off geo locations, GPS, etc on your device's settings may or may not actually deactivate the feature and stop the hardware of still capturing data and possibly transmitting it without our knowledge/consent!I maybe be overkilling with this but it's know that NSA requested router manufacturers to include backdoors in the hardware so that they could access those devices and snick into people's home networks and sniff everything they wanted. This may also be happening with phones. There is people removing microphones from their smartphones, I mean dessoldering them, and the same for cameras. When they need to use the phone to make phone calls, they use external devices such as USB microphones or USB cameras if needed! Just a reminder. Don't trust anything, mainly in this context of internet, communications, etc! They are among us, 5 Eyes, Prism and others!",
