Please participate in the survey and get a chance to win a up to $10,000 Project Settlement Grant(paid in PLEXUS governance token) *We provide Project Settlement Grant for projects that have responded to the survey.*Project Settlement Grant will be distributed linearly in 6 months.Service Manual: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIB2Cw-Ceft1Rj39En2_sDs2YKr4pE-6/viewGoogle Form: https://forms.gle/XPJZGXmEXwCUPDMw8📆Schedule: Sep 7th~Oct 24th📆Benefit: Up to $10,000📆Settlement Support Announcement: Oct 26th  💥What is PLEXUS?The First DIY DEX Platform, PLEXUSThere are many so-called \"decentralized\" financial services but ironically many crypto projects cannot use the services without limitations because functions are pre-set and \"centrally\" controlled by the development team. We are developing a truly decentralized DEX, PLEXUS in which anyone can ‘DIY’ or ‘Do it yourself’. There is no DeFi service that is a platform where anyone can use the DeFi services with no limitations. PLEXUS will support customization of all functions of existing DEXs. Projects will be able to create and manage liquidity depending on the characteristics of the projects. As new swap algorithms come out, we will continue to update for users to use it. With PLEXUS, no DEX will be needed and anyone will be able to truly own DEX.🏆Benefit:Project Settlement Support(Token Incentives)Up to $10,000 PLEXUS governance token airdrop to liquidity poolSwap Algorithm SelectionUsers can create a pool according to the algorithm of their choices.Liquidity CreationUsers can create any liquidity pools.Fee SettingPLEXUS allows users to set the transaction fee from 0.01% to 1% as they would like to. Currently, when listing tokens on an existing DEX, users have no options but use the transaction fee set by the DEX.Fee Distribution SettingUsers can decide the fee distribution between the team and the LP.Airdrop SettingThe project team can manage the airdrop amount, period, APR, etc., which are essential to secure liquidity.DashboardUsers can view and manage their pairs at a glance through the dashboard.AggregatorYou can purchase(swap) all types of tokens listed at the lowest price through the routing engine linked to the DEXs of the Ethereum Network. PLEXUS is developing in consideration of not only crypto individuals but also crypto projects in the ecosystem in order to popularize DeFi. We look forward to the response to popularize DeFi together. 🌍Docs: https://docs.plexus.app/🌍Community (Discord): https://discord.gg/Ctyd8au3CF🌍Twitter: https://twitter.com/plexus_fi🌍Medium: https://medium.com/@plexus.app",
