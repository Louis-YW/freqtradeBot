Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!I don't see any intersection. Gold is a physical store of value, while Bitcoin is a digital store of value. There's no collision here. The investors could choose to invest in both gold and Bitcoin. Global wealth is growing not because of buying and hoarding gold and/or Bitcoin. The global wealth is growing because of capitalism. Capitalism is basically investing money into physical capital(buildings, machines, technologies, raw materials, etc.)>producing goods and services>selling them>getting profit and reinvesting that profit. I don't care about cultural perceptions and historical narratives. Maybe you should ask a historian or a sociologist about this subject.",

Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!Maybe we have to go less of being grammatic here and head up straight to the difference in what gold have from the use of bitcoin, by checking this alone on the internet you can have some answers to the question asked, also, we have already seen this been discussed over time, make use of the forum search button in case of next time.Bitcoin is a digital decentralized currency, a means of payments and also a unit of store of value, a profitable investment and a decentralized asset, while gold is only a physical and tradition centralized asset, gold is scarce while bitcoin is not, gold appears in abundance supply yet not circulating while bitcoin has a limited supply, increasing in value and remain in circulation for use.",

Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!Bitcoin and gold will always be considered as a means of preserving wealth but I think the former will be more attractive to the youth because of its digital nature while the elderly will always see gold as the best option. The ease of storing and moving Bitcoin also makes it better than gold. Bitcoin doesn't need any special care to maintain its quality like gold and one can easily move from one place to another with his coin without any form of restrictions.Quote from: Poker Player on March 25, 2024, 04:25:31 AMThey intersect in the sense that many see Bitcoin as an improved digital gold, so most things that gold can do, Bitcoin does better. Although there are things you can't use Bitcoin for, since it's not physical, you can't use it to make jewelry or have industrial applications. But in terms of preserving wealth, Bitcoin is better because it not only preserves it, it increases it. Some of the points you gave about the uniqueness of Bitcoin are correct. Just want to add that the limited supply of Bitcoin is one of the factors that makes it better than gold. There are still great reserves of untapped gold in some countries but the maximum total supply of Bitcoin will always be 21 million.",

But in terms of preserving wealth, Bitcoin is better because it not only preserves it, it increases it. A huge factor why bitcoin is considered the better version of gold is basically its ability to be carried around without inconveniencing yourself. If I bring around a block of gold, I would have to think about storage and weight as opposed to bitcoin where no matter how much I own I can bring it anywhere. You can buy and sell it anywhere or any time of the day you would want to and in todayâ€™s age that has been the most important thing for a lot of people.",

There are still great reserves of untapped gold in some countries but the maximum total supply of Bitcoin will always be 21 million. Can bitcoin supply change if there is consensus among all miners and developers? I think it's entirely possible and just like humanity can find a new store of gold on the surface of the earth. In addition, gold is not only used as an asset but it is also used in a number of other industries and fields. Additionally, an asset having less supply does not guarantee that it is a better asset, it also depends on its demand. We should not deny that the demand for gold today is still very strong and bitcoin has not yet been able to surpass it. In the future, let's take time to answer everything and don't rush to confirm anything. Gold and bitcoin are two completely different assets but it's hard to understand why people like to compare them.",

Bitcoin, with its decentralized system, its incredible security - thats what the smart money is going to be on. This isnt just another investment; its a whole new way to preserve wealth.Sure, gold is pretty. You can hold it, feel its weight. ButÂ  Bitcoin's speed, its digital nature, thats the stuff of the future. As more people figure this out, you're going to see a huge shift. And think about this in the big picture. Bitcoin gives you something gold never can: easy transfer, true privacy, all in a digital format. Thats the kind of freedom and control that are priceless in this day and age. Bitcoin isnt out to replace gold, but its here to change the game completely. This is how wealth will be handled in the future. Its obvious to me, and anyone with the best business sense should see it too",

      "body": "Gold has been around for a very long time. It's a naturally occurring element, and humans have been working with it for thousands of years. It's physically present, nice and shiny. Gold has been considered valuable for a long time and is known as a safe investment. All of these traits give it an advantage over Bitcoin.Digital stuff is generally relatively new, and to multiple generations of current adults there's still a sharp divide between the physical world as reality and the digital world as something very different, kind of not real. So, of course, it's hard for Bitcoin to compete against gold, as it's not something you can perceive with your senses, it's not a bright and shiny thing. But if digitalization continues and becomes an integral part of life for many future generations, I think Bitcoin's perception can change and it might catch up with gold or even surpass it eventually.",

I know there's a huge number already familiar with Bitcoin but still, there is a massive number that is uncovered.",

So aside from the facts of their similarities that people have accepted both as valuable investments and their values will not diminish and they can be traded for valuables like fiat, they have so much more that sets them apart as mentioned above.",

Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!Historically back then there was no technology, and people were so attached to there cultural perceptions that they didn't want to leave the circle that their culture had drawn around them. But with technology, some people tried to leave there safe zone and moved from a traditional store of value to a digital store of value, and when they made huge profits then the other ones also got attracted.But some are still so attached to culture and historical concepts, that they are the ones who will be left behind due to not adopting new technologies. I think for the global wealth preservation, both gold and BTC should be used combined because usage of one and leaving the other would loss some part of the global wealth to loss money.",

Well, you can put it this way, since Gold has been an old method of saving value, bitcoin is now the new sheriff in town with a more innovative way to store your assets.",

Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!Comparison has always been clumsy, it shares some charactericts loosely similar to gold, as it shares them with fiat money. Yet gold is the best real world comparison we got, until bitcoin becomes self explationary.Gold is store of value, because it's scarse, it was able to be used for many things, with just basic tools. These days other materials have mostly replaced it, but it has stayed as a symbol, and still can be used for extraoridinary things without complex tools. It's hard to use for replacing fiat money, as price of it would grow and people would rather hold it and buy more of it later, if ever, as the value woul keep on growing. Economy wouldn't work without transactions and there's a same problem with bitcoin as a money. People rather hold it then use it for services, as it's scarce and who know what value it has in 10 years.Bitcoin has however designed to be digital cash. Cash was bound to gold as well, but soon governments saw the problem with it. Without ability to control it. It wouldn't benefit any government. In fact it could be used against it. Governments could literally be bought and there was no buffer on it to deal with volatility or crisis. Also when people rather store money then invest it or use it, economies aren't rising.",

Thank you for sharing your insights and perspectives!Bitcoin and gold are two different valuable assets,with different purposes to humanity,financial technology and to the real world at large.Another area in which Bitcoin and gold differ is utilityâ€”these assets have vastly different use-cases in the real world. Historically, gold has been used as both a currency and as raw material for the production of jewelry. It has also found use in luxury items, electronics, and dentistry.One of the most important industrial uses of gold is the manufacture of electronics.However,bitcoin on the other hand, has little use and functionality in the real world,compared to gold,but has more applications in financial aspects.https://www.moonpay.com/learn/bitcoin/bitcoin-digital-gold",
