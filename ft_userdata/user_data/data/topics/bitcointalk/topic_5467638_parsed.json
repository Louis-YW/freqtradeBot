This makes me to draw the conclusion that most gamblers are either too lazy to read the Terms and Conditions (T&C,)or they don't just care about it. The results of which leads to misunderstandings and frustrations, often resulting in negative reviews and complaints that may not accurately represent the casino's practices. It is too bad. I have noticed that when gamblers don't read the T&S of a casino, they :1. Accuse the casino of trying to scam them. 2. Accuse the casino of unjustly suspending or blocking their account.3. Accuse the casino of not being transparent because they request KYC that they want to steal their personal information.4. Accuse the casino of being responsible for ruining their lives and their gambling addiction.5. Accuse the customer support of being unprofessional. 6. Complain about having issues with withdrawal not realizing that certain wagering or withdrawal conditions might be outlined in the T&C.7. Accuse the Casino of Rigging Games. 8. Accuse the casino of hidden fees.9. Express frustrations with the bonus and wagering requirements.What other negative reviews do gamblers give to casinos when they fail to familiarize themselves with the T&C of the casino?",

Accuse the casino of not being transparent because they request KYC that they want to steal their personal information.Some may not be transparent. We have site that states boldly when you login into their site that no KYC, but in the ToS, KYC is mandatory. It that transparency?Most gambling sites that enforce KYC will let users to deposit without KYC but they must pass KYC befor they can withdraw. Is that transparency?But people should read gambling site ToS, it is important.",

And if it is not clear to us, maybe we ought to ask them or if we don't want any hassle then stick to the casinos that we have been playing for years.",

They are really just that making themselves laughable on which accusing out somethingwithout even realizing that you are the ones who are at fault on why you are experiencing this kind of problem. As long you do make yourself involved with legit sites then its always that recommendable that reading up terms and conditions would really be always ideal so that you would really be making yourself aware on what are the things that must done or must not.",

I was just lucky though that I don't have big money left in them.But I agree that it is very important to read it in the beginning, not just about KYC, but also read the part on how their \"provably fair\" is.

To be honest, I'm not that lazy in terms of it but will just try to fileter it out and just always do that \"find in a page\" thing. I'm just searching for things like KYC for the most part, VPN if it's allowed, withdrawal and deposit limits especially for newcomers, etc. I would just leave it if I'm just testing it for a new site that I find may not be worth it or if I just want to check it.",

When the casino refused them their withdrawal they tend to accuse the casino of withholding their money meanwhile they have failed to follow the instruction of a 1x wager requirement in all deposits to fight against the use of the casino for money laundering activities.",

This is true not just for getting to know about casino but also for making sure the section about the fairness of the terms and conditions is read. So that you can determine if they are actually doing anything or just influencing game outcomes in their favour.Sincerely speaking, I once made a deposit at a brand-new casino, but I failed to read the terms and conditions of the promotional offer they offered, causing me to forfeit the bonus and preventing me from withdrawing until the deal was cancelled. Since I lost the deposited sum after cancelling it, I now prefer to read the terms of service to stay out of trouble.",

We do even see accusations had been thrown out against into those known platforms like Stake, Rollbit, Roobet without even trying to look about their terms and conditions which it had beenpointed out that it was on users mistake specially that someone who had made out some deposits and make out some accusation on not to be able to withdraw but knowing that wagering requirement is required then he did just make himself look funny.  This is why it is really that relevant on always reading up the terms and conditions so that you wont really be making yourself look like a clown on which accusing on things which obviouslyit was your fault on why you are experiencing headaches now. Its not surprising that on the time that we be able to blow up our balance then this is where we do really that making some accusations that the site we are dealing is really that a scam and shady which totally make me some chuckles thinking about the things they do say. lol",

And when things did not work according to their plan, that's when they start accusing the casino for not being fair on their players or users. That's the reason why some got banned in a certain casino, or it's just that when people are in the losing end, they start to put the blame on the casino because their games or rigged or worst they accuse the casino as a scammer.",

I remember a case brought up by a russian gambler who was banned from the casino, due to the platform having a strict stance against Russia because the invasion of Ukraine. However, this rule wasn't mentioned on the russian translated section of terms and services, rather only on the English version, if I'm not mistaken. That is unfair, because it leads gamblers to not have awareness of a rule or another, if they don't understand a foreign language. Besides it's not being their fault. So, be more careful when pointing fingers to every gamblers facing such issues, as if they were all lazy and careless...",

When gamblers fail to understand the T&S of a casino, it can also be because the casino have failed in making their T&S easy to understand. Some gamblers may not like to read the T&S too, they have played in other casinos without problems, so they can easily assume that the T&S is the same in all casinos. It can be a costly assumption later.",

After all, they are up against large corporations who could probably pay off their whole spend anyway. And for the most part, customers won't complain if there's nothing to complain about. With that idea in mind, whether it be for scam accusations, issues with their winnings, rigging speculations, or changes in the terms and conditions, you always must consider and presume that the customer is on the right and then dig deeper and disclose relevant info regarding their cases later down the line., that's how you do customer service right there.

As for OP's number 4, which talks about gambling addiction, I don't think reading the T&C will help these type of gamblers as it will always be the casino which cause us to be addicted to gambling  Also, number 5 is so subjective as support should be able to explain and be patient to their clients or gamblers on their questions or issues. Gambler's lack of knowledge should never be a valid reason for customer support to be rude.",

Maybe it's not about the TOS but rather these users are really doing something strange to the site to the point that they were able to alarm the site's system or in other ways, attempt to do something sh*t along the way.Generally, it's not about users not reading the TOS or the site is using it against their users but rather, we have to read all the details if there's an ongoing scam accusation and decide from there if TOS was being used against the user. Somehow, if the site is reputable, I doubt they will use TOS as a tool to win against their users.",

KYC is especially problematic because there are many gamblers who are below 18 years of age and have no official documents. A passport, or government-issued National ID card may be required to perform KYC. But those who are below 18 years of age do not have them because they do not meet the conditions for doing KYC, so if they want to withdraw dollars, they must meet the conditions but because they fail, the withdrawal is frozen. Although I have not read in all these situations but I do KYC with my personal documents and I never open an account on any of these sites without reading the terms and conditions of the betting and casino sites.",
