According to the suggested Speedy Trial, the neutral votes are counted as 'positive'. Loosing the fungibility it's not exactly what I envision for bitcoin's future. If you remember BIP 340, 341, and 342 those called Taproot. that need 3 - 4 years (proposal since 2018) after implemented. So if 119 is good, it could be implemented in the future. that need time, we don't have to rush, bitcoin is the senior, don't follow what altcoin did.",

      "body": "I am not sure how to say this, but I think a hybrid setup for smart contracts would be better. I do think that having them as an L2 or other layer would be good. BUT, I also think there should be a way to and I know I am saying this poorly, 'prove on the 1st layer what the 2nd layer contract said' Kind of like when you make an L2 or L3 or whatever layer smart contract you generate some form of a checksum and signature, THAT is then put into the blockchain. This way there is always a way to go back and prove what the original was. If something goes terribly wrong on the other network, you can still prove what was what.Yeah, I know not the best way of saying this but I think I get my point across.-Dave",

QuoteA smart contract is better on a separate layer, not baked into the protocol where it can be used as a weapon by unscrupulous nation-states against the political acceptance of Bitcoin as a legal form of money. well i'm not sure how you arrive at that endpoint from bip-119. not that i'm an expert on it but from what i heard, it lets the receiver impose restrictions on how the funds sent to their address get spent. how do we arrive at a weapon of nation-states from that?with all that said, this feature of bitcoin seems like something 99% of bitcoin users would never utilize...oh and never need, they gotten along without it just fine all these years, right?",

I just can't take him seriously. But he is a smart dude.",
