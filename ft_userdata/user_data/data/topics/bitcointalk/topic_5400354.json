I think its really an emotional damage to a lot of users whom can handle stress on losing too much $ but of course this is a risky process and not easy to conquer.We cant blame some who panic sell to at least cut their losses by a margin. Selling isnt bad especially if your concern is your hard earned money.",

We have witnessed this type of dip in the market before but only if you are able to HODL through that you will be good but this does not mean if you have sold earlier and Hodl on to your stablecoins and were able to buy back around the bottom wouldn't have been better but at this moment, HODL and DCA too as you said.",

I agree. But I don't think professional traders care what the asset price is at the moment. They trade by opening longs or shorts. And if they are unsuccessful in a trade, their stops are triggered. Most of the traders in this market are non-professionals, who often become coin holders because closing a losing trade no longer matters. They are either liquidated if they trade with leverage, or they hold the coins until the end if they are buying it on the spot.",

I'm also holding and looking at the losses I've got, it's discouraging just looking at it.But if I'll be calculating all of my gains before the bull run, they're more than the losses that are projecting on my tab.

HODL !!!IMO, I think your portfolio of choice is good and strong, and your mindset is very positive and always ready, and for me, thats good I like that positivity it was appropriate for this kind of industry that is full of speculation and uncertainty. Anyway, based on your thread your portfolio is made up of Bitcoin and Ethereum thats why I believe it's a very good portfolio for long-term holding. keep the spirit of positivity as we cope with the test of time.",

It is up to you if you want to hold btc and eth like 40% both btc and eth then the rest will an altcoin of your choice. I suggest this to you if you ever plan to hold different altcoins like 20% each altcoins if you plan to hodl three altcoins. For now, your portfolio is not bad and all I can say is it's a good choice to start with. Good luck to you from Nakamura12, Ciao.",
