Why?2.I think that the BTC whales(and almost all investors/traders) are in interested in both FUD and FOMO phases, because both phases present and opportunity to make big profits.3.OK, I get your point of view. Bitcoin is a pump and dump scheme and the big whales are here to buy low and sell high. This idea has been repeated multiple times on the forum. Every speculative asset is basically a pump and dump scheme. Change my mind.4.BTC having a limited supply isn't \"a perfect weapon\". Where there aren't any altcoins with limited supply that are more popular than BTC?",

Bitcoin Core uses GitHub for code collaboration and it is essentially the developers' place of work. When someone makes a bold claim on twitter that angers people, and then encourages them to leave comments on GitHub, they end up disrupting the developers. These comments often contain accusations of bad faith, poorly informed statements about the code, and demands for the developers to make major changes, which drag the developers into arguments in order to defend themselves and correct misconceptions...The decision to close it at that time was made independently by myself.in short core is their business and no one should ask/demand a dev to do something outside of what the devs are sponsored to do by their masters, anything outside of their job asked by the community should be ignored and treated as noise and be shutdown and treat proposals outside the core roadmap as poorly informed misconceptions and distractionsand yes andrew chow does also manage the roadmap of core future direction, and githubs moderation and many platforms technical discussion.. basically filtering out any proposals on any platform that dont fit the core roadmap",

However as it gained popularity and it became more stable and without bugs, Satoshi decided to leave it in the hands of the open source community.Its basically a currency by the people for the people. And this is a good thing. Its one of the reasons why many bitcoin people didnt like ethereum because they found that the devs just had way too much control and found it risky. Hence why bitcoin is special in this regard.",
