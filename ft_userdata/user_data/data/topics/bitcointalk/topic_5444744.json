Nigeria got their first Bitcoin Atm in 2020 but there have been ban in cryptocurrency activities since 2021 and so I don't think it's still functioning and its really disappointing because this Atm do reduce the rate of scam in buying and selling of Bitcoin and The Kyc verification doesn't require you to place all your personal information as most CEX does but just require a basic information like your phone number",

As I have never used one, so I have no experience on it. But as every ATM works in such way that it could be hacked. Don't get me wrong on this, as I think it is a great way to reduce scams instead of P2P buy/sell. But my concern is that, could it be hacked? I have no fear regarding stealing, as they are stored digitally and can't be taken away if anyone tries to. But as every digital asset is moved through the internet, it is quite possible to get hacked. So can you share some knowledge with me in order for me to better understand this concept?",

Every system and software that's connected to the web could be hacked, there's always that possibility of being in that scenario. But the developers and companies that produce such ATMs, they've taken measures to their security, and for sure that it won't be easy for the perpetrators to commit such acts. There could be attempts and that's why securities of such systems are continuous in terms of updates to avoid into being potential abuses. As for having a bitcoin ATM nearby, it really brings joy to the enthusiast out there. I wish that I'm also near to one of it in my country, there are two already but I need to allot travel time on it since it's not from a nearby station/mall.",

In Nigeria the bank doesn't accept any money which related with Bitcoin, so they're just use it through P2P. However with the recent earthquake where Turkey government receive a lot donation through cryptocurrency, I think they might be more friendly about crypto usage in the future.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cryptocurrency_by_country_or_territory#Turkey",

I know another country where Bitcoin and all other crypto are banned. But, When miners import ASICs to mine Bitcoin or other coins. Customs release them because they do not understand what it is. I don't know how they import it. But, they are running their miners. What I believe is, If Bitcoin is Banned in Turkey, The ATM Was built before the ban, and the Turkey government didn't check if there are Bitcoin ATMs. Just like in some cities, casinos are banned. Still, there are some casinos inside some Expensive hotels and Bars. Sometimes they get caught, and the government takes action against them. I believe the shopping mall owner or whoever sets the ATMs will be in trouble if the government finds there is a Bitcoin ATM. Just my assumption.",

They allow you to transact Bitcoin, but they don't allow you to use it. Do they explain why they do not allow people to buy goods or services? About elections, I know political parties promise many things before the election. But, when they win the election, they turn 360 degrees and forget everything. I hope this is not going to happen in Turkiye.

I am not from turkiye. Not knowing their situation is not surprising. Suppose you running a mining machine inside your house, and the Government has banned Mining. They were unable to check your house if you were mining or not because it's impossible for every house. Does it make sense to you? Quote from: loopes on March 14, 2023, 07:27:24 AMThe reason that i know is inability of the goverment to monitor and control the transactions and excessive market volatility and use in illegal activity. That's basically similar things. Government cannot monitor Bitcoin Transactions. Also, they cannot monitor every house and private sector. It's not impossible to run a Bitcoin ATM in a secret club even if they ban Bitcoin transactions. That was just my assumption which I mentioned the end of my post.",

In fact we have very big exchanges such as BTCTurk that have high volumes around the globe. ATM's should fit under this category and are completely legal. They are probably used mostly by foreigners anyway. Because trading fee rates aren't competitive between these machines and local exchanges. The ban to use cryptocurrencies for purchases is complete nonsense but what do you expect from this government? They are very inconsistent in making decisions about cryptocurrencies.",
