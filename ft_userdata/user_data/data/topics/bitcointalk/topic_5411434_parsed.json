After the massive drop, bitcoin did not drop back to that price up till date.Bitcoin dropped all the way from $69000 to $17500 and this would likey be the lowest price during this bear time, there would be volatile but in a lesser way that would be followed price increase. I am still thinking if bitcoin can even go further, dipping down below $20000 which I believe would be a very strong support, although bitcoin is presently at $19900, but probably won't fall much further.If people start to DCA now, it would be very productive by 2024.",

Btw am not an expert bitcoin price analysts but from my little experience of the Bitcoin market any time Bitcoin pulls back drastically without any bad news from sec it becomes easier for the bull to pick up but as we are all familiar with the volatility of Bitcoin price we can not accurately predict what the lowest level in price can be.",

Even the highest rank or the highest merit earner couldnt tell what would be the btc stance in the coming years. But if you are deeply worried then just exit your asset and turn off crypto notification.  Its quite normal to see red days and thats due to a lot of news and some making it more exaggerated one that move others into selling due to fear and fud. But if you believe in btc is the future of money then just DCA no matter what the price, at some point it will go back or even surpass its ATH.",

      "body": "It looks like Bitcoin is going to break the $19k  resistance support in the next month.  Remember we still have an event coming in after this August that can cause FUD to the Bitcoin market.  The rumor and FUD about the liquidation of part of MT. Gox BTC can possibly push the price of BTC down.  While some analyst blame this current price dive of BTC on the reaction of traders to FED Powels Speech.  Said that the bearish news about Powell's speech is the reason why the market is like this today.QuoteWith the world economy turning sour, especially in Europe, there was a decent probability that Powell would be hawkish during his speech, which was indeed the case.At last, this bearish news was the tipping point for BTC to break out of the pattern after 2.5 months of being inside of it.My expectation is that we're going to see more bearish price action, potentially even a capitulation event in the near future. First target at $19k.Source",

Resistance is mainly defined when the price of an asset is rising, and support is the price level where buyers enter the market, causing it to rise again.Unless something dramatic changes, it seems like Bitcoin will be worth less than half of its value since the beginning of this year. And it's hard not to feel disappointed by that. But we can only hope that the cryptocurrency grabs a foothold again by the end of 2022 and starts climbing back up towards its former trading levels.",

For now we can't expect the price to have a steady movement. As it have dropped below the $20k support level, once again it needs to gain resistance to move forward. It needs to cross price barriers for a stabilized move. Any form of move can take place and we need to prepare to face the worst to stay strong in the market.",

And I suppose this cannot last for long and we could see the price touching the low 19k or even 18k.",

For instance, bitcoin has never dropped below all-time highs, but we saw it happen this year.We are having a lot of bad news surrounding Mt.Gox issuing 140000BTC this year and the world economic situation has not shown any signs of improvement, the Fed rate hike will have a very strong impact on the market. I think bitcoin will drop to $17k or under $17k is possible.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 27, 2022, 03:46:41 PMIf people start to DCA now, it would be very productive by 2024.Since everything is guesswork so DCA is the best solution we can use at the moment.",

About a month or so ago, other users were speculating that Bitcoin could even crash below $15.000, and reach as low as $10.000. Some stated that such prediction is out of the ordinary (the $10.000 sounds doubtful for me too), but with everything going from bad to worse, I wouldn't be surprised.",

In fact, we are thinking in the past few days that it no longer drops below $20k after getting stabilized at $22k-$23k. However, the situation is somewhat changing and it is now uncertain if it goes down to the bottom or rises again. Actually, we have no idea what really happen next, we can do some speculation but guess what, we just fail - most of us. Currently at $19,134 in the CMC - just hopes it recovers these weekdays.
