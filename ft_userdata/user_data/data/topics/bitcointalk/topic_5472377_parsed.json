I voted no.I modded this as people may get heated over it.The war angle means people die and the economy struggles.But if he is really dead and we do get a new leader things could shift bigly.",

I imagine that Russia would certainly enter in an uncertain and probably socially turbulent phase.Having one of the world's great powers, and one of the main actor of the BRICS, in the throes of a major social crisis could have major repercussions, not to mention Westerners and others trying to get a bigger slice of the pie in Russia after Putin s death... Russia exports a lot, meaning an unstable Russia would be bad for the economy.And about the war, not sure that it will end with Putin s death...",

Quote from: philipma1957 on October 31, 2023, 11:25:58 PMSo if true how will this affect the worlds economy?Easy, the band of the world war people sing around will slow down, the west or probably Europeans and the America will be looking at how to win over the double body to their side, at least this could actually bring the business ones done between this two countries back again. Because one thing I perceive is the major hatred of the west towards Russia is centered on Putin. Would the doppelgänger have same balls as him? NO, a photocopy no matter how perfect it is can’t be bold as the original copy",

If after a short time it became clear that his replacement would be someone with a more pacifist orientation, especially with respect to the conflict in Ukraine, I think that would be the case. But we also don't know whether he would be replaced by someone like him or someone more radical.",

The chances of this being true is really slim. I had conversation with some friends in Russia over the weekend and non of them mentioned it. Nevertheless, if it happens to be true, I don't see how it can affect the world's economy that much much. It will just be a minor response which will fade away easily. Considering the kind of support Putin have in Russia, the successor might not be too different from him in terms of ideology. I feel Russia's latest political moves and international policy is bigger than Putin himself. Their success in Syria and expansion in Africa is not something they would want to loose. So, the successor will like toe the line of Putin and this will not change global economy that much.",

The question is what is the US (the White House) saying or have said about this news, has there been any press briefing regarding this since the weekend confirming it based on forensic information that they would have gathered by now. If no, then I refute such news concerning the death of Putin to be untrue.Putin is a man that has been a torn on the flesh of Western bloc and parts of Europe in that case everyone of his subject loyal to him must have his ideology and belief system and a successor can not come from a different line which means his death either now or tomorrow would change little or nothing about the current situation of the war and how it's affecting the world economy. Worst if a more radicalist Putist should succeed  his position it would be another story altogether and not what we're discussing here.  In otherwords, the war is an ideological war so the death of Putin at anytime can't be an end to the war, it's something we all must understand.",

But on the topic though, I think that his death will definitely be a net positive to the world's economy depending on his successor stance on the war that Putin has waged on Ukraine, if it's a total stop in the war then it's going to be a positive for the world and Russia as sanctions are going to be lifted and it's definitely a negative for Russia but a bit much worse to the world itself because the successor might be more unhinged than Putin when it comes to usage of nuclear weapon.",

But what will be the good reasons for double-bodying Putin? Way back in 2013, Putin's potential successor and the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev just ended his presidential term in 2012. So I guess there would be no power vacuum if Putin left this world 10 years ago. Medvedev seems to have fallen out of favor last 2020 ending his term as premier. Although it might be good since he seems to be more militarily aggressive than Putin even mentioning the use of nuclear weapons including the issue with Ukraine.With regard to the OP question, I answered wtf since I don't think the rumor is true. But if it is indeed true then we will find out who's the successor first. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin is possible to negotiate to stop the war rather than the hardliners like Medvedev.",

If Putin dies they will either keep playing this game with lookalikes, afraid that admitting it might lower the morale of soldiers fighting in Ukraine, or they'll openly say that he's dead but the government wants to keep going. They don't have much choice. They can't shut it down the way they run from Afghanistan in 89, because it would be a political suicide for them. They'll keep fighting for as long as there's a chance of getting a positive outcome. What is positive for them? For instance permanently moving the border to include separatist republics. The perfect situation they were hoping for was to secure the land south of The Dnieper that includes Zaporizhia power plant. That area has a natural border along the river, protects Crimea from land attacks and is easy to defend provided they're given enough time to prepare.",

Only one Telegram channel, called General SVR and from what I saw and what reaction it received, nobody didn't believed in these reports seriously. In past this channel looked like reputable source of information, but in recently it lost it's credibilty.IMO, it looked like editor got drunk too much and then turned on his fantasy. Because this story doesn't sounds realistic at all.Quote from: OgNasty on November 01, 2023, 02:49:59 AMPutin seems like a pretty healthy individual and one of the wealthiest people in the world so I’d be a little bit surprised if it were true.Putin looked pretty health few years ago, but now it's not same anymore. If you would look closer, you would see that things had changed. Why he needs all these extremely long table or mandatory lockdown for people who want to meet him. Also, in his public appearances he coughs a lot. And it's been a while since showed his macho image like jumping into ice water. Still, he looks way better than Biden, but I wouldn't say that he is pretty healthy.Quote from: coolcoinz on November 01, 2023, 04:21:09 PMTo my understanding, Dmitry Medvedev is Putin's lapdog and he supports the war, along with most high ranked military officials.

I would rule out Medvedev as potential replacement. Even in Russia his ratings is low and many aren't looking seriously into him. Now he has role of angry clown who threatens to destroy half of world with nuclear weapon. Something similar what Zhirinovsky was doing until his death.",

At this point, because  I have not heard about confirmation and people are talking about body doubles and stuff like that, I can only assume he is not actually dead.The end of Putin would not represent the end of his legacy, by the way, there would still be a big faction of people in the Federation of Russia seeking to seize power and continue his ideas on Russian expansionism and alledged protection of Russian values. Economy would recover a bit, but it will go down again once authoritarism goes on.",

I remember the little scandal about the cue cards. It seemed quite strange to me a president of his category would need to have those for a public event, I don't remember whether Obama had to use those during his public speeches or not, though. Probably Biden indeed has some memory problems which does not allow him to remember details about the protocols he his supposed to follow in front of people, but I do not think he is suffering from some cognitive challenges as some claim. Besides, people in the right says Biden is a crime family boss who has been able to get away with millions of dollars and cover his track of crimes to this day but also it is claimed he is demented and does not even know where he stands, I don't know about you, but those ideas sound mutually exclusive to me.",
