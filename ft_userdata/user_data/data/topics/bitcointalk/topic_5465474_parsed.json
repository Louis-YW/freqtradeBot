      "body": "We created the Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon to enable, reward, and celebrate innovation on Bitcoin.  The Bitcoin Renaissance has started and we are doing are part to rekindle the culture and spirit of innovation on Bitcoin.   We invite any one that believes in the statement, \"To future proof Bitcoin means that we must fight for it and stay open minded, collaborative, and innovative.\"By way of background:The first time we ran the Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon was in Mar/Apr 2023.  We were able to get 5 Bitcoin technology tribes to collaborate and the beautiful result was that the most open minded people from each tribe came together to invite and enable people to join the greater Bitcoin community and build something that matters and the beginnings of novel startups on Bitcoin.The technologies used in the previous hackathon were Taproot DLCs, Ordinals Protocol, Rootstock, Hiro/Stacks, and Lightning technology.  The cash/crypto prizes part were around $10K.  This is not including the opportunity to get online face time with protocol creators and investors.People had such a great time that this time, for the second Bitcoin Olympics happening right now to Sep 30, 2023, the cash/crypto prize pool has grown to over $100,000.  And in addition to the 5 Bitcoin technologies from the first hackathon, we have added BDK (Bitcoin Developer Kit), Nostr, ICP/Dfinity, ZKP, Interlay, Taproot Assets, BRC20, Sovryn, Bitfari, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Miniscript, and more talks, office hours, and mentors.We also have team matching events so that you can find partners to build your project and get the chance to win in a prize pool that is over $100,000.  The grand prize is $30,000 alone.  Learn More: https://btcstartuplab.com/BitcoinOlympicsSignup Directly: https://btcolympics.devpost.com/",
