  "content": "Ya know, after being fucked out of Facebook (that little twat zuckCuck who’s a poster boy for big corrupt, corporations, deploy massive amounts of propaganda, media control on and on stole the idea where sure it made them billionaires but not like Zuck. Not sure he’s human really, for his sake I hope not. Anyways log in to Gemini (I’m already really over Wise, Plaid, etc. These third party vendors ..my red flag meter is way up with them (also fyi STOP USING lPayPal, their trickery “fun social media guided feel for Venmo (stop sharing who you do payments with and for what. You’re funding pure corruption and don’t even have a clue. F Google pay (Google I more worse mean words for), use cash app, Jack is a real one. Okay nuff bitching /trying to educate to force legit fair change. Now if you don’t know already, Coinbase is the worse of the worst because their the biggest and and spend lots of money that could go to infrastructure, but yet they choose to use it on a lot of advertising some of which completely unnecessary and to pay off news outlets to spread propaganda. This is not debatable. This is complete factual information.So Gemini is now requiring a lot of KYC that’s above and beyond the scope that is fair for signing up for such a platform. As an advisor, I certainly understand KYC requirements & its importance, but they don’t need to know my ethnicity. They don’t need to know my income. They don’t need to know my job title, don’t need to know my salary /net worth etc. could I lie about it all sure but according to one of my good buddies in my collectibles group who is a knowledgeable and reputable member he said that they are actually doing follow up emails saying if you do not provide it because you didn’t finish it you will be booted off their platform it sickens me what’s next you use that money a.k.a. bitcoin to buy Canadian allergy medicine and you get kicked off the platform like I did with Coinbase what a fucking joke it is none of their business that would say you wanna buy porn, which is unnecessary because there’s endless amounts for free but it’s pretty much stuff you have to pay for they will ban you for purchasing porn that is 100% legal. Where do they have the moral and ethical and legal rights to Ass such questions especially being scammers.another a bunch of other shit that they asked for it’s none their fucking business now in finance if you want to b purchasing options contracts or equity link Notes, there is additional KYC requirements, but it’s still in a different manner and a more fair and transparent and legitimate man. Data mining to sell is a clear obvious ploy of privacy and control over stepping. here.I’m upset , real upset,  will finish this thread in better detail hopefully this weekend though I will be in Aiken concealed carry class all weekend. It is a lot of fun.in AM bout to smash all slurs shit I can fOkOK I keep falling asleep typing this. I need to get to bed. I hate m tomorrow. Appreciate any feedback that I come back to it’s always greatly appreciated when people chip in and try to help the community because that’s what it’s all.Fck Gemini , Conbase, et   Okay I Do this anymore I just wanted to get this in because I’ve been wanting to discuss this for a while. I also had a big question to ask. I can’t think of hopefully I’ll have it for y’all tomorrow. Appreciate any interaction and discussion around this area.",

Don't use CEX. The problem is less liquidity, less offers, less convenience but using Gemini and Coinbase and complaining about their KYC is like going to the beach and complaining that it's full of sand.",

It was pretty much build for high volume staking, which is smart on their part.",

So that plebs wouldn't be able to do something at all  I first thought Gemini as AI, but then I googled a bit and understood what OP was talking about. A shame, really. Centralized exchanges, smaller ones, may bring more problems than good.",
