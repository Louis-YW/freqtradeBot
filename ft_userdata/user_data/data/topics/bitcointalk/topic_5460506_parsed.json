A real pump is what happened in April and ended just as abruptly too when price reached 360+ satoshi (50%) or in November last year from 310 to 760 (145%). Any pump now should be going back to above 300 sat at least, not what happened past week with a tiny rise from 213 to 240 satoshi (12%).I also have no clue what any of this have to do with Hollywood!",

      "body": "The question is,  what do people refer to as free money and to think of it that there is free money in cryptocurrency is becoming a big fallacy that many of us are becoming tired to hear because no one can own money unless their work for it or in some form of charity otherwise any other form of free money distribution is fake and attempt bigger scam to come. Movie streaming is as old as video editing and filmmaking itself,  and at that,  if cryptocurrencies are included as revenue allocation to content creators and movie makers,  it then means that the movie industry will become a major adopter of cryptocurrency aside gambling industry is also a major market for cryptocurrency.",

Not sure if he is talking about the Hollywood film creators or to the customers of those movies. I even think earlier that Paramount movies are going to create their own token or they are investing that amount in crypto.Now when it comes to cryptos, I think only a few of them are performing well lately but BTC may not be among with them because once again, BTC values fell under $30k but if it's about the last time, yes because BTC finally cross the most anticipated $31k. For those who have those top-performing coins of the week, maybe they are selling now but for those don't have those, maybe they are still accumulating.",

I am assuming you want Paramount pictures or some other large Hollywood company to make a Bitcoin movie to pump the price.I don’t think it will make a difference because people already know what Bitcoin is. It made a difference 10 years ago with Mr Robot and The Good Wife episodes because it was new back then. Now it won’t pump bitcoins price if some big movie was released.",

If you are working in an organizations, I think it will be easy for you to save your salary so that you can invest in any potential altcoins in the market, because their price has decreased to allow you to buy as much as you want and hodl for the price to increase higher before you can release for sale to make a passive income. Well, based on the recent moved of dogecoin price in the market show that you will achieve something good in the future, if you can embrace the opportunity in this period by investing huge amount of money on it, because the price is preparing to increase higher before the end of this month of July.",

Because nothing in this make any sense to me. I tried to to use AI to explain this post to me and even that got me vert iffy answer.Op, can you start by explaining what do you mean about Hollywood refund\"? And what is \"1 billion from Paramount movies\" referring to? And who told you there would be free money? Everyone in here is basically saying that you can't know if markets are going up or down. And if some random person is promising profits for holding, you can just choose not believe everyone.",

Well, Bitcoin is not a free money at all to begin with, even with the start of the Bitcoin genesis those who mine it will probably have paid something on it e.g. electricity at least, the hardwares being used. Dogecoin and Hollywood refund seems not aligning at all.",
