E no go make sense say as we de pull this kind weight, we go still be the ones when go de tarnish our own image by speaking ill of our country or even painting a bad image of our country to people through the kind of threads we create in other board that goes to downgrade us as a section in the forum..If you observe am well you go notice say na some of the new members when just join the forum na them de mostly go de yarn anyhow for boards and them go just easily attach nija to their post without considering the effect it will have on the reputation of our country and on our board.I created this thread because of one post I been see like that when the guy de talk say bitcointalk na source of wealth creation for Nigerian youth, him no even post am for we local board o, him carry am go drop for economy and I feel say this one no project our image in the right way.Â I just want advice say as we de try bring our people come the forum, make we try de guide them well so de no go come put sand for our garri through their post in the forum.Na the link to the thread be this. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5477748.0",
