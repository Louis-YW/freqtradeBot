      "body": "If you are a good gambler, you need to discipline yourself. Discipline is very important for you not to lose more than you are expecting. This has happened to me in gambling before, but it is just an addiction which you have known and need to stop doing. In life, do away with greed, learn how to control your emotion and completely discipline yourself.",

      "body": "Most of us for sure experienced such instance. We will always have a tendency to swear and avoid gambling probably due to losses, but will end up playing the next day. One reason is boredom especially if gambling is a part of your daily routine; you're used up to it. Another is frustration for your losses and it pushes you to get back with it. Last I guess is to enjoy things more; perhaps in sportsbetting wherein it is more thrilling to watch a game if you have bet in it. As long as you still function normally on a daily basis and if you are not struggling financially, I think you are managing things well as a gambler.",

I had a similar topic like this once which say NOT QUITTING ONLY TAKING A BREAK as I believed most gamblers who claim to have stopped the act only took a break on it for a little while.",

It’s very addictive that I even woke up on the middle of my sleep just play few bets that turns into long game because I can’t stop myself.I manage to counter this gambling problem of mine through limiting the funds I can access. I deposit my crypto now on a hardware wallet while I don’t have any computer to access it. This way, I can only play when I’m home. I have a job which requires me to stay in our company during weekdays. I don’t gamble during that time and only play during weekends when I’m at home.It’s very hard to stop gambling if you have an easy access to your funds while you are enjoying all the gambling games.",

But since you mentioned that when you did that you're under addiction so now you're over it which is a great achievement and this is hard to achieve by everyone who are in the same phase.Here is a trick, you can opt the self exclusion feature provided by the casino which prohibits from you from accessing their service for certain period of time but this only works if you're not switching from one to another meanwhile.",

This behaviour is not peculiar to only gambling but all forms of addiction. The more you try and fail to stop, the more forced you are to accept your addiction and lack of self control and your new normal, a habit that you cannot break free from. If you already are struggling to keep yourself under control and your gambling habit, but it is proving difficult and out of your hands, you can seek professional help.",

Of course the temptation is really strong. It's hard to be stronger than the inner voice telling you to go on and risk some money to recover that sum you lost days ago, as it seems perfect feasible on theory, especially because that is what you most desire on the currently moment, but you have to ignore it or argue with yourself to not break a promise or plan you have already sealed.I believe in situations like this to be an insecure person can help you to not get engaged in problems, since insecure people have aversion to take risks.",

I would just be frustrated and swear that I won't gamble again and although that particular period of time I always told myself  that it wasn't an addiction problem which is obviously a big lie I told myself because I would repeat same thing over and over again. But am glad today that I learnt how to stop this rubbish as I now have a gambling budget for the week and if exhausted that means it over for that week.",

When I lost most of my funds, that's when I started to exercise self-control and discovered that we can't discipline ourselves if we have too high of expectations for gambling. I'm constantly eager and working so hard to achieve my target objective despite risks hoping that I could get lucky but when I started controlling my emotions and tried my best to resist from gambling temptations, it became my habit and I started playing gambling occasionally and just considered it as a source of entertainment and not a passive income. It will be hard in the beginning but with perseverance and willingness, we can get rid of guilt and we can't also control ourselves. It only needs determination and self discipline.",

But now I can control it, you have to control yourself too. Because to be honest, I was ever in a position of addiction like that, everything looked bad, and in that situation I was aiming for the winnings from the previous losses, I mean chasing after what I had lost. But the results don't end well, because the emotions involved make us play blindly. Try to remember how many times break your promise ? I'm sure you can't count them, because I've also been in that addiction, but hopefully you can control it Sir.",

You are not alone. I was very aggressive in gambling before that even if I promised myself to take a break from gambling to reduce my losses, but I still find myself gambling again the following day. Of course, the guilt is there but what can I do, I find it hard to control my urge and just gamble again and eventually lose my capital. However, now that I’ve been a long time gambler, I learned to discipline myself and control the urge whenever I feel like gambling. That’s the best key so that we won’t be regretting everytime we end up gambling at a loss.",
