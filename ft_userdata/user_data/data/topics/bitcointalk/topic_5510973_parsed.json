The Fed lowered the rate by 0.5%, and when the rate gets lowered, investors are motivated to buy shares, the stock market tends to recover. Since Bitcoin ETFs are close in their nature to the stock market, it makes sense that there's been a major inflow of money this week. BTC price is also up by almost 5% over the last 7 days.It's all good news, but also highly dependent on the Fed.",

ETF   ...      inflow..and yes they are hoarding. as they are locking up that coin(with a custodian) to then register asset ownership with regulators to then register shares that the etf can then sell to individuals, businesses(their customers), and then those individuals can then resell to each other whilst the ETF and custodian just hoards the coins whilst individuals play the secondary etf share market for their pension profitsthe data shows that for instance blackrock and fidelity combined accumulated 11k btc in last week whilst greyscale main trust sold off(outflow) 820 coinother ETF trusts had smaller amount of inflows and some had outflows.. but generally a ETF accumulates more coins than it disposes (bar greyscale as the exception)..repeated for emphasisall news of \"etf inflows/outflows\" are going to be about the ETF trusts themselves..",

So far, more than $60 billion has flowed into the market through bitcoin ETFs in just a few short months. This shows their influence on the bitcoin market but many people still stubbornly believe that the government will not be able to influence the development of bitcoin. It is true that bitcoin can continue to exist without the US market but I do not believe it can grow strongly without the participation of the US market. The government is intervening more in the market but without that intervention or without their permission, I don't think mass adoption of bitcoin can happen quickly. That's also the price we have to pay if we want bitcoin to become globally popular.https://www.coinglass.com/bitcoin-etf",

The ETFs have been getting plenty of inflows since that 50 BPS rate cuts earlier this month. The global economy is highly interconnected. You might be correct, this proposed policy by the Chinese government might have a ripple effect on the market. Investors will consider investing in risky assets like Bitcoin. I also think that the US interest rate cut also played a significant influence on the market. Interest rate cuts lead to cheap borrowing, more job creation, and economic growth stimulation. Hence we expect people to start investing in diverse areas like the crypto sector in the US. However, I am concerned that the conflict in the Middle East might slow down the crypto industry.",

Cutting rates has its own effect (probably it will look better in the long term), but if we look at the inflows/outflows since the beginning of the approval of BTC spot ETFs, we see that such inflows are not always connected with good news - because I don't remember that in July there was a reason for such inflows. However, it seems that today we have significant outflows considering that the price is dropping.",

I would not put the credit towards US govt. While there are ETFs now of cryptocurrencies particularly bitcoin and ethereum, I do not think they have made a lot of supportive steps forward about crypto. SEC is constantly breathing down the necks of crypto companies and platforms so it is easy to think that this can't be good for the image of crypto.So this high record of inflow is most likely result of bitcoin's price hiking up bit by bit. We just came from some tough times where bitcoin was valued at lower than 60k so now that we are nearing 70k again I am guessing many people are wanting to get into bitcoin before it hits its new ath.",

Large inflows from institutional investors such as BlackRock, Ark, and Fidelity-fund giants driving this spike. So, it would appear that this has more to do with large-player strategic positioning than widespread main street adoption. The inflows were part of a trend that had been building through this year, not a one-off event. Government effects do exist, some regulations will reassure confidence in Bitcoin ETFs, but growth does look more driven by market conditions and institutional strategy. It is not the only driving force from the government side.

Well this is good for the asset management company. If ETF wasn't available and if the government had allowed investment on Bitcoin as cash equivalents, this money would have flown directly into the Bitcoin market. But due to ETF, companies are investing in it and not into the crypto market directly. It's a loss for us as the capital inflow is redirected to a middleman in literal sense.
