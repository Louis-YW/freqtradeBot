Now I’m faced with the fact that I can’t withdraw my coins from my wallet.I did the latest wallet update and also updated Ledger Live. When I try to send funds my Ledger freezes. What could be the problem?",

If you do get errors, try to see if it's one of those and follow the given steps[1]If that doesn't work, your option would be to import your seedphrase to a third party wallet as explained here[2]. Make sure to read the warnings, though.If you were mining, I'm guessing you had maybe hundreds or thousands of transactions. If I had to guess, I would say that's what causing the issue.[1] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7497812374941-Zcash-transaction-issues-in-Ledger-Live?docs=true[2] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/12434445524253-Access-Ledger-Zcash-account-with-third-party-wallet-YWallet?support=true",

The problem turned out to be that there were more than 1000 transactions on my ZEC address with small amounts of 0.05 ZEC. Following Tenant48's advice, I was finally able to withdraw a small amount of coins. Thank you very much for your help.",

The problem turned out to be that there were more than 1000 transactions on my ZEC address with small amounts of 0.05 ZEC.  1000 transactions to sign is an extremely big data chunk that doesn't fit memory area allocated  for  relevant operations by BOLOS in Ledger.  Thus splitting UTXOs  in smaller groups containing, let's say up to 20 transactions each, and withdrawing these groups separately   would be the wise approach to resolve your problem.",

      "body": "You got it to work, good. But just a general warning. OmegaStarScream's recommendation isn't bad in itself if there is no other way to get to your coins, but you should never import a cold wallet or hardware wallet seed into a hot wallet because you would be making the recovery phrase much less secure. Don't do it. If it must be done, move all your other more valuable coins (especially bitcoin) to an account on a securely generated seed elsewhere, and then proceed with the import of your old seed.",
