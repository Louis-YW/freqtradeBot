In this discussion, if you are speaking in the favour of a position it means you are automatically speaking against the other position at least this is exactly my own situation.So as a trader, I have discovered that there is a trading position that I get more comfortable and better chance for profit. This position is sell position. Yes, I have noticed it that I make profit more in sell position than it is for buy position and the reason for this I can not reach a reasonable or logical conclusion on. What I notice is that I have higher trust to get some flesh in the market while on sell mode despite I use the same ndicators and analysis for both buy or sell.So far the only reason I can give is that sell order is fall time or season as we know with bear. Then if the sell signifies fall time, I use to relate it with the second law of gravity, like an object with mass/weight that is falling down towards the earth. In this when I spot the sell position it just gives me that kind of comfort that whatever that has mass when thrown up most fall down and that the spotting of the sell order is that time for falling.Or could you say I'm more focuse at the bear time to get a proper signal for the second law of gravity relating to object with mass that fall downwards  What position do you make profit more and why ?",

Even though you mentioned that you profit more in opening sell positions other than having to buy more,  I may have a different opinion about that because if your entry price was above average and at the selling point you are going below average in asset DCA value it means selling at that position will not give you satisfaction since you will be on auto deficit due to price changes.",

That's why he decided to trade only when the market is down trend. Maybe the reason is that when there's selling pressure, no one is willing to buy to cover up the pressure most of the time. However, it still depends on the trader base on their experiences and backtests, because our strategy is not always working to them and vice versa. And also we have different way how we execute the trades. So wherever of the two is effective to you, you can do.",

With leverage trading, you can sell first, buy later with Short or buy first sell later with Long. In general, to close your position, you must have the pair of buy and sell, you can not have one but don't have another.With leverage, if you don't self close your position, exchange will do forced liquidation to complete it for you.You must not use Leverage as it is more risky than Spot. With any trading type and position, don't start it if you see risk is bigger than chance to get profit. Ratio of Profit : Risk should be 3 :1 at least. Risk means your cut-loss price.",

The reason why some people make more profit in trading while others encounter more losses is because those that make more profit either notice a winning strategy that works for them or keep trying it over and over again until they feel it's the best. maybe because they see more profit than loss with that strategy, but those who face more losses probably don't have any strategy yet or fail to realize what works best for them. So if the sell position makes you more profit, that is because you chose that position and you have fixed yourself in that position, but for me, between the buy and the sell positions, there was no side I let escape me. If there is no chance to make a profit in the sell position, there might be a great chance in the buy position, so I just can't let that chance slip through my fingers without placing a trade there. I almost make a profit with both positions, and it works so well, but the thing here is that I have not yet traded recently; I took a break for almost a year now due to some other activities.",

To be honest I pretty much make profit in both positions, but with short positions I have made far more profits than long ones. I must say that to make a profitable strategy has cost me a lot of losses, but with time I gained experience and courage to stick with the strategy and modify the parameters of some technical indicators and speculate the market. After that everything is going well for me.I think that shorting is far better than longing if you know the market very well. Because I have been doing it for a long time now and I must say that the thing is really profitable. But, you must know hedging technics in order to safely trade with a short position otherwise you will get liquidated soon.

I read some part of your analysis that it might be the trend which makes you profitable on sell side since the price action downward is high probably than upward since greed fear index is biased on fear side so only few buy on time like this.On the other hand if this is not related to the trend then it might be the psychological effect. Selling is very frequent in every trader since trade involves money that trigger fear when the price is going down. This is why a trader makes easier to sell at loss than in profit because greed makes us hold more while fear push us to sell. These are the factors that proves how sell orders is more dominant in normal days and bearish season unlike buy trade which only seasonal and highly related to bullish trend.",

All traders should think about is how to enter the right direction of the market whether buy or sell and short or long term. It is all about making money, not taking position records, and market changes.I've lost count of how many markets have traded and the number of buy and sell positions I'd entered. I can't just imagine myself bothering my brain with that. Traders should be flexible and dynamic, the music the market plays is what you dance to.Even the trading platform that can record such will have the months/years that buy positions would be more and sell positions would be more, so why waste your time on that?",
