That channel is worst before the moderator decided to level up there moderating security.Bitcointalk is the only forum that I know that allow all kind of opinion regardless of negative or positive as long as it was made in a constructive way which other forum doesn’t allow and only post that will benefit them.Just post it on Bitcoin Discussion or Trading Discussion to save your time on sharing your content to the public.",

Some Reddit group actually take them seriously and are strict with it, there are stipulated amounts of post karma you need to have to make a post and also comment karma you need to have to make commentsLike I said Reddit is transparent and some of those group put all this in their group rules which I suggest you always read first before posting, so it really doesn't first Matter the content of your post when you don't meet up with this your post automatically get deleted. After you have passed those rules then they look it's other rules like no spamming, no trolling and so on.You can also check the message sent to you by the moderator on the reason why your post was deleted make sure you aren't the one at fault before making your conclusions.",

That is also one of the reasons on why this forum (bitcointalk.org) is much more bigger and reputable compared to any other forum or discussion of BTCs.With their stringent rules, I doubt that the discussion there would be as meaningful compared here since no one can voice out their own opinions without them being tagged or the thread being deleted.I really suggest that instead of writing your message there, create a thread here and start a discussion. People here would most likely respond and share their thoughts on the topic that you will provide.",

Some blatantly favor some users / views more then others.On the flip side you can always create your own subreddit and mod it the way you like, so long as it does not violate the overall rules of Reddit.Personally, I think reddit does work well for some things but not others. There are a few crypo subreddits that I check in on now and then that ARE heavily modded and I like it that way. We may loose a valuable post, but on the flip side you are not digging through a ton of crap trying to find something. Take a look at the altcoin / token boards here to see what happens with only minimal modding.-Dave",
