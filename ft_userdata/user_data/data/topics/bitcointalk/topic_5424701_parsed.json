A group is trying to not just block Binance from getting a license but to ban it and file a case and impose penalties since many of my countrymen including me are using Binance. Although current exchanges here are improving, they are still miles behind what Binance offers like the lower fees, high volume, plenty of markets and it is easier to use. I can feel who's behind the movement since that company is not offering BNB or BUSD while it offers some coins that have lower values.Nonetheless, the news is still positive, especially for Brazilian crypto enthusiasts. Maybe the next debate is about letting Binance enter the Brazilian market.",

The newly signed law only makes crypto legal in Brazil and also move the country closer to embrace digital currency, is like making Brazil to be amongst other crypto countries per say.The bill was approved earlier this year by the senate but they were kind of dormant during because of the recent election, however the bill gained new urgency following the multibillion-dollar implosion of FTX.https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/brazilian-president-signs-bill-creating-crypto-regulations/",

It is expected that these functions will be shared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will be responsible for crypto assets classified as securities, and the Central Bank, which will be responsible for all other cryptocurrencies.Did you know that the new law criminalizes fraud using digital currencies? This is punishable by a fine and two to six years in prison.In addition, crypto companies are required to obtain virtual asset service provider licenses.However, since the law will come into force 180 days after its signing, it will not really be in force until June 20, 2023.

How about in india, when higher note rupees were discontinued?  Govt and banks pull all kinds of bullshit moves when they are trying to stop, discourage and/or dissuade people from moving to and/or using more sound forms of money.... Capital controls play into the matter too.. and many governments are very afraid in regards to people being able to move their value and/or to spend their value how they choose... so it does not seem accurate to be presuming that things are \"hunky-dorey\" in the world and the various forums of CBDCs are not going to continue to include coercive elements.Quote from: zasad@ on March 02, 2023, 09:31:17 AMBut I do not consider bitcoin to be a safe asset. Of course, bitcoin is not safe.. and the level of your safety with it depends on what \"attack vector\" you are trying to hedge against and/or offset, so it is up to you whether you believe bitcoin to be a hedge and/or one of the options that you want to \"take the chances\" of keeping.  Sure you can keep all of your value in traditional assets, and \"safe\" government approved assets, and find out how well that is going to do for you.. Maybe you will be fine?  You have to figure out those kinds of things for yourself concerning whether to allocate anything to bitcoin and if so, then how much to allocate - including how to store it.. and whether you trust third parties to hold your cornz or if it might be better to take some measures to hold your own.. .Quote from: zasad@ on March 02, 2023, 09:31:17 AMNow it is safe, but in the first 8 years, more than 15 million coins were mined, and manipulators own bitcoin. Sure since bitcoin came onto the scene 2009/2010 it hardly even had any market value.. so perhaps going back 8-10 years we could then start to trace bitcoin having more and more of a market value.. maybe 2011 or 2012 more and more ways to get bitcoin coming available for regular people and more developments that made it easier to hold it privately started becoming more popular and available in 2013/2014.  There have always been some manipulators in bitcoin, and the kinds of manipulators (or even the attacks on bitcoin) have become more sophisticated, including various attempts to facilitate some financial instruments (maybe we could call them paper bitcoins since they might be settled in dollars rather than in bitcoin) to be used as attempts to manipulate BTC's price downwardly, and so some of those financial instruments run risks of getting reckt, too... that is if the BTC price moves against them and they cannot stop it from moving up while throwing a lot of fiat at bitcoin in order to attempt to suppress the BTC prices (or maybe even fake bitcoins - or even some other bullshit behaviors like FTX and perhaps some other exchanges had been doing and not having the bitcoin that they claimed to have had).Quote from: zasad@ on March 02, 2023, 09:31:17 AMWhen everyone is convinced that bitcoin is the safest asset, then the manipulators can sell their coins. Bitcoin remains a baby.  NOT very many people own it.  You make your choices whether you want to participate in accumulating bitcoin, and if so how much and if so how you are going to attempt to protect your BTC holdings when you likely realize that outrageous BTC price moves (including to the downside) are not only likely but also likely to be inevitable (although we do not always have abilities to know where the bottoms are and when the are in and if there might be some points in which you are no longer able to get prices below certain price thresholds.. In early 2016, there was nearly 6 months of seeming desperation to keep prices below $500.. and then that battle ended up kind of continuing through the whole year, including in early 2017 there were a lot of DOWNity prognosticators that were saying that going back below $500 was inevitable.. and scared a lot of folks out of large portions of their BTC. .which surely did not work out very well for any of those who stuck to their position of waiting for sub $500 BTC prices to return.  We have a lot of those kinds of examples in bitcoin and some of those folks become bitter because they sell too much bitcoin too soon because they were filled with doom and gloom and negative thoughts that did not end up playing out and caused them to get reckt due to their failure/refusal to sufficiently and adequately prepare for UP - because they were too big of scaredy cats to consider that there were manipulators that would be able to get their way with bitcoin and it did not end up happening.  I expect that there will continue to be these kinds of periods and hopefully you do not allow yourself to be a casualty that fails/refuses to prepare for UP and keeps talking about downward possibilities that may or may not end up playing out.Quote from: zasad@ on March 02, 2023, 09:31:17 AMI analyze many coins, and if I were to make a new digital gold, then I would plan a more even emission of coins. Ethereum has even more fun, and 72 million coins have been printed. Tokenomics looks more like speculation to me.Fuck shitcoins.Ethereum is a scam and there is not any coin that comes even close to bitcoin in terms of whatever you may believe that you are studying in regards to \"tokenomics\".. and hopefully you sufficiently and adequately understand bitcoin.  Another thing to keep in mind in order to take over the incumbent position (which happens to be king daddy bitcoin), you better have something in the order of 10x improvement.. otherwise you are not likely to be able to do it.Hopefully, you are not allocating (or would it be wasting) too much of your time, energies and perhaps value in terms of investing into shitcoins.. and I saw a lot of this in earlier years, where people would hardly have any bitcoin, and I would suggest not going to below 10% allocations, if they wanted to dabble in shitcoins, so therefore maybe something like 90% bitcoin and 10% shitcoins would be about the maximum that I would suggest for those wanting to be adventurous in wasting their time, energies and values to fuck around with crap... (or maybe we could suggest it to be gambling?).. but hey, you do you, and if you think that you are using your time, energies and values wisely and prudently, then so be it. You have the right to exercise your own discretions regarding how to mange those kinds of investments... or maybe you just love the thrill of gambling, new things and you believe dumb propaganda about the various ways that the shitcoins are going to overtake bitcoin blah blah blah.Quote from: stompix on March 02, 2023, 10:02:05 AMHow things go downhill so fast:Mercado Bitcoin issues a token on Stellar Network, controlled by the government and on top of that we have......

Ethereum and its L2 solutions are used by many financial companies and government agencies, banks.Just because Ethereum and the other related projects are used by finance companies, government agencies and banks does not cause it to not be either a scam or a ponzi scheme.Quote from: zasad@ on March 05, 2023, 09:40:55 PMAs long as Ethereum is decentralized, and as long as this coin is decentralized, it will be in my portfolio. By definition proof of stake could not be decentralized... not only the theory of the matter, but also the practice of how the stake is used.  Another aspect is the pre-mine, so you are not even playing in a fair playing field if you do not know the quantity of tokens, but those with tokens are controlling various aspects of the policies regarding rewards of new coins are dished out and payments are confirmed and various other governing aspects of the scam chain.Quote from: zasad@ on March 05, 2023, 09:40:55 PMThe rules of the game in this ecosystem cannot be quickly changed.You sound delusional in terms of buying into the various mumbo jumbo and ongoing changes of the rules that happen in ethereum.. including the various ways that ethereum moved from proof of work to proof of stake.. and you are trying to suggest that those rules were established and or changed in decentralized ways.. what a bunch of baloney.. Yeah, of course, you have hope that your coin will pump.. so proof of pumpamentals remains amongst the most sought after feature for those holding such crap coins.. and also hoping that the rug doesn't get pulled and/or that the floor does not otherwise fall out at any point prior to being able to sell.  Long term holding is another thing... you are praying that you are \"in good hands,\"  I would imagine.Quote from: zasad@ on March 05, 2023, 09:40:55 PMA decentralized coin needs decentralized trading, and this is a big plus for the Ethereum ecosystem. I don't use centralized exchanges. For decentralized bitcoin trading, I need an intermediary.I suppose that there might be some interesting ways in which ethereum trading systems are being built.. but they are still reliant upon the base layer.. so it is likely best to consider that if you have anything that is claiming to be decentralized, you need to start from the base layer first.  By definition.. and logically thinking about the matter:  Centralized can be built upon decentralized, but decentralized cannot be built upon centralized... so it is best to think about and consider the solidness of the base first, prior to presuming that any subsequent layer is capable of being decentralized if it is built upon a centralized base.Quote from: zasad@ on March 05, 2023, 09:40:55 PMI do not use bitcoin for payment, the payment takes a very long time. I usually use Tron ecosystem or Polygon with low fees.Payment of what?   Goods and services?  or moving coins around?  or what?  I have not been buying goods and services with bitcoin very much, either.. Quote from: zasad@ on March 05, 2023, 09:40:55 PMI am not against bitcoin, but my forecast for the next 2-4 years is that ethereum will overtake bitcoin in terms of capitalization.Sure it could, and I see no reason for anyone to diversify in to ethereum, if they are weighing the potential upside that could happen in ethereum.It seems that the essence of the matter is that bitcoin is the king daddy of investments in the space, so the various shitcoins depend upon bitcoin in order to perform, and they would not be able to survive without bitcoin, so probably it is better to be invested in the king rather than some thing that is dependent upon it..**   but hey, you can do whatever you like if you believe that adding risk to your investment portfolio has decent odds of paying off better than merely investing in bitcoin. . .. and I am not sure if we got anywhere with any of this discussion, even though surely there are countries like Brazil that are experiencing the same kinds of beliefs as you in terms of their getting involved in various shitcoins and believing that those shitcoins might be able to outperform bitcoin and also hopefully they are considering the various downside risks too..of investing in various kinds of crap products that have quite a few weaknesses including their proof of stake mumbo jumbo that is confusing enough in terms of figuring out how the thing keeps going.. and the system staying afloat based on mumbo jumbo staking confusions regarding points of vulnerability too. and then what's going to happen when there is permission to start to unstake. even though they are trying to control runs on the bank too by the way that they allow unstaking.. a work in progress in terms of one way of preserving the ponzi scheme over the next while trying to maintain a theatre of decentralization and new/ongoing investors (or should we say gullible folks) propping up the house of cards.**It may well be worth highlighting that the vast majority of shitcoins, including ethereum, are affinity scam in their relationship to bitcoin, so in that regard, they frequently are trying to use the actual solid foundations of bitcoin and to cause people (especially newbs and other unwitting people.. and some of them even relatively smart people) to erroneously believe that they are sufficiently similar to bitcoin in order to be equal to bitcoin or better than bitcoin in one way or another that will cause them to go up in price/value... and the fact of the matter is that they would likely need to be at least 10x better than bitcoin to actually be able to take over the various solid value propositions of bitcoin.. so sure, there are likely some nice little bells and whistles that are provided by various other coins/shitcoins, and even with ethereum, it is possible that ethereum could end up doing some kind of a \"flippening\" on bitcoin, but that would not cause ethereum to overcome the many weaknesses that it maintains in terms of not really providing anything of value that is different from existing systems.. while causing people to believe that there may be something of value there.",
