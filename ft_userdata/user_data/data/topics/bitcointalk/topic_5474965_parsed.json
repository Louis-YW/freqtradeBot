I was able to check how gambling benefits relate to what HR officers look out for in a candidate before hiring them. There are 2 main benefit of gambling that improves the major skills people look out for in an employee in every offices. 1. Critical thinking: there have never been any job opening that doesn't require candidates to have this skill, because every company needs it to grow. And under critical thinking include skills like problem solving, idealist etc. 2. Socialization: Mainly the corporate world will call it interpersonal relationship. It's a very crucial skill anywhere we find ourselves in the world. And gamblers who participate in board games, easily develop the skill. When in the office, they'll always socialize and make friends with co-workers.Personally, I've experienced these two, in my daily conversation with people. And realized that my responses are now more effective than it used to be in the past, before I began gambling. I'd always think fast and respond accurately what the next person wants to hear. And most times it makes them laugh.  There are other benefits of gambling, and how it has helped your gambling life. It'll be great if you shared some of it with us. Cheers.",

It would be depending on what kind of gambling activity you are dealing with but since you are dealing with physical gambling on which you would be going against with other player then there's no doubt that you could be having that socialization but i dont see for it to be the sole reason on why you have enhanced yourself in speaking about socialization considering that we are dealing with thingson day to day basis on which we might not be aware that it is already enhancing our socialization with other people but if you do see that your gambling involvement did make out some changethen its good for you. Same goes for critical thinking on which its not only gambling that would be able to enhance your critical thinking on which we know that we could really be able to enhancethis thing naturally if we wanted to. This is why i would say that it is really that a little bit irrelevant if we do speak about enhancement of these specific areas of a person on which we know that these things could be acquired into other method and we might not really just that wary of it.",

People sitting in their neighborhood cafe or restaurant would play some card games to pass time and do something together. So it's an old tradition. But see, the thing is, you can talk and socialize even without playing cards. And also, online gambling doesn't really do much in terms of socializing. So especially when it comes discussing gambling with crypto, I think the effects of this specific benefit aren't that noteworthy.",

There are two kinds of gamblers, one is extrovert and the other one is introvert.  Maybe you have encountered lots of introverted gamblerss, the reason why you stated that these people are scared of socialization but if you happen to be a frequent visitor of a gambling establishment, you will found out that most people who are hanging on the gambling vicinity loves to interact with other people.  Some even make offline casinos as hangout and one way to meet new friends.Quote from: dothebeats on November 21, 2023, 08:43:26 PMI myself am not a social gambler, and would rather sit in an empty room and gamble and make my analyses and predictions there.

Like me! I just turn off my brain whenever I play simple games like dice, crash, slots, blackjack, heck even poker. In sports gambling, though I do indeed try to delve into the deeper side of things when it comes to matchups, but it's not to the point where companies would hire me really just based on that. Might've helped a bit when developing it but that's about it. As for socialization, don't really count online conversations for my side really. It just feels different in real life, and I mostly suck at it so I know. Even in instances where I gambled in some local casinos I don't really do small talk with people.",

And whatever it is, even though they often complain about their gambling activities, this does not make them stop their gambling activities and in fact people like this continue to increase their hopes that gambling can change their lives.And if we talk about critical reasoning power and social skills, this is indeed quite important so that we can become better gambling players. Because with sharp critical reasoning, this will enable us to make quite mature analyzes and calculations.And with good socialization skills, this will make it easier for us to search for and find information and solutions.",

There's no such thing as critical thinking with those games. You just play the game and let the system decide if you are lucky or not. Sure, there are benefits to gambling and one of those is how to be responsible with your money and being careful with it. We gamblers somehow know the importance of spending it because we don't want to just throw away money on a bet that we know is on the losing side. Sports bettors especially do care a lot about their bets. They do deep analysis and try to enhance their chance of winning by reading articles and looking at the history of teams and players so that they can make sure the money they will be risking will have a better chance to gain double or maybe even better in parlays.",

Gambling with friends is one of the multiple factors. Provided we hang out and discuss with people, our interpersonal skill may increase. Yet, we require critical thinking to contribute effectively to conversations and answer difficult questions. Thereby, building more network with mutual friends. Communicating with new people in the gambling house, helps us create a feeling of not being afraid to begin a conversation with people we just met. It could end well or be the best conversation we've ever had. Gambling helps me to think better, especially black roulette game, which I play in my private time. It's one game that improves my brain power to reason uniquely, when required to hit an outside the box idea. And these skills are not common kind of skills you can read in books and master them, without practicing it. Yes, solving mathematical exercises, taking quiz etc can help critical thinking. But, this thread is showing the benefits of gambling as regarding critical thinking. Not saying it's the only form of being a critical thinker. Isn't it great that we learn and boost our skills through gambling? same activity everyone thinks, nothing good can be made out of it.",

Religious laws that prohibit gambling prevent individuals from having the right to do so on a societal scale. Given the harm that gambling is capable of causing, it cannot be considered a factor for social harmony.I believe that practicing table gambling is not an expression of sociality because its participants are characterized by great individualism.
