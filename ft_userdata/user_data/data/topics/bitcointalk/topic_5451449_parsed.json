Whatever is the total amount that they've collected before launching calculated with its supply then that determines its price. But I could be wrong on this one so CMIIW.2. Well, most of these investors before the launching they all one got big plan and goal and that's to sell and dump it as soon as it's listed on any exchange where it will be headed. That's why, if you're quite late on this one, you may not be able to profit. But if you've missed the price before the launching and you're probably hyped in by its current situation, you may want to continue observing it before buying.",

Also, the project owners could decide to list their token at $1, but after listing at the mentioned price and the token seems to have a lot of exposure, or should I say a lot of waiting investors waiting to pump in money and buy the token, the price could move from the $1 listing price to $2.5 or more (immediately after it gets listed or after some times). But if the token has no much exposure, and perhaps there are a lot of early investors already who have bought from the ICO or even some people who earn the token for free, they may be waiting for the day the token will get listed so that they can sell, so perhaps if the token also gets listed at $1 each, and let's say there are a lot of people ready to sell compared to just a few numbers willing to buy, the price of the token will crash from $1 to $0.Whatever.So if a token was sold for a few cents during the pre-sale, then after it got listed on Binance or some tire one exchange, the price spiked, definitely because there were more people buying the token and also because there was enough liquidity for as many investors who were selling the token.Quote2/ In your experience, is it a good idea to buy a chip the second it is listed for a profit?Thanks for clarifying.This is a decision you need to make for yourself. I have tried it before, but I was unlucky because it did not favor me. I spent $300 to buy a token immediately after it got listed, and for some time the price was fluctuating until it kept going down. I was so impatient because I was really losing money on that investment, so I sold at a loss. I lost about $100. (Although I made a profit of about $50 but I guess I was expecting more, so I still wait until I lost it and also lost about $100+ of my capital).",

      "body": "There are numerous factors actually. I have observed the intensity of social marketing, airdrops, third party site publications and most importantly the % participant in the ICO sales. Now the last factor is bit tricky. In case of social marketing you can understand the analytics however, in case of ICO sales, the figures could be misleading. They are not indicative of real value. For example, owners/founders could deceive the investors by sending their own money from various addresses and thus doing an insider job to create a fake demand in the market. Since we put the anonymous thing next inline when it comes to the crypto investments, we are doomed by it's usage during investments such as above one.Such fake shit can hamper the coin's value at alarming rate during the listing. Moreover, it also depends on which exchanger it is going to list. Usually I have seen well known exchangers will create a hype before few days of listing some coins. Peeps actually start investing during that period as well considering its getting listed on popular exchanger. These are most common factors but not limited to this one.",

Nobody determine the price of a token launch, it all depends on the demand and supply of the token but ofcourse, there is a listing price especially when there is a presale, seed sales for venture capitals and also public sale. The price in which this tokens are sold to investor before listing them vary because of allocations and also priority and when they plan to go public listen, they make sure it doesn't go below the public which is always slightly higher than other sales. When the token are been distributed, not everyone get the opportunity to buy before listing, so traders fomo to buy as soon as it get listed and that is how the price pump and the demand and supply determine how far the price will go. SUI for example was sold for whitelisted investors for $0.03 and initial exchange offering for $0.1 and it is now trading at $1.29.2. It depends on how long you plan to hold, if you buy when a token is listed, there is usually short term pump if they are IEO conducted tokens and also in bull market, it is advisable but don't try it during bear market, most traders sell quickly as soon as they make some profit.",

If you are not able to buy during pre-sale, better not to rush buying it during the listing, its ok to wait for a week for the price to stabilize, and with SUI right now, its pretty cheap compare to its ATH hence a great time to accumulate.",

The team's dedication, influence marketing, the project's fundamental concept, potential, listing on liquidity provider exchange, and slam everything with some hype.This is all the exact thing the team involved in the SUI token did and if the project didn't have the needed longevity trust me all the bullish will end in the next market correction. If you can take risk you can take the risk of quick buy and sell but I will advise you not to go for crypto if you're not sure about its future position in the market for quick profit instead invest in BTC.",

Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. It will totally depend on valuations.When the team do the pre-sale themselves, their offers first come first serve percentage quantity buying and also give those early investors a lot of bonuses as early adopters, while the price of the token/coin at pre-sale changes at different stages of the token sale up until the closing of token sell period which places a token price about 30% less to it exchange listing price. The team have the sole right to set the tokens listing price,  and the exchange have little role to perform in that since the token teams are the one providing the liquidity for the token on the exchange,  and even in the situation of price pump, the team supply the liquidity, not the exchange.",

And then from there an exchange can get maybe 50% of that value so that someone actualy wants to buy it.And it will end up trading for 0.01 - 0.03 $ instead of 0.1$ which presale investors payed. This can fluctuate massively, thats why crypto is not a fast game, sometimes you need to wait months or years to turn a profit.2.All depends on the coin in question , sometimes it is.

Because as Dr.Bitcoin_Strange has already mentioned the listing price of a token can move up or down immediately after the listing. But i would like to mention important factors that caused a token price;Hype that creates high demandCirculating supply which of sui is 5% and it is less supply that increases the price for the short termListing of tokens on recognized CEXs that can be easily accessible by most of the crypto maniacs.Who are the investors and partners of the projectUse-case of the project, like, does it meet the new trend?Quote from: Sun2k on May 05, 2023, 06:45:48 PM2/ In your experience, is it a good idea to buy a chip the second it is listed for a profit?No, you should not do that because who knows to which extent a candle will go like the listing price of sui let's take was 1.37$ something, and then if the weight of buying is more than selling in the first candle then its price will always go up like for sui it goes up to $4 dollars and then in the same candle it came down to $1.3.  This indicates that we should not play with fire and should wait to cool it down. Because what if for the sake of profit, you bought it for around $4 dollars and that was the maximum potential it have to touch and after that, it never tries to break that potential then what will you do rather than bear the pain? So play cool and be patient.",

In some cases, the price may be determined by the project team or through an auction process, but ultimately it is the market that determines the token's valueOverall, the price of a newly listed token can be highly volatile and unpredictable, and there is no guarantee that the price will continue to rise after the initial listing. for this moment many are waiting and may be tempted to buy tokens once registered in the hope of making a quick profit.    but this strategy is often risky.",

The projects become immediately sold out if the price is deemed to be too good for the project. Some times the projects don't get sold out too and it can be from negative assessment of what they tend to bring to the market.
