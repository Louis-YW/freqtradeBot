I don’t understand your question, mate.I mean I get from the title you are asking about future roles of bitcoin in finance but then on your actual post it’s almost impossible to tell what you’re actually talking about. Anyway bitcoin’s role in finance is obvious. It is to serve as an alternative to fiat and serves as an investment opportunity for people.",

But I'm gonna gloss over that fact and humor the title of your thread instead as a baseline for this comment. If you'll ask me, it's not bitcoin who will play a large role in the future of finance, crypto is. Bitcoin has run its mileage and is basically nothing more than a glorified hedge fund at this point where we can make massive amounts of money out of whenever we feel the need to. The rest of the crypto industry though can still be mobilized to make a lot of changes in the way we think about money, loans, and economy in all senses of the word. Even now, we're seeing a lot of these premonitions per se of how the economy would move if it's powered by cryptocurrency. Hope that we get to live long enough to see that future though, I have a lot of faith in how crypto could shape the economy to be more for the people in the future, judging by the fact that a huge number of beneficial cryptocurrencies on the market are decentralized and are definitely not controlled by a central government or body.",

Bitcoin is just the first step that opens the door where traditional finance must be able to open the eyes that there is technology that can be followed in terms of managing finances today. Bitcoin is the originator of a better financial world, even though previously there was a same system, Bitcoin still comes with all the answers. If traditional finance remains steadfast in maintaining its system, it will be left behind and fiat will increasingly lose its value.",

For me, the only thing that we should anticipate for bitcoin to do is if bitcoin becomes globally accepted/adopted or even better, becomes a legal tender.",

If you are going on that tradition, banking will definitely suffer from many challenges that can even make them go bankrupt. Some of these challenges include: 1. Decreased in transactions: this is simple and self-explanatory of bitcoin becoming the main source of higher transactions in the future. The traditional banks will have a reduction in people that transact with them, and that is capable of causing them low revenue for the banks, which will make it very hard for them to sustain and run the banks. 2. Security and fraud from scammers: traditional banks will be in danger from scammers, so they have to increase their security measures in order to be protected against some bitcoin-related fraud because bitcoin is something that requires knowledge, and many scammers are trying to use this opportunity in other for them to scam other people who are willing to join. If this happens, traditional banks will definitely create another strong strategy of security that will prevent their customers from facing such incidents.",

When you talk about the challenges that it's going to face, I think Bitcoin has already faced all the challenges as the banks have attacked its existence over the years and have seen that there is nothing that could be done to it again; they have started embracing it, and even the government has been passing bills and regulations regarding its trading and holdings. The only people that will have more challenges to face aside from the ones that they are already facing are the broker operators. Regulations are not being made in their favour; they are being billed and asked questions by different government agencies.",

The traditional banks will have a reduction in people that transact with them, and that is capable of causing them low revenue for the banks, which will make it very hard for them to sustain and run the banks.Bitcoin has its cap in block size and maximum transactions per block and if Bitcoin protocol won't have upgrade, it will not be able to handle massive new demands from bank users who switch from bank systems to Bitcoin blockchain.Bitcoin will be competed by altcoin blockchains with cheaper transaction fees and higher TPS (transactions per second). I love Bitcoin but this fact can not be denied. Bitcoin takes out customers from bank systems but altcoins will take many users from Bitcoin too. For transactions, they will choose what gives they cheaper transaction fees if the transaction value is not big enough, to force them thinking of security and risk of reversibility of their transactions.Quote2.

Scammers can scam in both bank system and Bitcoin blockchain or altcoin blockchains. It's wrong to say they only can scam in bank system and can not do the same with Bitcoin blockchain or altcoin blockchains. People who lack of knowledge or are careless will be more easily scammed with any system.Bitcoin can not do everything, replace bank system, fix economic problems, beat scammers, it can not be a magic tool to do everything.",

A transparent government system developed with Bitcoin or any such technology is going to distribute the power in the hands of the public even though there are many possibilities to manipulate it as well just like ETFs today, still, it can be a major threat to their desires on the same a single ruling payment mode/currency stands no chance at all, today china has conflicts with the USA, USA has with Europe, Middle East with X, Pakistan with India and much more.Do you really think there can be any system in such a narrow-minded setup, to revolutionize the finance for the betterment of Humanity? I do support Bitcoin even though I love Bitcoin and Satoshi that there's hope for a system where we can eliminate or at least suppress the 99% of this shity interest-based economy.Edit: Sorry for the small political touch in the post ignore it if you don't like it, if you still cant then what can I do  .",
