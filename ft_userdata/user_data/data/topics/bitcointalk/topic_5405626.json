  "content": "The current situation of cryptocurrency market is disturbing to cryptocurrency traders, investors and users but, affected exchanges are taking cold decisions. Recently, 2gether just sent an email across their users that says; QuoteAfter five years of serving the crypto community, we are forced to close the private account service. The lack of resources and the crypto winter prevent us from providing the service with the quality and guarantees [with which] other nearby providers are doing it.This action affected about 100,000 users that trusted the service of this exchange. And, their funds are held on the exchange. They went further to urge users to pay a fine of $20.35 to keep their accounts active, and failure to comply will get such account suspended. ( Maybe they'll be back in future)Though the Spanish Financial users association is about to take a legal action in the name of all the users of the exchange. And, such situations will give regulators a better reason to regulate cryptocurrency. Exchanges are getting hurt during the bear market, why can't they hold? or maybe borrow some funds to finance their exchange while waiting for the market to correct. https://news.bitcoin.com/spanish-exchange-2gether-blocks-operations-affecting-100000-users/",

( Maybe they'll be back in future)This is robbery, pay 20 euros or have your account closed and funds confiscated?Where the hell do these guys think they are operating, Bartovia?QuoteThe platform had already made headlines in August 2020 after suffering a cyberattack that ended with the theft of 114  bitcoins  and 276 ethers,  equivalent to 1,183 million euros in cryptocurrencies  at the exchange rate at that time. At that time,  it did not have the necessary funds to cover what was stolen  from its clients' accounts, so in January 2021, the startup managed to raise 1.5 million euros in a financing round, an amount that was used to reinforce the security of the company and its coverage model, as well as to replace the stolen funds.Another website is mentioning something even more interesting:Quote Since 2017 the company has received different rounds of financing. As detailed in its 2020 accounts, 2gether had short- and long-term debts amounting to 3.14 million euros. The platform obtained 200,000 euros of financing from Lanzadera, the accelerator created by Juan Roig. It also obtained one million euros from Cecabank, through a convertible participatory loan. From Cecabank they point out that the exposure they have on the platform is reduced and that it is provisioned as it is an “extremely prudent environment”. It also received funding from the Ministry of Science (286,000 euros) and Abanca (300,000).So basically in all their existence, all that has done was to burn through investors' funds and grants and now they are trying to use customers' funds to keep the sinking boat from becoming a full-fledge submarine.Quote from: Accardo on July 08, 2022, 03:16:31 PMExchanges are getting hurt during the bear market, why can't they hold? or maybe borrow some funds to finance their exchange while waiting for the market to correct.Exchanges make money out of trades, if there are no trades there is no income, if you pay yourself outrageous salaries, advertising, and office rents way over your income you go bankrupt, and that applies to bullish seasons too. Just because your business is based on crypto and bitcoin is a long-term profitable investment it doesn't mean your business will be too. Bullion Direct went bankrupt despite all it had to do was reselling precious metals at a profit, yet they've failed at doing so.",
