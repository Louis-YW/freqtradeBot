For example if we take the decision of trying to dump then it will be happening so early that the crypto market will crash far earlier than expected. So we only need to behave normal and do whatever we want to do as normal and live our lives and that recession will naturally happen then the economy will get back than dumping in panic and forcing the market bear to come early.

But if they're really better than those billionaires, why don't they get rich? I mean they can make predictions about the development of an economy, then they seize the opportunity to enrich themselves. I don't believe there is anyone who doesn't want to become rich, their purpose as an economist is also for money. Everyone's advice is completely helpful or sometimes not, billionaires if not good, can't become billionaires.",

Inflation which leads to high cost of goods and services might reduce the spending power of most people, thereby discouraging them from investing in the crypto market. Apart from diversifying ones skills or income, it might also be good to cut down on expenditure. Families should ensure that as they increase their income and their expenses should be low to a large extent. Spending more than your income this period would lead to disastrous debt. Regarding the advice of Jeff Bezos, I just bought a new deep freezer because it would help me to save more money. Buying food items in bulk and storing in the refrigerators have been one of the ways my family have cut some expenses this period.",

      "body": "When financial advisors lack good advice, they preach diversification. Throw your money at everything and hope something works! The same principle could apply to inflation and economic recession atm.Commodities were one of the first options people turned to when discussions of \"transitory inflation\" arose. Real estate was another hot topic, although with the steep decline in home loans a housing crash is expected despite abysmal levels of new real estate construction. While there is a relatively new thing called fractional real estate investment which can allow small cap investors to invest in real estate, I'm not certain whether or not those small cap shares are too diluted.Which leaves the best option for most being entry level commodities. The price of lumber has exhibited several massive spikes recently starting with COVID in 2020. It is possible that wood, lumber and trees are all deflationary assets. Considering they are being cut down at a far faster rate than they can be replenished. To add to price strains, firewood has become a well performing asset during winter as many search for alternatives to heat their homes. While gold, silver, platinum and other high priced commodities might exist outside the reach of most investors. Metals may not be the best commodities market to invest in. Technology and mining methods are constantly improving. Allowing for minerals and metals to be stripped from the earth more quickly and efficiently.I think wood and lumber might be a decent asset class given them being long term deflationary. Even if people wanted to regrow lost forest, they couldn't do it as they would lack space. The quantity of arable land on the planet shrinks every year leaving less available space to regrow lost trees. Even if we have a current influx of lumber which is temporarily maintaining an affordable price for lumber. Over the long term I think the chart will correct and the price will rise.",

Usually during a global recession, we will see a huge number of job cuts which will create cash flow issues within economy. So the chances are very slim to see an influx into crypto market. Rather, we may see a lot of people trying to sell their crypto assets for survival regardless of what the interest rate is. The key here is money! What the economists say is very simple - have some cash in hand or in such assets which you can sell off at any time to maintain the cash flow at hand. Currently all major companies are firing people in order to reduce their operating cost and trying to figure out a bare minimum structure to keep the operations on. This is not really sending out a good sign to be honest!",

It will be worse for some countries and better for others, just like it will hit some people harder than others, but it will be a tough time. As for cryptos, they are not directly dependent on the global economy (sure, people need to have funds to spare on buying cryptos, but the market is small enough that even a very small amount of those capable of doing that will do). The market is currently down, but I don't see why Bitcoin can't reach its new ATH in, say, a year, while the global economy is still going down. We can't rely on that happening, we can't know how it will go. So preparing for an economic crisis if one has a way of doing that is reasonable, but maybe crypto investors will have it better than others, we'll see.",
