He contributed to this forum in old days. The merit system wasn't introduced back then. He got 500 Merits from Airdrop and earned another two merits from his quality post. Right after the Introduction of merit and the End Of CPU/GPU mining of BTC, He completely disappeared from this forum. Because He was here to do business with his Mining service and he also took some loans back then. This was his last post to this forum;Quote from: tomos81 on March 29, 2018, 07:17:26 AMhi , quick update from holiday:- ETN is still not fixed, waiting for that cryptopia bug fix- other markets are quiet because of bitcoin price, waiting for btc price growing ( i hope tuesday will start to grow)- i will start to work on new payment system right when i will return from holidays (tuesday) - will pay everything i will sell in pieces -  it means i will split sold satoshis based on user shares, deduct a piece of mined hashes and pay to faucethub..  this way i will be able to compensate everything in few weeks.cheersWe don't know if he is alive or not.

I can't jump to conclusions for all the evidence you said, maybe he has changed hands and is sold but maybe he just started something new to earn a few dollars from the signature campaign.The problem is, you have to give him chance to speak up and prove ownership of his account for while, that can be done by signing message from the bitcoin address he once used.You can expect him to sign messages from this address:Code:1DnWG7sL7yWekSS11nZsNNnxyWrwtHNYRs1ETKDyudqno5HLMCE4ngxARjmKPhe7fn41",

Yes, they will ignore the request but they are active everywhere to post something. We basically have no right to force someone to respond to anything we suspect about them, including signing messages or anything like that. But if these defendants want to neutralize the situation so that people no longer doubt it then they will come to respond.However, if you have valid evidence to say that the account has changed hands regardless of how it happened, then I just want you to be able to prove it. without needing to tell them about it. After all, you also don't have much evidence at this time to determine that the account has changed hands, but if you have any doubts about them, post neutral tag so you can avoid dealing with them in the future.",

Covid-19 has destroyed a large part of the economy but is quickly starting to grow and improve, but inflation has forced people to earn more even though they actually have primary jobs.I've said that one can change quickly when they need money [remember this one], but one can always doubt that accounts change hands regardless of whether they are sold or hacked. You can tag them with evidence, but I'm not going to pull out a gun quickly until I have valid evidence.

Deep down I feel a little sorry for him.But we see a lot of cases on the forum of wanting to take the fast track to make money, and that's not how things are done. In this forum you can earn money by being a decent person, without cheating, without buying accounts. There are countless examples of this. This is what account buyers are counting on. While you feel sorry for him, he continues to writhe like a \"snake in a pan\" and use all methods, from impudence to humiliation. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404539.msg60805776#msg60805776In fact, using all methods costs them nothing. Some particularly compassionate members of this forum argue by defending purchased accounts as accounts that do no harm to anyone as long as they are not involved in financial transactions. But on the other hand, we can see how real users work diligently to increase their rank. Why should we pity these liars?Sir you can believe me without doubt, I am not lying. I am the actual owner of this account. It's kind of oppressive to me. I beg you not to make me a liar. Please remove my feedback if you know but don't call me a liar. Finally I thank everyone. 😭😭😭😭😭",
