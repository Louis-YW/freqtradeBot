In the aspect of people getting access to your device when lost, by even entering your banking app, unless that persons knows your password or pin. No how they can have the access unless you give them.",

Because there has been several occasions of hacks from bank over the years and most of it is as a result of carelessness of the owner of the account. For example leaving your account information on your phone without locking your phone can be implicating. Sometimes we should completely remove things that will implicate us by deleting bank security detail on phone. rather write it on paper and keep in a safe place, in other not to get hacked when your phone get missing or when we release our phones to people. Quote from: MorganaX on December 14, 2023, 09:40:11 PMIf the phone gets missing, can you block the account?No,I think you can call there customer support center. Even if they don't have branches does not mean that dey can not attend to there costumers when it comes to security. I think when dealing with online banking we should deal with those that has license or CBN approval just like opay. Quote from: MorganaX on December 14, 2023, 09:40:11 PMif your phone gets missing and you’re using an online bank it will be easily hacked or they can easily take all your money while other banks, if you’re phone or ATM card gets missing you can go to their office and lay a complain and they will close down the account or card.One important thing you should know is that online banking system should not be a place to put all your funds, it is just like an alternative to banking system incase there is a network issue in normal bank you can run mini transaction on it like pay bills, recharge cards, buy data and some other things but no to put all your funds in. But I don't think hacking online account is possible just as i said earlier. It depends on how secured you are on releasing your privacy.",

But with the help of online banking people were able to navigate to other easier ways of banking so online banking has really improve a lot of things.",

We all were  withness during the cashless era this online banks were the mostly used as most busines men did their huge daily transaction with this online banks like the OPay and PalmPay.This online banks are licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and all trustworthy to use. Being licensed by CBN means the government has done close research and have their eyes on them incase they try to fraud.I also believe with time this online banks will soon develop into having their own office, I heard something about Opay already working on that, so have no fears doing transactions with them.Yes, there is every tendency of them getting hacked but it is as low as that of any other Banks getting hacked.",

When you have problem with these online banks and you contact the customer care service their response is is much more faster than the offline customer care service in the banking hall. In the banking hall, they will waste your time for unnecessary things. But for online banks they will go straight to the main point and solve your problem. They are agents for the online microfinance banks which they use to attend customers in their various offices across the country. No bank is from hacking. But the firewall of the site will determine the security of the site. They can't be hacked. Their security is tight.",

They have customer care helpline where you can reachout in case of losing mobile & even if you lose mobile the person who finds it cannot access your account without the passcode which would be similar to ATM withdrawal or net banking.

Many people don’t like online because it doesn’t have any office you can run to in case of any issues. How you go talk like that, I just do some rough browsing and Access bank get around 50 million plus customers while Opay wey be the highest fintech bank get around 40 million plus customer. Judging by their years of existence, Opay dun do well pass Access bank but other fintech aren't doing close to those numbers so although online banks dey do very well dem never take over the physical banks completely but they're on the path of doing just that. For this topic, yes online banks are good but just as I talk for a similar thread, make we no just close eye dey use this banks or apps them. You know that talk wey dem dey say when eating with the devil use a long spoon, na wetin we suppose dey do here.Everything wey you fit do for offline banks you can do with online banks and even more so your argument no stand here. Online banks are good and they're doing Nigerian a big favour especially cryptocurrency traders because without them eh the kind lack of trust wey for full P2P exchange and spoil the whole thing for us due to poor network for be problem. All banks can be hacked so this one no be points but if you put in some external security measures you fit avoid all those worries wey you dey get. Fintech Banks are just better than our traditional banks that's the fact.",

Also, all accounts can be hacked, if the owners of those accounts misplace some vital details of those accounts to scammers or fraudsters wether is an online account or a regular commercial bank account it doesn't matter.",

Many people don’t like online because it doesn’t have any office you can run to in case of any issues. Op, have you researched to conclude that fintech banks have more customers than commercial banks? With banks like GTB, Access bank, First bank, and Zenith Bank you can still carry out online banking with them. Fintech bank like Opay is good to use due to their low charge, and convenience, and they are licensed by the CBN and insured by NDIC. Since fintech banks are yet to establish a physical office where their customers can lay a complain you can just use them to receive money, after receiving the money you move the money to your main bank account in case anything happens, it will not affect you. QuoteCan it get hacked?I would actually say yes it can get hacked. It’s very easy to hack online banks. All banks can be hacked. Once you expose your login details to scammers or fraudsters your bank account will be hacked and you will lose your money be it our traditional bank or fintech bank. Do not keep your banking App as always login so that if you misplace your phone someone else will not get access to your account through your banking App. QuoteIf the phone gets missing, can you block the account?No, if your phone gets missing and you’re using an online bank it will be easily hacked or they can easily take all your money while other banks, if you’re phone or ATM card gets missing you can go to their office and lay a complain and they will close down the account or card.If your Opay ATM card goes missing you can block the ATM card with your Opay account. Just call Opay customer service they will direct you on how to block your Opay ATM card with your Opay App. Even in our traditional banks, if your phone goes missing and you don't act fast you will lose your money if the phone falls into the wrong hands.",

I think the only aspect you may not be comfortable with is the reliability which is because you go talk say them no get physical office and if them hack their server for instance, how you fit reclaim back your savings, yeah?Now before you go fit operate an online banking, e no be easy thing and na why you go find out say no be every Tom, Dick and Harry they fit run am. As you they see say the traditional banking difficult, na so online banking be in terms of establishment and management.Now before you go fit establish an online banking for Nigeria, you for suppose make sure say you understand and comply with the regulatory requirements wey CBN they set for the banks. You fit check this document wey carry the heading  “Guidelines on Electronic Banking in Nigeria”, you go understand say no be just like that them they establish but they must to follow due processes too to get approval.Aside CBN own, NIBSS too get their own “Legal and Regulatory Framework of Electronic Payment Systems” amongst other regulatory frameworks wey you go suppose follow to establish and manage your online or electronic banking platform for Nigeria. These bodies they always update their list and frameworks and if those online banks no meet up, them go ban them come restrict people from patronizing them.This mean to say that those banks must also be fully equipped and up to park with the technological infrastructure and security measures of the platforms. So, for instance, if people fit raise eyebrows on the secure of a banking platform now, it won't take a time before the bank will be shut down. More importantly, there will be a deposit of capital and commitment made by the company to be able to get started.",

So thinking that online bank are unsafe due to security breach is just a silly excuse, because I believe even the commercial banks can be hack and before now that online banks were not this popular, many people and I have witnessed many myself, have complianed that someone hack their account and sometimes it may be to the ignorance of the owner of account. If Bitcoin wallet and transaction which are said to be decentralized and more tightly secure can be hacked then what are online banks and commercial banks that are controlled by human and bankers like me and you that cannot be hacked. Because I liked to believe that most times, if an account information is leaked the bankers are widely involved in it.",

So my question is that is online bank good? Is it safe? These are the questions I ask and some people normally ask. Many people don’t like online because it doesn’t have any office you can run to in case of any issues. I will say that online banks are good and they have helped a lot of people when the physical banks network are on downtime for a long time. They pay more attention to their networks than physical banks and this has made many people to switch to using them than the physical banks we have in the country today. About their safety, they all claim that they are safe but the words of mouth isn’t enough to back their claim of safety that they are assuring their customers with. Don’t leave money in them for too long or use it as your savings account, that’s the best practice to apply if you’re use to using the online banks.QuoteIf the phone gets missing, can you block the account?No, if your phone gets missing and you’re using an online bank it will be easily hacked or they can easily take all your money while other banks, if you’re phone or ATM card gets missing you can go to their office and lay a complain and they will close down the account or card.Some of the online banks now make use of USSD code that you can use to access your account without the bank application in your phone. If your phone is stolen, you can renew your sim and immediately block the account from your phone. The security of the banks are increasing that I am sure of, but you can’t totally depend on them. Whatever you want to use them for, try and trade carefully to avoid disappointments. I love using them more than the physical banks we have even when CBN is giving them hard time to operate in the country now.",
