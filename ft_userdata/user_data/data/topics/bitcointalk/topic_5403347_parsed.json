  "content": "According to WhaleStats data, Shiba Inu is now the largest held crypto asset for the top 100 Ethereum whales after USDC, while Ethereum (ETH) retains the number one spot. According to data provided by the blockchain data tracker, the top 100 ETH whales now hold $423,180,380 worth of Shiba Inu, or 15.55% of their holdings. Circle's Stablecoin, USDC, on the other hand, accounts for 18.08%, or $491,815,225 worth.Â In the past week, U.Today reported that the percentage of long-term holders was 19%. This number has increased to 21% as Shiba Inu ''hodlers'' continue to increase.According to the IntoTheBlock's holders' composition by time held, 21% of SHIB holders have held onto their tokens for more than a year, 76% have held within a year, while 3% have held onto their tokens for less than a month. As Shiba Inu's population continues to grow, mid-term holders have also been redistributed.The number of Shiba Inu holders has seen immense growth in recent months, reaching 1,184,559 at press time, according to WhaleStats data. Shiba Inu dipped to a low of $0.0000071 on June 18 amid the latest crypto market declines. At the time of publication, SHIB was trading up nearly 4% at $0.00000815. Per the Shibburn Twitter handle, over 83,335,225 SHIB tokens have been burned within the last 24 hours, and nine transactions have been made. According to the Shibburn website, a total of over 95,183,018 SHIB have been burned. The Shiba Inu team published an update on its most recent blog post as Shibarium prepares for a possible launch.Shibarium is a Layer 2 solution developed by xFUND and Shiba Inu developers, with BONE set to be the Shibarium Protocol's \"gas.\" This \"gas\" will provide the essential functionality for smart contracts and transactions to be processed and executed.BONE, one of Shiba Inu's ecosystem tokens, currently has a fixed supply of 250 million. The community is now about to decide whether to halt BONE farms once the 230 million supply has been met or to increase the maximum supply from 250 million to 270 million.

If the number of whales grows and wallets increase, then nothing prevents them now to play this combination again. Buy some cheap coins, then steamroll that token and give it away to hamsters at inflated prices, and so on until they get bored. The scheme is proven and very well proven among shitcoins",

      "body": "it seems like that the whale was picking this token rather than doge coin with infinite supply. That makes sense if whales are gambling with this token. Doge is not worth to hodl for long term as this coin is always inflating so fast. Is this another signal from the next manipulation from the whale? This can also be considered as an accumulation for the whale. I think that if this thing already reported so many times by various press like cointelegraph or etc. Just let the whale to do what they wanna do",

While USDC has seen currency trading going above $500 million in the past few days, Shiba Inu has been rising at a commensurate scale that shows it is quickly becoming one of the hottest trading assets in the crypto ecosystem.This is the first time Shiba Inu has taken the number one spot from USD Coin on WhaleStats. Considering Shiba Inu was created as a joke dog meme, it's pretty surprising to see just how popular the Shiba is with ETH holders. Hopefully this only means good things for Ethereum bulls going forward.",
