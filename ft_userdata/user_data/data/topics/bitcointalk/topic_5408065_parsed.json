But, it becomes severe when other data signalling decline in economic activities.",

The term is typically used to describe a cycle that goes on for six months or more and lasts at least two quarters. In light of the Commerce Department's announcement that GDP declined by 0.9% in the second quarter, a second consecutive quarter of contraction, many are declaring the U.S. economy in recession. But, is it really? I don't think it's that simple.",

However it seems that America requires some other criteria to additionally qualify - like the unemployment rate rising during the same time period. It slightly makes sense, however we seem to be in this bizarre netherworld where all the indicators are flashing bright red and the sirens are wailing, but the stock markets are still up in the sky (well, besides the NASDAQ which was always highly overvalued). Generally though, it feels like this will be a slow and steady ride, but a big jolt could quickly cause a fast drop like we see in many recessions before - the shock always comes from somewhere new.",

      "body": "Very interesting, It is very useful to start by understanding what a recession is, as it is often confused with depression. A typical year has its ups and downs. The economy goes up, then down—sometimes sharply. This can be an interesting time to invest in the market, especially if you have a very long investment time frame.It's hard to say if the US is in a recession because many factors are considered. If the economic growth rate is negative, it is not a positive sign. The US economy has not faced this kind of turmoil in a long time. While some believe we are in a recession, others believe there is no sign of a slowdown in economic activity.",

But to be fair, I don't think it's just the US; it's the global economy trend which is expected every once in a while and then with the pandemic it was supposed to become evident at some point.",

I guess even if the US gets through the door of recession, the result will also mean that the US economy will also shrink, economic prospects  slow economy. Perhaps the most optimistic thing for the US economy is the hope of Russia defaulting on its debt.  Lol",

And I think everyone around the world is witnessing an uptick in these trends. Federal reserve (QE) quantitative easing and global monetary helicopter drops can mitigate the negative effects, over the short term. But eventually the shoe will drop and the harsh reality will be felt by everyone. If they haven't already noticed effects in their food and gas bills.Hardcore doom and gloomers would say the US economy has been in a recession since the financial crisis of 2008, and never truly recovered. The US stock market did trend upwards since 2008. Which many view as an indication of a recovery. But I think that many are noticing stock market numbers can be influenced. Pfizer was delisted from the NASDAQ index. Exxon was delisted from the DOW. Considering pfizer and exxon both reaped high profits from COVID vaccines and rising cost of oil, respectively. The turn of events surrounding those delistings becomes an interesting topic.",

Guys, just stop with the inflation thing!Japan has experienced a recession on the same levels as the US is doing now without having inflation at all, the great depression in 1929 happened while there was ample deflation, and inflation was barely above 3% during the 2007-2008 crisis in the EU and US, the largest inflation Greece recorded while near defaulting was 4.71 %.Quote from: sovie on August 01, 2022, 06:13:39 PMBiden has rush to Saudi Arabia to ask for the oil and gas supply.
