  "content": "Hello,Recently I bought a Trezor Model T to store some XRP on it through Exodus desktop wallet.Now before I transfer my XRP, I would like to know where am I able to recover this wallet in case Exodus goes bankrupt or whatever.I've transfered 10 XRP into the Trezor through Exodus and I would like to see this in another wallet beside Exodus.I know it's a BIP39 wallet, so I got another BIP39 wallet, Jaxx. But it seems it's not supporting XRP for some reason? Also don't see a option for Trezor.So my question now is; which wallet can I use to recover my Exodus wallet with the Trezor sub-wallet and see the balances in both of these wallets and have full control over it? In other words; which wallet does the same trick as Exodus?I've contacted Exodus and Trezor already. Exodus was really helpful but couldnt point me to another wallet, which I can understand.Trezor support was terrible, so I figured I'd ask you guys. Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "Trezor suite (which is trezor's official and open source wallet) does support XRP. Even if there were no other wallets that allows you to connect your trezor device, you should be able to (as a last resort) use the seed or extract the private keys and import them to a compatible xrp wallet.",

In other words; which wallet does the same trick as Exodus?This is not a trick, and I wouldn't use Exodus wallet with Trezor device because it's closed source wallet.I was wondering how did you first start using Trezor wallet and generated seed phrase if you didn't follow Trezor instructions, something stinks in your story, but whatever.Trezor Suite is open source default software for Trezor wallet, and it is supporting shitcoin you want, but you can confirm that yourself on trezor website:https://trezor.io/coinsPSIn my opinion it's not a good idea to keep many shitcoins in hardware wallets, it would be the same thing like keeping a bunch of bananas in secure vault.",

I don't understand why Exodus needs to be part of the combination at all. Why did you buy a hardware wallet if you aren't going to use it with all of its features and capabilities? Trezor T supports XRP natively, which means you can use it with the Trezor Suite. It also has a TOR switch for additional privacy. I would advice you to use that, unless you have a valid reason why XRP and Trezor Suite don't work well for your use case.",

You are lucky because MyCrypto wallet is a good open source solution, but it may not be the same with other altcoins.",
