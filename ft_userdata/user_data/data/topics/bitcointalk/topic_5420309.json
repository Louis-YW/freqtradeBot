Like we know when there is a huge drop like this people do not see it as an ideal time to buy, when it is fomo time and the price is surging is when the multitude consider it ideal to buy BTC because they have failed to understand the cycle and are here only to find a way to get rich very fast.I don't think BTC will fall to 10k USD, but no one knows and it can happen, it will surely take away many weak hands who are surely going to panic and sell if we get to that price, but funny enough they would still be the same set of people running to buy back so as not to miss the train when the bull run begins, these are the people who invest in BTC, but do not understand a thing about their investment .",

Over the past few days, the FTX crash has sent the market into a state of panic once again and no one knows what will happen next causing the market to go down again. Bitcoin can fall further is unpredictable and does not matter if we invest for the long term, but remember one thing, invest within your means, do not borrow, do not invest with money that cannot be lost.

There's nothing to guarantee Bitcoin's pump by the end of the year, either. December 2021 was the time of Bitcoin falling from $56k to $46k. December 2020 was the time of rising from $19k to $28k. December 2019 was uneventful as Bitcoin kind of remained in a dip between $6k+ and below $8k. In 2018 Bitcoin fell from $4k to $3k but recovered to $4k by the end of the month. Bottom line is, Bitcoin behaves very differently in December depending on a year, so I don't see why this time we'd be graced with a jump.",

That way you don't have to waste your time by trying to time the bottom (which has more to do with luck rather than skill) and instead you just keep buying more bitcoin in regular intervals.",
