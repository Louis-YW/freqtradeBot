That's a new token that launched by quick swap dev and this is the site to conver the old token to the new token but i suggest to join int he quick swap telegram group and you can ask the developers about what was the reason by issuing the new token with new contract. As far as i know if that was related with the new product like dragon lair but i can't explain it even further for you https://beta.quickswap.exchange/#/dragonshttps://t.me/QuickSwapDEX",

Surely not ? What's more... there's no past history of higher prices, which is untrue. Also listed as N/A in the rankings, whereas before it was ranked around #250 .What happened ?Yeah, that's because QuickSwap has redenominated to a 1:1000 ratio and because the total supply has increased that's why the price has also decreased a thousandfold, Anyway, you can compare and check the price below in both tokens. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quickswap-old https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quickswapor you can read it https://quickswap-layer2.medium.com/how-to-convert-your-old-quick-to-new-quick-1000x-your-holdings-9443463290a4",
