It is unnecessary to think of price movement this week or next week.You can think of a farther plan like when you should seriously think of taking profit.My recommendation is to use Pi Cycle top indicator as one of your indicators to take profit. When the 111DMA crossed down the 350 DMAx2, you will have to exit the market. Maybe it is not an all time high but you will be able to exit and avoid many months of bear market.",

Because in my opinion whether this week rebound is significant or not depends on the situation and the impact of the news produced by the media. I said last week and next week we will still be in a saturated  position seeing the market move down. Even more aggressive  markets show high selling pressure activity and this lends  itself to our DCA activity.",

If this is the mindset in you I am sorry to say you are not fit to be a bitcoin investor.A successful bitcoin investor is someone who have his mind set on the long term performance of bitcoin, not the short term. Erase this from your mind, a long term bitcoin holder is the real winner, we are still in a bear market and things can stay the same for months, if you can't wait for long you should find something else to invest your money. Moreover, when bitcoin goes down in value it's always a good time to invest some money, now is one of the good time to start your DCA into Bitcoin, it's very likely that Bitcoin will retest the base again, maybe 37k, 35k or 32k, I don't know the exact bottom but start buying bit by bit and hold for a year and half, Bitcoin should make a new all time high at the time.",

The ETFs, Grayscale dumping, large investors or companies taking advantage of selling, driving the price lower, and then accumulating more. Some individuals are likely pleased that Bitcoin has declined, as they've been predicting it for months. However, it's unlikely to stay down for an extended period there is going to be a rebound. It will happen slow, most likely this week or not.  But once the upward trend resumes, it's expected to surge significantly.",

So will Bitcoin rebound this week?Bitcoin price can be unpredictable because it can be influenced by many economic factors. And most of these economic factors are also very difficult to predict. I never expected the price of Bitcoin to drop to this extent after the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC. I was expecting the price to move to at least $50k but the reverse is the case now. I think the price will not recover this week and I also suspect that the price might keep depreciating until after the Bitcoin halving.

      "body": "If it's this week then it is hard being optimistic of the market peice behavior for Bitcoin. Charts are bearish and no huge news to uploft the demand and trigger a pullback to $49k or even higher. So if you are one of those who are confused on when to enter, think of a market price that will make you satisfy regardless of the price movement. As we all know, no one has the assurance of when will recovery again take place. At least, if that's your chosen market price, and if you only invested a portion of your overall capital, then nothing will be a problem eitherway the price would go. It is a matter of being preventive; avoiding huge loss than chasing big profit. Its market price could again fall down to $20k if ever demand will decline but if not, $50k and above are possible.Quote from: Fiatless on January 22, 2024, 07:27:07 PMQuote from: Relonage on January 22, 2024, 02:39:34 AMAccording to data from the Coinglass platform, the current open positions in Bitcoin futures contracts have reached $17.582 billion.  CME holds the largest share at $4.769 billion, followed by Binance at $4.151 billion, and Bybit at $3.199 billion.  The substantial open interest across these platforms suggests significant market activity.

It will always be unpredictable since its market value is dependent solely with demand. Well indeed it is correct that demand is highly affected by several factors. I still believe that its market price is bullish and what we are seeing right now is just a price correction given that its market price had a continuous but huge price uplift. The market may recover in no time but for now wait for clearer signs of recovery and always check in between different time frames in particular with volumes.",

What if the short trades are in a higher valuation than the long ones, then your prediction will not be completed. As we don't know people are either bullish or bearish with BTC price in the upcoming week. If you ask me what are my predictions on this, then I will say people are mostly bearish on this. And I am also expecting more downtrends in the BTC price, this is due to the billions of cash inflow and outflow from BTC which have made it highly volatile than before. Which is just too risky for all of us, and I was reading a news 2 days ago that, ARK has moved there a lot of money from the Future ETF of BTC to their own Spot BTC ETF, knowing as parking the spot technique to save funds for liquidation which also tells us that market might be bullish in upcoming days, or it is already in bearish state because it is around $40k now at the time of writing.",
