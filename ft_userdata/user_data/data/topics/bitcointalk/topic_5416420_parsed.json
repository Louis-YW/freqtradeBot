      "body": "the 2 fans blow out between 300 to 450 cfm depends on how fast they blow.the answer as to is it possible is yes.here is a direct link to the fan on bitmain.https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020220313175827439iOt7prxc071Bthese are variations on the delta's which do 200 to 250 cfm each depend on which one.so you will have 2 exhausting so max will be 400 to 450 cfm and if they blow slower due to a cool room they will drop to 300cfm or so.this will help you setup exhausthttps://www.ebay.com/itm/165362811412?_please note I have no connection to the seller on ebayhere is a link to some delta fans the 120mm by 38 mm are the size on s19'shttps://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/d/delta-electronics/afb-120mm-case-fans?a slower onehttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/1-NPT-603-1549/5066865a faster onehttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/1-NPT-603-1325/5066860it is likely to be this one or a clone of it since delta are costly now",
