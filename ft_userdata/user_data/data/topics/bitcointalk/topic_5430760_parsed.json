      "body": "Just like some countries, I expect Nigeria will later know that bitcoin is not even a security like stocks and bonds that government or business organizations can offer, it is a commodity like gold, silver and other physical assets, but just that it is digitally created.Many altcoins are securities.I hope crypto would be legally allowed in Nigeria which would lead to more crypto businesses and adoption in the country.Quote from: Agbe on December 21, 2022, 09:05:21 AMAs of 20th of December 2022, Naija lawmakers dey expect sae, a bill dat will regulate cryptocurrency in di kwantri go come 2 pass. Dem come diminished CBN influence on cryptocurrency in di kwantri.It is a good news.I do not know how true this is, but crypto adoption in Nigeria is growing, reported that crypto investment grew by 5% in 2022 in Nigeria even as there was downtrend and significant bear market.Instead of the government to take advantage of tax, they allow CBN to deem crypto to be what should be avoided and what government should not support. But with time, I hope things would change for better.",

NO BE JUJU BE DAT ONE?What really puzzles me is that the SEC has designated crypto assets as securities assets in 2020 but were forced to abandon those regulations they put in place to support and the regulations by the CBN in 2021, so my question is why didn't they try to stop or oppose the CBN when those regulations were placed behind their back in 2021?this our apex bank ( CBN) just dey trow regulations anyhow, funny enough dem think say they have all the right but the real palava na SEC wey no sabi their right. even the memo they published in 2020 they did not specify if crypto is legally or not, they were just beating around the bush and when CBN placed the ban on banks from dealing with crypto transactions NA SEC even carry the whole tin for head  . confused set of people.",

      "body": "I think the whole thing boils down to lack of understanding from CBN (i don't blame them anyway because they are not the appropriate body expected to regulate the capital market in the country), it is the duty of the SEC, and Nigeria should know that. Hopefully when CBN's power is diminished on crypto and the capital markets in general, the SEC can lift the ban on financial institutions processing crypto transactions, and thus regulate correctly what is deemed as a security or investment contract (of which Bitcoin is not).Quote from: Charles-Tim on December 21, 2022, 03:33:22 PMI hope crypto would be legally allowed in Nigeria which would lead to more crypto businesses and adoption in the country.Hopefully so, though we know it isn't illegal in the sense of a total/complete ban, but the ban by the CBN somewhat raises the suspicion that the government might soon be completely hostile to crypto which would definitely affect any crypto business that had prolly sprung up prior to that, i hope most of the dust settles so people can understand what the nations stand on crypto is.",

No reason am oh, but a country like naija fit ban crypto and nothing much go happen (though i don't want that to happen), and the reason why trade still they go on well well now via P2P for naija na because say government no ban crypto/make it illegal, if to say na that one them do, trust me trading and investment in Naija go drop well well.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on December 21, 2022, 10:19:37 PMThe other day, I go withdraw ordinary #415,000, GT bank tell me say dey no get that amount for the whole of the bank, con tell me make I go come back the next day, they just dey make life stressful for people.

It is not possible for the long term neglect to Crypto currency activities. I know for sure this day would come when our nation house would delibrate on it.",

But I believe today the government has seen otherwise and have come to an understanding of what naija government is losing from excluding themselve from involving in cryptocurrency as a digital currency with so much opportunities accrued.I just hope say both the SEC, CBN and other Arms of govt dem go quick joint body togeda see how Dem go allow cryptocurrency start to operate for we country legally as we dey enter the 2023 cos time no dey like dis.",

Me self for prefer more friendly environment to regulations but if this regulations go mean say the government go come dey friendly to crypto and allow companies to get based for Nigeria e go make sense. The likes of Binance and others go come operate freely and hire Nigerians in the process and many other investors fit enter the space and improve it.

Apparently, it seems to be that the reason why we are seeing a push from the lower chamber may be because there have been some serious lobbying going on in the background and vested interests too. However, one of the statements I like from the article is what the Mr. Ibrahim said - \"It is not about [the] lifting of the ban, we are looking at the legality: what is legal and what is within the framework of our operations in Nigeria. The CBN is regulating financial markets and the Securities Exchange Commission regulates the capital market\". It is my earnest wish to see a desireable outcome sooner than later.",
