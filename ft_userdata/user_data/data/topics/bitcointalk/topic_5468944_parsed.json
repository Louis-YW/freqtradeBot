Then the second input might be for new transaction where you use the output of the first transaction as the input through CPFP method. But if what you mean is having the second input and the first in one transaction then I don’t think it will work because this is like spending from an un initiated transaction. You can redress your question we’ll go get the right answer",

If the transaction has change address UTXO which is the second input that you were referring to.Then, yes. The second input can spend the output of the transaction which is the parent unconfirmed change address UTXO. But the change address UTXO should be regarded as an output that is sent back to the change address of the sender's wallet.",

But it is worth mentioning that the first transaction transaction can even has 1 input and if the transaction has a change, it will have 2 outputs which are, first the coins to the destination address the sender sends the coin to and the second is the remaining coins sent to change address as change.",

The child transaction will refer to the output being spent by the TXID of the parent transaction. If that parent transaction does not come before the child transaction in the block, then the nodes will not yet have the output in their UTXO set and so the child transaction will be invalid. (This actually happened very recently with a mining pool messing up the order of transactions in a block, and the block therefore being rejected as invalid.)So by the same logic that a parent transaction cannot come later in a block than the child transaction, the same transaction cannot spend a UTXO it creates. When nodes come to verify that transaction they will look for the output in their UTXO set, and since it does not yet exist the transaction will be invalid.",

Now the answer to your question is clearer, you can inject arbitrary data into the blockchain in one transaction very easily. The correct way is using an OP_RETURN output to do so.",
