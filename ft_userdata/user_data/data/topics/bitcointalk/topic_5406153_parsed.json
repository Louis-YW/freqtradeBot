  "content": "Its funny now the rates are low but going higher many banks scare people with high rates right ?But now they will be pushing narrative fixed rates they wanna get cheap money and you pay premium banks have become now soon near future specially in europe OTC traders like btc otc exvhange services when buyer payes even 10-20% premium. Short story short when for average joe rates fixed then probably central banks will be lowrring rates near future and big boys get money for cheap but not you. The situation will be like this: On the global markets money will be cheap to borrow but average person will still pay higher % We will see big difference on the rate prices in one country it could be a lot higher then other place since banks pushing fixed rates then if u see the rates lower on the global markets but u still pay for higher Dont agree with fixed rates Also dont agree with fixed energy price plans U fixing the the high prices for you while others get it cheapSure u dont care becouse u never learned about finanxes finances but u better should.",

      "body": "The economic situation is now complex and has many variables that control it, so it is a mistake to build economic thinking based on interest rates or cheap money, especially since inflation comes from several factors as:supply chains.energy prices.Which may decrease for reasons such as stagnation >>  may lead to a decrease in the price of energy >>  leads to a relative reduction in unemployment, or the exact opposite due to supply chains that will lead to an increase in prices >> means an increase in inflation.Unless those problems solved, predicting the economy will be  difficult.",
