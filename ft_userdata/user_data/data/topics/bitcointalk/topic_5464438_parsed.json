      "body": "There are many professional bounty managers and they always manage more bitcoin based campaigns than altcoin ones, there is no single reason for this but it is true that the average altcoin return is way lower than bitcoin return they get. Previously before the booming of bounties, the opposite may have been true from what I have heard from some ancient members of this forum.However it is not the job of the manager to \"gift\" us bounties. Rather the companies give them a hard time with payments and all and thus they might refuse to undertake this responsibility.Overall, I feel bitcoin paying campaigns are the holy grail and should be the ones everyone should target.",

What have they removed from the bounty due to the bad situation in the crypto market?It could just have been their personal decision and they probably have other things to do now. Because majority of the bounties are no longer worth it of their time if they won't pay to the crypto that they prefer.Many of them prefer to pay with their own tokens that later on won't have any value so, effort and time are wasted. That's what I think but I still see some reputed managers that do manage bounties.The gift you're mentioning I think is all about how professional they are and that's part of their job to choose the projects they have to manage.",

Let’s just hope for a more active bounty campaign here in the forum since many depends on it and many want’s to work with those bounties.",

So, is that manager's fault if there was no an offer from the specific developers to run the bounty campaign? what's wrong with you? If they have not yet launched a bounty that means if there was no legit bounty that can be run by them. There's nothing wrong with it. Quote from: Jocuserious on August 24, 2023, 02:55:05 PMWhat do you think could be the main reason for this? There were many higher rank managers who gifted us bounties for good projects in the past but now they are retired. There's no excellent project to be running by them. If they have any and they will run, it caused by it will also give those managers money too. They have not retired yet. Managers are not finding a legit bounty project to run this time. There are still legit bounties in the bounty campaign section.

What do you think could be the main reason for this?We don't know what the main reason is. Only the bounty manager knows it well.However, there should be 2 main reasons. It could be personal reasons or the unfavorable of new crypto projects. For the personal reason, the bounty managers may be busy in their real life because of their jobs or any other things. While for the second reason, after tons of scam and failed crypto projects, many bounty managers become non active anymore. We can understand because it just waste time to work with inappropriate income. Moreover, there will be so much protests from bounty hunters due to bad results of the bounties.Quote from: Jocuserious on August 24, 2023, 02:55:05 PMThere were many higher rank managers who gifted us bounties for good projects in the past but now they are retired.Indeed. Many of them are gone and never came back with new bounties. They may retire or just stop temporarily.Quote from: Jocuserious on August 24, 2023, 02:55:05 PMWhat have they removed from the bounty due to the bad situation in the crypto market?It may be one of the reasons. Too many new projects are not favorable anymore. Some projects provide small allocation for bounty, some projects never paid the bounty rewards/payments, and some of them are scammers. So, BM is just the one who is blamed for the failure.",

There were many higher rank managers who gifted us bounties for good projects in the past but now they are retired. What have they removed from the bounty due to the bad situation in the crypto market?There are a few things to look at. At the start of the bounty boom, bounty projects were paying a lot of money to the bounty manager as well as to the bounty hunter. I think most bounty projects are not paying enough to the bounty managers, so they decided to halt their bounty management services until they get a potential project to promote. Recently, bounty projects have not been up to mark, and the majority of them don't go to the next phase after fundraising, which could be another reason for the lack of interest by old bounty managers.",

      "body": "Nowadays, bounties don't offer significant payouts, which could be a leading factor. In 2018, we observed a high level of activity from bounty managers who were generously rewarded bounty hunters. However, presently, I also believe that project developers might not be offering substantial compensation to bounty managers. It's also possible that competent bounty managers are struggling to find good projects to endorse, so they are hesitant to promote subpar ones and tarnish their reputation. Additionally, there's a rise in fraudulent projects as well. To be honest, the bounty projects have changed from what they used to be, and the enthusiasm that was once there seems to have diminished. This leads me to think that reputable managers are refraining from endorsing projects due to these reasons.",

They may not have found good offers and projects, or they may have lost hope after managing many scam bounties, or they may have changed their activities to other businesses, and perhaps the most famous and trusted managers now have the lion's share of receiving good offers for managing Bounty campaigns and BTC campaigns; also the situation of the bear market and declining currency prices as a whole are an obstacle for project officials in concluding marketing deals in the forum. The good thing is that there are still professional and active Bounty managers in the Bounties (Altcoins) and service boards, and they have many good campaigns that have escrowed allocations.",

What have they removed from the bounty due to the bad situation in the crypto market?Bounties just naturally died off. There are probably a few that still exist to date somewhere here in the forum, but it hasn't helped that a lot of bounties of the past were about shitcoins or scam projects. This inevitably died down the hype of users towards the bounty market. I mean if it took you experiencing tens of scam projects before even finding a legit one, and said legit one was actually a shitcoin, then might as well give up and move on no? It had it's chance in the past since a lot of projects were real, sincere and highpaying. Now? A lot of projects just want money.",
