Fees will vary though; and make sure you're trading with reputable people when doing P2P.",

Localbitcoin is the best site to find seller of crypto in your country. This is what I’m using before Binance launch its P2P feature.",

Of course, Electrum can be used as cold storage, but that again requires a little more knowledge and another device.If the OP has no problems with KYC and his funds are legal, of course he can use one of the well-known CEX, where he will certainly not encounter a problem with liquidity - I assume that this would not be the case with one of the DEXs, although I do not use them, so maybe I am wrong.",

Buying large amount of Bitcoin can be done on centralized exchanges like Binance another others. What is mostly needed is to undergo KYC which has different levels of the numbers of trades individual traders or investors can do with strict limit. Another way to buy Bitcoin is to do that through peer to peer means like buying from people that want to sell directly.",

I believe the OP must have received some pm now suggesting to him where to buy bitcoin. It will be fine if the OP only follows information that is giving him here and not fall prey to any scammer. No change will Pm you first OP.Another aspect is that, for OP to want to invest upto $50k in bitcoin, he should have known things about Bitcoin and incase you don't know or have forgotten. There is no law that compels you to buy the $50 at once. You can buy $10k five  times from different sources, or a source but one at a time.",

That is right, 50k is a huge amount but I suggest purchasing on that exchange little by little so that it will easily move your orders. It is now possible if there is an exchange that there is no fee, that is how they generate profit through their fee, it is better if you care about your privacy.",

I prefer to go with the tried & trusted, no risky P2P sites.You missed Binance, the leading exchange and supported in many countries. In this case, I would buy bitcoin on binance and then transfer it all to my non-custodial wallet. 50k $ is not a small amount so OP should buy yourself a hardware wallet as the safest solution. Limit the use of online wallets, if any, it's best to split those bitcoins into 2 to 3 different wallets. Absolutely should not leave that large amount of bitcoin on centralized exchanges, after buying should immediately transfer to your personal wallet, avoiding unnecessary troubles with centralized exchanges.",
