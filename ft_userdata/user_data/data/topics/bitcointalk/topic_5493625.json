There's nothing special to look forward to for the next halving of bitcoin, it will still be the same, do what you've been doing on the previous halving and you'd be doing just fine, nothing special changes besides the potential that the price might reach somewhere that we might not even think might reach at that point in time.",

As you said, this is just 4th halving and we have a lot more to come. So whatever you are doing today, you can continue. That is, if you truly believe on this market. You will stay motivated if you have strong belief that this market will further increase its adoption and will continue to penetrate the mainstream financial market.

Early preparation is key.This is only good if you have financial capability to do so and wait for years before you can cash out. Not many crypto users have that kind of advantage as most are only capable of holding btc in short-term basis to get immediate profit. But if you have that edge, why not? Also, keep tab on this market. You'll never know what's gonna happen next...",

We buy as much as we can, even after the halving and accumulate and then wait what will be the new all time high, the peak price in this bull run cycle, time it, and sell for a ROI.And with that halving done already then still continue what we are doing, DCA. If it ain't broken, then don't fix it mantra.You can't just sit and watch your wallet grows, we are still have the opportunity so stack sats.",

Aren't we already in the bull run? what do you consider a bull run? what should be the price of Bitcoin and other altcoins for a successful bull run? Bitcoin was under 40K 3 months ago. and now it is above 65K. Solana went from $20 to $150, and many other altcoins skyrocketed just like that. So I think we are pretty much in bull run. the thing is everyone has their own price marks for bull run. which makes things more fun.and if we assume we are already in bull run. then what is the next big thing to anticipate after that?",

It does not mean they do something wrong because chasing profit is what we all do but I agree with you it's not accurate to call them as Bitcoin enthusiasts.I disagree with Bitcoin maximalists too. The world exists with many components as same as cryptocurrency market has Bitcoin and altcoins but Bitcoin maximalists don't accept this fact.QuoteI'm personally always interested in any adoption-related news.

We cannot predict it just because the haLving event is over as there are multiple factors associated with the bull run. You are too dependent on the halving event whereas you forgot that in 2024 Bitcoin price is not more dependent on halving it is now getting affected with Bitcoin ETF. For me, Bitcoin price has now become an unstoppable event and anytime we could see the price breaking the previous ATH.",

Then we wait again until the next halving comes and the price doubles up again. It’s just a cycle that we have to ride out and as long as there is money associated to it, I’m staying pretty motivated and inspired.",

The one-year warm up is not bearish so I disagree to say there is 3-year bear market for one cycle.QuoteMost people are excited about halving because history has it that there is always a bull run that follows, but this one might just be a little different.

Recent weeks, Bitcoin Spot ETFs tend to have less impact on price but I see it is very normal because after about 7 months of bull, Bitcoin actually needs to have real correction to make the market cooler. A consolidation phase is always important and necessary for a big bull run later so recent weeks are good for future bull run of Bitcoin.",

Since the ETFs bitcoin's price has been less volatile, and usually the people who buy ETFs are not in for some quick buy and sell, the hold for a while, so this time I still expect a price correction but way smaller compared to the previous years.

We can somehow relate it to the global currency narrative of Bitcoin. Still, for now, I'm keeping the expectation low, as Universal or global currency recognition is not going to be possible ever at least in the current timeline of 50 years haha.There are many possibilities with a slight difference from each other for now that's not the topic so I've gave just an overview about the macro trends possible.",

Adoption of BTC is the 'goal' for true BTC enthusiasts, just that high tx fees right now is a problem of adoption and until the fee is affordable, newbies may avoid the BTC network.",
