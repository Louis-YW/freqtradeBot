I'll PM him about this to let SB get to the bottom of this. Maybe it's a false-positive.Yes, I have talked with Steve privately regarding that issue since we solved one case previously. I thought he could help in this case as well. But probably this time he failed to solve the problem with his team, and they weren't convinced to even refund the deposit amount. So OP isn't happy with the decision, hence he made the thread. I am expecting a proper explanation about this so everyone can take a look here and decide what to do. I sent the thread link yesterday through DM to Steve. Let's wait for his response here.",

Probably they are assuming that the funds obtained from the connected account was the one being deposited in the casino using the new account. I’m not really sure if it’s legally right to do it on new account deposit. They should at least refund the original deposit if we will use the law and not the casino ToS.Sportsbet should provide here the detailed result of their investigation to create a solid justification for the confiscation of this huge amount to a new account.",

Generally, betting site doesn't confiscate the deposit of the users unless any serious thing has happened. Sportsbet has mentioned the clause 19.1 of their terms for confiscating the funds of the user. Several reasons have been mentioned in that clause. What serious violations of the terms has been done by OP actually which lead to confiscate his deposit?OP said that he has created a new account by watching the good reviews of Sportsbet on the internet. Perhaps, the violations of the mentioned terms have been made by the connected accounts (suspected by the system). How strong the evidences are of the multiple account connections?",

Most of us are curious about this accusation by thinking that Sportsbet team have confiscated the deposit of OP without allowing him to withdraw anything.Anyway, it can't be considered as a valid complaint if the user has withdrawn 16k+ USDT from his account and there are enough evidences about his account connections with the abuser group.",
