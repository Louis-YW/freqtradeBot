  "content": "The origins of Slot GamesSlot machines are practically the “furniture” that can be found in any Casino anywhere in the world. Slot games are said to have been invented around 1871 in San Francisco. The first slot machine ever to make its appearance was designed by a man named Charles Fey, and it was first known as the Liberty Bell. Since then, the device has been further developed over the years, and today we have hundreds of exotic games available to be played in slot machines.You can learn more about the History of Slot Machines here.",

I have fare share of winnings, and I really enjoyed playing slot machine whenever I travel in a physical casino.",

Each fruit displayed on the slots paid a different candy's flavor and that is why this slots' icons theme got so popular and became a classic until nowadays.",

A friend of mine works in one and he says it is the most profitable thing they have. Many times, games like poker, are offered to give variety of games and attract potential customers, of which some will end up betting on slots or other games that are more profitable for the casino.I don't know if there will be that difference in online casinos, I guess not.",

And when slots in online casinos use attractive animations, it can make gamblers come back again and play the same slots games as before. Casinos know very well what keeps gamblers coming back. A large number of slot games available in their casinos and the various bonuses available to members makes the casino a very profitable business. And if a casino does not have a slot game, it feels like a casino does not have a complete gambling game and people will not play for too long in that casino.",

Anyway have anyone hit a jackpot from slot machines on land based casinos?Same here. I love retro stuffs too much. I think that is because we are 90's, 80's or 70's kids. It's not that old slots are not catchy but being catchy will not only based on new designs. It's only up to the person if how he appreciates it.If you think there are more catchy slots are in land based casinos nowadays then how much more in the online world or here in crypto casinos? They are more modern because they are online and are using the blockchain technology but they can still apply a retro theme on them for those who are into it. When it comes to fairness I think it depends on the gambling place but I can also trust slots which uses a provably fair system.",

From what is written in the article link you provided above, its stated that the first slot machine was invented in 1891 and not 1871. So O.P, please take correction.So from 1891 to 2022 is a clear sign that this slot machine has been in existence for over 131yrs today, which is actually a long time. And its glad to know that the first slot machine was created by Sittman and Pitt in 1891 which had no direct method of payment, of which winnings were paid at the bar in a non monetary form such as free drinks and cigars. And also nice knowing that another slot machine developed in 1902 paid out winnings in form of chewing gum and sweets of the corresponding flavour back then.",

I think there are still some of them slot machines. I played some of them, and still very exciting indeed.But now the machine has evolved so much that the lines can be extended, just not 3x5 or 5x5, sometimes the screen will go high and not sure how much is the playing line. Played last night though,   not my lucky night but at least me and may friends did enjoy the game as there was a baccarat tournament in the casino's that we went it and so the atmosphere is very festive.",

The machines nowadays are still simple to play but more complicated to win. Also there are added combinations so I cannot gauge whether it is an advantage to have other winning combinations but with more columns. Basically bigger probability would be needed to get the jackpot. I stopped playing slots becaude it became noring on my perspective. But it is one of the gambling games I played when I was still young because there are imitations or replicas being played on gamezones but the difference is that rewards are in form of candies or chocolate bars. But the idea is still there; get the winning combination.",

So they check slot machines before they got it in a floor for every casino that it is fair and RTP as set correct as per law.Compare to online wherein you have to do it yourself if it is provably fair or not.

Surely, they will follow the standards, and all mentioned RTPs are fair and square. If the users don't know anything about RTP and are provably fair, it's good for them to just stick with reputable online gambling sites to minimize the risks of being cheated.And more importantly, in the event that a gambler got busted in playing slots, don't ever blame the random algorithm that was applied to slots as this type of gambling is really considered as \"luck-based games\".
