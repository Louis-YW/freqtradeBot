      "body": "HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL are commonly used for building websites, including those that involve user registration, login/logout, and tracking user activity such as bet history. So, they should be sufficient for creating the website you have described. However, if you want to incorporate real-time interactions, such as live chat or instant notifications, you may want to consider using Node.js or another JavaScript-based framework. Node.js can also handle server-side tasks, making it a popular choice for building web applications.Having said that, I think it is most important to use a technology stack that you feel comfortable with and that meets the needs of your project. You can always explore other options or technologies later on if you need additional functionality or features.",

Correct me if I am wrong because this is only my own anticipation. I think the best software for a dice game in a gambling casino would depend on the specific requirements of the casino, as well as any legal and regulatory considerations that need to be taken. As we know that many casinos use proprietary software for their games, which they develop in-house or license from third-party providers.",

I looked at Nodejs but find it difficult.HTML CSS and JS would be most of what you would use, especially if you're using servers like nodejs. You won't necessarily touch PHP if you want to, but if that's included in the study path you'd take in coding then you can do so as well. There are a lot of popular frameworks out there that you can use to make it easier to build websites, just try to build a foundation for coding first and be able to read the documentation for frameworks (I suggest React or Angular)Quote from: borkoborko39 on February 26, 2023, 11:34:37 AMQuote from: Hydrogen on February 25, 2023, 07:57:47 PMGames like dice require dynamic pages which can update and change without reloading the page.

As for using ajax, it's more of a technique per se, not a library, plus it's an old method that has been generally replaced by \"fetch\". They basically do the same thing but most modern libraries use the fetch implementation instead.",

In terms of backend I think you need to learn or add to you skills some cloud related things either AWS or Azure something like that not only SQL/MySql. Website development is not easy to do or to rush it requires experience as well, you may also check other casino or gambling sites check the source maybe you could see the front languages they used sometimes.",

If you want a real-time web app that can handle tons of traffic, Node.js is the way to go, my man. Don't trip if it seems too tough at first, there are tons of resources online that can help you learn. So, get after it and good luck with your project, homie!",

I do understand Front-end, that's going to be easy, but want to know what backend is good, especially when making real-time update. I watched a lot of courses on PHP, seem nice and easy, but I understand that it can't do real-time updates like real-time bet history and betting. I also understand the technicalities like API for unique wallet system for example.",

Or I should just switch to Node JS?AJAX is client side and executes in the users browser. This carries an advantage of distributing CPU and memory needs off server to the end users machine. The disadvantage is, code that executes on the clients browser can be edited and changed. Which makes it unfeasible for security sensitive applications.Node.js by contrast executes on server. This makes it ideal for code that you do not want users editing or changing on the client side. It carries a disadvantage of consuming higher CPU and memory for servers.I think most if not all dynamic pages resort to javascript based technologies like AJAX and node.js. You might be able to find free sample code on sites around the internet.",

The system got faster and more efficient, but it was absurdly expensive. Sometimes, I question whether making that change was worth the expenditure or not.
