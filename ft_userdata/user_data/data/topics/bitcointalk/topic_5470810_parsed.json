      "body": "Money is more important, because there isn't any such thing as \"time.\" Time is simply rate of change. And to take things back to the way they were at a different 'time', we would have to know and direct all the materials and energies of the universe to be the same as they were 'back then'.Money is more important because that stuff is dang hard to get without doing evil and hurting other people. But nobody will ever get to go back to a time of the so-called past. He'd have to reorganize the universe to do that.Focus on the money.",

      "body": "Ofcourse, time is integral part of our existence. It's really important, and I would say more important than money... It should be used wisely as though we were given limited time to do as much good and useful things as possible, in order to earn the future we deserve. It better to spend your limited time doing things you were created to do. But firstly, identify this role you were created or meant to serve and spend much of your time serving the role and developing yourself to serve role well. Try as much as possible to spend less time on things that do not help your role.  Serving the role well should make us happy and fulfilled such that moving outside of the role in search of happiness or fun becomes unnecessary.",

In this time, videos give more learning than reading.I'm guilty on this one but who's guilty on this when you're spending your time in entertaining videos that's also sort of helping you to have some laugh? Maybe there's a better approach about watching videos and we're all for those contents that are helping us grow like the common finance contents on different platforms.I like watching those videos and I learn a lot from them but if you're saying that videos are better than reading. They have their own differences but don't say that reading is better than watching videos. Both has their pros and cons but just take a look at the bookworms, most of them are smarter and have better memories than those that likes to consume their times watching videos, even by just watching it's also stressing nowadays.",

      "body": "In one's youthful and healthy years, money takes precedence, while in one's later years, especially when facing health challenges, time becomes more precious.However, the current reality paints a different picture: many young individuals revel in their time without significant financial means, while older folks savor their retirement years with limited time. Most robust youths have yet to attain financial freedom, a stage predominantly achieved by older individuals who have already traversed their youthful years. Essentially, people are trading their lifetime for money to secure their later years.At present, I lean more towards valuing money, as it can support me on my journey towards freedom without the worry of life's necessities.",

The difference between the rich and the poor is that the rich utilise is time doing the right thing that will yield money while the poor waste their time on things that are not profitable and with time become poor.",
