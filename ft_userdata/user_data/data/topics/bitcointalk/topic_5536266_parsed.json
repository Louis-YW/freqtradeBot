      "body": "Is there any way this approval will help Bitcoin or make Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more appealing to people in Switzerland? I don't want to sound skeptical but this appear like granting an exchange approval to allow trading of certain classes of assets, an action I do not see the direct impact on Bitcoin and the Blockchain Technology. You can correct me if my understanding of your post is wrong because I am open to learning new things.",
