      "body": "Hello!You raise significant points about the potential long-term implications of associating Bitcoin with controversial figures like Trump. As you noted, Trump’s divisive legacy and his positions on issues like abortion and immigration could taint Bitcoin’s reputation if it's perceived as being linked to his support.Bitcoin’s value increased significantly under President Biden, suggesting that it can thrive without political favoritism. Tying Bitcoin to contentious political figures might indeed harm its reputation and future growth. The Bitcoin community, ideally, should avoid entangling itself in partisan politics and focus on supporting a stable, moderate approach that fosters growth and acceptance.Best Regards,Tell The Bell",

One good reason for the Bitcoin price increase during Pres.

That he was \"anti-Bitcoin\". That his polices around Bitcoin were somehow terrible. The evidence contradicts that: if he was so terrible, how did Bitcoin go up 500% under president Biden? Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 07, 2024, 01:42:34 PMEven the whole Chinese government were unable to crackdown how bitcoin is in their country, not to talk of a single person in United States.First of all, Bitcoin is still legal to hold and trade in China. They merely disallowed financial institutions from keeping it on their balance sheet.Second, the US is not China. Clearly most Bitcoin is held by Americans.Third, nobody here is talking about \"ending Bitcoin\" in the sense of the network no longer functioning, but rather Bitcoin becoming as popular (and thus valuable) as it was 14 years ago when only few thousand people invested in it. The price of Bitcoin depends on American consumer sentiment. That's why the price is as high as it is. You can complain all you want about how uninformed and volatile those consumers are, but \"kicking them out\" means kicking out about 90% of Bitcoin's market price.",

The influence Donald Trumps has over bitcoin is that he's just a big Whale bitcoin user such also is people like Elon Musk's. So, their moves pertaining the relativities with the public is usually attractive so, let's abolish that thoughts of Donald Trumps being a govern of bitcoin.The speculations of bitcoin and Trump is just the fact that he speaks about positive minds about bitcoin and the community wishes to actualization all that promises so, there's need in the need to vote Trump as the US president but yet, it shouldn't be on the view that the bitcoin communities \"must\" have their mandates for him.

This is not about survival, bitcoin will thrive I'd rather say no matter whether Trump will be elected or not. I like how you put it when you said that bitcoin doesn't need Trump, but Trump needs the help of bitcoin (enthusiasts). That is very well said and hits the nail on the head. He has been known for long to be fishing for votes everywhere possible. Let him crack down on bitcoin, as you said, nothing's gonna happen as could be seen at the example of China. It is a prime example because if there is one country surveilling its citizens and trying to crack down on them whenever they can, it is China. Brutal consequences for misbehavior and yet they had to realize there is no chance stopping bitcoin from at least circulating. They could crack down on major exchanges and mining operations, but that's it. This is what happened when China cracked down on its mining industry last time.Even after the crackdown it was said that in 2021/2022 despite the crackdown about 20% of the mining operations remained in China, people finding sophisticated ways to hide their setups. Economic incentive outplays restrictive policies even in China and the nature of how bitcoin is generated and how people can participate will give an advantage to miners over the government. How would a government enforce mining restrictions across all China?",
