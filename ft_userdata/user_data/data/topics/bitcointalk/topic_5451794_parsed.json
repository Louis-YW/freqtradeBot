Try it again to see if the tests you are using are matching the ability to spend with the ecosystem from Ethereum, if you have been through the previous stages when DeFi was popular, sometimes paying hundred dollars for transaction fees will also be accepted. If I remember correctly, I also used to pay close to $200 for UNISWAP trades before, indeed at that time the return on assets was so great that I paid much attention or complained about such a fee, but to be fair this is also a multi-year problem with the Ethereum ecosystem, and they are also making a lot of changes that I consider acceptable for regular use.",

Even sending tokens to exchange has needed tons of fees. Ive even spend $39 for a token just to send it on Binance hence if I used it on uniswap Id be spending more fees due to possible frontrun. But tou muat wait for it to cool down or used other network for now.",

Nobody is forcing you to stay on the Ethereum network, and now there are many options you can use, and you don't have to pay high fees for gwei.That is a risk we have to accept in using the Ethereum network. However, high costs will not always exist because it depends on the level of network activity. Maybe you need to look for other solutions that can lower transaction fees so you can accept it.",

The popularity of DeFi and NFTs has increased demand for Ethereum transactions, leading to higher fees.Nowadays, we experience heavy network congestion in the entire market. In fact, not only ETH has been affected but also Bitcoin transactions. Wondering how this happens because as I experience in the past few days, it never takes so long and the fees declined but now, the fees are even increasing badly. I can't really imagine paying $10 and above in ETH transactions and $5 for BTC. I'd never see it was because of the popularity but what I think is that major investors(whales) are buying more and paying huge fees to take the highest priority which also influences the others to pay high as well.",

The popularity of DeFi and NFTs has increased demand for Ethereum transactions, leading to higher fees.Yeah i am also pretty frustrated with the current state of the Ethereum network. I am only a small investor and with the current prices for a swap, a staking transaction or even a normal transaction the ETH network is almost unusable because i don't want to pay 40$ for gas if the worth of my transaction is only 50$. I am currently sitting on some tokens that would need to be staked in order to get interest on it, but so far i have not staked them because it is just to expensive for me.Seems like the change from PoW to PoS really did not effect the transaction prices at all, which is pretty sad.",

The popularity of DeFi and NFTs has increased demand for Ethereum transactions, leading to higher fees.Been there and done that mate, there's nothing much that we can do. The highest that I've paid for Gwei before was around $100, yes, thanks to those failures that I've done with NFTs I'll never invest again. But this time, it isn't about NFTs but I think DeFi has something to do with this and as well as Pepe coin. Those transactions that have been clogging the network makes the gwei higher and bruh, we can't anything with that. So if you want to transact, do it and pay the high gwei but if not, we don't know how long we will have to wait until this calms.",

Although the fee is increasing, The demand on the Ethereum is starting to rise again which means mass adoption is happening to your investment.Use side chain like Polygain and Optimism if you want to experience cheap fee while still inside the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is not the only one experiencing high fees right now but also Bitcoin. I don’t see the trend on DeFi and NFT right now. Probably this due to the meme coin trend since Pepe coin and Floki listed on Binance.",

It was also one of the reasons why I just sat down and stopped trading in general, and just started hodling and DCA. The fees come in every now and then when I try out new coins, but hey, at least it isn't that often anymore. And as much as I hate NFT's, it is a pretty active community with a lot of people transacting on it, so it isn't that odd really. Though I think simple research would show the fees are high because of PEPE coin? Not really following it, never really want to touch meme coins anw.",

Like Polygon and BSC, these two are currently not that much compared to ETH's gwei. It's really terrible to see the fees go up because of those transactions that are being done and if you're in a hurry, you have to oblige and pay those crazy fees. But before anything else, you might as well do check if it's on other chain to save fees as I've said.",

The high fees for Ethereum transactions are a result of the network's supply and demand dynamics. When the number of pending transactions on the network exceeds its capacity, users have to compete with each other to get their transactions processed by offering higher fees (in gwei) to the miners who verify and validate the transactions.",

The cryptocurrency world is wide, you always have a choice and if that is avoiding Ethereum transactions then use other chains instead. There are also projects that are building their own blockchain because they are also trying to avoid this. Their problem is investors are being driven away just for the single reason of the high transaction fees. That is not good for business and will just end up in bankruptcy instead of making more money.",

It shows how vulnerable the networks are if outside forces do it deliberately.Another frustrating part, other networks also have high fees.
