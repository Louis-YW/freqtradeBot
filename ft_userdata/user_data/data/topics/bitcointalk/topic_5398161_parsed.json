      "body": "Depends where you are in the country.There are a few mining facilities opening up in NY.1) Cheap(ish) empty data centers. As has been discussed somewhere else on the board big corps are always chasing the 'next big thing' so a lot of fulling working data centers are empty now since they built a 'better' one right next door. The power and cooling and data infrastructure is already there.2) Upstate NY, where some of these DC are has a lot of cheap hydro power3) Cooler weather during the summer and cold weather during the winter help cooling vs other places4) Short trip to NYC where you have a lot of VC peopleTexas:1) Cheap power and the state has agreed to subsidize losses due to power issues.2) Same as NY, there are a lot of empty data centers as newer ones are built3) A lot of tax incentivesThose are the only 2 states I follow, I'm sure other people can chime in where they live / do business.-Dave",

There is no simple answer.  2) Last I heard the hydro places were paying between $0.03 and $0.04 but that was 2020 & 21. No idea now. There seems to be a push against it in NY at the moment, will have to see how that plays out but for now https://www.power-eng.com/renewables/new-york-hydropower-site-fully-dedicated-to-cryptocurrency-mining/-Dave",

      "body": "Don't start a mining farm in 'Noo Yawk'. If you make a profit, they have a ridiculous income tax. They charge a ridiculous sales tax too. The power rate is much higher than 3-4 cents unless you sign a deal directly with a power plant. The publicly available rate at 1 MW is probably 5-6 cents in the west/central load zone. The state as a whole is unfriendly to the crypto industry. The only advantage will be the low temperature.I recommend finding a state which isn't a stereotypical mining state like WA/TX/NY, browsing through the utility tariff documents, and hopefully finding a place that offers ~5 cents without having too much competition from other miners. Don't choose a location which is too hot, like southern/west TX, AZ or NM. I've heard of a large farm located in NJ moving to OH this month, so you might want to consider that state as the weather is cooler.I can also give you a list of states where you can't find power for < 6 cents anywhere in the state: CA, NJ, FL, CT, MA, RI, PA, DE, MD, VA. Disregard these states entirely.",

Are there any advantages of mining in the USA versus other countries?Economic freedom /property rights would be the main advantage. The government can't just confiscate the mining farm or Bitcoins as long as you follow the law. Banning cryptocurrency or mining is very difficult since it needs to pass the legislative and judicial branches. For taxes, yes the rates are high... but there are so many depreciation incentives that the effective tax rate can be as low as zero as long as you keep re-investing in more equipment. Finally, there are big established power markets like ERCOT or PJM where you can buy lots of energy with lots of options for the contract structure. As an example, Riot Whinstone has a fixed ERCOT contract for 2.9¢/kWh. They have massively profited because now the energy price in Texas has doubled.If you want to mine in the U.S., I recommend the Midwest since there are less mining farms there and they won't crack down on mining like 'Noo Yawk'. You might pay more for power but the weather is cooler than Georgia or Texas or Oklahoma.",

In some countries, economic freedom and property rights are not always respected, but there are no taxes on mining and there is cheap electricity. The US has very expensive lawyers and very strict control.",

Still this will be a fixed rate that is set in a contract and if the next bullrunn happens and they can't mine for some reason they will be pretty fucked up because they will only get a small compensation. If I had the option I would only mine where I had full control if I go offline or not.",
