I get the frustration of seeing coins you ordered on sale in the secondary market before you get them yourself. Legit frustration.

I bought 5 or 6 coins on the forum this month, including Satoris under $100, -all for great prices. That‚Äôs pretty amazing and only available on the forum. You bought a coin from Smoothie at the original price of the coin. You can only get that in on the forum. I would never buy the eBay coins at the high prices they go for, but not sure that secondary activity steals opportunity from collectors on the forum. I hope these coins on Stacks sell for all time high prices because it drives adoption and brings in more collectors. I think it is still risky for the sellers that are putting coins in the Stacks Auction though; with this many coins selling and in the bear market, there may be some real bargains available. In the last Stack‚Äôs auction I bought a CI Hodl redeemed for $20.",

At the same time, we can expect premiums, especially for non-funded pieces, to stabilize to a (hopefully rising) dollar value as opposed to the BTC-denominated value we use here.On the heads side of this, this can mean that the earliest coins become increasingly difficult to acquire for non-whales. Unlike a Bitcoin, you can't buy a fraction. Its like this with art, gemstones, and other rare coins or stamps.On the tails, as the most sought-after items move into the larger and more moneyed mainstream market, new entrants and smaller players can purchase newer collections that still come from within this community - in hopes that in 10 years, they too might command ever-larger premiums - something that is still true in the traditional coin and stamp world where many collect new releases instead of speculating on historical pieces.The reality is that many collect things not only because they are interesting, but because they are rare and desirable - like bitcoin itself - which then makes them even more difficult to get. Almost every collection gets sold eventually, if not by the collector than by their estate - which is already happening in our space.",
