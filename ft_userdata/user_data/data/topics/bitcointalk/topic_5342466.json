He'll say that aside from Dogecoin bringing to the moon, he's going to take bitcoin too.  He's too exposed for that Dogecoin shilling all over the twitter and he has to step up and lie down a bit and should go for bitcoin.",

With some renewable energy on the Moon such as wind power. If SpaceX and Elon can do that, it would be a big movement to the Moon, technically.The hardest part is not the energy supply but about the delay of signal from Earth to the Moon and back.Quote“BitMEX will mint a one-of-a-kind physical bitcoin, similar to the Casascius coins of 2013, which will be delivered to the moon by Astrobotic,” according to the release. “The coin will hold one bitcoin at an address to be publicly released, underneath a tamper-evident hologram covering. The coin will proudly display the BitMEX name, the mission name, the date it was minted and the bitcoin price at the time of minting.”What are objectives of the mission? To promote and make noise for BitMEX.",

You know the old line \"To the Mooooon!\" This is it. Bitcoin is indeed going to the moon. But not literally though. Bitcoin stays on earth.This may be pointless to others but it sure is fun. Aside from publicity that BitMEX will receive for sending Bitcoin to the moon, it also helps in promoting Bitcoin. This is no small way of marketing Bitcoin. This is not just on an international level. This is universal. Elon will take care of Bitcoin on Mars.",

It would be creative advertisement for BitMEX.Yes, it's a great advertisement for them. There's also a possibility to help them clear their name (with all the mishaps that befallen the BitMex name) and be branded as the first exchange to partner with a mission to put a physical BTC in space. It's a great approach really. Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on June 08, 2021, 02:38:41 AMI don't think Bitcoin has its max price for this bull run.

It broke the cap in August and the rest is Moon, real Moon, not half Moon.Well if we are talking about max price, why not going to Pluto or something the like? That's a better comparison to what the members here want. I don't get what you mean by \"rest is moon\" \"real moon\" \"half-moon\". It's doesn't fit any context for me.",

But I admitted that bitcoin could increase anytime and no need for anything to increase, and I will prepare my bitcoin for that moment.Elon must plan something related to the BitMEX news, and I think he will not just watch, but he will do something. We might see a new tweet from Elon soon More and more good news is coming about bitcoin. Hopefully, that can help the price increase and bring more investors to invest in bitcoin. We will see a surprise from bitcoin later.",

Bitcoin still needs publicity right now despite it already entering the mainstream. And I don't agree that almost everyone has heard of Bitcoin. I don't even think 50% of the world's population has already heard of Bitcoin.
