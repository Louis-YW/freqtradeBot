For example, as you have already mentioned, there is a lot of crime and corruption within gambling, and some shady casino owners do not mind capitalizing on that, as long as they can get some extra profit. Its in human nature to be greedy and everyone has their own varying degrees of greed. Shady people do not shy away from using addiction and even creating addiction in people. But again, these are all outside problems. Anyone with a rotten mind and heart will be rotten, even if they were selling medicine or apples. It does not matter. That does not cast a bad light on the MMA in my eyes.",

Holly Holm's MMA team won 6 figures when Holly Holm defeated Ronda Rousey in 2015.QuoteHolly Holm's team won 'six figure' sum betting on their fighterMELBOURNE, Australia — Members of Holly Holm’s support team won a \"six figure\" sum by betting on their fighter defeating Ronda Rousey at UFC 193.Holm stunned Rousey with a second-round knockout in the main event at Etihad Stadium, an upset described as the greatest in UFC history.With Las Vegas bookies offering odds of 10-1 and above for a Holm victory, several members of her camp pooled their resources together to place a wager, according to her manager Lenny Fresquez.\"I am sorry Vegas. You shouldn't have put the odds so high,\" Fresquez told USA TODAY Sports, while admitting that the sum exceeded six figures. \"It was couple of our team members. We had a good pot together so it was nice. I wish I would have (placed) more money.\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2015/11/15/holly-holm-upsets-ronda-rousey-bet-wins-six-figure-sum/75821580/There are also many UFC fighters on social media who post bets.I think the catch is UFC fighters must bet on themselves winning, they can't bet on their opponents and throw fights.There was a criminal case many years ago where korean UFC fighter Tae Hyun Bang was involved in a fight fixing case where he was supposed to throw a fight versus Leo Kuntz.QuoteReport: Ex-UFC fighter Tae Hyun Bang gets jail time for involvement in fight-fixing schemeTae Hyun Bang was sentenced to 10 months by the Seoul Central District Court for taking $92,610 (100 million won in South Korea) to throw a fight against Leo Kuntz at UFC Fight Night 79 in Seoul in November 2015, according to the Korea Herald. Three people who gave the money to Bang also got jail terms.https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/11/24/16697172/report-ex-ufc-fighter-tae-hyun-bang-gets-jail-time-for-involvement-in-fight-fixing-schemeBookmakers and authorities can sometimes identify fixed fights through an unusually large amount of money being bet. Which was what happened in the Tae Hyun Bang vs Leo Kuntz fight fixing case.Pride MMA promotion in japan was known for having ties to the yakuza. They introduced non obvious methods to rig fights. Such as the champion knowing ahead of time which opponent they would fight. While the challenger did not know they would be fighting the champion, until shortly before the fight took place.",

To be honest with you mate, I don't think we would ever around at a stage where rigged matches will be weeded out completely, like i said above, sports is business for most of this guys, and if rigging a match is how the money will be made, trust me, they will always find a way to do it no matter how regulators try to stop match rigging.This is just my thought and opinion though.",

And so I wouldn't completely say that MMA or UFC fights as 100% not part of the mafia. Perhaps the influence throughout the years are going down, nevertheless, who knows there could be fighters that can go and be influence and it's hard to judge or caught them base on the performance unless they admit it themselves.

Perhaps he think that it will be good for his business in the long run that's why favoritism in UFC is predominant under Dana's leadership.",
