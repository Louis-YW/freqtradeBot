  "content": "I have been trying to access Binance marketplace on my PC through their website or PC software, all in vain. I think I missed a step that I haven't yet figured out. Maybe someone more familiar could help. On the mobile app, it's pretty direct. On the Landing Page, I just click on More and the under Others, I can see MarketplaceOn the web version, I am not able to see anything about Marketplace from the Homepage, despite checking out different menus. Is there something, am not looking at?",
