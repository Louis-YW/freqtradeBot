I will try to exclude this to my AV, I’m just making sure that this is possible scenario when downloading the electrum wallet. Strangely, some other notification is popping aside from the screenshot I a provide the moment I open the nw portable application. I will give a feedback later.Quote from: DaveF on November 15, 2022, 02:39:54 AMLooks like something on that website that Electrum  is talking to is triggering something:https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/141b75102559ed04810d8c51f6e042354ad52468548fd59437e47c4a0f164864?nocache=1Would not worry about it.However, your version of electrum is almost a year and a 1/2 old.

It's just strange that my AV react like this since I didn't update for a long time.",

It is just the firewall preventing connection to some of the Electrum nodes that your client tries to connect to and sync. Possibly because those IP addresses are flagged. Considering that the communication between your client and these servers can not be exploited since the messages and the whole protocol is kept simple, there should not be any risks here.",

Since the software came from the right place and the signatures were verified, there is no need to worry about it.But what I find interesting is the thing you said here:Quote from: Coin_trader on November 15, 2022, 12:29:02 AMRecently I encounter a problem to my old Electrum wallet which my transaction is reverted back to my wallet balance even though the transaction already appeared on blockchain as unconfirmed... This is not something your anti-virus or firewall can do. If the transaction was verified and broadcast to the network properly, how did it come back to you if you didn't doublespend it? Are you sure you didn't create the transaction, but instead of broadcasting it, you saved it locally in your Electrum client? After deleting the local transaction, the amount came back to your own wallet.",

Now you can only hope that you will be able to save the data, and that you have confidence in the person who will get access to your hard drive.In any case, good luck and think about making a physical backup anyway, maybe in a way that you entrust part of the backup to someone you trust, and keep the part with you.",

I agree with Lucius and don't see how that way of storing sensitive data could prevent you from spending more coins than you would want to because you still have access to that computer and you can take whatever you want from it at anytime. Hopefully you can recover your data and this becomes just a slap in your face and not a loss of money. But as soon as you do, you have to improve your ways of backing up those seeds. Good luck to you!",

If you didn't create any physical offline backup of your mnemonic recovery words for your Electrum wallet(s), well, that's probably one of the biggest mistakes.I wouldn't trust any computer technician unless all wallets have a really strong wallet password and none of those passwords have been stored on the harddrive.",
