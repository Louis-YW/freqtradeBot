Your bitcoin will stay in your wallets forever.Possibility for all countries to ban Bitcoin is impossible. They won't have a consensus to ban Bitcoin and apply it at the same time. China banned Bitcoin, miners move to the USA., Kazakhstan, etc. and the story of miner migration will continue.If hashrate drops, Bitcoin network will be lower for a while but after 2016 blocks or 14 days, difficulty will be re-targeted by difficulty algorithm. Not big deal as not all countries ban Bitcoin mining at the same time, there is enough time for difficulty re-target.Citizens will not let politicians to do everything to harm citizen benefits. It's the world of freedom.",

Impossible it is not, but extremely unlikely. It's a question that made more sense in the early years, but now, with the level of adoption, even institutional, with El Salvador having Bitcoin as legal tender, it's extremely improbable.",

Many people are still using it, and will be using it even though it has been existing for centuries already. I guess it will be the same as Bitcoin. Many people are still using it, it will not die. Nobody uses? It will die. We might see a new, and better version of Bitcoin in the future we don't know. Adoption is slowly increasing, and it seems like there's no reason for it to decrease so to answer your question, it might be, but with it's current trend, it's almost impossible.Regulations that Bitcoin mining is prohibited? Well, if all agrees, but what are the chances of that to happen? Close to 0% TBH. In short,",

Suppose all counties ban Bitcoin Mining and No miner mine Bitcoin anymore. No coins will add to the chain. The network will be congested, and transactions cannot be done. But, this is unlikely to happen, while some countries already seeing Bitcoin as positive innovation. El Salvador has already legalized Bitcoin. If only El Salvador ran their miners and full nodes, Bitcoin would still be alive. You may see congested networks and high transaction fees. But the network will remain active.",

Bitcoin is inflation resistance,it is most valuable asset in the world due to its volatile nature. All these put together makes it impossible for bitcoin to die,due to its potential value that investors has seen in it. The decentralization of bitcoin is even more unique compare to other form of currency and it is limited in supply.The only way that bitcoin can die,is if its price goes down to zero,which is impossible to happen. This is when miners will pack up their mining equipment,but as long as this hasn't happen,nothing will make bitcoin die. Another way is if a different currency is invented that surpasses the value of bitcoin. As for government ban,it will be impossible for it to happen in all the countries in the world. Therefore,miners will move to a crypto friendly country if the country they are bans crypto.",

But Bitcoin would continue to exist if it's only mining they ban as there are over 19 million Bitcoins mined already, so the hope continues (you still own your coin but can't just use it). Anything could still happen in the future. However, one thing I would like you to know is that Bitcoin is striving because people value it, but if all countries could declare their ban on more than mining but the coin itself, then I personally believe it would seize to exit, especially if they are totally clamping on the holders and the companies dealing with it.I hope this does not happen, ever!",

Yes we have over 19 million units already but without miners no transaction can be confirmed and your bitcoins have no practical use in your wallet.

This has made me edit my post a bit to avoid misconceptions by using 'hope' instead of 'game.' I fully understand the situation this will cause to the Bitcoin network, yet the coin will still of course remains in our wallets, which is what I meant by that phrase.And who knows, things can change in the future and our Bitcoins will always remain ours.",

In order for all countries to regulate bitcoin mining, for this they will first have to agree among themselves on how to do this. As practice shows, even a couple or two countries can't agree among themselves, not to mention all countries at once. Therefore, if some countries ban bitcoin mining, then there will always be countries loyal to this, who want to receive taxes from this. For small and weak countries, this is an opportunity to somehow get money into the budget, which they will not neglect. So, I don't expect one-time regulation of mining, not only in all countries, but even in most of them.In fact, I would prefer a scenario where bitcoin mining is banned in all countries. This would allow large mining companies to be ousted from this market, and then ordinary users would take on the entire burden of ensuring mining performance. Bitcoin network would become much more decentralized when almost every person on earth would have btc mined on their home PC. I believe that the founder of bitcoin expected to see something like this, and not the dominance of a few industrial mining centers.As a result, I can conclude that even despite the regulation, itcoin death will not happen, because ordinary bitcoin enthusiasts will put this function of ensuring the operability of the BTC-network on their shoulders. I will say this as long as at least one bitcoiner, btc will live.",

And I think that for every ban there must be a more logical reason because if it was only banned without any detrimental cause, it would sound very ridiculous.
