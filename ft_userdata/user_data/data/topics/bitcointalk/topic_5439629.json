At least that's my hope.But for certainty, it is clear that there is nothing we can know for sure because even if we show that number, it will only be an assumption, not a certainty.",

No one knows for sure, but the math is simple. If demand for bitcoin exceeds the available supply, and the halving reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are being generated, it could lead to upward pressure on the price.",

What we can expect is history will repeat, and bitcoin prices will hit new ATH. That is all we can predict. If bitcoin is not pumped after the halving, history does not repeat itself, we do not need to worry too much. Because just looking at the growth of bitcoin and the market, it is sure that in the future, bitcoin will continue to increase in price, the main factor affecting the price of bitcoin is still supply and demand.",

I even think this pump may have already begun. However, I think any correction following the halving will be short lived and ultimately be the last chance to get in before a new supply/demand reality is priced in and BTC goes moonward.",

Sure it was lower price but back then crypto had a much smaller market cap.Now we have a very small miner fee and it getting capped by half again won’t make much difference really. Whether there is a pump or not can be purely coincidenal. Doesn’t mean we need to follow past trends.",

I hope you do your research before you post something like that.Most people know that Bitcoin is volatile unless you don't know it, so it's no wonder why you asked this question. All I know is that most people believe that Bitcoin halving will happen in the year 2024, but there is no definite exact date or month it will happen even in 2024 we still don't know of course.",

In the first, second and third halving, what followed but in months were bull run. This is the logic, because the first, second and third were bull market, the fourth would most likely be of bull run too. I am expecting bitcoin to reach all-time-high by 2024 and 2025, we should keep on holding and continue to DCA when the price of bitcoin is still low now.",

Ah I guess, the exact halving date is really unpredictable due to undefined gap between block generation in bitcoin network.The pump that we see right now or during the time we approach the halving date may not be totally related to the halving itself but maybe this is only the effect of the people's excitement. You know many of them are now stacking coins even harder but let's hope we won't lose this momentum even after the halving event. May we not end up like what happened to Eth last time where its value also pumped before the merge but after it, the increase didn't continued anymore.",

Even if no one knows what will happen to bitcoin after the halving but there is a general notation that bitcoin will enter into the bull run. That assumption is right because previous bull runs that happened all came with a price increase, I don't think that this would be a difference.Well, I was also scared about halving uncertainties, that is the reason I created a thread - My greatest gear about halving. As I was advised in the thread, we shouldn't allow halving to bother us so much",

How big it is? we really don't know. Conservative estimates put it at around $100k at least, so you do that match.Last all time high is more than $60k and there are also numbers being thrown that the next ATH will be 2x or 2.5x of the previous run in 2021.",

Still a wait-and-see though, even if the market hasn't shown us a drop after the halving before, it's never an impossibility. Naturally, I'm more hopeful that it pumps by then, but you can never really say with absolute certainty. Even with the pump though, I reckon we won't see insane jumps like before, maybe at most double of the price then.",

Per history, halving does not trigger any bull market but we may assume it will trigger only after few months. The gap in the last two halving was around 6 months but we can take that in another perspective also. I mean halving do happens on its own time but bitcoin market waits for year-end or a new year to get into a bullish trend.If you notice, a negative news may not impact bitcoin market in bullish trend but in bearish conditions, it will do. Similarly, halving happens but its impact will be visible only when bitcoin market enters into bullish trend.Coincidence or not, US election and a new tenure of a president is also happening along with halving which is having impact on bitcoin market over the time as well.",
