Even in the Philippines, Binance is already banned, though I’m not sure if the Philippine government will also go after them for a monetary settlement like the U.S. and France.With all these cases, one thing is clear, the governments believe Binance is so liquid that it can afford to pay whatever settlement they demand. That’s why they’re being targeted. But if this leads to criminal charges, is there a chance CZ could be jailed again? This is a different country, so it would be another legal battle for him to face.",

Regulations for example, started in the USA against Binance, then other nations followed it.Before France, months ago Nigeria tried to put two Binance staffs in jail temporarily for blackmailing money from Binance. Their reason is funny and unreasonable that Binance destroyed their national currency Naira.France with their action to arrest Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, shows that they can do severe regulation for their national benefit.Sure after The USA, France there will be more countries want to milk money from Binance.",

Sometimes it is assumed by some crypto industry players that these laws are designed not just to protect citizens from fraud but to milk them through fines. The laws are also targeted at making these firms to be fully under the surveillance of the government. If they keep on using Binance as a cash cow, the exchange might soon declare bankruptcy and customers' funds will be in danger. Let's see how the investigation will end.",

They are charging people 0.1% fee on each trade, that's ridiculously high amount because there are millions of trades done daily. That's why these exchanges are so rich and capable to pay billion dollar fines.Quote from: Z-tight on January 30, 2025, 07:50:00 PMI don't think this is a case of every country trying to milk binance, rather it is about binance failing to fully comply with regulators and follow their laws and regulations. Of course Binance always fails to comply with regulators and they regularly break the law but I think that countries really try to milk it. What were they doing till 2024? All of a sudden, every country decided that Binance breaks the law and they should pay charges while they could do it in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.In the US, I think that the reason mostly was Bitcoin ETF approval cause these companies don't want Binance as their competitor.",

Like when a record-breaking contract is signed by a star quarterback, you shake your head at the number, but part of you saw it approaching a mile awayFascinating is how this ripple effect might alter the crypto scene for regular people. Once regulations clamp down, sometimes you see mainstream confidence actually go up, people think, “Hey, if the big guys are getting reined in, then maybe this is safer for me to jump in.” More generally, the EU has been experimenting with new frameworks and rules (like MiCA), thus this could force them to speed up the process - get all that red tape in place to manage significant transfers. Could it be a headache for Binance? Sure. However, it could also provide the means for them to rebuild trust, particularly if they wish a strong basis in a big area like Europe. It is a typical illustration of temporary suffering for long-term stability",
