If it's a mobile version then to backup the wallet just go to the accounts tab and select or tap the wallet you want to backup after you tap it then tap the 3 dots upper-right corner and then export accounts keys and then slide it from public key to private key to the right. Now hold the or long-press the screen and it should show the private key that you want to backup with the QR code. Be careful with someone who PM you or avoid them at any cost because there are lots of scammers out there pretending to help you but in the end scammer.",

But it might be good if you don't share it to anyone even its pub.It composes all the used address of your HD wallet, which you can view it here https://www.blockchain.com/btc/xpub/<your xpub>Code:xpub6CUGRUonZSQ4TWtTMmzXdrXDtypWKiKrhko4egpiMZbpiaQL2jkwSB1icqYh2cfDfVxdx4df189oLKnC5fSwqPfgyP3hooxujYzAu3fDVmzYou can see it som discussion in reddit[1][1] https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4nu0qr/what_is_an_xpub_address_and_how_is_it_different/If you choose the Private one then its the one that starts \"xprv\" which explained above.The problem with Mycelium is that you can get back up keys for the wallet, but looks like you can back up your private keys directly.Even if op can't import the Address private key he should have a backup of the wallet keys if that address will stay active.",
