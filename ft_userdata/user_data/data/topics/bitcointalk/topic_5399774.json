The transaction key is available only to the sender (do not disclose it to anyone unless absolutely necessary). Knowing the key and the receiving address (the only one or one of the many transaction outputs)Â  makes available view the amount that will be receiving (or has already received) by the address of the transaction in the Monero blockchain.This information can be useful to a sender in controversial situations, for example, if a receivier denies receiving funds and refers to the fact that it is impossible to prove receipt due to the opacity of Monero transactions.",
