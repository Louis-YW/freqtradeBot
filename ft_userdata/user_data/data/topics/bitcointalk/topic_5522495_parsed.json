  "content": "On December 11th, 2024, Mayor Ken Sim introduced a motion to the council of the City of Vancouver titled \"Preserving of the City's Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves â€“ Becoming A Bitcoin Friendly City\", available here: https://council.vancouver.ca/20241211/documents/cfscA3.pdfIn that motion, the Mayor requested a report to be made by the end of the first quarter of 2025 to investigate the potential risks and benefits of including Bitcoin as part of the savings of the City of Vancouver to fix the problems of inflation.He goes on to list El Salvador, Lugano, and others, as successful examples of Bitcoin adoption, and he quoted Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper in the motion.And it ends with this:I think many cities and countries around the world are waking up to this reality. Fiat is losing traction, and Bitcoin is getting everywhere.",

And for the overall adoption of BTC. It could very well be the way that they accumulate those Bitcoin reserves, by letting people pay taxes and fees in Bitcoin.That way they would not have to pay any fees as the sender is the one paying the miner fees.We will see how they plan to do this when they release their report in the first quarter of 2025.",

They probably look at the numbers of users instead of the penetration/adoption rate, and judge that 10k users are good enough to support their plan. As long as the data they look at is verifiable I think there's no problem with them saying El Salvador is a success. Regardless of their reasoning, hopefully, this will be a success so more governments will be open to accepting crypto as a payment method on a limited scale. CMIIW.",

This year has been huge for Bitcoin, the friendly approach towards it by Donald Trump, during the US election and his win of the presidential election has been obviously bullish for Bitcoin, so I'm looking at greater things for Bitcoin in 2025.

I would say he is using his power to influence the citizens to adopt and invest in Bitcoin in his city with this new law. Bitcoin is the reserve currency for anyone thinking about alternate investing options. Next year we will see many counties or states/cities that will be supporting/promoting Bitcoin globally.
