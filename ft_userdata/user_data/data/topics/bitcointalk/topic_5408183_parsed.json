  "content": "I am trying to estimate the cost of mining Genesis block for a research paper and wish to narrow down variables to the best i can. Here is how i got the ~8228 h/s hashrate.1- I took the difference between the block-header epoch timestamp of Genesis and block#1 which turned out to be 506,360 seconds (i.e 5.86 days).2- The nonce of Genesis Block is 2083236893 which means that satoshi proved the work on genesis block by performing 4,166,473,786 sha-256 hashing operations (2,083,236,893 nonce increments and \"Double\" sha 256 operations per nonce).Hoping the math is correct, it means that the device used for mining Genesis block performed at 8228 h/s hashrate (4,166,473,786 hashing operations / 506,360 seconds) .Is the above calculated hashrate close to the one you'd expect from CPU mining back in 2009? any notes on the math used here?",

The timestamp can be adjusted forwards or backwards to the miner's will, no matter whether there is competition or not. Same with the way the nonce is selected. But I don't know why he would have done something like that. Most likely, your assumptions hold true. I'm also not aware, when exactly miners started playing with the timestamp as secondary nonce.This would be a question probably best answered by long-time miners from the Mining board, like philipma1957 and NotFuzzyWarm.Quote from: Moussa Al-Basheer on August 07, 2022, 11:20:06 PMNote: Am new on here, is there a way I can move the topic to \"Development & Technical Discussion\" or shall I just delete and re-post?On most boards, you can do it yourself just on the bottom left corner.There's even a 'Lesson' about it  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5265053.0You can quickly find topics using the https://ninjastic.space/search search tool, by the way.

I do understand what you're trying to do; personally I'd mostly stick to the maths and maybe write an isolated example to gather some benchmarks. But in theory, mining is a completely random process and you should not get any better or worse results in the long run whether you just count up or do something more complex.",

The timestamp can be adjusted forwards or backwards to the miner's will, no matter whether there is competition or not. Same with the way the nonce is selected.While it may have been able to be adjusted to any value initially, the genesis block clearly states the earliest date it could have been generated.Read the coinbase sig.Alas, bitcoin rules (which means all mining) sets limits on the value it can have as stated above.As I regularly state when the subject of the 'block timestamp' comes up, the stamp is not 'the time the block was mined'It is either when the pool sent the work to the miner or what it was adjusted to by mining code (or the pool).But adjusting the timestamp is no longer required with stratum, and all pools other than those setup by n00bs who don't know what they are doing, use stratum.Stratum was designed for this reason, to put extra nonces in the coinbase sig, not use the timestamp.This usually leads to the block timestamp being 'close' to when the block was mined - generally within X seconds of it, unless the miner or the pool is screwing with it.That X seconds depends on how often the pool sends work to the miner, e.g. on my pool that's every 30 seconds, but other pools that may be more.Some may screw with it, but in general for most blocks, the block timestamp will be within that X seconds of when the block was found.",
