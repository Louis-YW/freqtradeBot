      "body": "Luna 2.0 is another way Terra are trying to salvage Luna, would this be possible? Well in my own opinion it would be temporary, I say this because, Luna may never attain it’s all time high again or even come close, right now many investors are hoping that the Luna 2.0 at least do okay so when they get they can sell off and cut their losses even it it’s the very least. If this actions are carried out it would cause a huge dump to the Terra Luna 2.0, Luna has lost investor’s confidence and only few are willing to hang on.",

The funny part of all of these is that another similar coin is going to spring up yet again, pretty soon, investors and novices as well will buy and cause hype, then the coin crashes again, and people lose so much money to it, rinse and repeat, investors do not just learn, they want to make quick money, forgetting they can't be lucky all the time.",

It was getting triggered by someone who asked about the burning address and stupid people are following it as a campaign by the developers to burn terra luna but the fact they were burning their own coin. I never saw the most stupid community like that. So many awareness didn't enough to make them realize about the fact",

They are not Tier 1 exchange. However I expect to see more support from other exchanges, especially Tier 1 exchanges. If they step in with such similar support like MEXC, it will be massive for LUNA Classic communities.Quote from: GreatArkansas on May 29, 2022, 09:38:35 AMLune 2.0 after its launch, the loss of its price is already negative.

They can fix the issue or problem with Luna, but the trust seems impossible.Maybe the Terra team and Do Kwon wanted to launch Terra 2.0 as soon as possible in order to reduce their legal issues potentially. Not sure they will succeed with the intention or not but in reality investors who got painful loss after the attack are still very disappointed with airdrop and Terra 2.0. No matter what price they entered from $60 to $1 and lower, they got same rate in the airdrop for Post-attack LUNA (old) so that is crazy airdrop.From this, we can see the purpose is not to heal the painful loss for investors, small investors in particular.",

Most of the developers already migrate to the new version and only one left are the personnel of Do Kwon that leave to still process transaction. There's no point of saving it since everyone already received airdrop while the people who bought the dip just left behind.Those people that insisting token burn usually those bought Lunc at 0.0000x price. You can't encourage everyone to follow because no one is buying anymore.",

Luna classic nor luna 2.0 or UST or anything that was created based on this ecosystem will recover, you could burn it all and have just 1 left and it would still not be worth anything. Just accept the fact that it is gone and it will never be recovered and we will go a lot better and further along the way.I believe that investing even 10 bucks on something like this makes no sense to me at all. It would make sense if there was a true team behind it, or it was decentralized, but with the way it is right now? I have no hope.",

Massive sellout from LUNA2. The new coin is going nowhere and will be dead while LUNC still has the possibility of recovering because the community loves any burning movement. DEX exchange, MEXC exchange want to use this 'burning movement' chance to promote their site, advertisement scheme. But this will benefit LUNC as anyone can also use it to gain the community's attention and shares of the market. If Binance wants to upper its standing among the crypto community and good public press, they will follow suit too. A win-win situation for LUNC holders.",
