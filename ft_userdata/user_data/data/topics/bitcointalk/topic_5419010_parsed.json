Maybe try to contact them here https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/ and maybe they accept some donations from people who want to give a token of appreciation to them.Any other than that you must be careful since there are so many impersonators who want to deceive and exploit the money of people who want to show some kindness to the devsÂ  so always check then verify the information's you see.",

THXYour hunch is correct, it's for bitcoin.org, not for the development of the reference client.For the hardcoded Electrum address, it's not meant to be a donation address.It's for message signing purposes in case there's a new version to be announced to Electrum clients (for clients who turned it on).Because the \"version\" (electrum.org/version) that Electrum provides have to be signed with either of those addresses for verification purposes.If you need to contact ThomasV (ecdsa) to get a donation address, here's his bitcointalk profile: ThomasV / GitHub profile: github.com/ecdsaThese links might be useful:Electrum developers: https://github.com/orgs/spesmilo/peopleBitcoin (reference client) developers: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/people",
