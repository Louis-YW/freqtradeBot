  "content": "Hi!This has probably been asked many times before but I haven't been able to find it. I'm looking for a \"non kyc on ramp\" which is/looks legit in the eyes of the tradfi banking world making it possible to use credit cards/sepa transfers to them *without* being asked 10+ questions as of \"Why are you doing this transfer to X?\". This \"on ramp\" could then provide the means to buy crypto and/or issue credit cards which could be used for crypto purchases. It's hard for me to clearly explain what I'm looking for but I hope somebody well versed on these matters would be able to decipher my mumbo jumbo and point me in the right direction.I fully understand that the connection between the bank and on ramp service will not be anonymous but I'm extremely tired of getting these questions all the time...Many thanks in advance!",

      "body": "Maybe you can describe more about what you need. Is it only to transfer crypto, buy crypto with fiat, and use credit cards with crypto without KYC? At first glance, it sounds like you're looking for a prepaid debit card provider that allows non-KYC users. What do you mean by tradfi by the way? Is it traditional finance? As far as my experience goes, my bank never blocked or questioned any crypto-related activities from a non-KYC crypto platform. So there might be a banking issue if every transaction is flagged by your banks regardless of what app/platform you use. CMIIW.",

      "body": "Pretty sure if you are going to be funding from a bank account in any way you need to KYC, there is no way around this. It’s mostly for the exchanges protection so some thieves don’t end up using someone else’s bank account to buy crypto and then withdraw this crypto.If you want non KYC then use a bitcoin atm or just do p2p. However this will be difficult if you want to do large sums but there are no other ways around this unfortunately.",

Personally, I would no longer be aware of any way of putting larger amounts into circulation without KYC. The emphasis here is on \"larger amounts\". I don't know where you live, but there are bitcoin ATMs in Germany, for example, where you can buy BTC for cash without KYC up to a limit of around 500€. You can then use these BTC to transfer them to exchanges or to buy vouchers, prepaid cards and so on. However, when converting the cryptos to FIAT and cashing them out, you will probably be confronted with similar questions again. Therefore, you should keep the deposit receipts of the ATMs very well.",

But we are talking about non KYC fiat on ramp, not a trading platform, and in this category there is probably no alternative to P2P or ATMs. Please provide a better alternative if you think there is one.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on October 12, 2023, 12:25:21 PMIn some nations, Bitcoin ATMs don't mean KYC freeGood point.",
