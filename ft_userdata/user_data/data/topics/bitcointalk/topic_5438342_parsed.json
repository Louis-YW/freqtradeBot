      "body": "Huh?Does the Casino support asking for money to recover lost funds? Well, As I know, If you send coins to the wrong chain. It will be lost. Some casino wallet addresses are the same, and they can recover funds. Rollbit can say that we do not support this chain, and your funds are lost. Why would a casino support ask their players for extra fees to recover the funds? The amount was only $50, and they are asking for $200 to recover it. Does it make sense to anyone?",

You are the one at fault here so this obviously not a scam because they are not liable at your fault if they display correct network name for their deposit address.

You lead opinions as if Rollbit should follow your will like on other platforms. They have rules and you don't read them, or you are again careless.",

It's a shitty situation, true, extremely frustrating, arguably, but I can't see how this is a scam case that deserves to be raised on this board.

But in return, it is unreasonable for them to ask $200 to get back $50!!It is true that the ETH address is the same as the BSC address but the two networks are completely different, also even if you have access to the private keys of the wallet you will not be able to recover the wrong deposit on the Binance network, I think that needs technical support from Binance and this costs a fee.So the best solution is to forget them and make sure well before depositing in the next times.",

Yes, It's funny they are asking for money to recover the funds even though they know that the user won't spend $200 to recover $50. They should get such tickets daily when you do not support native chains for the coins. Suppose you have Bitcoins and want to deposit somewhere; what if it's a BSC chain instead of Bitcoin's native chain? For Bitcoin, You should support the native chain first and then the side chains. For Bitcoin - Native Bitcoin chain, For ETH - ERC20 Chain, For TRX- TRC20 Chain, For BNB and BUSD - BSC chain. Those are native chains for those coins. People are used to it. Suppose you do not support the main chain of the coin and support side chains only. That's quite funny as well.",

At best, this is a reputation issue which shows that Rollbit is only willing to help in such cases if they are compensated generously for that effort. I am not going to go into details if they deserve such a fee, but their team of developers have certain daily tasks and duties they need to complete. Those tasks don't involve recovering coins and tokens sent to wrong addresses or wrong chains. If you want them to do that, pay for it. It's a positive thing that the service is available because many casinos and crypto exchanges won't bother to do it at all. The fee isn't worth it in OP's case.Sadly, your money is gone unless they change their mind. The casino didn't scam you, and I don't think any neutral observers will object.",

It makes sense on my side, from several similar cases that I've found it can even charge more than that.The recovery process isn't as simple as it sounds. If let's say rollbit has the same system as cexes wallet in general (deposit funds are swept every few minutes). The privkeys is generated automatically by the system which is then collected together with thousands of other privkeys in 1 safe which is tightly locked by the master key (1st rule) and it should never be opened (2nd rule). If you have to find a privkey linked to OP address, you must have the ability and the credentials to access the master key, open the safe and scramble it (contrary to the 2nd rule). Up to this point, the safe has actually leaked and you are the only person who will be sued if anything unexpected happens.",

Instead, they state it out front that they can recover it but there will be fees charged for it, and they asked politely if the customer would agree with it. If the customer didn't agree, they didn't force them to.I've asked Rollbit Razer to come to this thread and let's see if they can give their insight on that 200$ fee. But their last online date was a week ago. If anyone has a link to their tg, I'm more than willing to rely the message there too just to get to the bottom of this --IMO-- unnecessary accusation.

This is worrisome that the casino could stoop so low to have made such demand are they desperate to scam people that way?",
