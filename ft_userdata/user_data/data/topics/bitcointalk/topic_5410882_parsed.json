  "content": "Bitcoin won't hedge inflation until it hits 1B wallets: ScaramucciAccording to glassnode, there are over 1 billion created bitcoin addresses, but this can not be used to know the number of bitcoin wallets, a site can estimate the total number of bitcoin wallets but no valid data which can be considered accurate about it because a single HD wallet can be able to generate many addresses and some people may continue to use different address for different transactions. Okay, let us assume that bitcoin wallet one day would get to 1 billion. I assume this because if Glassnode indicate only 1 billion bitcoin address to be existing for now, that means that less than 1 billion wallets are existing for now.But is what this man talked about be true? Bitcoin was less than $1 before, it got to $10, $100, $1000, $10000 and reach all-time-time of $69000 last year, now at $21300. Is that not an hedge against inflation? Bitcoin is highly volatile, but those that hold it for long see it as a hedge against inflation.https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-won-t-hedge-inflation-until-it-hits-1b-wallets-scaramuccihttps://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?%3Bm=blockchain.UtxoLossCount&%3Bs=1509303349&%3Bu=1576540800&%3Bzoom=&a=BTC&m=addresses.Count&zoom=all",

Bitcoin is highly volatile, but those that hold it for long see it as a hedge against inflation.That puts it less into the category of inflation hedges and more into a category with growth stock as pointed out by mk4. Being an inflation hedge would imply a certain disconnect from the stock markets, similar to gold, however so far Bitcoin seems to behave more like a leveraged stock position. Looking at gold, however, it doesn't really look like much of an inflation hedge right now either.Depending on what one expects from an inflation hedge it might still be early to tell though. It doesn't look like the decoupling from the stock market will happen any time soon, however I do expect Bitcoin to make up for lost purchasing power in a year or so.",

The last I could remember was when Elon Musk wanted to manipulate the market, followed by Chinese government FUD, this resulted in bitcoin price downturn from $63500 to a price below $30000, yet bitcoin skyrock back and reach $68900.

Bitcoin is highly volatile and can be regarded as a speculative asset, but in short period of time. If it is a long period of time, it is actually a hedge against inflation.",

Altcoins are easier to have x10, x100 in bull run and it is exactly what Bitcoin experienced with its past bull run.Higher price means higher marketcap and it's harder to manipulate higher market capped projects.",

I think many people fail to agree with this because it is unexpected and because bitcoin is still considered unreliable to them they fail to regard it as a possible hedge against inflation. Like I mentioned that people say things based on opinion, you will get to find out that these opinions are not the same amongst everyone, so as some say bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation yet or will ever be, some other experts have gone ahead to endorse it as one of the possible hedge against inflation.QuoteHere's where experts recommend you should put your money during an inflation surgeTIPS.

Is that not an hedge against inflation? Bitcoin is highly volatile, but those that hold it for long see it as a hedge against inflation.I also don't agree with the article, in my opinion bitcoin will be a good hedge against inflation in the long run. If you bought BTC last year near the ATH than it's not a good hedge. The high volatility we are seeing at the moment can discourage some investor now to invest. But the cheaper you manage to buy bitcoins the better it will be as an hedge in the long run. Another thing with the bitcoins price is that it's always quoted in USD and the Dollar had a very strong year, rising 10-20% against many other currencies. Taking that into consideration for all of the non USD investor it's another boost to the inflation hedge. Â The number of real bitcoin wallets is hard to calculate because so many wallets change their address for every new transaction. Even the mobile wallet that I only use for small transaction below 100 USD changes the bitcoin address regularly, and then most of the investors have not only 1 or 2 wallets but probably 3-5.",
