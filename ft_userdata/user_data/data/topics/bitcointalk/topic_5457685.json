I assume you didn't do much research on this section of the forum before creating this thread. in any case good luck with your site and I wish you much success",

His reviews are pretty good and helpful for the gambling community. Still, GamblingBro hasn't reached Full Member rank in two years. For now, I think it is better for you to buy a copper membership to make everything looks better. You have added 6 casinos review link in the OP. 3 casinos are owned and operated by the same team among those six casinos. Try to publish the review of different popular casinos.BTW, don't make consecutive posts. It is against the rules of the forum.",

      "body": "We reviewed Betfury, a casino we tried and loved!Check our three step guide on how to play FunFury Battle1. Make bank – collect as many FunFury coins as possible during the tournament, this will give you an upper hand. Don’t do this ahead of time, as these coins are reset every time a battle starts.     1.1. Spin the Fury Wheel at the beginning – it’s pretty clear that with no deposit this will give you 8000-10000 funCoins, which works great for us!     1.2. Claim the Fury Box once every hour – for an extra 300 FunFury to play with.2. Low Risk Start – Choose a high RTP game and set it to a 50/50 chance of winning, Dice works great for this. Set your bet somewhere between 20-100; a lower bet will make your progress slower but it will also help accommodate long losing streaks. Turn on fast mode, configure the autobet and let it run for as long as possible.3. High Risk Ending – Remember you won’t get to keep any of the FunFury coins you accumulated. If you still have some bankroll near the end you can start betting more aggressively. At this point we recommend you start playing manually for added control.We did this a couple of times and it works like a charm. We managed to reach the 9th spot which earned us $2.63, this isn’t a lot of money, but every bit counts!Read the full review here!",

They can take all their time so we would read a valuable insight from their end.Maybe he is just itchy because the casino review site isn't that new already. They are almost a month old now so some will think it's enough to have a good number of casinos displayed on their platform. Well for me, it's not about quantity that matters but it's about quality. So, I don't mind seeing a small number of casino listed on their site as long as the reviews are well-detailed and most importantly honest.Another thing that I like about them is like you said, they mostly review sites that are popular here in Bitcointalk. They will surely add Duelbits soon and yeah I also think the rankings can still change because casinos performance can also change sometimes.",
