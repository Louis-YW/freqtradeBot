This has been discussed many times on this forum. ETH comprises 95% of the block reward income available to GPU rigs. After PoS, the revenue we get will be just 5% of what it used to be at first, until network hashrate collapses to a reasonable level. At that point, GPUs will become very cheap, then revenue will recover, so it will make sense to build a rig again. But the payback time would be 600+ days.The losers will be those who bought video cards at inflated prices but haven't reaped inflated 2021 profits.",

If you're right, it will actually be cheaper to buy Ethers than mine altcoins then convert them to Ethers for the first time ever. That would only lead to more miners liquidating their rigs, meaning we could see RTX 3060 Ti cards going to as low as $250.",

It doesn't matter when the POS algorithm is launched, because smart miners are not buying video cards now. If the launch of the POS algorithm in testnets goes without errors, then maybe it will be August or September, but we are not in a hurry",
