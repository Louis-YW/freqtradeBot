  "content": "[/url]Argentina is about to launch bitcoin education in their curriculum,  this is going to take place in 40 High schools with about 4,000 students.  This is  an Interesting news many  bitcoiners have been waiting for,  I think this won't just end in Argentina,  other countries will take this same good  within a short time. Argentina  is the second highest  bitcoin  adopter in Latin America,  I the reason for the innovation is to make students  know  the importance of bitcoin. The economy of Argentina is suffering in the hands of hyperinflation. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-education-launches-in-argentina-for-high-schools",

I don't care about investment education that much, or rather, I don't think that should be the main focus of education on BTC and crypto. I do think monetary education, in general, is important, and investing comes along in that basket, but what is more important is what crypto can teach us on a technological and sociological level. We need to educate the new generations on it in order to have a better understanding and a better future for crypto be it BTC or something else and to avoid the pitfalls of monetary knowledge of the old.",

I don't care about investment education that much, or rather, I don't think that should be the main focus of education on BTC and crypto. I wouldn't want a talk about investment either but I would definitely suggest one about the risks of it when it comes to cryptocurrencies as a whole and the differences between them. There are too many that think every bitcoin clone out there will have the same success just because of a few loose common characteristics with it and get trapped or bankrupt in rug pull schemes.",

By introducing blockchain technology to these high school students, some of them might be interested and will proceed further when they enter college. Argentina just wanted not to get behind especially with their already struggling economy. It's just like the old Japanese kingdom sending some of its scholars to Europe and the United States to study and learn their technology, financial system, war machineries, etc. This is a good start for Argentina. And I hope my country will do the same.",

Teaching student of under age investment of bitcoin will cause stealing of parents funds. But if the school teaches the building and development and the techniques of bitcoin for future time. It will give support for the up coming crypto generation. And some countries have not start the journey of bitcoin yet. If Argentina bitcoin news is not widespread out, teaching youths the uses of bitcoin is a smart move for the pupils, including adults",

First I believe the schools will impact basic knowledge of bitcoin to their students thereby teaching them the imperative things as beginners. Furthermore, it is their learning ability and interest ratio that will determine if they will venture into teaching them about investment and finance.",

Is it only about Bitcoins or also about the Blockchain.Will glad to see a detailed article on this good news.Also if possible try to interview one of the students and ask them about their experience for the curriculum.",

For example, in India, the government is slowly erasing the actual history of freedom fighters and pushing their own organization as a savior of India under British rule. Make sure such kind of things are not happening there as well. If bitcoin is introduced under a positive note, then it should be fine!",

History for crypto is only a decade long so far, and I don't think it's going to take up much with what Bitcoin is and the basic explanation of what blockchain is. I don't think the discussion would move towards investments/trading type of stuff, that is if it went into the specifics. It might just be better to just include Bitcoin (or crypto) as a small of a general course about investments like what mk4 said so that people actually know what investments are and what they can bring to your average investor.",
