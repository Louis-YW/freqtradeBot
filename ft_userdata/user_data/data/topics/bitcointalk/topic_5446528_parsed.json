  "content": "Recently South Africa have been struggling with constant power supply as it were due to the inability of the power distribution company in charge of south Africa power distribution meeting up with increase in electricity demands. In today's economy we know how important the use of electricity is almost in all sectors of production and services without which a crack in a country's economy might surface. For the past few days many has taking to the streets of Johannesburg to protest against the power out calling for the resignation of the country president as the power situation has affected employment and work processes...   Source:https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2023/1/25/hundreds-protest-s-africa-energy-crisisBringing in Nigeria in relation to this situation in South Afric knowing full well that they are both Africans countries and, we have been facing and still facing worst electricity distribution conditions and constant power black outs in different parts of the country both in rural and urban areas and yet there hasn't been any protest call of any kind at any time for the resignation of the sitting president and every other authorities vested with the responsibility of power distribution. Rather it has seem like a norm, more of something we have adjusted ourselves to with the situation (na normal tins nah) despite the devastating negative impact it posing on the economy, increase in interest/fee rates from private companies on the citizens as a result of financial burden from self-provided-power, layoffs and unemployment surge, etc.I just have a few questions to this comparative relativeness:√ South-Africa is an African country just like Nigeria, currently believed to be the fast growing industrialized country in Africa which I believe it's part of the reasons why many Nigerians are moving to South Africa for greener pastures. Does it mean we Nigerians don't have the capacity and the wherewithal as citizens to boldly make demand in such issues as this or it is due to I-don't-care lifestyle maybe cause some feel they are able to afford a generator set so need not be to paddle in such issues.√ Or is it an issue of fear of the government by the citizens to their tendency on the use of force to gag citizens against what should be a demanding right. Or is there other underlying issues that am missing here.",

Anyway to go to demand better governance no be the problem but na the aftermath of such demand matter. One be say dem no go listen to the people on wetin dem dey talk but dem go last last do wetin dey their mind. Two be say dem go bring soldiers on the people wey dey street make dem begin kill. To compare naija leadership and South Africa own, my brother you sabi say naija history and constitution still carry military history and dictators join even the current Nigerian president na formal general for army but South Africa don dey enjoy undiluted democratic system. Even when dem dey for apartheid regime to when Mandela come become president better pass Nigeria.Yes lately I don hear say deir electricity situation don dey fall and one of their legislative member dey express serious concern about the light issue and the guy say dem go fight to rescue South Africa and not to allow am degenerate to Lagos where generator dey make noise everywhere. Imagine the comparison, well I wish dem well.",

Me sef don tire to dey blame the government because for this one sef nor be only government dey cause am. E get too many bottlenecks and restrictions wey dey prevent light to dey constant. By the way Naija and Southy nor dey dey same at all. Southy better 100 times pass Naija. For this matter sef, citizens nor get mouth to talk anything because na the same story every time . Na still the same story make them do private-public ownership of the Discos , na still the matter make them bring prepaid meter yet nothing don change.",

      "body": "Nigeria and South Africa no be the same nah. You cant compare the both together. They are already ahead of us in everything. The things wey we d condole for our country no go fit happen for Southy. You know why? because them the practice pure democrat(citizens get right to question the government without fear). But not in our country \"Nigeria'' that still use the military kind of rule to intimidate em people. The issue of light no be today wey Nigerians begin long for am. Em started during the time of Obasanjo to this present president. Almost all the president's wey rule the country don use light matter cash out big time. Demanding for light as South Africa people d demand for their own no go fit  stand for Nigeria because d country no d take eye see people wey d protest for the county. Even if Nigeria calls for it, em get some people(cabals) wey no go allow for the demands of Nigerians concerning light to put into consideration because they know wetin them the get through am. The forces wey hold light matter plenty. Protest or no protest no go fit put an end of Nigerians not having a steady power supply. You don see how the finally sell Nepa give private bodies to handle light matter. Na to tell you sae our light matter d on a long thing to come through",
