I don't understand why you are asking him \"proofs\" instead of just asking more detailed explanations if you are interested in this case. This is not a scam accusation thread and he doesn't owe you anything as far as I know.Regarding your last sentence reputation is not about repeating this casino is fair and reliable from people paid by them to wear their signature and avatar, it's all about showing how this kind of cases are handle and resolved actually.",

      "body": "Here’s the “proof”I had an issue with a bet where stakes odds provider scam radar messed up a bet for 4.3k. Support gave me the run around and offered me $100 as a bribe (which I posted here) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419009.0 I asked Steve for assistance as it was quite clear that support was not going to resolve the issue. He refused to help me and called me a scammer. After making my case heard here, darko reached out to me the next day and resolved the issue. However, he didn’t pay me on the single, he just credited me back for the wager amount which was already bullshit to begin with.Proof here https://ibb.co/56NRyrMhttps://ibb.co/NrwtDm3Darko credited me back the 4.3k as a bonus. As he did this, it messed up my + - and 25% cashback rewards.The next day, I lost 4.3k + 5k of my own money and should have had roughly 2k in new cashback, Steve said I had nothing and told me to basically stop trying to scam him.I reached out to darko directly and he advised that he would contact Steve on my behalf. Proof herehttps://ibb.co/r3djm50https://ibb.co/mcqTjLpI then approached Steve and instead of fixing the issue, he blocked me on TG and than threatened to only answer me once a week via email. I am down over two million dollars on this site and this guy treats me like I’m some child.To put the cherry on top, Steve had told me(You’re about even) than I lost 2k and he told me“Nah you don’t have any rewards now” lolNow he’s ignoring me completely, refuses to send my cashback and refuses to transfer me to a new host.I have always had issues with Steve for two years now, he’s a screen warrior. I love stake but I’m no longer interested in dealing with Steve at all. I am also a diamond 3 player.",

Proof or it didn’t happen.I did not claim my CB on those funds as I had lost an additional 5-6k after that, nice try though.Unlike you, I recorded all our conversations on TG prior to you deleting them like a child.Shall I expose when you insulted me? Accused me of scamming you even though darko told you what happened?Bottom line is, I am not interested in any appeal and I am not interested in doing any sort of business with you. You have insulted me and accused me of shit multiple times, just like you didn’t help me with my bet and called me a scammer? Yet darko refunded my bet the next day? Yeah, you’re right.The reality is, the real scammers here are you and stake. Now that your streams are all gone, time to turn off the RTP, don’t worry people will catch on soon, just like your fake drake streams lolI have tried contacting you many, many times and you just ignore me because you like to play games.I am formally asking for a transfer of vip hosts.Please and thank you",

The OP have to tell the forum users what conspired the both of them that Steve is insulting and accusing him. OP how do we know that your host Steve is insulting and accusing you without evidence. At least you would have screenshot some of the conversations and inserted it here and the reason (s) why he did that. Even though you don't want to insert images or the screenshot of it why did you tell us the verbal aspect of it. As it is said by OgNasty, it's like you are playing the victim card, and just that you were badly insulted so you want him to stop the insult.",

Well, I don't know about you dude, I am not the type that say good things about casino simply because the casino is paying for my signature ad space, My feedback on casinos are majorly from my experiential knowledge and usage of such a casino, my mention of stake being fair is solely from my personal experience with them, as well as experiences from other users that's been shared on this forum, aside me wearing stake's signature, you and i know that stake is one of the most reputable casino around.",
