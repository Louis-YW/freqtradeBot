  "content": "The reality of our current market cap is interestingly definitive, in that, everything purchasable by a decentralized or even a centralized system comes with a high price tag. Most economies of the world are heading towards recession, even though measures are still being suggestively introduced. It is however imperative that one should think like an economist to survive these times. How does an economist think, you might ask?Firstly, an economist would only think in terms of trade-offs.  As in, an individual must be able to give up something they own for something they want. There is nothing as a free lunch. For example, two of my paintings were traded with a cash token and 2 cans of perfume. She had expressed her interest in owning a piece or two for her wall space but couldn't afford it. She included perfumes she sells. The success of the trade ensured we got what we both wanted with what we had. Variables that influence an economy’s wages cause an increment in cost leading to inflation, whereas dividends might decrease and vice versa.Secondly, they try possibly to quantify ideas and assign numbers to things. However difficult this might sound, it’s always good to give them a try. With interests conflicting between keeping a white or blue-collar job vs going entrepreneurial, how are you going to measure the quality of your current job description to determine its efficiency and effectiveness? How can you get something you want with something you have?",
