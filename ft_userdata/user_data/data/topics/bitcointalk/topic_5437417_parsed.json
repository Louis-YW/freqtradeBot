Surely the competition in the market is currently becoming so hard to predict and choose which coin to invest and as you said, you are looking for coins that are still cheap with potential, I recommend doing your own research with such coins and surely we will gonna find one rather than blindly following someone telling you this and that is the right coin.",

You can buy them now if you afford to lose in next months before a bull run for Bitcoin starts and altcoins will officially recover from their bottoms.Not all altcoins can make new all time highs in a next bull run in 2024, 2025 and I only bet my capital into Ethereum, BNB for altcoin part. Bitcoin is my most favorite part of my portolio.",

They may have already reached a point where everyone freaked out due to it getting to its peak. There's a likelihood that it may happen again but that's for these top altcoins in the market.If there are those low-price altcoins with high supplies, it doesn't matter. What matters to them is the market that they're in and how will the demand will go.",

And our earnings here depend on our beliefs and choice of course.Now, if you ask me, although most altcoins are high risk if I compare them to bitcoin. I have a suggestion but it's best that you only invest in it in the amount you are ready to beat it, and one of the coins I'm referring to are SHIB, Bonk, Shibarium, bone, Matic, and GRT.",

I was buying some Cosmos (ATOM) a while ago for around 10$ per coin, because i think that this project definitely has a lot of potential to become really big in the future and i think that a x10 or even more from here on are definitely possible if the market overall is doing well.I also looked at NEAR, but i did not buy at 1,30$ per coin and now it is at 2,30$ so obviously i can get myself to buy some now. If it drops below 2$ again i will probably buy some NEAR.",

Here is a thread I made about BNB back when it was @15$.Phenomenon of BNB (Fundamental analysis BNB/USD)Now, despite the fact its at 300$ and we are in 600 days+ bear market it still looks good. I'll update calculations (P/E indicators) when i'll find a time.If you want high risk/reward coin with tiny marketcap take a look at IDENA. First Proof-of-person blockchain. No KYC.

So it's hard to track of every altcoin that is in the market right now. So for me I can't give any who has the potential to become huge in the future.And with that said, I will stick with the \"traditional\" altcoins like ETH, BNB or ADA.They are solid to begin with, they've reach new ATH last bull run and I think they will do the same in 2024/25 bull run again, so I will stick with them, in my opinion.",

Does anybody expect for the price of BNB to shoot up that high after they created Binance Smart Chain? Do we expect FTX to be a fraud exchange until it happened? The point is, those altcoins that you're seeing right now might go up in price in the future, but at the same time, there is a chance that it will not.The good thing though is that, we have seen the worst already. We've seen markets going down. We've seen crypto coins going down really hard and currently, we are in the phase where accumulation is happening thus, the market is slowly going up. I will not say a specific altcoin to you, but I guess it's safe to say if you will just pick in the top 50 coins in terms of market cap. There is still a risk on it, but lower compare to those new projects out there.",

There are a lot of altcoins out there right now and most of them are scams!And btw, how you can define cheap altcoins? Is that measured from their previous all-time high and how much percentage dropped since all-time high?",

Investing in Altcoins is aimed at finding high returns, but the risks are also high, so it is impossible to give advice to someone, nor should invest according to the advice of others. If you want high returns and are willing to take risks, then look for meme projects and new projects. Regarding altcoins, I will only focus on top coins like ETH, BNB, and ADA... maybe the profits won't be as high as shitcoin projects, but the risks are also somewhat limited.",

If it is, then thats likely to recover in the coming bull run. Not all projects can deifnitely go back but only those have real potential and serious to develop their use case om different cases.",

It's a big company so I guess worrying about their reputation will not be a problem at all. Ethereum might be expensive but it will not be gone from my list to be bought whenever I have the spare. BNB too. As its usage will be nonstop in their exchange there is always a chance for growth, and their chain seems to be growing with NFTs using it for cheaper transaction fees. Check the popular cryptocurrency reference website for easier tracking of the good coins but don't expect too much with anything you pick.",

That alone might have taken longer to find the info. But from that list, I already own some of it and now, I'm just in a position to wait for the price to increase.",
