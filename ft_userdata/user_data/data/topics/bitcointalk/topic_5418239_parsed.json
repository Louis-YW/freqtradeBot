  "content": "Hi Alex’s readers, how’s everything today?As part of the series analyzing the list of Fan Tokens, I will provide my dearest readers with information about Santos FC Fan Token (SANTOS) - one of the Fan Tokens that has gained popularity in the market in recent days.Compared to LAZIO, SANTOS is in a fairly high price range at 13.3 (about 4 times higher than LAZIO).https://i.imgur.com/CuGLJNG.pngGoing through some information from the TokFlow Overview interface, SANTOS is showing quite a positive signal when the current TokScore is 61/100 with 75% of $SANTOS community making predictions that it will increase in the future.I will elaborate more on the Tokscore index which is calculated based on the metrics of Real Volume (30%), Source (30%), Price change (20%), Number of holders (15%), and other social metrics such as the increase in interaction on networking sites, the number of followers and subscribers (5%), thereby scoring the token's strength/weakness based on a 100-point scale. For $SANTOS, the score is in the range of \"Average”, in close proximity to the “Good” level. This shows the potential of a bullish trend for this token.With such a pretty good index, it’s worth noticing how the big and small money flows regard $SANTOS?As usual, we cannot ignore the significant factor that has the strongest influence on the token price - Smart Money:https://i.imgur.com/Jgw0z5A.pngIt can be seen that, for Santos, Smart Money was active only in the first 6 months when this token was listed on the exchange, and was highly active between March and May of this year:With the highest buying price of $978K (March 11) and the highest sell price of $836K, Smart Money successfully pushed $SANTOS price from about 2.1 (late February) to 8.7 (March 12).And once again, with the highest buying price of $817K (May 18), and the highest selling price of $856K (May 18), Smart Money also pushed the lowest $SANTOS price from 1.7 (May 16). ) to hit the peak at 6.7 (May 18) after only 2 days.In this fourth quarter, Smart Money's activity was at a standstill. However, the token price increased quite high (reaching a peak of 25.2 on September 24, 2022), also during this time, the highest figure in Q4 was recorded for buyers were $158K (September 23, 2022); $151K (August 17, 2022) and $140K (September 23, 2022) for sellers. This proves that the community is quite interested in $SANTOS, so there is no need for MM to put too much effort in pumping the price.This can be shown in other Smart Money metrics:https://i.imgur.com/E8jgv7r.pngBuy orders scattered from $19,000 to $20,500. The largest buy order executed was worth $20,377 from wallet 0x08493d163de902cd289ae51406fe4ec8385634d2.https://i.imgur.com/P9VM9wE.pngSell orders scattered from $10,000 to $31,000. The largest sell order executed at $31,012 coming from wallet 0xa38c28f8049d95a0ef025cfbd3a2bff6ab2692c9.https://i.imgur.com/Nhwm8OV.pngTotal assets of Smart Money wallets are currently worth $716K, a modest number. There’s only 2.92% holding SANTOS, while the Total Value In is $20.9M, and the Total Value Out is $20.3M. This indicates that MM has transferred most of the cash flow and left only a relatively small amount in the wallet.With the average buying and selling price of SANTOS tokens ranging from $8.6 - $8.5$ and a very high profit of 163%, it is very likely that Smart Money will dump if there is a strong $SANTOS bull run coming. However, how massive the sell-off is depends on the volume of tokens that Smart Money holds. Holding a quite small volume at the moment, it’s necessary for Smart Money to have a strong adjustment to accumulate a large volume of tokens as well as ensuring its control of the community.So, which situation will be more likely to take place, especially in the context that the community is giving a lot of favor to the SANTOS token. Will Smart Money wait for a strong adjustment to accumulate more or will the price pump greatly for MM to dump it? The answer will be found in the next article. Stay tuned with Alex!",
