  "content": "Looking for marketing power / JV for a crypto project.We have already everything up and running, two tokens, smart contracts deployed, two dApps & website, listed at 10+ coin trackers, a few YouTube influencers, etc., but we are short of marketing to push this to the Moon(!)It's a miner type of project. Investors invest in, get rewards, stake & compound & take profits, but it doesn't stop, it continues. We want to build a community that knows how this works and bring in \"fresh blood\". However, it's also much more. That's just the start and we see there's huge potential behind this, but it needs marketing that brings results.To be clear, we do not need mods, shillers, or upvoters. We are looking for pro YouTubers willing to give visibility, big Twitter accounts willing to spread the word, and \"botmasters\" able to drive interested users from Telegram groups. We are willing to do a profit-sharing deal either for certain rounds or long-term. Profit-sharing can be written on the smart contract(s). Alternatively, we're willing to JV with an investor who finances marketing for example through a multi-sign wallet making every marketing spent transparent. We have connections to paid Tube/Twitter influencers etc, who will do the job with money. If interested, please DM something else than \"Hi, tell me more\", and I will DM back the details, thx!",
