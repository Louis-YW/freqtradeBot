  "content": "Hey everyone!I am looking for enthusiasts who are interested in building an exciting product or just simply bored! ----------------------Project name - BenefAid.Concept:BTC Build a simple platform for the content creators and crypto communities. BTC User creates a \"message\" that is shared with the public (similar to Twitter). This \"message\" is an NFT and can be a simple text or a media file.BTC Other users can upvote it, donate to it(goes to the content author), and leave a comment.BTC Unlike traditional NFT Marketplace, at the BenefAid you don't trade an NFT, but rather create content and monetize it. Every user can receive donations.BTC Users can follow each other and build communities. Within the community, every user(approved follower) can send \"messages\" (NFT messages) that are only available to the community members. BTC Two types of users: Aiders - people who donate, follow, and upvote. And Benefiters, people who create content, have followings.BTC Community Founder(content creator with followings) can receive donations, funds from upvotes, etc. BTC 100% of earnings go to the content creator/community founder.BTC BenefAid makes revenue from in-app purchases: unique icons, extra features, customized profiles, etc.BTC BenefAid will have native tokens(subject to change).BTC All major project contributors will be rewarded.----------------------Please let me know if anyone finds this idea interesting/is willing to help/or just a recommendation.P.S. except for SocialFi, is there any other similar platforms?Â  TG: https://t.me/+eBeInnAk_OU5NTAx",
