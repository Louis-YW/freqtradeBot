  "content": "Quick Monday poll for the good start of the week.I've heard a few crypto-friendly financial experts saying that everyone should have at least 10% of their investment portfolio located in crypto. Lets find out how this looks for this forum.Rules:Bitcoin and all other crypto should be considered but excluding fiat-pegged stablecoins.Retirement funds and value of residential properties should not be included in equation, but any investment properties should.Vote changing allowedYou can lie in the comments, but try to be truthful in the poll, it's anonymous after all Feel free to comment whether you're comfortable with the level of your current crypto holdings, or do you plan to increase/decrease it.",

And I wonder whether the altcoin I bought can still increase or not at all. But if that altcoin can't increase again in the next altcoin season, I can't do anything but just wait.",

Bitcoin not only IS a cryptocurrency, but it's a \"poster boy\" for the entire market. Therefore, by all means, it should be placed in the same category.Just like with the stock market, you have a good stocks, and stocks that you shouldn't touch with 10 foot pole.Quote from: pooya87 on January 17, 2023, 06:21:20 AM...I have said it before that majority of my portfolio is bitcoin which is a high percentage, that sometimes makes me uncomfortable since I feel like I haven't diversified enough into other markets Similar here, I don't hold majority of my wealth in BTC, but my exposure is still way higher than that recommended by *experts*. But, in my case, it just happened - as bitcoin appreciated in value, a small percent became significant. I just never bothered to re-balance my portfolio. And I probably won't be doing it now, during what might be the beginning of a new bull run",

Even that is not the best example since even penny stocks have some utilities while altcoins have none!Given the differences that we like to think exists, bitcoin is very much a cryptocurrency like the rest of the altcoins and that is a definitive factor to place them in same category. Besides, there are some altcoins that have been known to stand out and offer securities so, it won't be the best of ideas to start creating categories over any little difference out there.In that regard, am very much in agreement with the level of categorisation by OP.I acknowledge cryptocurrency to be an innovation for the feature but still, I don't see it to hold all the opportunities that can make one have a much better life. It remains a field amongst many so, I hold a good enough number of my portfolio in cryptos and also look forward to increasing it when my available funds gives me the chance. Can't really place the percentage now so, I leave this to it.",
