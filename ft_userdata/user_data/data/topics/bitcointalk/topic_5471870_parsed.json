      "body": "How much USDT to exchange for CryptoClicker tokens?Pre-exchange with a discount starts tomorrow. How many and what kind of tokens are needed? CLICKER:- You need a minimum of 5,000 CLICKER to get your first Monster Contract. This will allow you to start the game, get Airdrop and the rest of the bonuses.- The player will then be able to evolve the monster into a stronger monster for 22,000 or 30,000 CLICKER.- A total of 3 Contracts are available at a time. Total with all evolutions - 90,000 CLICKER maximum at launch.- BUT there will be a new Evolution available 2-3 weeks after launch. Taking into account the purchase limits, for the fastest and most productive start it is better to take the maximum of your limit, because it is impossible to get more than 80,000 CLICKER at a discount.In summary: to start the game and get bonuses, you'll need at least 5,000 CLICKER. And to get the three best monsters at the same time, you need 90,000 CLICKER, up to 80,000 of which can be obtained at a discount. SUPPER:- The weakest booster will only be worth 2 SUPPER. Gives +1 click damage.- The toughest booster is worth 15 SUPPER. Gives +30 auto damage every minute.- Boosters can be combined and used on different monsters.- Boosters don't require a lot of tokens, but they are effective and make life much easier, and taking them at a discount is a nice bonus.PREMIUM:- Token will be used for Mercenaries and mechanics available ONLY to the elite club of players. More details on this in the next post.- Most importantly, within 1-2 months of integrating the token into the game, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to obtain it through exchanges. ALL elite features will initially only be available to those who get tokens on the pre-exchange. The cherry on the top. Rewards for monsters at the start are INCREASED. By getting tokens on the pre-exchange, you can get a lot more tokens in a shorter period of time than everyone else.",

      "body": "CryptoClicker Global Update: Season 2All details of future releasesHello everyone from Peter Zeman! I am excited and honored to announce season 2. - Season 2 will be implemented in phases: major updates will be released about every 1-2 weeks until we get there. Plus there will be more minor releases as we go along.- The first stage was realized last Friday: we made a reward only for CLICKER. The second phase will be implemented in the middle of next week.- When all updates will be released - the 2nd season will officially begin.Here's what's coming up nextÂ  Â 1. Rewards for monsters, including event monsters - just for CLICKER (already done).2. Increased rewards for all monsters (already done).3. Contract repeat for CLICKER (already done).4. 5th and 6th Evolutions.5. Reward will be paid NOT AFTER killing a monster, but after each session. Roughly speaking - every day. You clicked, you got the reward. This way you will have many different strategies, as well as opportunities to multiply tokens.Â  6. You will be able to open an infinite number of new slots. They will be opened for 100 USDT. The first three slots will remain available by default, as they are now, at no cost.7. Each user will be able to take ANY contract at once, even if they have not taken previous Evolutions. That is, get whatever you want and whenever you want. Any Evolution is available immediately.8. Already in the next release we will make a dark theme, and instead of monsters - coins of top (and not so top) cryptocurrencies and tokens. Hype will last a couple weeks (so that you do not get bored) and then we will return monsters, but already with an updated design. We want to make witches with big \"chakras\", what do you think? 9.Â  Boosters will be for USDT.10. The starting set of boosters will increase from 2 to 3.11. We will add an Ambassador Program for everyone. Every active user will be able to receive improved conditions on the affiliate program. Those users who are already inviting players or will start actively inviting them, will get another nice bonus. That's why it is necessary to invite now and explain all the advantages of this wonderful update to users.12. We will redesign the site's main page for newcomers. It will be more like an instruction and more informative in general.13. We will launch a promo to attract the audience, even those unfamiliar with the blockchain segment.14. We will add hints to the app, simplify the UX/UI, there will be links to social networks, news and more.Â  15. There will be no commissions, only network commissions will remain (already done). We can't remove the network commission, sorry. You will have to pay, it's blockchain.16. We will remake the test monster. It will give either a discount on the first monster or frozen tokens, not \"some POP\". And yeah, I don't know how to withdraw them either (stop spamming support). Pis. 17. The withdrawal/exchange limits will be different. Everyone will be able to withdraw 10% of their total balance per day. The balance includes the value of all monsters received. That is, you can withdraw more than 15 000 CLICKER, if you have a high balance, a lot of monsters. And if your balance is low, then withdrawal/exchange will be available accordingly. In any case, in 10 days you will be able to withdraw the entire amount. The only thing - maybe we will still put some upper threshold for safety, but the fact that it will be much higher than 15 000 CLICKER.There's something more:- Regarding SUPPER: we're going to give up on it. It's hard for newbies. Existing players are uncomfortable. We need to be flexible. Those who don't believe in us - drain at a low rate. Those who believe in us - thank you for your trust. Already tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will announce (or maybe already implement) my solution for SUPPER for everyone who has it on the balance in the game. I believe you will like it. - On PREMIUM: there will be something too. But it's too early to talk about it yet. By the end of the update we will reveal the cards.- On CLICKER: it's not a stablecoin. There was already such a thing that the rate rose or fell. We will develop the application and CLICKER further. Volatility of the token is possible. It's a market.Â  Wait for the news. Moving on. Hugs!",

      "body": "CryptoClicker updateMobile app is sent to storesMeet a new major update during the launch of the second season. Some of the changes are already live and available to you right now, and some of them will appear when the new version of the mobile app is released. The mobile app will go out to all parties already today, and it will be left to wait for moderation. This usually takes from a few hours to 3 days. ð¬Among the changes (some of the changes to the app will appear after the version update):1. Opened the possibility to receive any Contracts at once, instead of in stages. That is, even immediately after registration you can get a Contract that gives maximum reward! Until the release of the new version of the mobile app, this is only available in the web version.2.Â  Added the ability to get new monster slots for USDT. You can get an unlimited number of slots, and for each new slot you need to spend exactly 100 USDT. Until the release of the mobile app, this is only available in the web version.3. Added 5th and 6th Evolutions, as well as new boosters and rewards in the Affiliate Program. Works ONLY in the web version right now, will work in the mobile version after the update. 4. New design! Tokens and coins instead of monsters. Now you can click on popular cryptocurrencies and get rewarded for it. More interesting design changes in the future. Available now.5. Getting Boosters for USDT. Available in both mobile and web versions now.6. Several major fixes that have significantly improved the operation of all exchanges, deposits and withdrawals. Recently, everything works without hiccups.7. Long-awaited dark theme in the mobile app (will appear after the release of the new version of the app).8. Addition of social media links and helper bot in the mobile app to make it easier to get help and find official news. Will appear with the mobile app update.9. Changing the logic of rewards for winning. Soon you will get tokens not after 10 days, but after every game session! Get tokens immediately and dispose of them at your discretion. The change will only work for new Contracts received after the update. (This change is inactive now and will work later, we will inform you about it separately).10. White screen bug fix and other minor bug fixes.Looking forward to the release of the new version of the mobile app and already working on the next update! P.S.
