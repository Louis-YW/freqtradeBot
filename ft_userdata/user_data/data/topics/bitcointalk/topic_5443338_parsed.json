  "content": "As title says, I want to buy galaxy s10 plus OLED display for screen replacement, product must be original! No flat display! I may buy your galaxy s10+ if it has other defects but screen is untouched and works well. If you have galaxy s10 plus 512GB Ceramic Black and is in great condition, I may buy that one too, I prefer Snapdragon version over Exynos.Or if you offer good price, I may buy new galaxy s20 plus. Don't offer me any other smartphone, I don't want iPhone or any other android/Samsung models.1. Post here or pm me if you have any question.2. We can use escrow if you wish.",
