  "content": "Creating this thread to be a reference to any new Ballet custom cards I made for my CypherHODL free raffles.      Arriving sometime this week will be the one pictured below of my painting Bitcoin Dawn https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5147522.0      The two current different variations will be in the raffle and past winners will have the option to choose a new one they do not have.     Any new winner will be sent a random card.      The cypherhodl Bitcoin dawn ballet card will be loaded with $1 equivalent in BTC at the time of loading.      If you notice the new card has no currency value. They only to do it was with the orange box and that IMO would ruin the artwork.      So I chose just to add my company name and nothing else....and I think it is better this way.      Future Ballet custom card made will most likely depend on my mood and also will have my copyrighted artwork on them.     So goodluck yea all!",

I love the hunt to find the personalized cards to add these to my Ballet card collection. Geophphreigh",
