Look into the current state of sales for crypto websites to see how often sites like these are being flipped for a 30x - 40x multiple of their monthly revenue (30x - 40x is a really a vanity metric, the multiple really comes down to your negotiation with the buyer, but crypto sites are increasingly popular and the demand is there).Let me know if there's any interest in these domains (have other domains in other areas as well). Thanks.",
