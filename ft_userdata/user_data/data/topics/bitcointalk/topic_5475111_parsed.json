I recommend you to learn about personal Bitcoin wallets and especially software wallets like Electrum and then try to create your own personal wallet and deposit your Bitcoin into that. I won't recommend you to go with Hardware wallets as they can't be trusted because sometimes they may contain malware which could be very risky. Go with a software wallet like Electrum and save your private keys and seed phrases on secure locations and then disconnect the pc that you used to create your wallet because air-gapped system is the most secure way to keep your Bitcoin safe.",

Quote- Coinbase has a Tuesday filing deadline to answer the Securities and Exchange Commission's rebuttal of the company's motion to get its major enforcement action dismissed.- The company is said to be ready to underline two legal arguments: that the tokens being traded don't represent investment contracts (and thus securities) and that the SEC is violating the Major Questions Doctrine that outlines the relationship between regulators and Congress.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/23/coinbase-poised-to-make-final-pitch-in-bid-to-kill-sec-accusations-quickly/So we will see how this things settle down between SEC and Coinbase. Or if SEC will also used their hammer against a US based crypto exchange, or if they want to show force that anyone can be under their microscope and could suffer the same fate as Binance or CZ.",

Bad news for me and it feels like the ship has sailed.In the grand scheme of things, 5% rise is nothing. Do you really thinnk that once BTC goes above 100k it will matter to you whether you bought it at 35k or 37k? Don't let this feeling linger on you and instead just start investing, preferably as soon as possible. Another thing, instead trying to time the market (as you will fail at it anyway), you might wanna consider DCA investment method.

Managing HW ain't that hard at all. Just get one (preferably open source), send smaller amount of bitcoin first to figure things out and once you feel more comfortable, send the rest.",

You should be the one controlling your money yourself. If you allow a third party to control your money, then you are wrong. All I do on exchange is just buy bitcoin, and after buying it, I do send it to my personal wallet instantly, which I know am the one in  control of it. If you are not confident about your skills, all I will recommend you do is go for more research and learn. If you will be making investments, you shouldn’t be tired of reading because we know money is involved. Any slight mistake can lead to you losing your entire investment.",

Don't let this feeling linger on you and instead just start investing, preferably as soon as possible. Another thing, instead trying to time the market (as you will fail at it anyway), you might wanna consider DCA investment method. I have a 70k savings account and 20k available if I sell the car (and get a new one on credit).I intended to invest 20k in BTC shortly after the FTX collapse. However my deposit on binance (5k euros, and I intended to make 3 deposits) was stopped by the bank and the momentum was gone.That same 15k investment now only allows me to buy half a BTC or even less. This also means that if 1 BTC ever skyrockets to the moon, I will only make half of the money that I could have made. I want to get in now. Hopefully I can do this on Binance, from Belgium. I was advised to go for small deposits first but the price is already rising. I estimate the odds quite high of my bank stopping a 5k deposit to Binance. I don't know how to proceed if that happens.",

Maybe he does not actually have the funds to pay anyone back. As far as I know, withdrawals are still frozen and despite promises of a coming solution, if he has no money then he is just biding for time. He believes he can get the money back with profits that will not exist anymore because nobody is going to use Poloniex after this.",
