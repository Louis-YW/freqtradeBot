Of course, it is impossible to understand something when their income depends on not understanding it. Well, this is the difference between honesty (Bitcoin) and total moral corruption (Ethereum and the rest of the fiat world). I repeat. There is no such an invention in PoS. This is the way fiat currencies and even the gold standard worked since the origins of monetary history. All modern nationalized fiat currencies (the USD, the EUR, the GBP, etc.) are already digital and working under the PoS model.  Where is the innovation? Nowhere. This is the computer versus the typing machine, and old fogeys proposing going back to the typing machine because computers spend energy. Well, you type… I’ll use a computer. Let’s see who wins.",

They are just a group of individuals who have misplaced priorities and have been misled because of misinformation or under information about the major causes of climate changes. If they have had proper information, they would channel their energy plus resources to campaigning about Increasing deforestation and increased combustion of coal, oil and gas which are leading causes.",

This forum is a bit of an echo chamber though so doubt my option will hold much sway.Most Bitcoiners reach a point where they begin using alternative energy to mine.  I personally wouldn't have a 12kWh solar system if it weren't for Bitcoin.  Now with them using Bitcoin mining to cut down on wasted natural gas, you can even make the argument that Bitcoin mining is a positive for the environment.  Sure, it's still a net negative, but making progress.  When you consider the industries that Bitcoin is attempting to replace, there is a chance it ends up being a net positive for the environment.  We just aren't there yet because people will always chase profits over doing what's right.  You can only hope at some point a majority of Bitcoiners are so rich that they prioritize the planet over their pockets.",

But it's clear that climate change is caused by a lot of pressure from hundreds of different industries, bitcoin is not the only cause of climate change. Many people think that other industries create use value so emissions are acceptable, but so does bitcoin, it doesn't give them value but it gives value to millions of other people. Therefore, this can be considered a conservative, incorrect argument. This is yet another excuse for bitcoin haters to take advantage of mining to put pressure on bitcoin.",

I'd say there are tons of things to blame for enviromental destruction and Bitcoin would hardly make the list, yes Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy no doubt, but definitely not at the level of it being enviromentally destructive as some of these propagandas make it seem, and definitely changing from pow to pos is extremely improbable.",
