  "content": "For example: Mt gox, liberty reserve, luna UST All that was happened on the beginning of qt Qt means quantive tighting means central banks shirnk the money supply.However this big lossses helping to eliminate the inflation becouse all those like UST and liberty resrve kind of things will eliminate the big money from the circlelation.Luna UST was nothing so they have to make second stealing also only god knows wich way or how they gona steal but we are like bees we collect honey then they make smoke....and come take it our honey off course it might be not fair but after big printing they have to take inflation away only way is to eliminate existing bigger money from the crowds.Once its eliminated the money from the crowds then printers can go on again again to print more money.But the next QT phase will be ugly more \"get rich\" quickly kind of people will lose their money If 2021 they printed a lot money then 2023 they have to do double times it means bigger set up for the collection of bigger money bigger basket and bigger BLACK SWAn event off course 1929 it was al capone from who they took money but first place they used al capone to be bee to collect honey but times are changed and bootleggers have replaced by luna UST kind schemes.We could only imagine what could be the 2026-2027 when next quantive tighting start the bull run been on and bees been collecting honey so it could be taken away with smoke ....something in crypto it could be who knows but one thing for sure bigger the debt circle and money printing then bigger the operation to eliminate money.We dont need to say even big organised crime operation like cyber crimes...all those been set up when in the world economically quantive easing and all those wanmabee criminals just been used as bees to collect the honey so at the end of the quative easing the honey collectors will come and take it thats only purpose the organise crimes been set up by highet powrers...but when organised crime operations not enough to collect honey then LUNA UST kind of operations been used and when this not enough they will use even more schemes to take MONEY But money is a publick asset not a private thing if money going wrong direction or too much money stay one place it will couse inflation and therefor distruptions on our daily living if you talk abput dirty money then goverment dont care or police that money is not clean moraly or ethics...no no its all about that money is just part of economy and again if money flows not correct ways it can harm the daily lifes by bringin inflation.Right now we dont need to name some eu zone countries where inflation are slightly higher...it coused of dirty money in flow too much always dirty money activity couses inflation Look at the uk is good example becouse uk been famous about all world dirty money activities.Authorities can stop all things if money flows too wrong ways becouse they have to protect living envoirement the law enforcement dont take orders by moral or ethical reasons but its just the part of the bigger game First money wgat is destined to collect will need to be collected from many places also casinos working same ways but whole point is if there is so much money printing then so much inflation to take away inflation its not enough to cut off just the money supply...u got to eliminate existing all ready printed funds also If things are not like that then all currencies specially usd will end up fast like zimbawe dollar but it not happened becouse our govetment is good to collect honey from the bees with various operations and schemes",

      "body": "Image link: Â https://i.ibb.co/XYqjckg/washington-last-act-loot-treasury.jpg\"End of money printing\" made me think of this quotation attributed to George Washington. Which has circulated on social media recently. Its a crazy thing. To think that circumstances have deteriorated to such a significant degree in prior centuries that governments would loot their own treasuries. Will it be that bad? We could be in for a rough ride if so. There will be no more need for Bear Grylls, post apocalyptic movies or naked and afraid in the wilderness reality shows. We could all be living it. Which is crazy to think about. I wonder how the average person would fare under those conditions. Especially with recent announcements claiming that rain water is contaminated with PFLs and no longer safe to drink. There was also another announcement I saw claiming that soil is contaminated with lead and people should get theirs tested. Had to check on amazon for lead contamination testing kits. Luckily they appear to be affordable.",
