The developers of this coin connived with some government officials to scam the public. This is what happens to greedy or uninformed people who are enticed by quick money or blinded by ignorance. It is also a lesson for people to do their research and invest in only reputable coins like bitcoin. It is also good to know that the investigation into the crime is ongoing and some people connected to the scam have been arrested. I feel sorry for the victims who have lost close to $300 million to this scam.",

Imagine how many years that it took for this particular scam in India, to see the limelight,  further imagine if the scammers tracks and identities have been cleverly hidden, then there wouldn't have been any arrests. There is need for people to be more enlightened about cryoto dealings, in order not to fall prey to this wicked predators. I see a lot of WhatsApp and telegram adverts that will entice you with bogus promises of making massive profits in a short time if you invest in some crypto coin. And you'd be surprised that people will actually ignorantly waste their money in this scams, I think that governments should be monitoring these scam adverts and arrest the criminals before they commit their evil deeds.One time an exchange called Patricia, floated in Nigeria, it wasadvertced on TV to gain trust, and people were using their exchange to facilitate their crypto transactions, all of a sudden the exchange collapsed with people's money in it. I think till date that people have not recovered their investments in the exchange, they came out and gave some assurance, but as far as i know, that was how the matter ended. We wouldn't know whether the intention of the exchange was to accumulate people's funds and go down, a ponzi in disguise.",

When Police and key Politicians are involved in any scam then it will be hard for the financial crime agencies to persecute those scammers until new government will come and take over. And I believed this what has happened in India scam scandal. The government in 2018 was friendly to those key players of the scam so he could not nabbed them at that time but the new government has to clean the system by arresting those fraudsters.Cryptocurrency education is most needed in everywhere now because it will help to give awareness to them and the kind of cryptocurrency investment they will involve themselves. And another thing people need to do is to check the coin in the CEX platforms first before proceeding. We thank God that they are finally arrested.",

We thank God that they are finally arrested.This scam originated from a state of India known as Himachal Pradesh. It all started because mainstream media promoted Bitcoin unknowingly when it reached a ATH of 21k. Then afterwards a lot of scam projects came into existence in many northern states of India. The RBI placed a blanket ban due to a surge in scam project. All of them claimed that they are better than Bitcoin. Due to which innocent civilians invested.money and got scammed. To counter this ban these scammers mainly used MLM with cryptocurrency and created thier own exchange and continued scamming people. After the blanket ban was removed by the Supreme court again these scammers became active and that is why the government used it last resort by applying 30 percent tax on crypto gains. I am not sure whether it has stopped scammers as still news are coming out about such scams. The problem is that everyone thinks crypto is way to become rich quickly and because of they greed they fall for such traps.",

Why I'd say that they won't be stop? Because they will just reproduce and the same schemes will be made. They won't stop because they all know that there will always be the victims that they can fool and no matter how hard the authorities crack them, they will keep on re existing because of unlimited tricks they can make.",

Education is very important and people have to accept the fact and lodge deep inside their mind that crypto is not a get rich quick scheme as people often fall prey for these things. What's even more shocking is the fact that authorities are involved in it just like their involvement in all the other scams. It's high time that awareness has to be spread and what more worst is, we cannot have any team to investigate any new projects because either it will become centralized in nature or else corrupt. These scams will stop only when Crypto and risks associated to it would be taught through open forum else people will just assume crypto as a scam.",

Most such scams make use of the stupid MLM schemes that are a rage in Tier-2 cities in India. All this bullshit started with Amway and then a lot of these companies started popping up selling soaps and herbal supplements and all kinds of shit. This is why MLMs are considered as an acceptable form of business in India. It may be so even in other similar countries with a lot of literate but uneducated, 5G phone-wielding nincompoops (sorry!!)This is the kind of demographic that these scammers target and easily fleece with light shows and throwing airs of importance by hosting themselves in small hotels and banquet halls. It boils my blood to feel that these people defraud so many people. In this case,, there were grown-ass cops involved too (well, even the cops in these countries of ours are like the aforementioned literate but uneducated, 5G phone-wielding nincompoops)Hope the police can catch these scammers and hang them by their ankles till they don't make everyone whole. The fuckers have pleaded that they have lost all the money and are running lot of liabilities. I bet they are just banking on the lack of traceability and the slow Indian judiciary to bail them out.",

So many people who misunderstand about crypto that they cannot avoid fraud because this fraud will continue to exist at any time, and usually this fraud will look for victims who hope to be rich quickly or in other words they are greedy. Key education to avoid fraud, they should study Crypto in full, learn the basis of crypto so that they can sort Crypto that smells of fraud, because usually frauds always offer small capital can get big profits.Which is very unfortunate from this fraud, people are even afraid to hear the word crypto, and with the emergence of crypto fraud that is only done by people like this, it is not surprising that more people are afraid In fact different, but the ones in their minds are the same.",

Government official getting involved? I'm not even surprised that they are involved TBH. Most of the government officials are corrupt, and include also the fact that they have the power. Authorities, and those who have knowledge in crypto are milking those newbies and those who are financially illiterate. Kind of sad, but that's how the world is. Some will go up, some will go down.
