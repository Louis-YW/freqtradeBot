You get a collection truly identifable by its quality, traits, and expressive behavior. The Mutant Apes of Ordinals is a collection targeted at delivering high quality profile pictures, use-case, and benefits to our holders.Mutant Apes of Ordinals is one of the few collections currently launched using Ordinal Theory, an approach to delivering Inscriptions (NFTs) on the Bitcoin Blockchain. We combine pastel colors and Doodle design, with Bored Ape/Mutant Ape traits and wearables. Our artwork is focused on expressive creativity, diversity, and inspiring deep thought into exactly how artwork combines and delivers endless potential.The ApesThe Mutant Apes of Ordinals Collection consists of 333 Mutated Apes ready to find their new owners through an in-group auction. The collection consists of 18 1-of-1 Apes (Ultra Rare), 23 Solid Gold Apes (Super Rare), and 292 Mutated Apes (Rare). Numerous traits can be accounted for, along with various background and wearables. Inscriptions range from 149,000 up to 332,000 with each rarity maintaining a certain range of inscriptions to not only give trait rarity, but inscribed sat rarity as well. You can view the inscriptions by clicking the button below.Interested in learning more? Check out our links at https://linktr.ee/mutantapes",

Bitcoin NFT's, or inscriptions, are a far more fungible approach to digital artwork maintained in the value of Bitcoin itself. I say it's a step forward, especially with the fact that Bitcoin has many use cases that expand beyond a digital payment system.",

Bitcoin NFT's, or inscriptions, are a far more fungible approach to digital artwork maintained in the value of Bitcoin itself. I say it's a step forward, especially with the fact that Bitcoin has many use cases that expand beyond a digital payment system. Let's be very careful about calling this artwork though.First off, NFTs have nothing at all to do with images, that was just the lowest hanging fruit for the technology because its visual. Unfortunately the idea of NFTs as images seems to have taken over the collective crypto consciousness so I'm starting to wonder if we'll ever actually see good uses for NFTs or if the market is just gonna get stuck in this \"NFTs are images\" rut.Secondly, this ain't artwork. The vast majority of NFTs are just computer generated collections of similar (usually) crappily made images that are sold as a cash grab. There's no 'art' in the work. The work of actual artists selling art is a tiny tiny part of the NFT marketplace. 99% of NFTs are stupid image cash grabs for people who are still buying into this fad.",
