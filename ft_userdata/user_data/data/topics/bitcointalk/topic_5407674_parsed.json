Russia is part of the biggest supplier in oil and the short suorpply is affecting the world. The war is affecting the europe countries hard because two countries in the war are two big supplies to europe. Russia cut supply of oil to euro and that affecting production, gas use. The Ukraine economy supply large amount of iron, steel, ore,stag and ash to the world and euro now in shortage include animal vegetable fats and oil to euro and the other countries. This is hard time for economy to survive what is your thinking about the collapsing of world economy with highing inflation.",

      "body": "Of course, the ongoing six-month war between Ukraine and Russia will have serious consequences for the global economy. First of all, there is a redistribution of spheres of influence both in the sphere of politics and in the sphere of economy. Russia is gradually losing the European market, where it primarily supplied coal, oil and gas in significant quantities. Now, as a result of Russia's blackmailing of the EU countries and the sanctions imposed on Russia, which unleashed a war of conquest in the center of Europe, the latter have set a course for the fastest possible rejection of these Russian energy sources. Europe is looking for and finding other suppliers, and will also gradually switch to alternative energy sources. For some time there will be confusion, so for some time the prices for these energy carriers will jump, but then everything will calm down. But Russia will lose big in the long run.In addition, Russia, as an aggressor country, will increasingly isolate itself from civilized states, and from such isolation and international sanctions, its economy will collapse, and it will itself lose its current status of a superstate, if it does not fall apart into many separate republics. As a result, our world is in for a big change.",

If this war lasts for another 6 months or so, then the chances of a recession will increase to >50%. Here in India, the government was forced to reduce the taxes on diesel and gasoline, so that the citizens won't revolt against them as a result of high fuel prices. But then, they were showering the citizens with freebies when the crude prices were low. Now they can't suddenly stop that. Either they need to increase taxes elsewhere, or they need to take loans. Both the options will be bad for the economy.",

Right now, all the nations in Europe will have to reduce the natural gas consumption and prepare for a not-so-comfortable winter.The world is heading towards \"de-globalization\", which means that the traditional supply chains are getting destroyed and we won't be able to afford cheap goods coming from China in the near future.

If you were to veil those involved in the event and asked people to judge, they will likely side Russia because she was doing it to rescue her children and save herself. I'm not sure if people are aware that Russia allowed alot of Ukrainians into her territory just to make sure they are not harm in the course of the war special operation.If others had judged right and supported Russia they wouldn't have been in the mess. I never knew Putin loves Europe & Ukraine this much otherwise there were opportunities to do the unthinkable which I think he is aware of but he ignored them. It seems he was just too careful trying to prevent negative impact of the special operation on people but people worked against it.In regards to food price, unless you don't produce food yourself, you shouldn't have too much problem. I doubt most countries don't have local foods that can easily replace that which are imported from Russia or elsewhere. The food narrative doesn't make much sense to me",

The Ukraine war gave the world an energy crisis and potential food crisis, but that was coming anyways from the post-COVID economic effects. Ukraine war accelerated the process.",

From what I can see, Ukraine is losing more and more territory as the war progresses and Zelensky is claiming that hundreds of his soldiers are getting killed every day. And remember that all this happened despite Ukraine receiving funds and equipment from 40+ countries. And when the war started, everyone claimed that Ruble will be reduced to \"rubble\" and Russian economy will undergo a complete meltdown. Ruble is now stronger compared to the pre-war levels, and the so called \"meltdown\" never occurred.",

We have to deal with the inflation as that's the impact of the war and it's inevitable because usually, there is inflation and only a few countries manage to skip from it for a year or two, and then there it goes again with a few percentages. The current inflation rate for the US is around 8% and CMIIW and that's one of the highest. And aside from the shortage of oil, there goes the high value of USD which solely affected most countries' dollar rate exchange. Those countries that are affected badly by this are the ones that imports and pays through USD.",

If the war is a big deal, even if we think of it from a mid-term economic perspective instead of a moral one (which I believe should dominate instead), then why not focus on stopping the war? We have one obvious aggressor here, and while it's a mighty aggressor, the world has more power and could, with proper policies, get it out of the way. Ukraine is asking for more weapons, which is unfortunately what we need. But if the world truly united against Russia economically, ensuring that Russia doesn't get money for exports, the war would be over very fast due to a total economic collapse of Russia. But no, countries keep giving Russia billions of dollars because of fearing recession and not being willing to work actively on alternative solutions for their gas and oil problems, and then of course Russia has even more money to keep waging the war. In the end it will have a much bigger effect on global economy than if cutting economic tied with Russia was implemented very swiftly and decisively, but hey, humans aren't very good at long-term thinking and oh no, 2% recession is a way bigger deal than people dying and being tortured when it could be prevented.",
