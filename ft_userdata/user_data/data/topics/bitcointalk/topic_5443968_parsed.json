The 6 digit price is not a must and we can’t rush things for the price because it will just make the price growth form an inorganic development which always lead to a pump and dump without organic price growth. It’s too early for the price to move 100k$ since we just hit the current all time high last 2021.",

Bitcoin can stay in the bear market for several years, that wouldn't be unheard of. Moreover, the current price isn't so bad, even if it's very far from the ATH. If enough people start believing in the $100k price and become willing to get it there, it will happen. But I don't think the momentum is there yet. Something must happen to push more people into actively buying Bitcoin, and there's no such thing for now.",

For us bitcoin reaching $100k or not is not a big deal, because what matters is whether we are involved in it or not.You can analyze the reasons why the bitcoin price has not reached the way many people want, fluctuations will bring bitcoin in both correction and recovery stages. How did the assumptions used to be when bitcoin was not as priceless as it is now and so fast was the process of proof given by bitcoin to date. Shouldn't be a problem for the current bitcoin price, but investing in bitcoins is the best way to preserve the value of the currency you own.",

Keep in mind that situation is quite different compared to previous cycles, with economy crisis, war in Ukraine etc and general instability in the world. Instead wasting time thinking why bitcoin hasn't pumped, its much better to use this to to accumulate as much as possible.",

Because once bitcoin crosses $100k, we will never be able to see bitcoin as cheap as it is now. Honestly, I don't expect bitcoin to go up this year because I want to buy many cheap bitcoins. I am not in a hurry to expect bitcoin to increase in price because if bitcoin does not increase this year, it will also increase in the future.

So if this price will still drop down some more, that $20k price could happen since that support line is within that range or even lower but overall, I believe that $100k is not a problem even if not as quickly as OP thinks.",

It'll be interesting to see if Bitcoin holds this support trend-line in the coming years. It will be around $25K by 2024 and about $30K by May 2024 when the halving is due, which I think is realistic based on a lowest price, especially if prices are to rebound strong towards $50K which I still find relatively likely based on 2019 relief rally / mini bull market, as well as a retracement to around $25K to $30K there after.As for $100K, I think that'll take until 2025 to reach personally.",

Because they can't take on all the debt just once, it will be released by Mt.gox on a schedule and can take many years to complete. Although I want those victims to get their money back, I really doubt that they will pay the victims bitcoins. Mt.gox's bitcoin release has been rumored for years and talked about every year, but so far, no one has received any compensation. Regarding bitcoin going up this year, I also doubt it, I will just believe bitcoin hit ATH after halving, no surprises will come, IMO.",

Moreover, bitcoins have another advantage in that their supply is not low; rather, it is limited or fixed, so we have more chances that bitcoins will become more valuable. We have to now just wait for the perfect time, when the demand will increase and along with that the price will also go up. Just don’t become impatient and sell your hard-earned coins.",
