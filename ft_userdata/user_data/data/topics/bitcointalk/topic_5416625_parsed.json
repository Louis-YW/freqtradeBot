I also \"reserved\" some XEN with two different wallets on BSC that are ready to claim on november this year, but i know people that have made this with hundreds of different wallets on different blockchains. Since a few month or so you can mit those XENNfts that are basically multiple wallets worth of XEN. I also know people that have already minted hundred of those NFTs and spent more than 1000 $ of gas fees on it. On paper those people are millionaires now but once those tokens are ready to claim they are probably worthless.",

Last mint with one month duration and I got XEN coins above 2,000,000 when price still higher and earned above $30 each wallet free mint. Right now still possibility for minting XEN crypto coins but I don't know will has bigger reward or increase down because many people get free mint this coins for one year duration. Still not late to free mints and prepare enough eth as fees transaction because XEN crypto coin with ERC20 network more profitable than BSC or Polygon network coins.",
