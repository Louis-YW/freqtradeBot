To test: visit the forum in a private browser window, if you see Cloudflare, scrapers won't work.Quote from: TryNinja on July 09, 2023, 04:24:42 AMForum was extra slow today (DDoS?) and cloudflare went full paranoid mode, like LoyceV said.

I am being worried of the whole situation at hand now as I can not freely make used of this forum as usual.I believe that Telegram bots are mostly tied to accounts that scrap the forum and then send the information to Telegram (a very simplistic and basic explanation). If you are using TryNinja notification bot you'll see that the scrapping is currently offline[1] due to how Cloudfare is behaving at the moment. This was also confirmed by both LoyceV[2] (who also scraps the forum) as well TryNinja[3]. The best thing that you can do now is just wait until things settle once again.[1]https://status.ninjastic.space/[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5248878.msg62523115#msg62523115[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5248878.msg62525045#msg62525045",

They are like scrapers which blocked by Cloudflare and slow operation of forum recent hours.The cloud fare seems to be doing more work than theymos sent him. I perceive that there is a great attack on the forum and there is always a test for secured connection while browsing the forum.It therefore means theymos has disconnected all the third party activities. This has affected the bot notifiers also. I believe this will soon be resolved.",

      "body": "This is my first post since yesterday. Because yesterday, I slept three to four hours during the daytime and i didn't thought for a second like why i have not received a single notification yet. Well, yesternight, i came to know about forum situation it was not opening in my side.Today, at 7 AM around (at local time) i woke up and checked the forum was working so i waited since that time, because i was still not receiving any notifications on TG. I am so dependent on TG that until i do not receive any notification i found it difficult to spend time on BTT.Well, because i am tracking boards too, so after receiving no new topic notification i thought everyone else also facing the same problem of not access to BTT. So now i thought i should visit topics manually and members were creating topics and bot was not functional so i fond this topic too. Point is, the whole time i was so dependent on the bot and didn't visited BTT and didn't made any post or reply. This whole things needs some redecoration like any backup system atleast that bot. Because if scrapers a re not allowed then we must be notified about that on BoTs too.",

This might even be a good idea. When the bot fails to scrape, send an informational alert.@TryNinja, Have you ever thought about having something like this in your Telegram bot?",

Apart from the mentioned and new threads notifications, I earned a merit today and didn't get a notification from the bot on my telegram unlike it  so I doubt it's back online, the errors still persist. However, I agree with you the fault it's not gonna last for long, hopefully.",
