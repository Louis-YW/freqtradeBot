If they may be doing the exact job they were contracted for; giving the public a faux sense of security.Such auditing firms operate like many of the trust ratings website, and they both can be paid to give a not so accurate report to sow how safe the platform is - If you won't trust a centralized exchange, why would you trust the report of a centralized platform, on the said exchange?",

However, the auditors could be working closely with the centralized exchanges to help them boost their market presence. Exchanges are under serious competition and would do anything to target more customers. And the internet market of today is about numbers. The exchanges claiming to hold the bigger amount of bitcoin in reserve could attract investors and newbies attention. So, its not new that people should stay a mile away from keeping funds on exchanges. Merry Xmas.",

Exchanges do not even keep any key for anyone, they generate the key for themselves and use it to store users coins. As for the exchange users, they deposit on the exchange, the exchange represent their coins with just numbers and store their coins (the customers coins) using their private key (the exchange private key). Which literally means that the coins belongs to the exchange on blockchain and the exchange have the full control over it. It also means that the exchange users do not have full control. Not only money misappropriation and bankruptcy is possible, exchange hack and freezing of users account or coins are also possible.",

In fact auditors is declining the audit on Binance Proof of Reserve since Binance lacks some documents to complete the legal audit. CEX doesn’t have proper audit because they don’t allow it. They just hire random audit services just for a show and not for legal compliance.CEX will be safer if there’s really a legit audit company that will check on them.",

This is the part that is easy to understand because the other part of auditor wasn't really connecting with the whole body, content and meaning to your post. Anyway, nice to remind users here on the right thing to do regarding the coins they have. Maybe some have the habit to procrastinate about moving their coins from the exchange to at least their own wallet and I hope they will have a new year resolution to do that and take a step to see that they adjust their coins to proper wallet to avoid crashing with an exchange like it happened to some people while FTX crashed.",

Always have your coins in your wallet and when you can afford a hardware wallet do not hesitate to order for one. There are many reliable auditing firms that know how to do their job. But most times these firms are given the scope of their audit. Their role might be to audit only a sector or a segment of the exchange while they are restricted to auditing some areas. An example is the case of the auditing firm Mazars which fail to give Binance a clean slate because it was not sure of its proof of reserve. A few days ago the auditing firm have terminated its contract with Binance.",

These are, in fact, a better strategy for a profitable cryptocurrency journey in 2023. We always learn from our mistakes, and I think that in the year 2022, centralized exchanges taught us some valuable lessons, starting with the Luna and concluding with the FTX scam and security issue. If there are no safer peer-to-peer transactions available where you are, keep buying in exchanges. However, once you have purchased Bitcoin in an exchange, try to send it to your personal wallet right away to prevent any issues in 2023.",
