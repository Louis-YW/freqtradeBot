I just wanted to know what people would like to see as categories in a list of sportsbook, to compare among them. You could check the categories that I have previously chosen in the url at the bottom of my OP, it will redirect you to my previous list. You'll get a better idea on what could potentially be categories for sportsbooks list",

Besides, you made mention of KYC which thrills me, many would say they would prefer the no-KYC option, and this always baffles me as to what kind of thinking has those people. With KYC, you are better of in terms of some regulations for better assurance because no regulated casino would dare to void KYC. Still, one has to do their research to be sure of this.Aside from what you specified, and with my choice gauge, it's good that the sportsbooks offer good bonuses and must be with a better condition. The site must not have any security flaws or too much bad reviews online. The deposit and withdrawal must be instant and the fees associated with them must be ridiculously low.",

Since the existing list will be for members of this forum, it will be good to update the list in line with those that have a presence here. Quote from: EarnOnVictor on May 16, 2023, 08:55:29 AMit's good that the sportsbooks offer good bonuses and must be with a better condition.

If any 1 of my needs are not there I will not bet on that sportsbook.Okay, I have a question for you. Do you do KYC on the sportsbook? As far as I know, All licensed casinos ask for KYC. Or maybe I am wrong? Let's say a casino has a solid reputation and they are on the market for a long time. They accept your country and have the market you want. But, They need KYC to sign up. Would you choose them to play? @vennali, I've checked your old list of sportsbooks. You have added freebitco.in as a sportsbook. I am not sure if they are a sportsbook. They have a casino named Dplay. But that's a different platform. If you want to hear my opinion about what I prefer and like to know from your future list. It's essential to know if the casino is licensed or not. So, Having a License Yes/No will be appreciated. Moreover, I would like to see what license they got. I want to know if they require you to do a KYC. KYC Yes/NO will also be a great addition to your list. I guess all sportsbooks have Live support these days. But, if any casino doesn't. Please mention them with a Yellow Star.",

The other points are obvious, but don't forget about the first ones because they can make a huge difference and become a big win into a big lose.",

Security - getting paid is by far most important. 2. Working with the forum. This is a player's thread and books are held responsible for their actions. Questions are asked of books concerning number of employees, time in business, experience, poster problems, etc. If a book is going to ignore a player's thread, they will be severely downgraded. Most books are very easy to work with. The following cannot be quantified as to importance since being highly detrimental in one category may supersede other criteria used.3. Poster review - poster review is much more important at bitcointalk than other forums, but other forums are also read. A high review from a new book will weigh less than the review of a book that's been in existence 2+ years.4. Anonymous - one of the reasons that bitcoin books are used is to stay anonymous. There may be times where it is necessary to question players but it should be a minimum.5. Margins - If players are going to have a chance to beat a book the margins have to be tight enough to give us that chance. If the margins are larger than -110 (1.91) that's a big blow to a book's rating.6. Payout speed - If the average is longer than one hour, a book will be downgraded. One hour is sufficient due to possible grading errors. A large book is dealing with a significant amount of money along with a huge player base.7. Markets - The more betting options, the better.8. Traffic  - time in business along with amount of players that a book has gives us a large sample size. 9. Currencies used - It's easier on the player if we are allowed to deposit and withdraw from alts.Miscellaneous - Books accepting fiat currencies are omitted from the guide. Other forums are read to make sure the ratings here aren't significantly out of line with the average of other books.",

Lastly, for me, they have an ANN thread here to make it easier to check if they have recent issues or problems before making a deposit and events.",
