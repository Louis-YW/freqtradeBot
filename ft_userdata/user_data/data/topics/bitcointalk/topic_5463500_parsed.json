It's one's privacy, and it should be respected unless there is some sort of investigation that could warrant that kind of searching, which I still don't find convenient.",

It doesn't really make a difference whether you delete the message or not, as they aren't archived on external sites to begin with.",

And I think it's pretty common, that a bot can only see information which is available online to be seen by the public.If it's not there, it's not possible for the bot to track it. Unless everyone from their end provide the data themselves to some sort of Form which then later store it in DB associated with your forum user ID.",

PM; also known as personal message or private messages, is intended to be kept private and not intruded upon by any other party. If it breaches the rule of privacy, it is not worthy of the title (private or personal message).",

Just like you I have not heard about anyone complain about this issue before, so it may not even be possible in the first place but you can never tell. Regardless I find it unwise to send someone a message and then delete it, you should always watch out what you send to people it should be something you don't feel threatened about.",

Pms are private information, only admin have access. But even if you delete the messages from your end, the receiver will still have a copy of the messages. Posting pms with another user is frowned upon for the most part, unless it is necessary like in a scam report situation.",

But they do it at will because nobody can access it except the administrators . It is easy to see deleted posts from ninjastic but I have never seen personal messages on the space. Personal messages are for private discussion. And I have never also seen any incident where these administrators release the PM of any member to the public. But if you want to know more about privacy on the forum you can check this link: https://bitcointalk.org/privacy.php QuoteCan personal message (PM) apare on ninjastic space? OP you should consider correcting the mistake in the spelling of appear in the topic. It was difficult to get the idea of the thread from the topic until I read the content.",
