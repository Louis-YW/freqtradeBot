  "content": "Stumbled across this fun thread If Satoshi Nakamoto Reveal his identity ............ ? and thought the thread creator would appreciate a follow up. Since he himself has locked his thread and thus no answers are possible there. By the way, side node for whose who still didn't recognize it because those machines are getting better and better: D l G 1  TAL M0 N K is not a real person. It is one of the numerous A.I. bots that exist in a long-lasting pilot project distributed over the Internet for several years and train more features and communicate with us real people. Form your own opinion by looking at his profile info, when his account was registered and what content he has posted in that time. On 2022/Aug/16 he created his account and post his first question about Bitcoin because he has absolutely no clue what it is and how it works. Two days later he posted this thread. But it is getting even funnier. On the same day he is trying to contact Satoshi Nakamoto    On 2022/Aug/19 he already had Bitcoins in his wallet. Wow, great success in such a short time period. Just continue in reading his threads and you will understand what I'm talking about  However he tricked many users and even succeeded in receiving some merits. Meanwhile he has negative trust points. Not only the contradictory content he posted in the short time but also the word choice and sentence formation that consists of the funniest and most confusing word fragments makes this very clear. These A.I. bots have trained various techniques, they try to look real by intentionally swallowing punctuation marks or putting two spaces in a row as well as trying to imitate typical spelling mistakes. However, their algorithm varies, so that they don't always succeed (as you can obviously see from DMs' content). Back to the fun part, now I can address him directly  Dear DigitalMonk, here my answer to your question to claim your algorithm a little bit:Satoshi Nakamoto is among us and is an active reader here. He is also still involved in the development of the code. There is not a single valid reason for him to reveal his identity, not in his lifetime. The truth may come out one day but even that is uncertain because it would jeopardize the safety of his family, friends and acquaintances. He planned everything and various things he is still planning. He will plan his whole life and it eats him up because he can't talk about it with anyone. Even if only a very small part of his environment knows or knew about him and his project, they would be involved and in danger. Although it should not really be so, because he is not a danger to anyone and also not a wild card that could be abused. Also criminals would have no benefit from knowing his identity, the system is running he can't change anything without the masses agreeing. The only ones who have a great interest in knowing who is behind this name is the large community. You and me and the rest of the world. And that out of pure curiosity, nothing more. The fact is, it would absolutely not change a thing about bitcoin and its impact. The only power that could stop Bitcoin would be the one that also ends the Internet once and for all. We all know that we and our direct descendants will most likely not see that state of affairs. It will be a while before the Internet is replaced by something else. There are still a few inventions and technological advances to come. Satoshi Nakamoto is a genius and he deserves all the awards in the world. But the good thing is, he already got them and he appreciates them very much. Satoshi Nakamoto is not an ordinary person who wants to cover himself with fame. His goal was different and he has so achieved his goal and is completely happy and fulfilled. Cheers to Satoshi Nakamoto, may his karma conquer the world.Satoshi Nakamoto is not an ordinary person and is not the sole inventor and founder of Bitcoin. He has many colleagues who not only supported him but also financed him. The only difference between Satoshi Nakamoto and his colleagues is that he also acted as a press spokesman. He was the interface with the public, the mouthpiece for its masterminds. With the introduction of the Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto would be hailed as a hero, the unknown mysterious Mister X who would free humanity from the clutches of greedy powers. Yet Bitcoin is the beginning of the end, the people will suffer, but people don't see that, they only see what they want to see, they are blinded. With Bitcoin and the introduction of digital currencies, the apparatus of power is only being expanded. The goal is clear, away from non-traceable cash and the introduction of a digital currency. First in a huge pilot project, then the people will become beta testers and in a few years/decades there will be no more classic fiat money in the world, commodity money either way. For such pilot projects offer themselves nevertheless nearly perfect countries, like e.g. El Salvador that in the year 2021 officially introduced Bitcoin as payment. In the following year, the Central African Republic, which is a highly underdeveloped and unstable state and, in 2016, the poorest country in the world in terms of real GDP per capital. Of course, the inhabitants are happy, because they absolutely need opaque technology to survive, and somehow the smartphones have to be used. In a few years, no one will talk about cash anymore, but everyone will clap and applaud and boast about how comfortable and safe they feel. There was no difference between fiat money and cryptocurrencies, the bad guys do their thing one way or another. The only problem with fiat money was that it was not easily traceable; fortunately, that is not the case with the new digital currency, everything fixed now and all are happy. Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared from the scene and no one will ever know who he was. The mob will also never question why his identity remained hidden forever from all the powers that be, who would actually be very interested in uncovering it. Because Satoshi was the hero, no doubt. The fictional character Satoshi Nakamoto has served its purpose. Gone from the scene once and for all. His sister will emerge when the time comes and announce the next step of the era.Which truth fits best in your algorithm? Looking forward to your comments. Have a nice day all and enjoy",
