  "content": "I notice serious Bitcoin companies like Swan and Strike use Prime Trust (https://www.primetrust.com/). What do they do exacty? From my reading of their API docs, they appear to provide companies with an API to acquire bitcoin on the fly, and they also custody it if needed. Is this correct? Im playing around with the idea of building a Bitcoin exchange. It seems to me Prime Trust provide all the Bitcoin related functionality, and I can concentrate on a nice user experience. Have I got this correct?",

They want to deal with the Strikes not the small guy. They want all your financials to the beginning of time and so on. Think of them as a really large commercial bank except instead of dealing with cash they are dealing with crypto.Not a bad thing if you are running a good MSB and want to expand, but for small players they are not interested**The not interested is from a while ago when a customer of a customer wanted to do some business with them and they more or less said if you are not spending $1000s with them a month then go away.....-Dave",

Prime Trust seem to be highly trust-worthy. And post after post here warn about building exchanges and how difficult it is to keep private keys safe (though I would like to know why this is the case).",
