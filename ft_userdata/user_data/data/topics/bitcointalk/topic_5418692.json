  "content": "EdenHazard took 0.3 btc loan from me long ago. I sent it using two transactions and amounts were 0.11480613 btc and 0.18519387 btc. Those who know original EdenHazard, he was a high stake gambler. Steve from Sportsbet.io can confirm it.My neutral tag when the loan was takenQuote 2020-09-08   EdenHazard took a private loan from me.Trust page: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=505752Long story short, EdenHazard was in real estate business but according to him for some mistakes of his partner he lost everything and even ended up in jail (some of you must remember the time when sportsbet.io were offering some of us to visit Dubai to watch world cup club finals, Mia Khalifa was in one promotion for sportsbet.io, it was few months after that time). He did not have anything left to repay the loan he took. I never had doubt about his situation. At some point I was even telling him to apply for a donation from covid-19 fund to do something for his life first but he did not apply because he never wanted to feel low to the community. At some point he even said me he was nearly taking his own life but all those days he was in my contact. Always kept the communication.The following was his last message on the forum PMQuote from: EdenHazard on July 23, 2021, 04:02:57 PMHow are you mate ?it8been a loong time , i wish you in healthy in this ensless pandemic. just to let you know that ive lost all acces to my mail and telegram where i put your contact there.and found remembering the only one btctalk account. thank god.we can now communicate over hereAfter that few times he knocked me on my telegram and was confirming that he is okay. But from many months I did not hear from him so I thought to check his account and found out it's still active. Other day I sent a PM to check if this is still him but never got a reply. The real EdenHazard would reply me in less than 24 hours. I really hope the real EdenHazard is well but whoever the current owner he is not the EdenHazard we used to know.Flag will be created and OP will be updated with the link.Flag: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3041",

I would say that he had no intention of returning that money to you.I support your flag and leave them a negative tag, but I think you can forget about that money.btw. I remember the Sportsbet promotion and the trip to Dubai, but how is this case related to this and the user himself?",

I would say that he had no intention of returning that money to you.Looking at the feedback I am assuming the account was sold before joining this 1xbit signature. The account was in very good shape to be honest. If you see his last forum PM, then it happened in July'21. If my memory tells correct then we had last telegram chat around that time. I told him several times that to join a signature campaign. He kept telling, he does not get mental strength, even he does not have regular internet connection. He was even telling me to take his account so that he can at least feel that he tried everything to give me something. I was saying him to stay strong and to find peace. I was telling him when he will feel better then he can start with this account again and can start getting something for living. Then if any day he feel he has enough to repay the loan he can. I was telling all these so that he does not feel pressure anymore and many more things, I can not remember everything correctly, it's been long time.According to him he actually lost his family members, business, ended up in jail in foreign county - every possible bad things that can happen to a man. At some point after coming out from jail he was homelessness and that's when he was thinking to take his own life.Another indicator of the account's current owner is not EdenHazard is the writing style. Hazard was not a shitposter. He was very knowledgeable football analyzer and gambler.  QuoteI support your flag and leave them a negative tag, but I think you can forget about that money.Thank you.Quotebtw. I remember the Sportsbet promotion and the trip to Dubai, but how is this case related to this and the user himself?I can not remember if this was  SyGambler or buwaytress, one of these two won a pool or something from sportsbet.io. Reward was to visit Dubai with family which was equivalent of a cost of 1 btc at that time (btc was $10k to $12k). Hazard was in Dubai at that time and was telling to meet (SyGambler/buwaytress) in the match.Around that time Sportsbets were pushing their marketing too hard. They were offering influential forum members exciting offers. It was then they offered me 1 BTC trip to England/Dubai (I can not remember). But for privacy of-course I rejected the offer. I am assuming they offered the same to EdenHazard too. One day EdenHazard was requesting me if I am interested to take it from him, at-least this will recover his debt. Then I told him that I got the same offer directly from Sportsbet but rejected it.Anyway, somewhere at that time, I was contacting Steve to check if he was really a high roller because he was a regular SB gambler. Then Steve was checking his profile and confirmed that yes he was a good client but for some reason for last few months he is not playing with them anymore. That actually confirmed my believe that EdenHazard really was in trouble that he was not making up all those story of his losing family member, losing business, getting in legal trouble in foreign country and ended up in jail.",

I wondered how a legendary account with clean reputation decided to advertise 1xbit scam knowing that their account could be tagged yet there were so many other good signature campaigns, but I left him a negative tag anyway. It now makes sense that the account probably changed hands and the new owner doesn't care.",

      "body": "Sorry for your loss and undoubtedly you will not get your money back whether the owner of the account has been changed or not. And I doubt there will be a loss of the account holder as 1xbit will still accept him/her as the negative feedback received for joining their campaign. This could keep staying away from joining on any signature campaign if this accusation happened before joining 1xbit. Anyway, provided a negative tag and supported the flag.",

High-ranking accounts change hands in order to join those campaigns or run scams.",
