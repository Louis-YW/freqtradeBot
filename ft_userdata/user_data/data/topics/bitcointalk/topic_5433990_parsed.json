  "content": "As most of us here are already aware that the bitcoin halving cycle always bring with it an opportunity for another Bitcoin all time high price, even though we can not predict when the exact time for this AHT will be but we are certain it will come. At the moment I am I am intense face of portfolio accumulation and I will like to share them with some newbies who may be confused on how to prepare for the expected time and what their portfolio should look like. This thread is not for speculation, but a personal contribution and suggestion as motivated by my personal decision against the next halving and I will share them with any one that like to read through the thread and also consider the comments of others that will go inline with your personal convictions. What my portfolio consist of ahead of 2024 halvingTo be sincere with you guys, I never give any thought for. Altcoin and as a newbie I have always been all in for bitcoin and I am very vocal about that, I have some friend who always try to convince me to buy some altcoins that they claim to be good and will give 10x profit at any opportunity, but I am not convince due to centralization of most of the altcoins. So I can say that my portfolio is made up of 90% BTC and the remaining 10% as savings in case there will be further opportunity to buy BTC at a discount price. So at this point I am all into BTC and nothing more.",

As you've said, no one is aware when the bull run will start and we also don't know what are the particular altcoins that will pump during that time.Yes, many of them will but we don't know if those altcoins that are part of their portfolios will also go up. The market is tricky but one certain thing on it is when you're holding bitcoin. You'll never skip the bull run if you have it because the entire market is going after bitcoin's move.",

Not everyone is with 99% of altcoins in their portfolio. But there are many altcoins has good potential and value, but most of them are scams. You sound like all the altcoin holders are stupid, but when you buy really deep of a potential altcoin it can give you much profit when the price goes up.Also, don't invest your money in crypto for thinking of flying high in a short period of time.",

It is always good to have some flexibility in your investment strategy.I mean, if you really based this data on previous BTC halvings, at least all occurrences increased the price of BTC in the market. That is why, investing and purchasing BTC while the price is relatively low on the market is a good strategy for the coming 2024 BTC halving.Of course, like OP mentioned, no one can accurately predict when the next ATH would come. But being prepared for such opportunity is a key in order to maximize your profits. We create our own luck and this happens when preparation meets opportunity.",

But the 90% you mentioned on the op, do you think that amount is save in the investment of in the bitcoin. When you are dealing with bitcoin you have to think from the both sides, both the risk from the bear markets and also the protection of the seed phrase. But I will also advise you op to reduce the amount to 60 or 90% so that small thing will be left over of in the hand for fire use.",

Or you're talking about your investment portfolio in general, not crypto portfolio, and that 10% is in fiat?Anyway, many might not agree with you that since altcoins are centralized, they're not worth investing. After all, many crypto investors don't really care whether a coin is centralized or not. They couldn't care less about the technicalities of a coin. They only care about its potential to increase in price rather quickly so that they could make the most of it and leave before it dies.",

And if we don't prepare to own a lot of bitcoins from now on, we will only see their price increase without having the opportunity to make huge profits like others.If we decide to invest in altcoins, we will never know which altcoin will increase because there are so many altcoins that we have to work hard to find the right altcoin. But when you choose bitcoin as your main investment, you won't be confused because the choice is bitcoin. Give a larger portion to bitcoin and adjust the portion to altcoins because you will feel difficult to buy all the altcoins in large quantities unless you are the whale.",

When it comes to investing one of the factors that should always be on the back of your mind is the risk that you are taking, and while bitcoin carries more risk than other assets, when it comes to this market bitcoin is probably the safest investment you can make.So from that perspective investing all the capital you have decided to invest in bitcoin is a good strategy, those investing in altcoins are doing so due to the increase in the profits they think they can get, but this also carries a higher degree of risk, and when in doubt it is better to take the lowest risk we have available at the moment, so your decision to stick to bitcoin despite the advice being given by your friends is the right thing to do.",

The majority of these shitcoins that promises to give huge profits always turn out to be a scam. But it is also important not to put your total investment in bitcoin. As much as it is good to have a bitcoin investment portfolio, you can still invest in other sectors. In my country, the real estate sector is doing well because of the increase in population. Some people buy cheap land in the interior and sell the in a few years when the price has appreciated due to development. All investments are indeed associated with risk, but you can identify other good investment opportunities in your area.",

Bitcoin is surely the best bet ahead of halving but there are couple of altcoins which you must add to your portfolio. For example - ETH! The way bitcoin is the pioneer of the crypto market, ETH is the pioneer of the smart contract facility. If you see past trend, ETH usually follows the price trajectory of bitcoin. So putting all your eggs into one basket, is not a good idea and advising people to do so is even worse. Diversification is the best decision you can take!",

On all the previous occasions, there were big spikes starting from a few months before the halving event, but I am more skeptical this time. The impact on halving will be more moderate this time, as the mining reward is already down to BTC899 per day now. After the next round of halving, the mining reward will be further lessened to BTC450 per day. This represents only a tiny fraction of the daily Bitcoin transaction volumes. So I am not sure whether a lot of movement will take place in the market solely because of this event. But then, history says something else:",
