It is very risky especially here in cryptocurrency.I believe Michael Saylor will be careful in his next decision about their next transaction on Bitcoin whether they will buy or sell. We all know Michale Saylor is a long-term believer in Bitcoin and one of the big players right now on Bitcoin. I am still looking forward what his next move.I am also curious if those big crypto players especially exchange founders can do those things to liquidate Michael Saylor, I don't think so, what benefit can they gain?",

It's not like 30k is the end of the world or something. There's much more room to the upside now since we are 60% down from the ATH.As for others trying to liquidate him to get his coins, many centralized exchanges are corrupt. You could see how the Chinese were faking volume in 2014 which lead to a strange event where they got raided by the government and suddenly their numbers fell by like 90% because they were being watched and had to stop faking it. There's no stopping guys like CZ if they want to fake a massive dump using their api, without really selling anything. The only people affected by this will be traders who use these platforms. Bitcoin doesn't care what a bunch of traders do. It was there before Mt Gox and it was there when Gox was gone. It was there before Binance and it's going to outlive it.",

In fact many people believe the $29,000-$30,000 area is the bottom area so many have started buying again. I think microstrategy has thought of additional strategies to avoid margin calls. I think they not only have more BTC in the Spot market but fiat to hold the sell market before reaching their liquidation price. In the end I think this is also a market strategy, to bring the market opinion that the price will remain above the margin call Microstrategy.",

Musk keeps doing it But seriously, I don't think he is worried at all. It's not like a TV or movie drama were you get liquidated at the end of the day. Big money moves differently then small money. For some reason people don't want to hear that. If my brokerage account falls below certain margin levels even I have a couple of days to add funds.Although I can't give an exact time someplace the size of microstrategy probably has weeks if not months. They don't want him liquidating and paying off the loan, if they do then they don't get interest on the money anymore....-Dave",

There is no such thing as a level above or below profitability.Mara mines with 2 cents power kWh with s19 and s19pros, Riot in another location at 3.5 with same new gear, some miners in Iceland with cheap rates but with older s15 s17, there are people who still mine with s9 at near-zero cheap energy.  This is not like other mining industries, for example, if half of the oil miners would shut down the rest won't be able to produce the same amount with the same costs. If miners right now have 200exa, the revenue of 30 million a day, and a cost of 8 million in electricity, assuming half of them won't be able to keep mining you're going to have 100 exa, the revenue of 30 million, and a cost of 4 million in energy, making it twice as profitable, making some miners come back. There is no such thing as below profitability, for that to happen it would mean every single miner would have to mine at a loss, impossible, some will quit before others hit that. Also, the revenue per TH/s day is still double the one in 2020, and with better efficiency, it will take a price of 15k to reach back that level.",

Back then there were reasons, Elon Musk's tweets, China's statements but now?Yes it briefly was below the level of profitability. It happened twice in the recent years, once in 2018 and once in 2020, although the 2020 crash was mainly due to low liquidity on exchanges. Too much inflow of coins compared to current market orders. The fair value was much higher but the exchange price dropped for a moment which did not affect miners at all, so such an event can happen again, but this would not liquidate Michael Saylor. For him to be in trouble the price would have to stay at that level, not go there because a whale holding 10k BTC suddenly decides to throw the towel. Anyway, mining profitability isn't a rule that says when we go below it miners will stop mining, because it hasn't happened yet. The production cost is only a guideline, but we've managed to follow it for many years. When the price goes too low miners will stop selling and rather get money from other sources like loans, which decreases the inflow to exchanges and stabilizes the price. You feel that it's possible we'll repeat 2018 in the lows, but we have not repeated 2017 or 2013 in the highs. What we've experienced was the weakest bull market in history.",

($1m each)and you decide you want a 4th home but dont want to waste years saving up $1m of cash to buy it.so instead. you put one home up as collateral for a mortgage to get $1m in cash instantly to buy the forth home. with terms that you have to slowly over time pay the bank back $1m in cash. or they take your first home.where the clause is. if the housing market shrinks by half. you will have to put up 2 homes up as collateral.. of course none of this means you lose any homes. they are just sat there still accessible by you to live in.and just pay the monthly repayments in fiat..  but if you dont pay up the fiat cash monthly loan repayments. eventually they might take the homes.so as long as you know you can afford your monthly repayments. there is no harm..micro strategy has the cash. but knows they dont need to throw the whole sum at once. where by they can instead just drip feed the cash later, whilst getting a lump sump of bitcoin upfront in a deal. they are not needing to touch their bitcoin reserves for years anyway. so they are just sitting there anyway doing nothing.. so why not use them as collateral.., so there is no problem with doing multisig with an escrow/trust/middleman while they settle the loan.. its not like he need to access his coin short term. its not like he cant afford the future monthly payments..so he gets to buy new bitcoin now while cheap. not lose the bitcoin he already has, and ontop of that not have to shell out millions in fiat instantly from his own pocket in one go.. win win win..imagine it this way. interest rate is 2%.. inflation is 2% (demo numbers)and you have two choices. work minimum wage, and save, to then buy bitcoin in one lump in 2 years time.. once you have what you hope is enough to buy a whole bitcoinor get a loan today buy a whole bitcoin today. and then pay repayments to the exact same amount you would have had to put aside as savings over the next two years.the answer is obvious.. buy now pay later..infact loans were meant to be designed for those that can afford the loan amount but choose 'buy now pay layer' as a economic tool advantage of keeping wealth and accumulating wealth rather than spending every last penny you have in one shot.. loans only go bad if you never have the fiat cash to repay the loan. thus risking the collateral.micro strategy is not putting his btc collateral at risk because he can make the loan repayments. so its not a problem for him",
