      "body": "The answer is no, volatility is not controlled by the number of adoptions that reach Bitcoin, that is to say, the number of people who own Bitcoin is not responsible for controlling Bitcoin in any way. Talking about government regulation of Bitcoin, how can government regulate something they don't control? The regulation that the government wants is on exchanges, platforms, and people who are associating themselves with Bitcoin; regulating the currency itself is something they really can't control.So the adoption of Bitcoin grows beyond this level, and the government succeeds in reaching out to the majority of the people by regulating a few crypto exchanges and passing bills that people (let's just assume they agree to) agree to. Those laws and regulations only bind the government and the individuals involved, not Bitcoin directly. Just as you have said, volatility is the nature of Bitcoin; it's part of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, so it can't change. We will always have a drastic change in price; that's one thing I know will never change with Bitcoin. No volatility means Bitcoin will be stable.",

When they are born or created they go through a period of high volatility and as they mature and their market cap grows, volatility is reduced. This happens a lot with companies, hence the division between small cap and large cap.Bitcoin is already heavily regulated around the world, what is missing is more adoption, which together with halvings will reduce volatility.",

The price will always go high when more people are buying. There will always be diverse economic factors that will make people buy or sell bitcoin so the value of the currency will never be stable. Regulating Bitcoin can be an effective means to reduce volatility because the government could make certain rules that can make the more stable. But regulating Bitcoin will be extremely difficult. Volatility will also reduce when Bitcoin is used solely as a currency and not as an investment, which is highly unlikely. Due to the uniqueness of Bitcoin, it will continue to be a store of values, and hedge against inflation and investment, so it might never be stable.",

If more people adopt Bitcoin (e.g., 200 million people) and the government succeeds in regulating Bitcoin to some extent, would it reduce its volatility?Satoshi Nakamoto's idea was to create a decentralized currency that cannot be controlled or regulated by any centralized entity. So to answer your question, Bitcoin cannot be regulated by any government or centralized authority. The government can only regulate centralized exchanges like Binance, Kucoin etc. that trade Bitcoin and other digital assets by setting up rules and regulations that guide and control the activities of these exchanges which may have little or no effect on the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin volatility is inherent in nature, it is what makes it unique and beautiful. The price fluctuation is influenced by supply and demand.",

According to them, there are oiver 44 milliion of unique Bitcoin addresses in use and that is very different from \"over 40 million  hwo owns Bitcoin\" because people can have more Bitcoin addresses in use, and many do have (myself included) so the real number of bitcoin owners is much smaller than that.

But Bitcoin’s still getting scarcer and it’s still got a halving every 4 years, so quick, big price changes won’t really stop. Adoption will also help just because the more distributed the supply is among holders and the more holders we have, the harder to manipulate the market becomes!",

      "body": "On a hypothetical level, it makes sense to me that with more adoption comes less volatility, because if more people are a part of the system, regional changes (like bans or friendly regulations in some countries) are likely to have a smaller effect, and minor panic selling is less likely to affect the whole as well. But it just doesn't seem to be the case over the last 5 years. Adoption is growing, but volatility is pretty much the way it used to be in 2018-2019, or at least I see no improvement. As for regulations, I don't think they have an impact on volatility at all, apart from temporary price changes when major regulations are rumoured to be coming. I believe it's more likely that we'll get used to the current level of volatility (which isn't that bad most of the time) than that we'll see Bitcoin as a way more stable currency in the future.",

I hope you will be accurate, it is difficult to determine the number of people who own Bitcoin, all you can get is accurate data for the number of people whose accounts have been verified in CEXs other than that, all we can know is the number of unique addresses which the article talked about and not the number of people.QuoteAs of February 2023, over 44.15 million unique addresses have a non-zero balance of Bitcoin.That’s roughly 10 million users more than a year earlier and about 16 million users more than in 2020 (a 57% increase).Also, adoption is not measured by individuals, but rather by services. As soon as there are more digital and local services that accept Bitcoin payments, individuals will do so.All of these statistics depend on prediction models, and most of them are not accurate.Quote from: Alphakilo on May 27, 2023, 07:39:38 AMIf more people adopt Bitcoin (e.g., 200 million people) and the government succeeds in regulating Bitcoin to some extent, would it reduce its volatility?Which government do you mean, without a global regulation just as happened at the Climate Summit[1] it is difficult to put in place a regulatory framework for Bitcoin.[1] https://www.un.org/en/climatechange",

The volatility of Bitcoin and crypto-market can't be controlled because Bitcoin isn't in the hands of the government and they can't increase or decrease it's volume. The volatility is the part of the crypto-market and controlling it isn't possible for anyone. The regulations and other restrictions pose by authorities on exchanges could be the cause of less adoption of the currency, but they won't be able to control the volatility with the restrictions. Even if the currency is adopted by many users that won't reduce the volatility and in face that can contribute to the volatility of the Bitcoin. With more people there will be more buy/sell orders executed and that would cause an increase in the volatility. The only possible way to control the volatility is to limit the buy/sell orders, but even that is not possible. If the authorities pose restrictions on the exchanges to limit buy/sell order per day, still they won't be able to control the volatility so much. The Bitcoin isn't dependent on those exchanges and can be traded without those exchanges, and if regulation authorities pose some regulations on the exchanges that won't impact the volatility of the coin.",

That said, regulation can only directly affect the inflow and outflow of Bitcoin, and for this, it doesn't have a direct link with trading, investment and liquidity. Still, some might not like the regulation and leave, but I can assure you that more would like the regulation and adopts it even more.However, these statistics can't be predetermined, yet, one thing that is sure is that Bitcoin would always attract more liquidity as time goes on, and that is good for it's economy. And if liquidity is what you are mistaken for volatility, be sure that volatility is merely the magnitude of the market reaction, and adoption might not have a direct link here but how liquidity is being pumped and dumped.",
