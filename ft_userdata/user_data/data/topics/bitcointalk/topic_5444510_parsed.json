The balance displayed at bottom of the window is also correct. You probably made a mistake in your calculations.",

It is best to get a receive address from the receive tab. You can also set a label there and save it so that when you receive money to that address the label shows up on the history tab.Change addresses are used internally by electrum to send change back to your wallet. You could still give out a change address and receive bitcoin but it's better to just go with the flow and use receive addresses instead.Meanwhile, if you are uncomfortable using the receiving address, you can disable it in the Preferences of Electrum; uncheck the Use change addresses option on the Transactions tab.",

I don't see a big difference between entering your master public key on a block explorer and creating a watch-only wallet with your master public key on electrum, unless you run your own server on electrum. If you don't run your own server on electrum, you have to connect to a server and your privacy is still compromised.",
