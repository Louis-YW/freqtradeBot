  "content": "New competitor Chinese MTT S80 PCIe 5.0 GPU Closes in on GTX 1650New driver optimizations have enabled Chinese vendor Moore Threads' MTT S80 gaming graphics card to rival Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650 at 4K gaming. There may be some untapped performance, so don't be surprised if the MTT S80 eventually becomes a contender for the best graphics cards.Armed with 4,096 MUSA (Moore Threads Unified System Architecture) cores with a 1.8 GHz boost clock, the MTT S80 is a PCIe 5.0 graphics card that pumps 14.4 TFLOPs of FP32 performance—the 7nm graphics card sports also sports 128 Tensor cores and 16GB of 14 Gbps GDDR6 memory. With access to a 256-bit memory interface, the MTT S80, which has a 255W TDP, delivers a memory bandwidth of up to 448 GB/s. The specifications look very decent on paper, minus the high TDP. However, the driver is what's hindering MTT S80's performance. The MTT S80 reportedly leverages the Chunxiao silicon, based on the PowerVR architecture developed by Imagination Technologies. The exact generation of the PowerVR GPU remains a mystery. Nonetheless, there's a lot of optimization work to get the graphics card to play nice with DirectX 11 titles.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-mtt-s80-pcie-50-gpu-closes-in-on-gtx-1650#",

But they have not yet mastered support for games on Direct X12February 2023https://www.tomshardware.com/news/moore-threads-mtt-s80-tested-bullslab-jay",

I have been selling video cards for the last year and miners are not ready to buy old models. And video cards for games can be sold on the market now.",
