  "content": "I want to ask what is the dangerous of creating a seed phrase that generate 3 words only + passphrase (strong password 18 characters)? Is it safe? Is it possible to lose the funds this way? If yes, how?The idea is, people just need to memorise 3 words + passphrase (of their choice) (strong password) rather than worrying that the (seed phrase 12 or 24 words) is stolen or lost. Any reason why this cannot be practical or recommended?I understand that seed phrase can easily be guessed by a hacker but then he needs to be able to crack the 18 characters (combination of lower, upper case, number, special characters such as * ? >< !@#}|_-&^%$)",

I see it the same as burglars coming in (so this makes crypto steel useless) : backup at somebody else. And this backup can be made in a way only you can understand it - sealed envelope with a \"letter\" in a specific format to a password protected USB stick... it's up to one's ingenuity.

Also, the 12-word seed IMO is easier to keep/hide in plain sight, and more robust and secure rather than a 3-word, 1-phrase combo that you're suggesting of.Some people keep their 12-word seed in a rather unconventional yet witty way. Let's use these words for example:Code:there wake tomorrow carry cold since lose open practice road shame witch Quote\"There used to be some sort of blabbering around town. Wake, my child, as he often say to his daughter. Tomorrow, we shall feast with the gods! Carry these cloth round town and try to sell them in the market. Cold feet is attributed to being afraid or nervous of the current situation. Since 1971, the gold standard was no longer in effect. Lose something important and you'll never feel the same again. Open-air stadiums are preferable during viral outbreaks. Practice makes perfect, or so they say. Road trips are fun with your friends and family! Shame that I didn't have the last piece of beef. Witch hunting was a popular activity back in the Victorian era.I for one tried to do this and left the text somewhere inside a book and used it as my bookmark for sometime. It works, it's secure, and no one will ever get interested on it due to its nonsensical phrases and purely unconnected sentences.",

First, the hacker needs:1- to figure out that the public key on blockchain belongs to YOU.2- then he needs to figure out whether the public key was created based on BIP39 or legacy way (private key only per each public key).3- then need to know that your way of creating passwords is like this.You REALLY think it is easier to remember 12 random words (in order) THAN creating a strong password of your choice???In terms of guaranteed sufficient entropy, you can your own and test it on http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.phpTest for example, !Went>P@r!S-Be$tMem0ryEv_r",

The range of words allows easy correction of the seeds, there is a built in checksum with the seed, it doesn't have to rely on the user's judgement to make a secure password. I bet if people are actually forced to create their own passphrase this way, I would see loads of people asking how to bruteforce their passphrase because they cannot figure out which symbols they inserted. What you've described is basically brainwallet which has been cracked thoroughly and isn't recommended for use. It could be more secure it being salted and it would take a much longer time to bruteforce.You can certainly keep a passphrase this way, I wouldn't recommend it but it's definitely quite safe if you choose a secure way to generate your private/public keypair.",
