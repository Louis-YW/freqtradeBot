It's just that I don't know the right approach or how to open it to my neighbors here. So I would like to ask for your advice or opinion so that I can start it right and properly. Then I will do it for free without asking for compensation.I hope you give me things to do and follow, thank you and I look forward to your suggestions.",

And it is not in my plan to teach them for now about in trading activity. Because it will be too hard for them to understand it. Only the basic features and usages are my priority Sir. In fact, before end of this day after checking the opinion of others here in this thread, I will keep you all update about this plan I gothere in my place once I start to educate them and show you the activity that I'm going to do here.",

Now, am just wondering how you can be able to present Bitcoin when it just slashed more than 50% of its value based on its last ATH...will you say that the dip is the best time to get involved with it because it will definitely be back to where it was months ago in terms of price? Or will you concentrate on it being an anti-inflation kind of thing where many are shaking their heads right now? Or maybe it can be packaged like the kind of technology and money of the future? Anyway, as what I said I do admire your desire and if you can do it then I am applauding you more.",

In addition, bad things can often result from such educations, because the actions of those who do not understand what it is about can have very negative consequences for them and their families.For me personally, the right approach is to give correct information to whoever asks me about something (in case I am very well acquainted with the subject), but in any case, I avoid encouraging some topics that concern anything that has to do with investments.",

In this sense, Bitcoin has never proven to be a method of payment that will attract the masses, if we also add that the matter is far more complicated than paying bills in some other way.Some would say that LN is the solution (and your position on this is well known), others say that sellers should accept transactions without confirmation if they are not RBF, others will say that Bitcoin as a means of payment is only suitable online - while the last ones will completely ignore that Bitcoin should be used as a currency.At the end of the story, everyone has the right to their opinion and to use Bitcoin the way they want, at least in this regard, individual freedom is unquestionable.",

      "body": "each to their own but when trying to say \"use bitcoin\" but then if they advertise and demonstrate for instance custodian storage of crypto in an exchange controlled cold wallet..  it's not actually displaying bitcoin its advertising something else.. a company/banksame with using sidechains and altnets bridged to it, is not actually demonstrating bitcoin..same with using share certificates of gold while trying to say \"it is the actual metal called gold\".. is just not really helping settle it in peoples minds. that paper is metal, no matter how many times you shout \"its back by it so it is it\"yes people can have faster transactions using custodian accounts of assets or tokens/certificates or sidenetworks. but then your not actually explaining the underlying asset anymore.that said if you want to describe the underlying asset you have to think about the features and benefits and yes flaws of the asset and actually describe it. otherwise your just advertising something else.take bitcoin. dont try doing the \"its fast cheap, instantaneous, better then visa\" (crud that LN'ers try to push as their \"bitcoin\" advert. as its misleading. )instead compare it to using a chequebook but faster then 5 days. no bank authority to close accounts. where you can create family trusts or offshore shell company store of wealth without needing lawyers, certification and bank managers. and use the value either unlocked to buy many things direct or locked up in your control/group control to DO many things amongst people you know and trustshow how from your home you can pay with a 'digital cheque' which settles in 10-20 minutes rather than 5 days and you pizza arrives within the hour. dont push it that the pizza should arrive in 5 minutes. dont embellish the speed of the pizza delivery time.. even with fiat, pizza wont arrive in secondsbe realistic.describe how bitcoin works from the cheque prospective where the source funds are listed (the utxo) being like the routing numbers along the bottom of a cheque. the \"to:\" being the destination. the amount you want to pay and it needing a signature. then you can lead into the clearing house describing how there is no central bank clearing house but random people pooling together to collate the transactions into a batch and secure the batch to previous batches in a complicated way so no one can edit them and such later without huge costs that surpass millions of peoples hard work ..its all about finding BITCOINS features and benefits and wording them in ways normal people can understand using actual comparison examples that close my match what it does. no big misleading embellishment that bitcoin is some tap and pay better then visa thing. but no worse then a 24 hour wire transfer or a cheque. jsut find the right comparisons rather then leading them away from using bitcoin to use another unit of measure on another network instead of bitcoin while still pretending your describing bitcoin, because that just causes more issues.there have been many that have been sold into the idea of \"fast, instant, cheap\" but when they first use bitcoin and see withdrawal fees and BITCOIN transaction fee's they feel lied to. but then they dont trust the next push into the the \"fast cheap\" network you actually described because you just lied about bitcoin. its like saying guy gold you can make jewellery out of it and electronic circuits.. then a month later they see it means they also need smelting equipment and moulds which you didnt describe because you described certificates.. then when or if they trust you to buy certificates thy realise the paper they now hold cant be electric circuits or jewellery. so again you double lied and confused them from both sides.. so just keep things real, dont confuse bitcoin from the side/altnet stuff. explain it all if you have to but just dont confuse the two pretending they are al one.you could (if you are better at PR then the LN'ers) actually turn things into a positive. about how bitcoin is so strong its actually used as a peg for other networks (rather hen pretending other networks are bitcoin) where it offers other networks to do more stuff. meaning that it opens options up . (rather then the LN'er mantra of LN is the solution the end point people ned to shift into).talk about how fiat might buy them 1 9inch pizza for $10 this year but will cost them $20 in the future (inflation)where as bitcoin for 0.0005 will buy them the pizza and in the future that same 0.0005 may buy them several pizza's(deflation)tell them about all the other things you can do with bitcoin that the plastic visa debit card cannot do.EG you dont have to reveal life history or the number and the 3 digit number on the back which means anyone getting that they can steal funds from you. with bitcoin you get to keep the secret that allows the spend to stay secret. meaning you get to hold funds without the online card 'skimming' risks of ID/fraud.and yes if you wanted. then meander into how you can allocate some funds to be locked and then represent other units on other niche services(de-fi) or sidechain/altnets to then do other things withjust avoid going to fantasy utopian dream world about it, over promoting, over promising. over committing",

And the causes of the upward and downward movement of the market. When to start and when to end the trade. There are lot of questions they will ask you.2. Your audience ( the people you what to teach are which category. Are they Children, youth or adult? So with this you will know where to start from). This is where the whole thing starts from. Know your students category is the priority in the teaching and learning process. That is, did they have knowledge on bitcoin before? Or have they not heard it before? This will also make the class very easy for you3. How many days are you going to teach them for them to understand it very well? If it is a classroom as a school then you just meet the heard teacher in the school and discuss with him or her to accept. But if it is in your compound.
