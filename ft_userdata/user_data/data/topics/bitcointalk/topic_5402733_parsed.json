How this will actually work in practice, idk yet.I'll be brief - another round of making money on people's paranoia Tell me - your private data, what is it? Full name, passport details, insurance number, residential address, bank details?All this data, no matter how you store it, you can still get it! Yes Yes ! Do you know why? Because it's data to USE! You can’t show your passport to a police officer, for example, and then hope that he will “unsee” your data. You cannot order delivery from an online store without specifying your residential address, you cannot hide your insurance number when you call the hospital and you MUST give your insurance number. You cannot hide your face if hundreds of cameras are filming you at intersections, in the subway, and in shops! Well, the most important question - does everyone really think that their data is the most valuable thing for all the criminals in the world? Well honestly!? PS No, my answer does not mean that your documents should be lying near your door outside the apartment / house",

From 1990 to 2004. That web phase is also known  as \"read only web\"Web 2.0Since 2004 until today (yeah, we are on web 2)Read-write web.It growed with social media platforms where everyone can share content and read and write on the web. Main name is Facebook.There is a great problem with centralization and ownership of personal dataWeb 3Is related to decentralized app, and ia still in development.  Ethereum and bitcoin are the main names.Read-write-ownMore details here:https://ethereum.org/en/web3/",

You shouldn't and never trust anyone to secure your any personal information since there's no guarantee they will secure your data, they can easily backdoor you to use your data for online loan etc. Until debt collectors knock your door and ask you to pay some exact amount, you'll regret it.Moreover currently Web 3.0 is still on developing and it's seems like a nothing difference like scam dapps that already exist since 2017.",

For now lets see if this web3 would truly succeed because if this could really bring good result for sure the 4 and 5 will come up and by that time its more realistic to discuss about such things in future.",

But the problem here is how data is being stored and left vulnerable to criminals, companies, governments forever. The individual has almost no measures of protecting itself against this anymore. I dont get how Jack Dorsey wants to change that.You see, the fact is that in all this there is a huge, insoluble, internal contradiction. Now I will explain. For example, your passport. In fact, this is not your passport  This is some kind of not very secure document that the state issues to you based on previous information (your citizenship, your parents, whose surname you inherit, date of birth, etc.). You can’t make a passport for yourself and call yourself Ivan Mgooogone Kurasawa Zibelmanshucher - right? Therefore, the state centrally determines this data and confirms that you are the owner of this document. And a passport was issued to you, not for you to bury it far in the forest, deep in a hole. And in order to provide, when finding a job, obtaining a loan, buying real estate, etc. Those. these data have been deanonymized by the judge herself. I understand that there may be a potential problem, such as data leaks, from some social network where your name and your photos are, possibly very private or spicy content, and you do not want to show them to everyone, but only to a small group of your friends. But technology will not solve this problem for you. If you transfer information somewhere, outside your laptop, the site you entrusted becomes the actual owner. Any encryption will not help. In order for this information to be seen by those to whom you want to show it, you must provide them with a key to decrypt the data. Whether it's manual or automatic, it doesn't matter. Everything, the whole system collapsed. The person to whom you gave the key can lose it, transfer it to a third party, ...Or here is your medical record, data, where is the history of what, when they were ill, how and by whom they were treated, etc. But it is also not secret, it is available by default - to an insurance company, a hospital, an ambulance, (God forbid, of course, this is just a list of possible situations) ...And your financial details, if you are not a drug dealer, are known to the tax, insurance, bank where you have an account, and even to a dealer selling you a car in installments! To summarize: all these systems of anonymity are nothing more than a game on paranoia or on gullible people.",

That seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about (regarding the internet) these days, and it really is a pressing question. But I kinda doubt that this can be done by decentralisation, I would rather think that more government regulations would better work for this issue. But then again, we don't really know how it will work or what in fact it really is.",

People trying to come up with the next latest and greatest trend by starting with a \"catchy\" name then coming up with the concept later on. Nothing they're saying is groundbreaking or new, in fact privacy has come into heavy focus in more recent years with countries like the EU coming up with GDPR to protect personal information - in a way what they are saying is wrong. Third parties can be forced to delete private information if they hold it on EU citizens and America is coming up with similar strong consumer protections. Encryption is increasing and improving year after year, as long as it is applied properly it works well, people just need to be wary about the companies they use - but even then unknown day zero day exploits can pop up to create vulnerabilities.",
