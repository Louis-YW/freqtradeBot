  "content": "Influence is the power to effect and control, manipulate something and we have two great players in the person of Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi who have dominated football for almost two decades now, the two players are influential in their own way but who has the most influence, in my opinion I will say it's Ronaldo because he has a larger fan base that follows and love home genuinely, abdy secondly the CR7 brand which he has created for himself, Ronaldo went to Saudi Arabia a core Muslim state and we know the Muslims as people very strick when it comes to their laws but some laws was amended in favour of Cristiano Ronaldo that's influence, and any club he goes to the number 7 jersey of that club is automatically his, that's influence too, like I said Messi is influential in his own way too.",

      "body": "Both of them were able to get to this point, apart from their skills, also because of their extraordinary love for their profession as footballers and of course extraordinary hard work. In short, they both really perpetuate their lives for the game of football. People who really understand football will respect both of them without comparison.There were many great footballers before them (Messi & C. Ronaldo), but the consistency of the two at the highest level will be difficult for any player to match.",

Let’s just appreciate that we got to witness their genius.True both players are great and you can't separate them, actually you can't mention Messi in any conversation without mentioning Cristiano Ronaldo, and you can't also mention Cristiano Ronaldo without mentioning Leo Messi.More as we all know Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed person on Instagram and as such on Instagram he will be be more influential than Messi, Ronaldo have fans that follows him to every club he goes to,Football wise and on the pitch they can't separate them , but off the pitch Cristiano Ronaldo is a little above Messi, that's why the media keeps trolling him to sell their papers.",
