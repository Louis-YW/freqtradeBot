  "content": "Bitcoin has gained so much popularity and recognition in the past few years that it rose from nominal prices to almost $69000 in 2020. It however gained hundreds of billions of dollars in capitalization over the years. The situation has changed with both appraisals/approvals and backlashes on the cryptos by some countries, especially government officials.Inflation is another problem, and they have successfully caused Bitcoin to remain at lower levels compared to its all-time peak of almost $69000. Its market capitalization today is a little above $454 billion, which is still a good value. However, in events that more backlashes and higher inflation negatively affect the crypto some more and finds itself at about $1000. What would be your reaction? Will you turn your back on Bitcoin or has your investment just begun on it?As for me, my investment has just begun. I have learnt from my past mistake.",

For some Price levels of $1k would cause fear about whether it is a good store of value as it's normally said to be, but for me, I would buy more.It is still a very secure network and cannot be controlled by the sneaky banks and governments. There is also less risk as the price would have hit bottom and cannot go much lower.",

Buying Bitcoin at that time will be a case-to-case basis depending on the reason why it goes to that level because there is chance that Bitcoin is already a risky investment by that time and buying it is already a suicide.

I remember when Bitcoin was around 9-10k and I had to sell some for ongoing expenses so I asked few friends who wanted to buy from me when BTC was ~17k, and none of them were interested, sating that price is too high. Then they contacted me again when BTC went to 35k as in their eye BTC suddenly became cheap. As for me, it would depend how we came to that price. If there's nothing wrong with Bitcoin itself I would keep doing DCA as that's my preferred investment tactic.",

If in the next 2 years we'd be gradually going down, reaching something like 10k next year and 1k in 2 years, I'd be really worried about the future of btc because if you think about it, 10k is largely below mining profitability. If we took a year at 10k and then went to 1k, nobody would mine this. All those billion dollar investment companies would have to be out, all the celebrities, bitcoin casinos, whole industry would have to be selling end exiting for us to go to 1k. At this point I'd say a flash crash due to no liquidity would be possible, but not a gradual decline to 1k. That would point to the end of all cryptocurrencies.",

Many would not go near it and the media would have so much fun churning out article after publication about how Bitcoin is finally dead, which has been predicted for many years now.Here in this forum, the majority of active members (non spammers and serial bounty hunters) would still be carefully following it to decide what action to take. And if it turns out to not be a problem with Bitcoin as you pointed out, many would fomo in.This questions are mostly so fantastic and discussing them seems unnecessary. This situation would very likely never happen, and we should stop dreaming about future low prices, but focus on the utility of Bitcoin which exists in any price range.",

As you have said, it rose to $69k, then go down hard around -70% of that all time high. No one can stop it, sooner or alter the market will go on a boom and bust despite inflation or even the war.",

This theme is reminiscent of it. $1 or $1.000 - what price, it doesn't matter. This refers to the extreme fall in bitcoin price. If we talk about $1 or $1.000, then I can allow a fall to a level of about $10.000, not lower in current realities. Of course, I am not a predictor and such conclusions are connected only with my personal assumption and feeling of the situation. If you fantasize about extremely low values of bitcoin ​​like $1 or $1.000, then in such a situation, decadent and panic moods will arise in the entire community, from the influence of which it will be difficult to move away. I would probably try to figure out the reasons that led bitcoin to such a strong price drop and after that I would make decisions for action. It is easy to think theoretically, but practically, in such situations it is difficult to resist the influence of human emotions. Therefore, it is impossible to predict even one's actions in such sensitive moments, such as the fall of bitcoin to $1.000.",

Will you turn your back on Bitcoin or has your investment just begun on it?You should pay attention to the reasons why the price is down by more than 98% of ATH before you make a decision whether to start investing or switch to another investment. Just like now, you must have a reason why you are investing and we can't just speculate.If $1000 is reached because 99% of countries have banned mining, trading and adoption bans, then I would definitely take it one step further not to invest. But if that $1000 is influenced by Chinese FUD or some other country, then surely I will look for more capital to invest.",
