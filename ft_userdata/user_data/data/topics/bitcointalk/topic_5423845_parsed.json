I believe the road map has come to an end. and since we are still in the early stages, bitcoin is still relatively cheap. Bitcoin's price has not yet reached 1% of Satoshi's predicted price assuming he hasn't touched his 1.2 million BTC from when it first hit $1 to when it nearly reached $70k last year.

Yes, people had tried something similar to Bitcoin before, but Satoshi gave it a full form, and it is now known as Bitcoin. It is not necessary that there should be an end, but it would improve over time. We don't know what will happen in a hundred years. But I am optimistic that it will be upgraded or that Bitcoin will be replaced by something else.",

These changes or improvements are aimed at making the network function better (it's surely not perfect), but I can't imagine a newer system replacing it at this time.It checks all the boxes for what one needs from a consensus driven network.",

So, bitcoin having its base 40 years back is not a big thing. Already it is know that there are other cryptocurrencies that have got into existence before bitcoin, but they weren't able to stand good in the market. Even bitcoin took years to prove its ability. Innovation that have gained the acceptance of people won't have its end, until something happens bad to the community through it.",

I think our work here is just as a missionary who have kept everything outside rather than only bitcoin progression.As per the price, it's always like this because in the future 2022 would be a year to be remembered of if we could be flashing back to 2009 and to 2014 and 2018 what more of 2022, so it's advisable you don't skip this year as you may not have it on a platter of gold anymore.

Well it is useful indeed; low transaction fees, faster with anonymity and such but the problem is its market price volatility. I doubt that in countries wherein it is widely accepted, people will use Bitcoin perhaps, to pay their clothes or food. They'd more prefer using fiat still on daily transactions. Let us accept it. At the present most of the people view this industry as a way of earning profit or in form of investment.But going back with the topic, it's been years indeed. Its market value have gone too far and thid technology is now being recognized on countries around the globe. But I doubt this is the peak already. Bright future ahead once the market price slowly stabilize as more people or businesses acknowledge this industry.",

People are still not fully using Bitcoin for payment for goods and services due to regulatory issues that are not fully operational in some countries.The bitcoin journey that started 40 years ago gives us proof that the Bitcoin technology being developed is not just an ordinary digital currency, but has many benefits for now and in the future.",

It doesn't matter what the business is, even the easiest tshirt business could still develop, how? You could end up with some new machine that produces a great amount of shirt, for very little resource, or with a cheaper resource and you would be able to sell brand new basic shirts for $4.99 suddenly, which is unheard of, or even lets say 99 cents to make it a lot more unrealistic.I personally believe that is not a priority as of right now, people focus on more tech related stuff, but that could very well be done if R/D was hardcore there.

That's how innovation works, Satoshi had an idea that will replace liberty reserve, a big competitor to bitcoin, but he didn't relent. Unlike liberty reserve bitcoin cannot shutdown, but a bitcoin exchange can, I'd say that liberty reserve functioned like the cryptocurrency exchange. Because I wasn't there to witness how it worked.
