  "content": "These Polymerbit notes were a private order made by forum member Agrawas as a surprise gift to all individuals who appeared at a dinner on one of the nights during Bitcoin 2022 Conference in Miami, FL. A little back story: Polymerbit (Daniel) was in FL visiting and decided to attend the Bitcoin 2022 Conference in Miami where Agrawas was also attending. Unbeknownst to the rest of the forum members attending, Agrawas requested some private notes. Now, Daniel was not in Switzerland where all his equipment and materials were but he took on the challenge and drove all over FL getting the materials and equipment - a suitable color printer could not be found. There were a few phone calls back and forth between Daniel and myself while I directed him to various shops/stores that might have printers - none were decent enough lol. However, Daniel did keep looking and a black and white printer was located several hours away and Daniel made the journey and secured the printer - he worked long and hard in the few days before the conference to get these notes designed.  At dinner, Agrawas surprised everyone with their own notes.  A great thanks to both Agrawas for providing the attendees with such a gift and for Daniel for making it happen!Everyone who attended the dinner received one. There were some left over notes and Agrawas has asked that I auction ten of these notes here on the forums. They do have a lot of similarities with the regular Miami Conference notes - but there are differences as well. To list a few:1. they are black and white, not in color2. on the front, bottom center \"Printed in Florida\"3. on the back, the phrase \"Physical Collectors Meetup 2022\" 4. on the back, the image of two beer mugs being clinked together in a warm toast can be found5. on the back, the phrase \"member gift\"6. on the back, the phrase \"A Special Note Made for Physical Collectors\"Please note due to the express request of Agrawas, the funds from this auction will be set aside and used for the next \"happy hour\" at the next conference. Depending on BTC value, it might just be enough to buy everyone a drink  or even enough to pay for all of the \"happy hours\". Who knows where Bitcoin price will be....These will be done using the LIFO system, where you will need to bid on the number of notes and the the amount per note you are bidding -  ie: 1 @ xx BTC, 2 @ xx BTC, up to 10 notes. Keep bids to no more than 4 decimals.starting bid: 0.0001 BTC per noteAuction will end on 11/13/2022 at 3pm Eastern TimeSniping: Any bid made in last 5 minutes will extend the auction 5 minutes beyond the ending time.If within those 5 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 5 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid.Winners may select their serial numbers in the order of winners - IE the highest bidder selects serial numbers first. Serial numbers: 022, 023, 024, 025, 026, 027, 028, 029, 030 & 031pymt address will be posted at the end of the auction and pymts are required within 24 hours of auction ending!",
