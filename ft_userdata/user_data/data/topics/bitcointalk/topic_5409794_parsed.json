Killing another zero will be a very easy thing as long as there was a hype to make it happen. The hype that created by elon in the past has been making shiba killing so many zeros. we can learn from there easily during the bullish market and anything is possible to happen. You must also take valuation from how many USD worth of tokens already burned. Billions tokens meant nothing if it's only worth a few thousands dollars.",

Killing one more zero means pump to $800T marketcap (2 times bigger than bitcoin). and its only a meme coin. Joke that was funny in 2021. Its not funny anymore.Quote from: YellowSwap on August 14, 2022, 05:06:28 AMWhat do you think about Shiba inu billions of tokens getting burned from time to time?

Most likely there are more new coins coming in than being burned.",

Have an estimation how much market cap is needed for it to remove those two zeros. It will be a huge market cap if you're going to calculate but look and have your own calculation to see how much it's needing.It may have been burning billions of supplies from time to time but nothing will change from shiba. It's a meme coin and it will continue to have an unlimited supply overtime.So that's a useless thing even if it is burning and there's no cap for its supply. We may have been seeing it at the top but I guess someday that it won't be there anymore and will just part of a great pumping history.",

They continue to burn same thing with Minting, if they can lower the minting as well then most probably this can be a good addition to the hype and the pump is inevitable. Though killing two zero means a lot in the economy of SHIB, this can be a huge target.Despite of being a meme token, we know that there‚Äôs still a hype with SHIB and with the recent pump on its value, you can just say that meme token is not over. Waiting for the same news with DOGE since it looks like they are not that active compare to SHIB.",

Sorry in my mind it's usual nothing any special, on shiba whether it's burn or not because the supply is also no limit. It maybe affect price on the shiba but only slightly, up or down because the burning will definitely have any effect on any token price. Killing two zero in the next bull market, maybe one zero because to kill two zero in my opinion is too heavy for a token meme.",

I heard that this thing already implemented by shiba inu but the burning seems giving a small contribution to the price. The burning mechanism can happen once its blockchain will be fully launched but this time it was still peg with ethereum blockchain.

How do you think this will affect the price in the few years to come? Do you think believe that Shiba could kill two zeros in the next bull market? . Well in general i always like projects that are burning tokens from time to time because this means that the supply becomes lower and therefore the token becomes inflationary which is usually always good for the price of the tokens. In regards to the burn of SHIB: Burning Billions of tokens sounds like a huge number at the first glance maybe but if you look at their maximum supply then you will see that a billion token is way less than 1%, even less than 1¬† per thousand, so the effects of burning a billion SHIB tokens are close to none in my opinion. In addition to that, SHIB is just a useless meme-coin and without a use case burning tokens also won't do anything.",

How do you think this will affect the price in the few years to come? Do you think believe that Shiba could kill two zeros in the next bull market? . The Shiba inu project has been talked about suspiciously often lately  Two zeros? Hardly, the project has already grown enough, one burning is not enough to make it grow 100 times. Burning by itself does not yet indicate that the coin becomes deflationary. If combustion exceeds issuance, it might have some effect on price growth, but if like Axie Infinity, when issuance greatly exceeds combustion, it won't save the token from becoming even cheaper due to increasing supply in the market.",
