You have no team to release your own wallet?Answered here -https://member.cash/p/2b039c370dGot it. Thank you.By the way. Take a look at the Qortal project.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5258519.0First, I'm not the part of their team. I just find Qortal project very interesting.Why I recommend it to you ? Because they released web site hosting on their Qortal blockchain. Just imagine, you can start your social network Member.cash inside the blockchain. Truly decentralized.There is no centralized web hoster, as it is now. Each participant in the Qortal network (Minter) is a component of hosting. This will be a very interesting experiment.And nothing is required of you, no fee. Everything is free.https://wiki.qortal.org/doku.php?id=how_to_host_your_public_dataI'll duplicate the answer to https://member.cash/",
