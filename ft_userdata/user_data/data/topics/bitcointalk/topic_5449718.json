  "content": "Introduction:Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, brought a revolutionary concept to the world of finance - anonymous, secure, and irreversible transactions through a blockchain confirmation mechanism. However, many potential aspects of this contraption remain unseen by the public, and its initial idea of unknown transactions got deviated by enterprises and governments. The brilliant minds of the industry, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood, were inspired by Satoshi's original idea and developed the Ethereum blockchain, which allowed for the emergence of smart contracts. These self-executing agreements opened up new possibilities for automated transactions, making blockchain technology even more valuable. This article aims to discuss the unused potentials in Bitcoin's white paper, as well as the potentials that the advances in blockchain technology have presented to the society. It is the beginning of a series of articles that will be published by EdEE Ecosystem, leading to the introduction of blockchain-based solutions that will unlock Blockchain features beyond Satoshi Nakamoto's vision. We invite you to engage in this discussion and share your thoughts and opinions in the comments section, as EdEE Ecosystem prepares to launch its public presentation at the end of these series of articles.The Future of Anonymity in Cryptocurrency: The Inevitable End or a New Beginning?While anonymity of users was not explicitly mentioned as an advantage in the Bitcoin White Paper, yet it quickly became one of the currency's attractive features for early adopters. The anonymity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has raised concerns among government regulators, who fear its potential use in tax invasion. However, the inherent nature of blockchain technology makes it impossible to separate anonymity from crypto transactions, leading governments to put controlling mechanisms on cryptocurrency gates, exchanges. Strict KYC policies have been enforced on centralized exchanges, ultimately removing the anonymity from crypto transactions. Both centralized and decentralized exchanges have had to cooperate with regulators to avoid legal consequences. However, the emergence of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) presents a new opportunity for a no KYC gate to open toward the crypto world without considering legal consequences.Can a for-profit DAO act as that gate?Would Satoshi Nakamuto open up such gate and guarantee the anonymity in Cryptocurrency transactions?The Hidden Risk of Blockchain Payments: Protecting Buyers in the Age of Cryptocurrency Shifting gears, Satoshi Nakamoto's concept brought a secure transaction system for payments, but it only works for one-way transactions, where one party intends to send value to another. In the real world, transactions are often reciprocal, and one party pays with the expectation of receiving something of equal worth. Currently, there is no blockchain-based mechanism to guarantee that the buyer will receive purchased goods or services as agreed. To fully utilize blockchain and cryptocurrency as a secure payment system, it's crucial to implement escrow mechanisms that protect both buyers and sellers from fraud. While some may argue that it is not blockchain's responsibility to protect buyers, there is potential for innovative solutions that can ensure trust and security for all parties involved in every day transaction.Blockchain beyond Crypto CurrencyUnfortunately, for a considerable majority of individuals, blockchain technology has been viewed as an Eldorado full of ×1000 opportunities, leading to a never-ending search for the next token with the most hype potential. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that such profits are often nothing but collecting other people's funds, as participating in a head-down pyramid Ponzi scheme. It is imperative to use conscience and simple math when assessing the value and potential of these opportunities. A wiser investment would be the evolved form of crypto currencies, such as utility coins/tokens, that offer more than just transferring value; they can be used to unlock useful features provided by blockchain services.The opportunities that blockchain technology offers are way beyond crypto currency in its raw sense of currency, with the capability of bypassing centralized power towards a horizontal democracy. This is not achievable in the short term nor without the public's involvement. But, if such a move starts, are we ready to join in?",

You could have edited the first thread to add any new information you may have found on the topic. Why do you want to make it a sequel?We decided to create a sequel for our first article for a few reasons. Firstly, the topic is broad and would have made the original thread quite lengthy. Secondly, each thread tackles different issues under the main subject. Lastly, we believe publishing in this manner encourages more engagement and makes it easier for readers to participate in the discussions that interest them the most.Quote from: SamReomo on April 21, 2023, 06:07:30 PMThe simple answer to your question is no. It's really risky to trust those Dao projects  as most of them have emptied the balance of thousands of investors. I know that the centralized exchanges ask for KYC and without that they won't be able to survive but there are many decentralized exchanges that do not require any KYC, and have been operating without any issues.The Dao projects attracted the attention of investors in previous bull run, and most of them run away with the money. I feel bad about those unlucky investors as most of them lost millions of dollars in such scam projects. Anyone who falls into trap of DAO's will be responsible for his/her losses.I believe what you are referring to as \"DAO scams\" mostly reffer to rug pulls in 2021, that pulled just less than $3B that year (https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/17/defi-rug-pull-scams-pulled-in-28b-this-year-chainalysis/). Those projects are founded on, as we call it, the lame idea of \"Liquidity Pools\", which are the foundation of almost all existing DeFi projects as well. Liquidity pools are essentially smart contracts that operate like a seesaw, causing token prices to rise when funds are swapped for tokens and fall when tokens are swapped for funds. Unfortunately, these pools often do not function well in normal market conditions, which can lead to issues such as rug pulls, or another problem that they called it \"Impermanent Loss\". (https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-impermanent-loss-and-how-to-avoid-it)We have dedicated an entire section of our white paper to this topic and will soon be publishing an article that goes into more detail. In short, we believe that liquidity pools are not simulating a healthy market condition, and this is one of the reasons for the problems we are witnessing. To illustrate this, let's use the example of a supermarket. In a normal market, the price of a product does not increase or decrease based on how many units are purchased or added to inventory. However, in a liquiditypool-based swap, the price increases with each purchase or suddenly plummets if a large amount of inventory is added. And this is exactly what happens in most of the \"rug pulls\".We are sorry for those who have lost money in these schemes and, for that and many other technical reasons, have developed a new mechanism to replace the current liquidity pools. Our mechanism removes the possibility of such losses while still allowing for a decentralized, no KYC swapping platform, and that is still the subject of our initial project. Quote from: SamReomo on April 21, 2023, 06:07:30 PMNo one else can be Satoshi Nakamoto, he was the true freedom lover and he created something really useful that's still known and working in the form of Bitcoin. Those DAO's and their makers aren't Satoshi, and trusting those organizations is not going to be a good decision for anyone.The fact that Satoshi Nakamuto has done an amazing job does not indicate that there is nothing left to do in this field. In fact, we are still in beginning of this path. We believe that anyone with the right talent, consistency, and courage can make a difference. Finally, we define DAO as a true Decentralized Autonomous Organization, not the Defi projects that have been experienced before.Quote from: Hatchy on April 21, 2023, 06:14:02 PMThe major reasons for the introduction of the kyc was actually for the government to control  money laundering and other illegal crypto activities.  But the decentralized systems of cryptocurrency has made it a little bit impossible for the government to accomplish this goal.  And I don't think that they will be able to create any technology soon that can control Bitcoin or cryptocurrencyMan, the controlling mechanism is already implemented and that is the KYC. When officials know that you have exchanged 1 Bitcoin to 30,000 USDT and then Bought 100BNB with it, the anonymity is already gone.Quote from: Hatchy on April 21, 2023, 06:14:02 PMSatoshi Nakomoto has hid himself for a reason of which no one has been able to tell. And I don't think that he would just pop out of no where now just to guarantee the anonymity of cryptocurrency transaction.No, he won't. But users will have an option to bypass KYC gates into crypto currency world and guarantee their anonymity in a few months. Quote from: Hatchy on April 21, 2023, 06:14:02 PMAnd from your previous post you said you didn't know about the cypherpunk who had the vision but Satoshi Nakomoto brought it to life. If you so claim to be an elite in Bitcoins theory how come you never heard of the cypherpunk?As humans, we are capable of arriving at conclusions without possessing complete knowledge of the facts and the history of similar ideas and actions on a given subject. Additionally, we do not profess to be experts in the field of Bitcoin theory. Rather, we are a team of inquisitive and purpose-driven individuals seeking to expand our understanding of the topic. Quote from: Hatchy on April 21, 2023, 06:14:02 PM And I dont get the idea of your article what are you trying to tell use? Just summarize it all in one thread so we would understand.instead of creating new thread and getting everyone confused.Our goal is to create Decentralized Applications (DApps) that simplify entry and exit from the cryptocurrency world without the need for KYC or imposing high commissions on users. The first two DApps will enable users to convert their assets into cryptocurrency and vice versa while addressing the issue of Liquidity Pools. Furthermore, they will serve as a new launchpad for crypto startups looking to launch tokens without creating a liquidity pool. Our upcoming projects will focus on addressing other user needs besides financial ones. Our posts function as market validation surveys, allowing us to receive feedback from the cryptocurrency community and engage in direct conversations about the reasoning behind our solutions before entering the marketing phase.",

You are absolutely correct about the function of Bitcoin transactions in keeping senders and receivers completely anonymous. Wallet addresses can still be traced.The Bitcoin white paper suggests that by not revealing private keys and creating a new key pair for each transaction, we can still keep the anonymity of the users. This means that no one can relate a transaction to anyone in this case.There are now wallets that offer such functions, such as the blockchain.com wallet.

It's high time the crypto community joins forces with regulators and policymakers to cook up responsible, lasting solutions that appease every stakeholder.Thank you for taking the time to read our article and for sharing your thoughts on the subject. What you have outlined is a subject that we believe should be openly discussed and debated.First of all, we have to clarify that we do not encourage tax evasion. Yet, we believe that it should ultimately be the user's decision to cooperate with their government based on the clarity of the government's use of tax and national resources.To ensure the cleanliness of our ecosystem and the adherence to regional rules, we have an innovative solution that involves enlisting the help of bounty hunter users. More information on this can be found in our white paper and FAQ, which will be published on our website.In terms of the risks and challenges within working with blockchain based service, we believe that the most crucial aspect is clarity. Although there are many complex and unknown features of blockchain technology, the workings of a DAO are straightforward and can be easily demonstrated.DAOs are essentially using smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks that cannot be edited once they are implemented. This means if they are initially safe, they will remain safe for good. Any DAO can make their contract code open-source or use third-party assessments to demonstrate that there is no room for abuse or fraud. An assessed and trusted DAO can handle billions of dollars of daily transactions, making it an attractive target for hackers who may attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in the code.This concern is especially valid in our case, where a mobile application on clients' phones directly connects to the smart contract and uses it as the back-end. A simple hack involves deploying the contract code on the same network and creating a convincing phishing tool by releasing a fake update with a similar UI to our DApp. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the smart contract's code is secure, and there are no potential exploits that could be used to undermine the system.At this stage, we believe that users can test our DApps with smaller transactions and over time, the system will prove its credibility. The dilemma is whether we should rely on complete transparency or user experience and feedback to approve the system.What do you think should be prioritized: the security of our clients or gaining their trust?As a user, how do you suggest we handle this situation?",

This is the privacy issue we have stepped in to solve.Exchange itself isn't direct part of cryptocurrency network/protocol. To solve privacy problem of exchange, we need more privacy-respecting regulation.I believe we are talking about different animals here.We offer a Decentralised Applications that facilitates anonymous peer to peer interactions in an anonymous and safe ecosystem. And bypassing current exchange options (as crypto currency world gates) is only a part of the solution.Imagine that you want to order a table with clearly known specifications, and you and the seller is do not know each other. Yet you will be able to put your order, receive the good as agreed and pay the price with crypto. there is also a Decentralised dispute mechanism in place to make sure that the table will be in the same quality and speciation as ordered. Is it currently possible that you would do such interaction with crypto currency?! If you can get the example then we are on the same page...Besides, there is nothing we can do about the privacy of transactions, which we believe is already good enough to mask sender/receiver's identity. Yet making any changes in any crypto currency's function would be on each Coin/Token's core development teams.",
