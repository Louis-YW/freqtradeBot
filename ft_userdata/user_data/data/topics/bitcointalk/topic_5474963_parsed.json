      "body": "Most people will think like that, assuming that their cell phone is eavesdropping on conversations or as if they are spying on them, and that kind of assumption is something that is normal, but I think that is too much, and it is true - sometimes it is by chance when we want an item or product. Often times advertisements for products and goods suddenly appear. And I think this can happen because sometimes when we want something, we often see reviews and explanations of the product via social media or search via web searches. And maybe that's what causes advertisements for the products we want to often appear on our cellphones.And the exact reason why we get or see advertisements appear is that the advertisements seem to correlate with what we are talking about and what we want. This can happen because most technology and marketing companies work together to collect a number of people's personal and behavioral data.",

If I am not mistaken there were some phones that were released that had the option to physically disconnect the camera or the microphone by flipping a small switch, but I do not think much success was had as the phone was too expensive and people were not willing to pay extra for this feature.",

I'm pretty sure that we've know for a long time that free services such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube ande ven Google etc. make bank on selling our data to advertisers. The more successful these corporations are at targeting you with ads right on your interests, the more likely it is they'll be picked by those being advertised. So keep this in mind next time you sign up to another website. Thankfully, GDPR kind of helps in this regard. Allowing people to delete their accounts and recall all their data along with any permissions they might have given in the past helps restore some balance in terms of privacy. But most people will be tempted to actually ask for their account deletion on big platforms, as it would also require an account deletion and these platforms are kind of monopolizing access to their info sadly.",

As much as privacy is concern, but the moment we decide to use these smart phones, note that it has its connection to an app store. It has its monitoring device that keep us tracked, so the more we tend to use it, the higher chances that our actions and responses are being in controlled or monitored by them. Even if we disable these location services or remove these unnecessary apps, that will not guarantee that we are still not monitored by them.For me, the best option is to turn off your phone when you are conversing or making an important transaction. That is the best way not to indulge your own privacy.",

It's nothing new, that's why in shopping apps, I disable the camera and microphone access, because it's weird for an app to request for those even when they do not need the functionalities given by those parts of your phone.",

After that, you can disable one after another to see if things stay the same or if you're just being paranoid. Who knows, maybe you can find which apps are eavesdropping or if your phone is just recording everything even though you turned off the mic. I honestly doubt the latter though, since if that's the case the company can smell a lawsuit incoming.As far as I can tell, search results or your activity is likely the culprit for targeted ads like this.

I've even shared it with others to also know their reactions and hear their opinions. I'm not sure if I'm also being paranoid but many of those to whom I shared my experience brushed it off as simply coincidence, paranoia on my part, too much thinking about being spied on, algorithm thing, and so on. But I'm not completely convinced. I think our gadgets are listening to us to a certain extent. If the cameras are spying on us, why can't the mic? And this isn't just plain imagination.

Let's start from the basics, Android or iOS have a feature to check when was the last time your microphone or camera was used and what is the application requesting it. Go look for it, if those things are always readily activated, then it is a bad sign. You should never automatically accept those two things to run in the background. Furthermore, if you don't excessively use Siri or other personal assistants, you should deactivate its features.After that, if you still do not believe that feature to tell you the truth, well you should throw away the phone all along.
