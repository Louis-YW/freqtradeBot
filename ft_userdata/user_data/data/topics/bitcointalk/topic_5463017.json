I really don't know that if Hal was Satoshi or not, but I can say proudly that the guy was a genius and people like him born once in centuries. Very few people can be so enlightened like Hal Finney, and their leaving of this planet so early can be a nightmare for many of us. Hal was just 58 years old when he left this world and we have lost a gem like him so early. RIP Hal Finney, you are always alive in our hearts.",

You've been here long enough you must have heard of the name Hal Finney and that he's been dead for a while now. Who doesn't know the one who received the first ever Bitcoin transaction? He's no member of any local board here. But the information about the man, his contributions to Bitcoin, his life, and death, are not to be doubted. He's more or less an open book. Anyway, reading his posts, Hal seems to be the open-minded man that many avid Bitcoin supporters today are not. Rest in peace, Hal!",

He was one of the few that believed and embraced Bitcoin when the currency was nothing. He would have also been the person that has the information about the identity of Satoshi because he had contact with him. Sadly, he didn't benefit much from the currency he built with Satoshi. Most of his bitcoin was sold to take care of his failing health. He believed in science till death and his body preserved because he believes that one-day science will conquer death.",

I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals.
