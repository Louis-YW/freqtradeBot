That's why the Chinese authorities keep the FUD propaganda. They simply cannot stop all the crypto enthusiasts in from using cryptocurrencies.The seconds reason is pushing the digital yuan, by trying to FUD on the cryptocurrencies.I wonder why the Chinese FUDsters are so focused on Bitcoin. BTC is the most stable and secure cryptocurrency(by stable I mean that the blockhain is stable, not the price). BTC price might never go down to zero. The FUDsters should be focused on the shitcoins, because the shitcoins are the real problem of the crypto world, not Bitcoin.",

Just days ago I saw this post too Chinese messaging app WeChat bans accounts involved in crypto from this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403603.msg60418031#msg60418031It was the Bitcoin mining Ban whose effects didn't last long then the numerous Bans which are still not having effects on Bitcoin and now is a prediction of Zero price  Don't worry China, me, I am prepared to take all losses if it does happen.",

And what I find interesting is that influential organizations and individuals are no exception. There are mixed views, and here, like some people, I find things that drive prices down and then buy them back up, a manipulation that makes many people panic or sad. I'm basically a bitcoin lover, so after so many years with information like this, I'm just taking it as a bit of entertainment during difficult times, and let's be optimistic with BTC in the future, everything only that",

China is against everything that they can not control, since the people of china are basically slaves to their own government. The mistake of the Chinese government is that Chinese people because of this media dump their coins when price is low and start to buy when it is high.

This isn't a shocking, new phenomenon by itself, of course, but it's still worth highlighting just how much some people still don't get it. This sort of \"negative\" hype has been a primary tenet of practically every \"crypto crash\" prediction that has emerged in the past. In fact, not only has this trend of \"skyfall\" predictions been witnessed consistently since Bitcoin first started making headlines....but this hype never seems to end up panning out for the naysayers. These \"skyfall\" predictions should not be treated as a reliable indicator, but rather be dismissed out of hand. Those who spread this sort of negative hype, may end up regretting it later on. Just my personal opinion.",

Huge failure couldn't go to zero it just came back up from some decimals so how can you expect bitcoin to go to zero, i am not even expecting bitcoin to go below 5k at this point in time you are saying it'll go to zero?
