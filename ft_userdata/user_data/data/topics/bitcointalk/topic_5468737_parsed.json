Em d very heartbreaking sae our leaders can't boldly boost of how good them be to the  people wey dem d lead so since our independence day till now. Em d always be from one hardship to another na wetin d see. Em go be like sae, as we d grow older as a country, naso our suffering d increase d go so. Em d unwise sae we be giant of Africa and we still d act like a puppet for the hands of the Western world. We can't lead the other African countries or live by a perfect example of how a nation that calls herself the giant of Africa should lead in terms development, utilizing of mineral resources, security, economy, rule of law, employment rate, industrialization and empowerment of her citizens. Nigeria as a country go better for all of us, na this kind story wey we d hear since we d small, and we d grow na still the same palava we still d encounter of how corrupt our leaders can be till date. This one come bring me to the question of when our country go grow come be able to act like a giant of Africa wey we be. Em be like sae our leaders no know sae this our country don grow old so. Them no suppose to the act this way give her citizens cos em d real sense a peso wey d born around 1960 don get grandchildren by now.",

I really agree with you because been alive to witness today as naija @63 is a moment  of joy, so many plan for see today but they did witness it, so we have heavy right to be happy. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PMYou can still afford to have access to the internet. Meaning, there is not censorship. You have access to the outside world.You are also correct here, despite the naira rate against dollars we can still buy data comfortably with less than ₦1000, and the freedom of accessing every part of the world. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PMWe are still better than some other countries where civil war is ongoing.Despite our suffering, naija is still a best place to live in, reason for my statement is that there is freedom, we move freely to any where we like. Is only those experiencing civil war can relate to this. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PM You have access to electricity, good water, and food.Sorry sir, I disagree with you here because I don't see the electricity, good, and food you are talking about, I been they search for all you mentioned above but I couldn't find them, true be told we they suffer for all this you mentioned as if they are all imported, in this aspect our leaders has failed us, at this age we are still suffering. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PMThe youths of the country are becoming politically conscious, aware, and are challenging the status quo.Because they are using us to enrich themselves, they approved a bill \"not too young to rule\" but the old once are pushing us away. When they called youth we know they are playing polites, so our awareness is still question because youth do not have even 30% say in naija polites. In this aspect they have failed. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PM There's more ways to earn money other than waiting on the government to create jobs or even private companies for employment.We just have to force ourselves to survive because government do not care about us, countries with good leader also have companies and other ways of earn too. In Nigeria company works are still treated as slave, leaders do not show any concern about the wages they pay their citizens, in a company some will work for 12 hours and end up getting ₦1500 not even up $2. Please are they been fair. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 01, 2023, 02:03:54 PMThere is hope.We shouldn't give up, each an every citizens should serve as good ambassador of the country, we don't have the opportunity today but tomorrow by God's grace we will make a difference, we should all have this at the back of our mind.",

All the advance countries in the world today are older than Nigeria, they have gone through series of hard and bad time. The lurk we have in Nigeria now, is that we are in technology age where we can easily hit transformations and live a better life which I believe can happen befor the next independence. It took many years 4 advance country to cross to where they are today. In one of my post on this local board, I wrote say make we wise up for Africa, make we collect our full dominion because we still dey under the slavery of the people wey say Dem don live us, this one wey we dey celebrate so that the one wey be say Dem no dey over us directly. If Dem steal money for naija, no be oyinbo country Dem carry Dem go, take build companies for them?. Thank God say we gain independence but make we dey free from their mental and economy slavery wey waga us with better hunger.",
