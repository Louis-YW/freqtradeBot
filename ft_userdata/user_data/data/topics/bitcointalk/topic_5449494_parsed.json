  "content": "For those which are not aware, Jaxx Liberty wallet recently shut down their services.I received this email in March:I saw this message at beginning of April as I only use Jaxx rarely. However, I had some funds deposited inside it and I was afraid I lost them.I quickly checked Help section from Jaxx and there was a mention to a blog post as well: https://blog.jaxx.io/jaxx-liberty-sunsetting-update.I tried to transfer my funds but I was unable to. Fortunately, another blog post explained me what to do:QuoteMigrating your Jaxx Liberty wallet to a different compatible wallet is simple. You do not need to send your digital assets out – all you need to do is input your Jaxx Liberty 12-word backup phrase into a trusted wallet platform like Edge Wallet or Exodus Wallet to manage your cryptocurrency from there. In fact, after we shut down Jaxx Liberty servers on March 27, 2023, using your backup phrase with another wallet will be the only way to migrate your digital assets. However, this statement scared me a little:QuoteWe expect to officially retire Jaxx Liberty on March 27, 2023, at 8:00 am ET. After this time, users will still be able to view their 12-word backup phrase for a limited time, but they will be unable to make transactions and balances may be out of dateI had my seed phrase stored somewhere but I was afraid I will not be able to migrate my wallet.However, I took my chances with Exodus (Android version). At first glance my fears worsened: I could not scan the QR code of the screenshot containing my seed phrase. The QR code scanner from Exodus did not recognize my QR code from Jaxx. However, next step I made was to write down manually all the words of the seed phrase.Hooray, it worked!I have no idea how things work in case of Edge Wallet, but I believe they are similar.In any case, I advise all Jaxx Liberty users to migrate their funds as soon as possible, while they still can! I migrated my wallet at beginning of April, so still after the deadline given by Jaxx and I was able to do the operation. However, the more time passes, the lower are the chances to see your seed phrase inside Jaxx, in case you did not store it somewhere else. And also, it is possible that the wallet migration to not be possible after some more time passes.I hope this thread will be helpful to all Jaxx users.",

Well, if you have the seed phrases with you, then you can import it in any other wallet and will still get your funds access anytime. The important thing is that you have noted down the seed phrases somewhere with you before this wallet service is shut down.Quote from: JeromeTash on April 19, 2023, 08:58:13 PMGood luck to those who never even subscribe for the service email notifications.

Subscribing to email notifications is another thing, if they had emails of their users, they should send this information to everyone regardless anyone opted for the email notifications or not.While I understand your stance - as in they are going to close and the users lose access to their accounts/seed phrases - I don't support the fact that they would still send notifications/information to everyone even if a specific users opted out of their e-mail notifications since I'm mostly sure that goes against some kind of anti-spam law in some countries[1]. Here's a good summary explaining the reasoning behind such action[2]:QuoteNow, here’s the important point: when a person unsubscribes from your email list, that person will be opting out or withdrawing consent previously given. To continue sending commercial emails to that person would amount to your sending unsolicited commercial messages which, in turn, would likely result in your acting unlawfully.This applies to both unsubscribing from a mailing list but as well to opt-out from receiving such notifications as well (from my interpretation of the actions).[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam_legislation_by_country[2]https://wpandlegalstuff.com/legal-risk-continuing-email-someone-unsubscribes-email-list/",

Subscribing to email notifications is another thing, if they had emails of their users, they should send this information to everyone regardless anyone opted for the email notifications or not.Using Jaxx did not require an email. You could opt-in for an email notification though, about their updates. And, if I remember well, at some point they started working on a new feature and you could be notified on email about updates for that feature. I think it was a new coin they had in mind to create / implement, named Jaxx token or something like that, but this coin was never launched. And, if you wanted news about this development, you could subscribe to their mailing list.To sum-up: not all Jaxx users were notified by email as not all of them subscribed to their mailing list. Only those which made this subscription received the email.Regarding the other ones things do not look good -- since they did not receive any email, unless they used Jaxx often (thus being able to see any app notification about the future shut down) then prolly not many of them heard about this event on time. Some could see, by pure chance, the posts made on Jaxx's blog. But who know how many these were...This is why I considered that a topic on BitcoinTalk may be useful for Jaxx users which were not subscribed to their email list, which did not used Jaxx frequently and which also missed their blog posts.",

More specifically, jaxx_andrei - Staff at Jaxx - posted this when asked how to import wallet files within Jaxx Classic:QuoteJaxx always kept the wallet files in the Application Support (Mac) or AppData (Windows) folders. If they have the files all they need to do is to install a Jaxx Classic instance, create a new wallet and then overwrite their files to the ones created by the app in their ^ folders.If they think they have the files, I can share a copy of the latest build we had for Jaxx Classic if they email us ([info@jaxx.io](mailto:info@jaxx.io)).Unfortunately I can't help with details on the specific files/information you listed.Sadly both the user and the website listed here[2] doesn't seem to be around anymore and I wouldn't trust anything that states that it still has Jaxx Classic available to download. May I ask, what are the extensions of the files that you have @anonbtcnoob23?[1]https://safereddit.com/r/jaxx/comments/d56zi0/did_jaxx_ever_export_keystore_files/[2]https://safereddit.com/r/jaxx/comments/lpxxhy/jaxx_classic_wallet_recovery_without_12word_key/",
