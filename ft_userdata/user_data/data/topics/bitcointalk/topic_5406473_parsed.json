  "content": "Hi,I am very new to bitcoin investing and am trying to understand the tax implications.  My understanding is that to the extent that I just buy and sell on exchanges, gains / losses are treated like any other capital gains / losses.  If I buy $1000 of bitcoin in January and sell it for $2000 in March, I have a $1000 of short term capital gains.  That much seems easy enough.But what if I actually use it as currency to buy something.  It seems like in theory I would have to manually look up the price that day calculate the gain losses every time I buy something.  That's obviously not practical for anything but the very occasional large purchase.  If people are ever really going to use bitcoin as a currency, how is this going to work?  What am I missing?Thanks!",

Let's say you bought or received your Bitcoin when its price was $5,000 and then you made a payment with it for certain goods and services when its price was already at $10,000, there's a $5,000 that needs to be taxed. This might help you:https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-tax-guide/Please note that this is US-based. Taxation highly varies from one country to another. But yes, it is indeed a hassle to do some reconciliation of Bitcoin's cost when it was acquired and its value when it was spent every time you make a purchase with it.",

      "body": "Well, As it happens, only a small part of bitcoin transactions are related to merchant processing. However, eventually you may see widespread merchant adoption, and that will have implications for tax reporting. Currently, users who use bitcoin for purchases can easily calculate the profit and loss at the time of buying and selling. But when there is widespread merchant adoption, you need to track your income and expenses i.e. at the time the transactions are made.",

If you lived in El Salvador, since it is legal tender there, you would not have to pay taxes for using it, regardless of price fluctuations with respect to the USD or other currencies. In the case of most countries, as you mention, simply paying for a coffee in theory creates a taxable event, which makes it very difficult for people to spend it as a currency on a daily basis. At some point it was discussed in the USA to set a threshold below which Bitcoin transactions would not have to be declared, such as $200, but as far as I know there is no law passed on this.Quote from: Darker45 on July 16, 2022, 04:14:19 AMAnybody please correct me if I'm wrong, but the moment you use your Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, it's as if you are already converting it.

You see the fair market value of the asset the day you are relinquishing it in exchange of something else and this fair market value becomes your sell price or purchase cost and accordingly you calculate your taxes on this value itself. But this is in practice because it is clearly written in law, about Bitcoins it isn't written in law so far therefore one cannot just assume that we have to follow this methodology but based on similar scenario this is only the best way we currently have to calculate this.",

But this is definitely the case in countries where tax laws, policies, and appropriate forms are regularly updated and implementation is strict. From where I'm writing though, not only are the tax laws archaic and partially blind to emerging technologies, they're also poorly implemented. Anybody could buy and sell Bitcoin, pay it for goods and services, without paying a centavo of tax--save perhaps to the tax already included in the prices of goods and services--and no agency would run after you.",

In your theory yes you need to keep the records and has to be reported for tax compliance on most cases.",

Perhaps among the countries where Bitcoin is already recognized by way of policies and laws, most of them impose capital gains on Bitcoin. QuoteIt has been explained to you before that although there is no explicit regulation for Bitcoin, capital gains tax can be applied to it because it applies to what you sell for more money than you buy, without the need for a specific law.Not necessarily. There might not be a need for a specific law for it, but if Bitcoin is not even categorized, how should it be taxed? Is it by default that since it is not classified, it should immediately be listed as a capital asset? What if I don't even treat it as an asset? Or what if I reason that I am keeping my Bitcoin for a while and then sell it when the price is high and buy back when the price goes down and then sell again when it recovers and so capital gains tax doesn't apply to me? In which case, I am only responsible to pay value-added tax but since I am not reaching the amount limit set by law then I am not obliged to pay any tax at all? Is that legally valid enough?My point is that for as long as there's ambiguity as to how Bitcoin is classified or regulated, interpretations are open. And if interpretations are allowed, how can I be obliged to pay a certain form of tax which assumes Bitcoin's classification?QuoteIn any case, if you argue that there are many countries where no tax or capital gains tax is charged, I would appreciate it if you could provide a source,I did not say many; I said some.
