Last weekend Manchester City played Manchester United in one of those international leagues that the influencer kicked against and it was easy for most football bettors to know who win the match even before it was played.",

Morrocco too sometimes. I like South American leagues, most especially Brazil Seria A and B. Argentina too, but not all the time. I do not use to bet on these leagues but the few I bet, I win than lose. But I prefer EPL more than any league and also European football generally. When I was still betting daily, I do go through https://www.livescores.com/ and see the better leagues that are playing daily, make some analyses to know the best clubs to take for that day. But that can be a kind of addiction. If you check the prediction sites and also live score sites, you will definitely see leagues to choose from daily. I am not advising on daily bet though.",

The non-European leagues so far are still very unclean as some people have mentioned, yes there is the possibility of fixing scores in some matches so it is necessary for you to avoid lots of bets there.Premier League and La Liga are my two favorite leagues, and so far it makes sense to get some wins there especially at few favorite teams.",

When it comes to football I like to bet locally, either on European teams or the World Cup because it makes me feel comfortable. I watch these games so betting makes games more exciting. Also, I can bet on my local teams or at least my local players who play in various clubs all around Europe. Betting on Asian football would be like betting on sports that I know nothing about like cricket or the NFL.",

Even if I were interested in this tipster's information, I would first closely follow the leagues he doesn't recommend betting on, and then make my decision. My personal opinion is that all leagues have fixed matches, not just European soccer.",

In my personal experience I've won easier with Tennis matches compared to other games. Most of the time my choice of odds selection is to go along with the lowest one. Nowadays this is quite risky, because underdogs outperforms and gives surprise. Another thing that makes sports betting easy to win is the live betting. Making bets on live betting used to give a better outline about the match than placing bets prior to the match.",

So far his winrate is 90%, and when I looked at the teams he usually picks, it's not always the favorites who's winning but sometimes the underdogs depending on who they are up against. There are league favorites that does consistently well against a lot of teams but does badly when it comes to one or two particular teams that aren't as good as the average teams. I personally don't understand how he does it, but to him it's just another day in the office and another $$$ to collect. I'm yet to get a consistent win on my Korean baseball picks, though I'm already winning quite a lot just by tailing him.",

Singaporean League for example, is one hell of a clown fiesta, so much so that not a lot of people are really looking forward to watching them, basically already closing out on their chance at getting fans and supporters from their very country, although I'm guessing it's because of their relatively small population, not too many athletic specimen that could show massive display of talent and skill per se, but at this point it's just excuses lmao.",

Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1.maybe, in the next season I will try to learn the Serie A League. I mean, I haven't been up to date regarding the Italian league competition for a long time.Related to victory, of course every gambler wants to win his bet. but to make it happen, several supporting factors are needed, namely, knowledge, insight, skills, and good at analyzing a team that will compete. the rest, let the luck factor decide.",
