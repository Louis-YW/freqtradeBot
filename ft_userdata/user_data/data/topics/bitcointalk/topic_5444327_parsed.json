You can stop using the app if you are among those who are concerned about thier privacy. Data can be sold though so that's what they are worried about as the KYC is part of the surveillance the government is doing on thier citizen. It's kind of an exaggerated reaction but it's already happening with the social credit system.",

Sure — but historically it caused far more bad than good. People often heavily underestimate how bad of a damage database leaks can cause.Quote from: Justtoons on March 10, 2023, 05:30:13 PMIs this true that kyc verification can put your funds and personal data at risk?Yes, I assume you've already read the post you linked.Quote from: Justtoons on March 10, 2023, 05:30:13 PMShould we stop using any app that ask for kyc verification?It'll be very very difficult to live your day to day life without using platforms that require KYC verification. The only thing I'll suggest is that you do not submit KYC verification unless totally necessary(e.g. banks, insurance, etc). A lot of people register and submit KYC on a crap ton of crypto exchanges, which is a very dumb idea.",

And this is why some casinos and exchanges use a 3rd party for the KYC process.",

Users have different approaches when it comes to KYC. Others are just fine complying with it while on the other hand, there are people who are not that comfortable with that policy.Let's put it this way, there are pros and cons, advantages and disadvantages, and so on.If you can find a way where you can use a service of a trusted and legit platform without the need of underdoing KYC, then good for you.",

As long as the company has good security and privacy policies, KYC verification is generally safe. You just need to be cautious and do some research before giving away your personal information. Check if the company is trustworthy and has good security measures before signing up. If you are not sure, it is better to be safe than sorry and choose a different app or website.",

Should we stop using any app that ask for kyc verification?Like every other policy KYC verification has its merits and demerits. Criminals would always take advantage of every slight opportunity to defraud people or engage in criminal activities, that's why there is need for controld. KYC has indeed help in tracing or tracking of criminal transactions. Recently some murder suspects were apprehended because they foolishly forced a victim to transfer money to an account before he was murdered. The police easily tracked them through the transaction.But KYC can be a means of spying on or monitoring of the financial status of a person. The government use KYC as a manipulative and intimidation tool against it's citizens. Your person information can be sold or stolen by criminals which can expose you to loss of information or fund. It is impossible to avoid KYC especially if you depend on banks for transactions and when your country doesn't support Bitcoin. But it will be unwise to give out your details to firms or organisation that offers unimportant services.",

Even those who use sites that require a registration process using email and public information are not aware that they are handing over private information about themselves to the site. Social networking sites provide the most obvious example of this.On this basis, they are surprised that there are users who do not want to share their data with any party, and who in turn raise awareness about the dangers in these procedures.In principle, it can be said that there are no major concerns about sites that operate according to licenses that require them to secure depositors' accounts and audit operations according to the so-called AML. Since it will be possible to file a lawsuit against the platform in the event that it is proven that it used user data for purposes different from those approved in the terms of use of the site.",

Should we stop using any app that ask for kyc verification?We can't get away from it in the twenty-first century. KYC is required for approximately 70-90% of the online services we use on a daily basis. Because of the risk involved in disclosing your personal identity, you should not always disregard the positive aspects and services it offers. Binance was once accused of providing user data to Russia during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; these are the types of cases that make it a risk when disclosing user data.",

Atleast for the least you might easily find your documents on dark web for sale for just a few bucks. But obviously there is no option sometimes you just have to comply with KYC norms of a few websites to use them.",

If you are not a criminal or intend to scam people of their hard earn money, I don't see any reason why you should be scared about sharing your KYC, but thou I know there are a lot of persons who loves privacy and can't share their details online. But, let me break this down. \"KYC\" simply means \"Know Your Customer\", and it was made compulsory due to the high rate of internet fraud,  as a medium to be able to find any customer who seems to scam any other user on a given platform and ran away. Or as a means to ensure a system isn't abuse by multi-accountingKYC is both good and bad, in the sense that if someone happens to scam you on a kyc platform, he can easily be identified. And it's bad in the sense that a platform can sell your details to whoever is interested for huge some",
