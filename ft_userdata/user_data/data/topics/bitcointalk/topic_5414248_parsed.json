No idea why.Several times I requested to be paid with an instant SEPA from guys in Germany and Italy and they weren't able to send it.I thought they were poor payers looking for an excuse. But in fact, it's the banks.",

The previous posters are on point.Kraken offers instant SEPA withdrawals in certain countries. Just check their TOS if its available at your place too. Or ask their support. I know that many users from the German forum section have already used their instant withdrawl service. It is slightly more expensive than a regular withdrawal, but the cost is only in the range of a few cents, if I remember correctly.Usually the funds are in your bank account within a few minutes. Pretty chill!",

      "body": "Have you tried to use bestchange where you can filter exchanges that support sepa withdrawal?Look at this one https://www.bestchange.com/bitcoin-to-sepa.htmlMost of them are instant just make sure you check the exchange first if they have KYC verification. Bestchange filters them with an icon on the right side of the exchanges if it's manual, automatic, KYC verification, or if they are taking commission fee just hover the mouse to the right of the exchange name and also check the exchange after you access the site go to the bottom to read TOS/Privacy policy and AML/KYC POLICY to make sure you are using a non-KYC exchange.",
