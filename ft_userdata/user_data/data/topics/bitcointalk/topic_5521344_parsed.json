I suppose that when they see dozens of countries creating strategic reserves they will have no choice but to do the same.",

This is because Switzerland is not part of European union. Quote from: Poker Player on December 02, 2024, 08:54:42 AMI am quite pessimistic about the EU, maybe in Germany they will be the first to think of something but in the rest of the countries the politicians are not aware of any of this. I suppose that when they see dozens of countries creating strategic reserves they will have no choice but to do the same.Only what we want is for United States to begin bitcoin strategic reserve. It will not be too late when Europe Union will consider such move in my opinion. Just like you meant also, other countries will likely having bitcoin strategic reserve. But I think before United will do something like this, it has to be a bill passed by Donald Trump to the Senate. So Senate has to accept the bill, signed it and pass it back to Trump before something like that can happen. So I hope this will not be an issue for Trump.",

However, I believe that here, as in the case of Brazil, it is just a matter of one man's wish and nothing more. Besides, Switzerland is known for holding referendums on most important matters, and I'm not sure that most people in that country would answer positively to the question \"should we have BTC in national reserves?\" Most people are still skeptical when it comes to BTC, regardless of whether it is Switzerland or another country in Europe.",

Managing a personal, company portfolio is easier than managing a national treasury, and countries have to be more careful with their national investment in Bitcoin. If anything is wrong with Bitcoin, like its price collapse, a national treasury will be in trouble, if Bitcoin is a main part of their national treasuries.Bitcoin is good for an investment portfolio but there are many things that affect decisions like invest or don't invest.",

BRICS is just fiat and the value is stable, people will not want to hold something that didn't make them to generate more value, they only use fiat to buy things in their countries. If The US is officially accept Bitcoin as their reserve, we might see almost all countries adopt Bitcoin as their reserves too. The US give a lot effect to other countries.",

This is very similar to the usual hype around bitcoin, but on a larger scale. On the scale of countries. Now, when the price of bitcoin is growing and crypto-euphoria is in the air, these countries are talking about plans to create a reserve in btc. But if there is a noticeable and prolonged fall in bitcoin, then countries can immediately abandon these plans with a reserve (or postpone them indefinitely).It seems to me that such news should be perceived more cautiously and not succumb to premature euphoria. Don't pay attention to this hype with a reserve for countries. Do what you must (accumulate btc) and come what may (profit in the long term is inevitable).",

The global banking regulators have taken a significant step towards increasing transparency in the financial sector. The Basel Committee, comprising banking regulators from major global financial hubs, has introduced a proposal to enforce standardized disclosure of crypto assets by major banks starting from January 2025.This move aims to bolster \"market discipline\" by offering investors a comprehensive view of banks' crypto holdings and activities. The Basel Committee, one of the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) committees, took this step after establishing new rules in December last year that dictate the amount of capital banks must maintain to cover various categories of crypto assets.BIS' Crypto Asset Reporting FrameworkAccording to a statement on BIS' website, the Basel Committee has released a new framework for public consultation, outlining how banks should report their crypto asset holdings to the public.According to the proposal, banks must provide qualitative and quantitative information regarding their dealings with crypto assets. This information will encompass details on their exposure to crypto assets, the corresponding capital and liquidity requirements, and the activities related to these digital assets.The Basel Committee stated: \"Banks would also be required to provide details of the accounting classifications of their exposures to crypto assets and crypto liabilities. The committee expects that a common format for disclosures will support the exercise of market discipline and help to reduce information asymmetry between banks and market participants.\"",
