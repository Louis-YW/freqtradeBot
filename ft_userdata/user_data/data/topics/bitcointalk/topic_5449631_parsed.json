The token was made to be completely safe for all plebs, which is why there is 0 tax and liquidity has been burnt.Pleb get reky no more.c–∫a—áa—Ç—å –∫ap—Ç–∏–Ω–∫–∏ –≤a—Çca–øWhen you combine the best memes with crypto culture, you have the recipe for a unicorn ü¶Ñ. Opportunities like $PLEB don't come by often, its refreshing seeing something original from all the other recycled memes from 2021 or a dog coin. Pleb is a commonly used term all over CT, there is no reason why this wont go on a run similar to the way in which $GM did. The community are constantly producing some hilarious memes and are really getting behind PLEB, imagine if we are witnessing the birth of a new meme legend. The next WOJAK or PEPE. That would be quite something. I see this being a low risk very high reward type play.
