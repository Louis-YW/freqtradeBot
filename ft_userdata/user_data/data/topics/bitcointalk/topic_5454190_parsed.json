What does it mean exactly?It means ACINQ has imposed a rate limit, which you've exceeded. It can happen to other nodes as well, it might not be just you. Rate limiting is a mechanism usually used by big servers, as this one, to prevent abuse either due to encountering too many requests within a specific timeframe, or simply because you don't meet their channel opening policies.I'd wait for a day or two if I were you.

I have not opened and closed multiple channels with them though, it is a single channel I have been trying to open with them for a new node. If it is a rate limit due to a number of nodes too large trying to open channels with them, then I can understand.",

I will try rebooting my node since it has been up for 6 months or so and see if it makes a difference. Thanks!Edit: So I tried connecting to their IPv4 address after rebooting (through Tor still though since my node's firewall blocks all IPV4 services in and out), and I got the same error.",
