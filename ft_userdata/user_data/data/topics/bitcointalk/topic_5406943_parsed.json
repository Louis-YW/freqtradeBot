  "content": "The FBI has issued warnings about a cryptocurrency scam running and defrauding US investors.This cyber group is very successful that they were able to stole around $40++ million already. The authorities name 2: Yibit[1] and Supayos[2], Supay.So the MO is that they will target their victims and then to install fake apps. This criminals going to the length as faking legitimate sites, using names, logos and other information. And then once you are in, they will ask you to deposit money obviously. And then when you wanted to withdraw, they will ask you to pay the taxes first. And even if you pay your alleged taxes, you can't withdraw any money.https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220718.pdfSo again, this is just a clear warning to everyone specially that we are in a recession. We really have to be very careful of our money and where we are going to invest.Don't believed this too good to be true offers.[1] Yibit was a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, unfortunately they are closed since 2018[2] Supay is a fraudulent company but they are using the name of a legit crypto exchange from Australia.",

      "body": "for a second I thought you made a typo and were supposed to put \"Yobit\" instead of \"Yibit\". QuoteFollowing these deposits, 17 victims received an email stating they had to pay taxes on their investmentsbefore withdrawing funds; all 4 victims could not withdraw funds through the app.I'm a little confused about this part, did the 13 other victims able to withdraw or all of them were not able to withdraw but the 4 victims just got scammed for a lot more money than the 13 other victims because of paying the \"taxes\"? I have a feeling that some of the victims are just decoys to show other possible victims that there are people \"investing/depositing\" on their website.",

FBI issued these cyber warning now but there has been many scam alerts which people completely ignore and continue to invest with brain wash in these projects and then get rugged by them as you can see this one also worth million dollars.How could they raise $40+ million so easily? The answer is people are fool enough to send their funds over to scammers in hope of earning more or greed and carelessness.This is only one example and you would find many more such scams in this crypto market but you need to be extra careful with your funds and don't invest blindly in any of those projects you see over the net.",

The 14 billion is a worldwide number, the FBI doesn't care about that and the FBI can only publish numbers on proof of scams and investigations. Of course, they've managed to form more than only 28 and 4 victims! Those are actually the ones identified, the true number might be in the hundreds, but if the victim doesn't want to tell the world he is a victim, there is no crime being committed!Just look at the scam section here, I'm willing to bet that less than 1% think of filing a complaint with the police, and scammers know that and become more aggressive.

But how can this really help if they don't invest more in grassroot sensitization, For dating scams that have been on for a long time and the authorities have warned severally, has it resulted in putting a stop completely to dating scams? I do not think so. They have to do more than just verbal warnings but invest massively in grassroots sensitization to ensure that people always double-check the credibility of an investment sites especially cryptocurrency related that they about to get involved with. That can prove more effective than just issueing several verbal warning.",
