      "body": "Probably going to be awhile before that transaction confirms. It was sent with a 30.2 sat per vbyte fee and currently transactions needs over 200 sat per vbyte fee to confirm quickly. You can try viabtc free accelerator or pay to speed it up, but likely it'll cost too much to speed it up with the paid option. I'd ask again for the sender to RBF and see if they will.Quote from: coupable on December 15, 2023, 05:21:26 PMQuote from: f.tol on December 15, 2023, 05:14:25 PMplease help to fast this Transactions sender refuse edit fees3a39e9ba4baab80d33263431e93b5fca69946cdb0a9db83751947e4e6a92d718With only 30 satoshi per vbyte, it's unlikely to get confirmed sooner.

Miners are not joking with regular fees these days, priority is always advised if you want to get it confirmed ASAP",

I think you mean when too many nodes drop it out of their mempool. If the node that the sender is connected to, drops the tx, then the tx would turn 'local' and the sender can send the tx again with a higher fee this time. The tx is also opted to rbf, so the sender can also bump the fees if they are ready to pay for it.Quote from: wallet4bitcoin on December 15, 2023, 05:27:40 PMMiners are not joking with regular fees these days, priority is always advised if you want to get it confirmed ASAPMiners have always prioritized tx's based on the tx fees attached to them.Quote from: abhibtccc on December 15, 2023, 05:32:45 PMThe fee you have added is good.
