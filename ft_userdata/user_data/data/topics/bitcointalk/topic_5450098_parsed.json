I am asking because if it is the former, then Bisq and similar truly decentralized non-KYC exchanges are not a very good solution (beside not being very beginner friendly and having very limited number of trading pairs) due low volume so you may have to wait for days for your buy/sell order to go through and that's not something that as a trader you want.If I have to chose one non-KYC exchange to recommend, that would probably be Kucoin. I've been using it for years and so far I wasn't asked for KYC but then again I never dealt with big amounts because I know that at any time they can ask for documents and in that case I am ready to lose the money I have there.",

Do crypto to fiat and vice versa trades.Because there are many decentralized exchanges out there where you can do crypto to crypto trades with complete anonymity whereas the problem occurs when it comes to fiat cause lot of regulations when we are talking about fiat currencies. As far as I know Bisq seems the only real p2p where you never need to do KYC compliance because its not really a platform whereas other p2p exchanges out there which may not have mandatory KYC at the moment but they will be forced to do at any moment.",

But if an exchange can offer a $10k Bitcoin exchange limit I think that is enough liquidity to put so many things in check, better still if the 10k limit is based on daily limits because that will make it more fun to use since one will basically plan out his/her limit in transactions and spread them to run through several days.",

I know Bisq exchange is good but you can't trade with it on it mobile app (and not every traders has a pc ) and is not really beginner's friendly. As far as I am concerned, all CEX are under a region and that region has a government with laws governing it so therefore all CEX will be subjected to KYC as time goes on. If they do not do KYC now do not forget that there are always a way to get the crowd and the government knows what to do the getvat the CEX for failing to meet up with their demand so no CEX would want to fall victim of the government wrath but do as it pleases them. So do not be decieved CEX are government wing of Crypto exchange that must do kyc.",

Some exchanges, such as Kucoin, allow trading without KYC, but this policy can change at any moment. Bybit was previously a popular exchange that didn't require KYC, but it will now be mandatory. Therefore, it's not advisable to be too confident in trading without KYC on centralized exchanges if you want to stay completely secure. It's best to use a reputable decentralized exchange. However, if you choose to trade on Kucoin without KYC, exercise caution as it is well-regarded but subject to change.",
