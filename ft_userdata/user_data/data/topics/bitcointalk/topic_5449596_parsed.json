Do you agree?”“Ummm, I… I… it’s… actually all securities are commodities under the Commodity and Exchange Act, it’s that we’re excluded commodities, but I would agree that a security cannot also be an excluded commodity and an included commodity, I’m sorry chair, just to talk about the Commodity Exchange Act, more precisely.”McHenry did not appear to think this answer was an answer at all.He followed up: “I’m asking you, sitting in your chair now, to make an assessment under the laws that exist: Is ether a commodity, or a security?”“Without speaking to any one…” began Gensler.“You’ve repeatedly said you won’t speak to one,” interrupted McHenry, “But you’ve spoken to one: bitcoin. So I’m asking you to speak to a second one, with the second largest market cap.”“In speaking to the tokens,” Gensler replied, “There’s ten to twelve thousand, if there’s a group of entrepreneurs…”“I’m asking about one,” interjected McHenry. “I’m asking you a specific question, Chair Gensler. I said this in private, this should be no shock to you that I’m asking this question. Is ether a commodity, or a security?”Gensler: “And again, it depends on the facts and the law on if there’s a group of individuals…”McHenry: “I’m asking about the facts and the law, sitting in your seat, and the judgment you are making.”Gensler: “And so, Mr. Chair, I think you would not want me to prejudge…”McHenry wasn’t having it. “But you have prejudged on this. You’ve taken 50 enforcement actions. We’re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices on what is a security in your view and your agency’s view. I’m asking you a very simple question about the second-largest digital asset. What is your view?”Once again, Gensler refused to answer. “And my view is, if there’s a group of individuals in the middle of it, the public is entitled…”McHenry gave up and moved on.https://korea.postsen.com/business/145169/US-SEC-Chairman-Avoids-Answering-Ethereum-Securities-at-Hearing-%3C-Blockchain-%3C-Main-article.htmlPreviously, Chairman Gensler argued that Ethereum, which was converted to Proof of Stake (PoS) after the merge upgrade, is a security. He cited the fact that the majority of all nodes operating Ethereum at the time were in the United States.Live: Gensler Answers to House Financial Services Committeehttps://blockworks.co/news/gensler-house-financial-services-committee___This is a real circus!",

      "body": "You should also listen to the part where he's being questioned by Waren Davidson, who not only makes Gensler sweat in his seat, but also proposes to remove him from his position. In short, Gary Gensler is asked about suing Kim Kardashian for promoting EthereumMax, and he responds that it was a security and they reached a settlement. Davidson asks why did they go after one person who was promoting it and not after the coin and its creators because the coin is still trading. It's obvious they went after an easy target that had money to pay the fine. The SEC is there to gather money from easy targets, it's not there to protect investors from scams. The SEC also allowed coinbase to do its IPO, after stating that it's a platform where unregistered securities are being traded.I'm biased here as a bitcoin holder, but Gensler is a strange guy. On one hand he is so into making it hard for any crypto company to function, on the other ha made it very easy for the biggest scam exchange on the planet (FTX) to prosper and SBF was allowed to do what he wanted. This guy is prejudiced, incompetent, and tries to find a way to make the 100 year old laws to work for new investment vehicles, which cannot work.",

      "body": "It is clear to me that it is a security, so I don't know why he said it clearly before but avoided saying it in that appearance. Basically Bitcoin is a commodity because it does not depend on a central authority and the supply cannot be increased at will, something similar to what is happening with gold and other commodities.  Obviously this is not the case with Ethereum and shitcoins, which are more like bonds issued by a company, which are dependent on a central authority, that company, and can be increased at will.",

It’s most convenient to search not where you lost it, but where it’s lightQuoteOne night a policeman found a man searching for his keys under a streetlight. He joined to help, only to realize after hours of searching, that the man had lost his keys in the park.“Then why are you searching here?” asked the policeman.“Because this is where the light is,” replied the man.",

Look what's going on on the political scene in the US. They're starting their presidential campaigns and a some candidates are using bitcoin to show they support financial freedom and civil liberties. At the same time some states make bitcoin mining legal, while other states ban CBDC. Every politician gets asked these hard question, like where do you stand when it comes to capital punishment, gun laws, women rights. Now bitcoin is becoming one of these questions that candidates need to have an opinion on and these people are old, they don't understand it and can't make a solid argument for banning it. A great example is Brad Sherman. He's against bitcoin, but take a moment and listen to his points. Maybe he could convince my elderly father that he knows what he's talking about, but most tech-savvy people will laugh at him. Here's how people react to him. Every time he says something about bitcoin it gets ridiculed.https://twitter.com/BradSherman/status/1382871291443699714So, I don't think a crackdown is coming. Gensler is trying to make it look like he wasn't involved in FTX scam, by attacking those who promoted FTX and legit crypto companies who want to provide services in the US, and a few politicians are lobbying against bitcoin because they probably own bank stocks and/or are involved in CBDC implementation.",

By doing that, SEC would be reducing their power. Without clear rules, they have a power to strike at any time at any crypto, or the entire industry if they wish to.Quote from: NotATether on June 08, 2023, 11:54:47 AMThis kind of waffling is really going to end badly for Gensler and the SEC since basically the entire crypto industry has turned on them.Sadly, the crypto industry has no strong lobby and is politically irrelevant. But even if they were, as SEC is deemed an independent body, Gensler's position is pretty safe, as long as he doesn't go against the SEC's Commissioners (who appointed him).Moreover, SEC's actions are in line with the current administration's crackdown on crypto, known as \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\".",

The SEC hopes to win the case and wants to set a legal precedent. And then the decision of the court will become law and no one will be able to change the rules. Probably, the court cases will end before the US has a law to regulate cryptocurrencies.",
