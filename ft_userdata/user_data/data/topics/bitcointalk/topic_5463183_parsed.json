  "content": "Hello, we need someone who can make video announcements for our new project. Ideally, you’ll have knowledge about crypto and trading. If not, you’re able to learn about it. You’ll need a good mic, good webcam/camera and need to confidently read out a script. We can pay for each video that you’re able to make. You should have knowledge about crypto trading or are able to learn about it and are comfortable speaking into a camera. English as a first language is preferred, and you need to be fluent in English. We can pay $150 BTC upfront and $300 BTC total for each video. We need someone’s cooperation for about 3 months. Being able to use Telegram is also ideal.",
