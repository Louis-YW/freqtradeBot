This is a volatile market, some people ride on speculations that’s why we have traders on cryptocurrency. What you saw yesterday was just two side of how the Market is and will be. Yesterday they were sellers who thought the news was true, or probably miners who sold some profits, or better still people who had set a target price of $45k as when they will sell all three combine and the price hit $40k. Immediately many who wants to seize the opportunity to accumulate also jumped in and bought and the price immediately stabilized. All this are parts of it. The best thing is for one to set his own target, and invest what you can afford to lose but you can’t definitely eliminate FOMO from this market",

Bitcoin's value can swing, but it's essential to remember that one event doesn't have the final say on its future. Crypto is unpredictable and believing every rumor can be a confusion.",

But this was a tight slap on face of those who tried bringing down Bitcoin as it survived this attempt as well and rising again.Matrixport came up with the prediction that Bitcoin ETF might not be approved in this first quarter based on some careless analysis. And people who knew nothing about the sector were consumed by fear of the unknown. This shows that many people who have invested recently are targeting just the ETF approval by the SEC. I think we might see more of this and other smart investors will seize the opportunity to buy more.    QuoteWhen I as we I meant those who have panic sold their holding and it's sad people don't understand that just one event like spot ETF approval cannot define Bitcoin's future and people should stop believing in these smear campaigns because no one can predict much about crypto or Bitcoin. Spot ETF is currently having the biggest attention from investors. It has attracted so much money to the industry but these events cannot define the future of Bitcoin. With or without ETF approval, Bitcoin will keep growing. Experienced investors will only sell when they get to their targets regardless of the FUD.",

Because of this fact, people believe that if Bitcoin Spot ETFs get approvals, very huge capital from Wall Street will flow in this market and will help Bitcoin increases a lot in price.I agree with you, users in Bitcointalk don't have enough big capital to pump or dump the market. Maybe there are some whales hidden in the forum and still watching our discussions in Wall Observers but generally I think there are not too many big whales here.",

The price of Bitcoin moves within a range from $38,000 to $45,000, and breaking these levels is what will cause a change in trading trends, either returning again to the 32,000 levels or moving forward to the 48,000 levels. Therefore, all news and analyzes within the $38,000 to $45,000 range are just fluctuations.

If you think that panic will stop in the market, then you are new to the business. It is not perculiar to Bitcoin, it happens to anything being traded in the open market even in our localities. A speech by Fed Chair, Jerome Powell inject volatility into the entire forex market with people selling or buying aggressively.  Many people profits from this while some also get burnt from this. The key point is that panic buying and selling will continue to happen as it is part of the business. Different people have different perspective and targets. It is mastery that makes the difference.  While some will see holding for long as a way of keeping the money redundant and not yielding much profits, some see it as the way to maximise profits.",

Not everyone has the same thoughts and and analysis of the market. A blind bullish faith too might not work for everyone specially short term traders.There's no doubt bitcoin has been making progressive all time highs historically. But there's also long pauses between. People who are into trading benefits from the price swings and people shorting even makes profit on decreasing market. Not selling could sound good for us who expects x4 on our investment within next year but their are traders who wish to x2 their money every months. If everyone had the same mindset, the market would not work.",

Can't agree more! People who are involved in Bitcoin since some time, they understand that an ETF approval cannot define the future of Bitcoin. But the dumps are coming from novice speculators. Actually seasoned Bitcoin holders do not care about weather and ETF is going to be approved or not. Honestly it just needs some market maturity before Bitcoin can stop responding to such events. Unfortunately we haven't yet reached to such maturity level.",

One truth is, if you’ve been in this space for a couple of years and I don’t mean just having to invest in Bitcoin alone but to be involved in some news field or forum to discuss it’s mechanics and development, you would come to realize just how safe ot is and wouldn’t be moved by just any news or FUD that is being spread around.The centralized nature of aspects to Bitcoin doesn’t define nothing of the currency. What they ought to realize first is that, Bitcoin is decentralized and having a decentralized system defined by centralized system is a big fraud and flaw. It just doesn’t make any sense. It’s always been a consensus of users and still would be.",

Do not be too sure. I think that we will see more FUD in the coming days, which will push down the price of Bitcoin even further. It is obvious market manipulation, but there is nothing we can do but HODL and not give in to the panic.And if you really want to stick it to the manipulative whales and their media/influencer friends who are trying as hard as they can to spread the obviously manufactured FUD, then buy the bottoms and hodl. No selling whatsoever.If more people stuck to that strategy, then we would not see so much market manipulation.",
