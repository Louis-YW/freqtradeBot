Does this company dominate the HW device market in terms of HW device shipments?This news from the ledger demonstrates that even in a bear market, you can make good money. It would seem that sales of hardware wallets should be reduced due to a decline in interest in cryptocurrency due to falling prices, but it turned out differently. Demand for HW devices has increased due to the desire of people to single-handedly own their cryptocurrency and secure themselves by removing it from the exchanges. Which, in general, is not at all surprising.",

I see only one explanation: the influence of advertising and the good work of the marketing department with many other shortcomings of ledger. As for the quality of the device that I bought a few years ago, I can't say anything bad, because nothing broke and everything works as it should from day one. It is possible that problems in quality and functionality arose as a result of the use of lower quality materials, and possibly a less experienced workforce.I also thought that Ledger will lose the user's trust after the data leak scandal, but it's obvious that most people don't value their privacy enough to blacklist such a company. And as you say, a good advertising strategy still keeps them on top and probably targets those completely new investors in the crypto world who are probably not aware of anything that happened in the past.Another fact that works in their favor is that, apart from Trezor, they have no real competition that can offer a product for the masses at a more favorable price, and at the same time gain more trust in the short term. I can only say that my next HW will not be from Ledger.",

If the reason for better sales is just shitcoins mania, then someone is going to be in big trouble when things go downhill. What I like about Trezor is the \"Bitcoin-only firmware\" option, which is one step higher in security considering possible attack vectors in combination with all coin apps that can be installed on the device.I also have a small theory that potential customers prefer the Ledger design in the form of a classic USB stick, rather than the design developed by Trezor - which attracted me to buy Ledger at the beginning.",

I think that reason must be the right mindset why holders should not keep their assets long term in a centralized exchange and by far HW is the best storage wallet ever. Every investor and long term holder should know it and they should be aware of it for one thing, not your keys, not your assets.The bitcoin price crash is not the main reason why demand for HW increase during 2022, but I think this increase can be interpreted as an increase in awareness and knowledge among users [investors and holders] about why not to store their assets long term in a centralized exchange. There are many reasons why it is increasing, but the first one I think is bitcoin users are starting to know and realize not to choose a centralized exchange for long term storage of their assets.",
