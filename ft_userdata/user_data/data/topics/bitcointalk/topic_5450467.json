I guess his attempt to return the money was not enough which landed him in prison.it's a cautionary tale about the importance of being responsible when investing or trading. Even with the best intentions, Using money that is not your is the worst idea, when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency And can result to serious legal consequences.We should all have it in mind that Investing in Bitcoin it's a game of luck and the market is volatile but this guy actually ran out of luck.",

We don't know their activities are good enough to keep their companies and our money safely enough.That CFO is bad because stealing customer fund to trade but even if they don't steal our money but like collapsed banks, they failed to manage risk and we at the end have to bear losses from their bad management.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Its really frustrating to see a lot of users who aim to use other people money to trade and then loses it. This is fine if he is using a legal way like lend the money and pay the interest from what he borrow cause its working on defi products where users borrowed funds but with collateral. This is one way to do it in a proper way. But others who uses a trick method or power will definitely go to prison. But does they really go there?

If you are trading on behalf of other people because they don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies, you are doing something really stupid and risky.I don't need to know how good or bad your trading skills are and what is your experience with cryptocurrency trading but trading on behalf of others will contain more pressure than trading for yourself with your capital.Because the others don't have knowledge, don't understand about this market, they will feel panic when they read news by chance, and they will call you to ask why it happened, is it safe to continue owning cryptocurrency, should they exit this market and more funny but headache questions for you. I am sure you won't want to take risk and pressure like that.",

Point is that such people are just a popular name and therefore the news becomes so popular but this is common among many small cap crypto investors starting off their journey with shiny memecoins and shitcoins without thinking of checking their charts.Previous memecoins have performed poorly and still going go with their owners attempting to keep their ships afloat. This is not understood by many such investors but they want the quick sell off at profit and exit. But that at one point due to sheer bad luck does not work out as intended.It is a lesson if someone understands this, most of the memecoin lovers are in denial which is only because they are seeing a part of the cycle which has been running since many years.",

We should trade with those assets that we have no fear of losing. That is, before trading, the amount of money you will trade with should be deducted from your total money. Because there is no trust in this money. Maybe you made a lot of profit in the beginning but one time you will see that instead of profit you have lost a lot of money from your capital then you will not be able to sell your coins at a loss and may have to wait for a long time to recover that loss. Basically this is the reason why you should trade with extra amount of money that you have no desire for money. There are some new traders who decide to trade by selling their much needed assets. I think it is a completely wrong decision.",

Trading is not easy and in order to make profits, you need to understand the market completely.If trading is a quick job to make us rich, now there are many people who are millionaires, or even billionaires. However, the facts that occur in the field are not that easy, there are even people who end up bankrupt due to trading, more precisely, they trade without adequate knowledge. From this case, we can learn that assuming trading is a get-rich-quick scheme is a big mistake. I am not considered a new person when compared to beginners who are just getting to know trading, but I also still experience many defeats which in the end make my trades a loss.

It is good to let them know that if they don't learn and familiarize themselves with the trading tools, strategies, and rules, they may not even make any profit, even before considering it a get-rich-quick scheme. There is a guy I am aware of who makes about $100 on a daily basis from his trading; at times, he even makes more profit than $100.

Plus trading in meme coins is a good way to become rich if you have a lot of experience and money because AFAIK, without experience and talent, you can not become rich even if you have all the wealth of the world.",
