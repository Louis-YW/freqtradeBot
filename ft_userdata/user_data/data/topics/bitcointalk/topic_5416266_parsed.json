Of course this is one of the good points for DC, if Binance and FTX list DC, it is not impossible that DC will become a rival to Doge and Shiba as memecoin.but we need to know that memecoin is memecoin, where the project is not clear in the future, so stay careful if you want to invest in memecoin.",

Doge second layer for doge coin was only selling the name of doge coin and no more than it. Dogecoin has nothing to do with Dogechain and they are separate projects where the Dogecoin founder rejected the Dogechain developer when the latter asked the cooperation of the former.  And even told the latter that using the Doge on its name is a bad idea.  But the Dogechain developer still used the name to confuse people.",

If the Dogecoin developers disapproves then there's no need for it to be highlighted just because they've attached the name of Doge after it. This is the same as BTC and ETH that's always being romanticized and used.",

Doge second layer for doge coin was only selling the name of doge coin and no more than it. Yeah, this is also the first impression when I heard about the name, probably just riding on the popularity of Doge. And then as what you have said, offering money for the real doge co founder, that smells something fishy and it look like it hit their reputation.So the people behind this project is simply riding on the popularity of Doge, nothing more than that. And for sur there are intelligent investors who knows it and would stir away from this project.",

I also started my bot with this trading pair then because it had a very high volatility and also a high volume.Afterwards i started to read about dogechain and found out the stuff that others in this thread have already mentioned. The dogecoin community is not supporting this project and the team behind dogechain is also kinda dubios and has done some shady stuff in the past. After i have read this i stopped my bot and now the price is already like 80 or 90% down from the ATH and i think it will continue to fall.",

I think that's the same with other layer 2 projects like matic, so it might be useful and beneficial for the doge coin. It's not really a shit project I guess?This is different from those who are literal shit projects and meme coins with no known use cases other than riding the hype and they also carry the name of the other more popular projects. They think it can give them an edge to be easily noticed by the public. Wrapped coins are not new. We have wrapped eth, wrapped btc and others but they are still the same coin so I think it won't differ to this one. Doge is still doge but they are only giving it more capabilities.",
