We have had many projects already go through consultation and many of them have had a lot of success! We really strive to bring education to the space and empower project leads with the knowledge they need to have a successful launch.- SINU's List: A simple featured list of some of the great SmartDeFi tokens that have a great vision and are working on real utility. You may notice a few familiar ones there-Roadmap:- SINU's Subs: Alert service for all SD tokens. Market alerts and baseline arbitrage. Accessible only by holding SINU. We are very close to finishing development of this service!- SINU Stake: Revolutionary staking idea that will change the perception of how you can earn rewards in crypto, only made possible by SmartDeFi. We've kept the details under wraps to avoid being front-run on the idea! Development will be in full swing after SINU Subs.- SINUX: SmartDeFi exchange. This will be an exchange for SD tokens only and will highlight some of the best projects in this space.- SINUversity: Educational archive for SmartDeFi, trading, and markets!- SINU sNFT & SINU Club in the metaverse: Down the road we will utilize sNFT technology when it is available (sNFT gives all the benefits of SmartDeFi to NFTs). The funds raised from the sNFT sales will go towards buying land in the metaverse for SINU holders to meet in. This is just for fun! We can host all our events there.Please feel free to ask any questions you may have!",
