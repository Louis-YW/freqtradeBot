      "body": "I've noticed that the prices on CMC have been pretty good, and the fully diluted market cap of $1,047,820,690 is pretty solid. from the initial listing price $17.6 and ATH in 2021 $490.. I personally see this, it is decent and good and the price is now $33.3.But, I still think MultiversX Coin has a short and not long track record, this can be seen from the listing date, which is in 2020 and my view is that it is still relatively new, having only been around for 3 years in the cryptocurrency market. Some investors may still be a bit hesitant to invest in projects that have not been tested from time to time.",
