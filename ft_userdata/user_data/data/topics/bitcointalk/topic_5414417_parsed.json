This question is about bitcoin block structure, not about mining.This means that * if you're a technical guy you should move the topic to Development & Technical Discussion; then you'll get good technically accurate answers. (this would be the best option imho, this looks like a technical question to me)* if you're a not so technical newbie, this may better go to Beginners & Help.Now, about your question, you may not have been looking for the right websites. And sources of information.One direct explanation come from https://learnmeabitcoin.com/ which is one very good source for learning:Quote from: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/block-hashYou get a Block Hash by hashing the block header through SHA256 twice.If you go to the source of this quote, you'll get more details.Related links:* https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/block-hash* https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/blocks* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm",
