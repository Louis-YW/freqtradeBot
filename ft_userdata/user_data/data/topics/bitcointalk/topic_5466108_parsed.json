  "content": "Hello BitcoinTalk community,I've encountered a perplexing issue with a recent transaction and I'm hoping to get some insights or assistance from the knowledgeable members here.**Background:**I executed a series of transactions directly from a node using this script: https://github.com/codeunsolved/brc20tool I've used this script multiple times in the past without any hitches.**Details:**- **BTC Payment Address:** `bc1p8welxq7lx55ane5nhcwfe00k6k6c9m5lty3crnvhwlnalykz2srqhm38zr`.Â  - **Transaction ID:** https://mempool.space/tx/369a184f3e941a501b99a2865f6c1db09f39af379ef8c63fb52689e37e3376a7On mempool, the transaction seems to have over 300 confirmations. However, decoding the HEX indicates 0 confirmations, suggesting it hasn't been included in any block. I attempted to mint SATS tokens 500 times in one go, but only 20 reached my address. The intermediary BTC was transferred correctly, but it seems there's a hiccup in the processing.**HEX Snippet:** ```Code:],\"block_height\": -1,\"block_index\": -1,\"confirmations\": 0,\"double_spend\": false,\"fees\": 367829,\"hash\": \"369a184f3e941a501b99a2865f6c1db09f39af379ef8c63fb52689e37e3376a7\",\"inputs\": [```**Ordinals Link:**https://ordinals.com/tx/369a184f3e941a501b99a2865f6c1db09f39af379ef8c63fb52689e37e3376a7Has anyone experienced something similar or can shed some light on what might be happening? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.",

Anyway, it seems to be outdated information.Looks like a result from Blockcypher's decode raw transaction page. (the shown json output part has striking similarity)And for some reason, they currently show 0-confirmation on every decoded transaction even if it's mined already.Here's for reference: live.blockcypher.com/btc/decodetx/Quote from: 216kedi on September 08, 2023, 12:20:05 PMHas anyone experienced something similar or can shed some light on what might be happening? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.As far as Bitcoin is concerned, the transaction is already sent and included in the blockchain,any missing ordinal token issue is Altcoin territory and most people here may be unable to help,you can try their forum or the Altcoins board for more fitting support.",
