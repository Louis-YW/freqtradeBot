  "content": "First, I would like to acknowledge and thank our senior comrades like igebotz, Cryptopreneurbrainboss, Charles-Tim and other established members for the good job you guys are doing in our local board, I want you to know that we don't take it for granted, we really do appreciate it. Following the creation of this board the numbers of new members have been on the rise which is good for us, but sadly the number of spams, low quality posts and creation of exiting topics have also increased and all advice/warnings so far have fallen on deaf ears.... Maybe it's time to start administrating some sorts of punishment because that's the only way we can achieve decorum. There are things that I'm seeing here lately that I don't like... Example is where a topic creator would create an exiting/similar topic, when his/her attention is drawn to it and asked to lock it...  And other board members would be commenting and defiling such instructions. And the reason for this is because they want their post to count so that they can stand a chance to be one of the winners of the monthly merit award. While we want this incentive to continue, we still do not want spams and the likes in our local board and one of the ways we can achieve this is:1. Automatically disqualify anyone known for always creating exiting topics and not taking advice/warning from the monthly merit award.2. Automatically disqualify persons posting after the OP attention has been drawn to such topics, i.e if the topic is not locked.Whoever is saddled with the responsibility of calculating the total post count can calculate the affected person(s) total post count for the month and write disqualify against the person's name so that such person(s) would be aware of his/her shortcomings and possibly learn. These are my suggestions and they are open for criticism and I also welcome suggestions from other concerned members on how to put these issues to bed.I don't know if the newbie welcome and orientation thread is the  appropriate place to post this or not, but I had to create a new topic hoping that many persons can see this and also contribute. I can lock this topic anytime if you don't welcome the aforementioned suggestions and think this topic should be locked. Thank you.",

      "body": "But just as it is on English board when I joined this forum, giving merit is basically about users quality posts. I do not know if the monthly merit giveaway is the reason for the topic spam or not, but I think merit should be about quality posts not quantity.Also there can be a competition for most quality posters monthly, it would be better. This can be a means that beginners may be able to know that quality is what we are after on this local board. We are no more looking for a local board now, what we need most are quality, constructive, meaningful, educational, informational and other helpful posts, not quantity in relation to spamming.",

I think it is one of the reasons for the spams, low quality posts and repetition of existing topics and like you said what we're looking for is quality and not quantity.Quote from: Charles-Tim on March 24, 2023, 12:31:53 PMAlso there can be a competition for most quality posters monthly, it would be better. This can be a means that beginners may be able to know that quality is what we are after on this local board. This is also nice, If we go with this we might be able to achieve some good results.",

      "body": "First i go like to thank you for pointing this out, i am sure when we see low quality posts it doesn't take too much to point them out unless you are not willing to read or you lack the knowledge to detect such act, the level of low quality posts have increased lately and as a matter of fact, not only newbies are involved in this, even established members with tons of merits are constantly putting out low quality, thoughtless post, just writing without putting many efforts to add anything to the discussion and the reason for this is not only the monthly merits award because that has not been in practice since it has not run coherently for 3 months.-Merit rewards were just introduced some were 3 months ago officially but in the last 1 month the reward has been postponed due to the increase in the levels of spam/low-quality posts on the board.-Note before the merit reward we have monthly commentary from our honourable uchengod21 who has constantly given us fun-filled analyses and commentaries on members' monthly activities in the local thread now the local board, this to me means more than the merit award.-Whether you top the chat as the user with the highest posts or not, as long as you post quality content, you will recieve merits regardless of the number of your posts.",

For the established members, I think it's because they want their post to count for the signature campaigns, but we can do better. To the newbies, please don't feel some persons are trying to be bossy or impulsive, please let's not feel bad when we are been corrected, it is for our own good. Someone once said to me, '....I love you so much that I don't want you to fail and I'll always tell you the truth'. The people that are ahead of us here could be likened to our big brothers and sis and they love us that they don't want us to make mistakes especially in other sections of the forum. Also, there are things we can learn from here that can be applicable in our daily lives. I believe we can learn and improve.",

But since its still a young and growing board, I just hope that we willl all get it right someday and maybe the spamming level will be reduced in our local board.",

      "body": "Having topics like this is one of the problems that we have on this board. What's the usefulness of this thread, if you want to discuss about the monthly reward, you can do that in the monthly chart thread, you don't need a new topics for that. Next you should know the monthly merit reward isn't a community project for you to think the organizers have to adjust to how you feel it should be ran. If we see it isn't getting productive, we end it at anytime. It's a personal project and if you want to discuss that go to the monthly chart thread not creating a new topic for that, that's just nonsense.Next we have discussed about the multiple similar thread creation and spams numerously so what's the use of bringing that up again, isn't that exactly what you're speaking against so what difference is your post from those creating similar or related threads? You can see we didn't get much election related topic as we did last month and that's because we created a thread to combat that. Instead of complaining always, do something to help the boards. You can reports the topics each time you see them and stop commenting on them too.",
