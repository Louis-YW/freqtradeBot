I find it absurd that many people keep bringing up the past to evaluate his present because he is not the only person who changed his opinion about bitcoin after spending time researching it. It is true that we still cannot confirm 100% that he is serious about crypto or not , but with him, we are getting more hopeful when compared to what the Biden administration is. I would bet on him over Biden in this election.",

      "body": "Trump currently seems very likely to win the US elections. Unless the Democrats come up with a very good replacement for Biden and manage to unite people around a figure that can appeal both to Democrats and to at least some Republicans, that is. His policy on cryptos has shifted, that much is true. But for now, it's still presidential campaign promises, nothing more. Also, the idea of creating cryptos in the US to counter the influence of China is not very pro-crypto because it's not a decentralization-driven approach and also since we don't need more altcoins. But perhaps the op is referring to the idea of Bitcoin being 'made in the USA', which is about being supportive of Bitcoin mining. In that case, it's good news for Bitcoin miners.",

Musk suddenly supports Trump, Jamie Dimon seems to be changing his stance because he can't be anti bitcoin when Trump is not and there's a career in politics awaiting Jamie if Trump wins... It's funny how the whole animal kingdom sees the alpha and runs from Biden to Trump. Musk, who used to vote for Democrats is a good example of this great shift. I don't care who wins, but if you're a US citizen, you should. Biden is a weak old man who won't survive a whole term if elected.",

All over CT, even solana meme tokens have been created for it. To top it up, there is an active prediction market on polymarket with Trump currently leading the market with 66% of people betting on Trump to win the elections. The reason why everyone is talking about and is still skeptical about Trump's U-turn to crypto is because his government weren't any friendlier than this Biden administration. It was still all duct-tape like kind of regulations with no clarity. Whether he would make good on his crypto promises remains to be seen. Personally, I have my fingers crossed.
