  "content": "I read a news recently about CBN dollar to naira exchange rate, that CBN has devalued naira from ₦465 to ₦630. Later it was said to be a rumour, but which many of us would have known as no changes in the parallel marker either. https://twitter.com/cenbank/status/1664195669484097536?s=20According to what I read later, it was reported that the rumour was as a result of what the recently elected president said about naira exchange unification and its importance.In Nigeria, we know that different institutions like banks have their own exchange rate which is close/similar in price with CBN rate but different from bank to bank. Banks foreign exchange may not be possible anymore because CBN itself discouraged it.CBN Ends Forex Sales To BanksI do not know how true that is but I have watch a video before about how Nigerians can not more exchange naira to foreign currencies again in bank. You can obtain a dollar card in bank but which you will be the one to fund it yourself, not with the help of the banks. Parallel market has its own price which is also different but what Nigerians are using because naira is more devalued in parallel market and of course it is what CBN will like. The recently elected president talked about naira exchange to foreign currencies unification, and the rumour of CBN rate of dollar to naira, to ₦630 per $1 was what that happened next. What do you people think would happen if the president make sure there is naira unification? Is it going to help Nigeria economy? We all know that if that is what would happen, CBN rate is going to become the parallel rate or there will be more decreasing of foreign reserves in Nigeria because we depend more on imports.",

I just see this as a strategy used by the politicians to siphon more money after devaluation they stockpile from looting and they find all possible mean to make the currency value to be little stable at their own benefit.  Secondly, Nigeria is a consuming nation,  we barely produce nor export anything rather than crude oil and gas. We depend on other countries for survival since we can not export but consume what others produce. so therefore, currency unification is no big deal anymore. Let us start producing and exporting.",

There's nothing like rumors about news once it has been aired, there's a likely possibilities that every rumour is the genuine and official leaked information we are getting clue on, i wouldn't be surprised seing this since the inauguration of the new administration in office, many things have begin to change starting from the removal of fuel subsidy in it entirety, yet the administration is claiming that it's not coming from their end, also the NNPC made this same declaration for a fix price on the market fuel pump price and every other institutions involved made the implementation and readjusted their selling price, of naira today enters a new official rate of #630 from the bank then the black market should be something close to #1,000 or more for one USD.",

There was a borrow course from social studies and there is a statement there that \"the real ruler of a country is unknown\". Fuel subsidy has been removed, na the di masses go suffer, then the masses go disembark to the president to reverse the price. Time is coming for that. Yesterday or today I also say di news that CBN has devalued Nigerian Naira from #465 to #630 per dollar, and in Nigeria these are the two major factors that control goods and services in the country so any thing that affect thses two elements affect all parts of the citizens. The naira devaluation news has not been verified because it is only on blogs and social media the news is escalating and has not shown in national TV news in Economy news . So that might be rumor but even though it is a rumour, the parallel market is still using their normal price of $700+ The problem in Nigeria is also cause by these parallel marketers. The naira unification will help the economy because when the economy is unified commodities will be sold equal rate with dollar because 1 dollar to 1 Naira so things might workout the way it has been planned.",

What I'm concerned about is if he can achieve such a feat because by calling for unification of exchange rate, there'd have to be proper planning, coordination and engagement with relevant bodies like the CBN. Lets hope that he achieves the task of unifying the naira so economic growth can be fostered and doesn't sidetracked.",

Although Tinubu has actually stated some of his campaign manifestos that he plans on the dollar unification which I strongly agree with, but there is yet to be a consensus or any order of such. This calculations of it been at 630 have been done by just economic analysts on social media.

The limitations set on the amount to be available for one person a day is one big factor coupled with the numerous hassle to get them from the bank. I feel if there is a monetary policy that guides how the dollar flows from the bank to the common citizen then the issue of black marketers will be minimized. Also the hoarding of this currency should be addressed because most of these traders hoard this currency till the bank runs out of it at a time and they hike there prices",

I am no economist but from the layman's point of view the multiple exchange rate really killed the economy. Unifying the exchange rate can have both advantages and disadvantages, depending on one's position in the market. If this truly works the advantage is that we are likely to see an increase in diaspora remittance, we may also see that an increase in portfolio investors because they know that they were coming in at a fixed yesterday and they know they will exit at that rate. On the other hand, the BDC guys may not profit much from this too. This may be off point but can we just abandon the dollar when doing imports. Say for example, use the yuan when importing from China. And only use if when importing from US? Is this possible?",

You should not get me wrong, the rumor is that CBN did not devalue naira, but the news about naira exchange unification is true. So naira exchange unification news is not fake.About some people that thinks this can help the economy, some analysts says it would have negative effect on Nigerian economy, saying only enough foreign exchange supply will make this likely. Also that exports, foreign reserves, importing and oil products needs to be addressed. https://independent.ng/exchange-rates-unification-will-crash-nigerias-economy/When I read this news, I think the analysts are very correct if true they make such conclusion.I'm not claiming that the news of Niara exchange unification is false; it's true that Ps Tinubu has a plan for it, and he has said it publicly several times. My problem is Daily Newspaper claiming that the Naira has been devalued, despite the fact that the government has yet to implement it. The President invited the CBN governor last week to brief him on the Naira redesign and the E-naira initiative, so the Naira excahnge will be unified but not right away.To be clear, the Naira exchange rate will not be unified under the present CBN governor; a new governor will be nominated soon.Well if that one na actually the case then e good because the president has already stricken emefiele of all his right as the CBN governor so the unification as you said would be possible now since the CBN will definitely need a new governor to handle all its economical affairs. Nigeria has suffered a lot from the hands of this so called CBN governor and I just wish the country would do something tangible about his case instead of just probing him and then letting him go of all his charges as usual.",

The former CNB Governor was solely responsible for Nigerians' plight. The unification of the Naira is a wise decision.From cases of corruption to embezzlement, he has a lot of questions to answer.",
