I want to know if its safe to keep your coins in staking instead of just holding them in a wallet when your ultimate plan is to hold for long term. You could easily earn a good percentage in staking compared to investing in banks that only give a low percentage annually. But the only problem is because these are centralized exchange or custodial wallets that offer this kind of staking bonuses, Most wallets crumble down when the market is down and probably will go bankrupt then you lose all of your stakes, even on other projects staking reward wasn't worth it, especially on the long term. I've lost a lot of money staking on many projects mostly it's better to profit quickly than invest it on staking since it's a scheme so that the platform will always have liquidity.Would probably trust Binance for staking since it offers a good reward for staking, it's a big exchange and probably the best cryptocurrency exchange out there to trade, but still, there is a possibility. It is still your decision if you're going to risk it but I do not recommend a centralized wallet or exchange for long-term investment.",

While staking the coin, you should be notified about the days you have to wait before you unstake the coin and before you can be able to send the coin. You have long term goal, you want to hold for maybe months or years, it would be better to stake the coin if that is the coin you want to hold.But you should be careful of many coins that you can stake, it is better to go for a coin that you can not stake but that have the potential to increase in price more than expected than to stake a shit coin that its price may continue to fall or remain almost stagnant at some prices without moving up higher.",

I want to know if its safe to keep your coins in staking instead of just holding them in a wallet when your ultimate plan is to hold for long term. Safest way is to hold it on a noncustodial wallet and just keep it. But if you are wondering about staking feature which is almost the same with holding but youll earn something then you should be aware of some restriction like what act said, staking have risk to lock your fund for certain time. But if you arent conservative there are features like on binance earn that are flexible to give you rewards but dont expect the rate to be higher than staking with locked on either dex or cex since its very flexible. But still higher than bank rates of course.The potential risk might be would be the price declination. But thats normal, but if you are holding the token or coin for long term, you shouldnt mind that.",

I have never been for staking coins. The mode of operation seems flawed to me if one can get extra coins from the amount of coins they lock up. In the short term, it has some economic profits by taking away coins from circulation and looking them up, reducing supply against demand, but long term it centralizes the coin as those with higher number of coins keep getting more. It also inflated the supply in the long term, which would eventually catch up with and possibly supercede demand.",

Holding your coin where you have 100% control over it is what's highly recommended and is the safest. My Bitcoin holdings and in wallet which I have control over it. I also buy specific coins or tokens for specific purposes. Their are coins that I bought, not because I just want to hold them, but because I want to stake them. I know it's actually not the safest, but it's just a risk I'm willing to take.I purchased a few BNB, of which I left some on my Binance exchange, and during any project launchpad that I find interesting, I use it to participate and get the token as a reward. Why few which I kept in my trust wallet I stake it their just to be making some few % which sometimes I see that's the earning is not even worth the risk.  But at the same time, I prefer it there over some staking platform that might wake up one day and start giving me excuses.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on March 20, 2023, 09:02:12 AM2. You can choose to stake on Binance exchange, if anything goes wrong they will pay you back, Binance exchange takes responsibility for any users funds that get lost or stolen, using damage funds. Any exchange offering BTC staking is just telling you to give them your coin for them to use and do business, and at the end of the agreed-upon period they will pay you back with interest. That looks like lending to me. I don't agree with this their statement. They always believe nothing will happen to users' funds, which is why they always take security seriously, but I don't agree that they will refund any users' funds that are stolen on their platform. This their statement sounds valid till we experience a similar FTX situation, which we don't pray for, then you will know that we can't take centralized exchanges' promises.",

The risk with staking is the future dilution, if the APR reward does not compensate for this then it does not worth it to stake your tokens. It is also easy to stake your tokens in a bear market because the price has already bottomed and can only go up than to be stupid to stake at the top of the bull market, so be careful",

Some staking procedures has this thing called terms. There are times tokens won't be allowed to be withdrawn or will just be locked for a period of time. Problem is, not all investors would engage to staking, meaning, tokens will continue circulating on a particular chain which could trigger changes with the market price. So if it happen that your funds are locked, and downtrend occurs, then you'll be left with no other choice but to endure and close your eyes from seeing the market turn red. Also, in most instances, after a period of staking, tokens are being sold in an instant in order to save oneself from lossesm Those who will sell last are the ones to suffer.",

I wouldn't recommend buying market-priced coins for staking, especially now that many altcoins have gone up a lot in value. Don't try to stake coins that promise you thousands of percent APY, no one will pay you that much or the project itself will turn out to be a scam.
