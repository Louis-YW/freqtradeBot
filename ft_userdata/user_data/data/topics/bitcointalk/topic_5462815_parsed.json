That's plausible, XRP might reach $1 with the good news circulatory it recently, knowing that Gemini has now re-listed it, it has given it another edge to make a move. This indeed will make a difference for those holding it in other exchanges. Will keep looking at the update to know my next trading line in action",

Or conversely as we have seen during their historic win against the SEC, the price really pump so hard that those who have been holding it for years and waiting for the final judgement could have sold out and get their profits.So the same here, if SEC appeal was positive then it will take away the gains before. This is how crypto reacts for every news. However, then again, if you really believed on this project, then you will hold on it and not sell short term or at least wait for the bull run next year. Best of luck!!.",

It's not like they could just go back in time. They made a mistake in attacking XRP because it's fighting back and didn't wave the white flag. Maybe they thought by what they did could take them down, but they are wrong.Now, it's XRP's time to gain back the reputation they had before, it may be slow but it will keep on going up with more demands coming.",

Projects should have learned from XRP case and they should avoid the points why SEC filled a suit case against XRP. SEC are doing their job this is why projects should learn the law to avoid being on the watchlist of SEC. Altcoins are targetted because there are various peojects that are built differently, SEC can easily find holes in those projects like SEC allegation against XRP as a security.",

It seems that SEC can't accept what happened last time and they are trying to sue XRP again? but I think it won't be effective anymore as before. The support of the people are going to be with XRP this time. That's great if Gemini is also among those exchanges who listed XRP. Even them didn't expected this latest rumor but I'm sure they will not be bothered with it. It's also great if they will give away 4k XRP in the form of a faucet.To be honest, I haven't saw or heard an XRP faucet before.
