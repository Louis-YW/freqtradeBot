Society expects them to be successful and even exceed their parent's wealth. When a rich kid misbehaves it is piblicized in all news outlets because they easily attract attention.  They are indeed supposed to do well because they have all they need to succeed. Good schools and financial support to start businesses and others. But life sometimes is don't work that way. I want to also point out that it is not all rich kids that are spoilt. Some of them were raised very well by their parents and are respectful, humble, and enterprising. I have a questions in mind to ask.Quote* why do some rich kids not realized that they are  spoiled??This is because they are badly raised. They are not aware they are misbehaving because the have been trained abnormally. When a child is given all he wants, that child will have the mentality that he can get what ever he wants at all costs. This will breed impatience and even criminal tendencies. Quote* Do you think rich kids become spoiled and impoverished when growing up??Like I said before it is not all rich kids that will become broke when they become mature. Some of them have grown to become successful. But the majority of rich kids will misbehave in the future because of a lack of home and business training. If the rich successfully teach their children about life and business they will succeed. But most of these rich folks don't have time for thier children because they are busy pursuing more riches. QuoteWhy do you always think that a rich man's kids are the split onesI am assuming OP that you wanted to ask \"Why do you always think that a rich man's kids are the spoilt ones?\". So you have to edit the title so that members can understand your topic.",

I usually tell people that kids are like clay in the hands of a potter, it's how you mould and shape them that they turn out. Some spoilt kids tend to feel others are beneath them and this is as result of either what they have been told or seen. Quote* Do you think rich kids become spoiled and impoverished when growing up??It's not all kids who come out from rich homes end up being spoiled or end up poor because sometimes, association and experience changes mentality and attitude.",

At some point, they'll be spoiled but they're still teaching life lessons so that their kids won't end up growing up naive and no knowledge in life survival.",

      "body": "Not all rich kids are f@#$ed up. Jay Bloom is a billionaire, and his son Sean was about to go on the Titan sub, but Sean had enough sense to say NO WAY. Sean then convinced his billionaire father not to go on the Titan.  But yes, billionaires should not give their kids any of their money. They should instead just donate it to the IRS to add insult to injury and to teach their kids a lesson. Kids need good nutrition, a safe environment (this also means that the kids should learn about safety, so they should be allowed to learn what it means to be safe), and a good education. I am sure I forgot something, but I cannot think of it at the moment. Oh. I just remembered. If one of the billionaire's kids knocks up a girl or gets knocked up, then it is alright if the billionaire pays for the costs of having a baby in order to have a Darwinistic advantage over others.",

Parental control is important in how children are raised by their parents and who they associate with in society. We live in a society where rich parents do not allow their children to interact with poor children, and some rich parents' children are the most pampered to let your child to interact with in many circumstances.Quote* Do you think rich kids become spoiled and impoverished when growing up??Yes, I believe so, and some of them are likely to be influenced by their peer groups with whom they associate. As a result, there is a need for child care and support sensitization for both children and also the parents in order to educate them the values and wrongs of society.",

If poor responsible parents absent themselves from their children's life, they will learn a lot of bad things. I share almost all your thoughts @Stepstowealth. Parents are expected to be there for their children. They should always be around to monitor their children so that they can be raised properly. Children are like clay, you mound them how you want them to be. But because of the current economic problems in most countries, parents are forced to work too much. Some women just have one-month maternity leave and they have to send their baby to creche to be raised by a stranger. Some children are raised by house help and school teachers. Some parents don't just want to stay with their children. They prefer to be active on social media than staying at home with their children, so they will send an underaged child to school. Nobody can take proper care of your children like you, young parents are not giving their children the right attention.",

I guess it can be tough to have a very successful Father as a kid because you are always in his shadow, being compared to him. Some rich people work so hard that their kids miss out on parental care so I guess it isn’t always great for them.",

People say so because rich kids are often showered with money by their parents and they learn that when they show wealth other kids get attracted to them, want to be around them.I remember when my friends (who weren't very rich, but had more money that the average) could bring a new game to school, or could invite a lot of people to a party. When I had a party, I had to pick 5 or 6 friends and invite them to my room, so we could play computer games together and eat pizza, but rich kids were getting the whole house. Their parents would go out and allow them to invite 20 people in and have food and drinks for everyone. This meant they immediately felt appreciated and envied. This constant envy often evolves into a feeling of false importance. Kids who grow up like this crave it when they're older. They want to keep showing off and receiving positive feedback for what they do, or they get angry.",

For sure being wealthy or being born into a  rich home is no offense but most parents of today has built an indirect/direct impression on their offspring that they can get anything they desire and also do what ever mischief they wish to do and getting away with it whereby neglecting the fact that they got so successful in life because of the kind of moral role their parents played in their upbringing.   Lemme extract an example from famous Christiano Ronaldo's way of training his son, he made sure the boy does waste his food in the name of remnant because during his time at the boy's age he wasn't privileged with such meals. To sum it all there was a  day he (Ronaldo)  took his son to his former residence, the neighbourhood where he grew up and the little boy was left with shock to discover where his father grew from and you will agree with me that such discovery will input in the young folk more sense of humility.    So as a parent whether rich or broke cub them (children) when you can still bear responsibility for their actions.",

There are some certain things you will not be exposed to. The includes such as clubbing and other kind of social activities which will have needed some money to sponsor them. And it is the rich kid that will have his money to sponsor this kind of activities and that is why they are the ones always into it. Did children of the poor will only be where they will have a good food to eat and shelter and not some other things which we have to make them spend more. That is why they are not much exposed.",

Being rich doesn't make kids to get spoilt or have bad conduct,  if parents are incapable of taking responsibility of giving their children the  best home training they will get spoilt. Their are so many kids from rich home who are well  trained  , very discipline. A poor kid from a discipline even have more chances of getting spoilt than a rich kid from a discipline home because environment is a big factor that influence children a lot. A kid brought up from a rural area can be so much influenced by his environment,  if the environment is a kind of place with  bad lifestyle the kid can turn into something else because of the kind of people in the environment. Children with bad parental up bringing has nothing to do wealth, rich parents who are discipline and that gives good parental training to their children, indeed it will be impacted in their life.",
