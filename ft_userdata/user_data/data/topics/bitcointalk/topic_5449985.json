The story will not be like this having bitcoin bought over 10 years ago.The questions \"Why me\" and \"Why not me\" are applicable to every sector of life. Regretting not starting an investment with Bitcoin over the past year because you consider your savings wasteful is really unwise to me. Would you have had these thoughts if Bitcoin were not to be as successful as it is today? Did you not also think of it the other way around, like the people who invested in some scam projects and lost all their retirement funds and all their life savings because they made the wrong investment choice? If you were in such a situation, your question could have been, \"Why you?\"But if the investment is to be favorable for others, which is not you, your question now will be, \"Why not me?\"What I am trying to say in essence is that you don't have to regret any action that you have taken in the past; concentrate on how you can make things work out with the opportunities that you have. Leaving regrets over the past will eventually make you take a harsh decision. Since you have decided to start buying and hodling some bitcoins, keep it up. And don't ever regret not buying from the beginning; if everyone bought Bitcoin back then at the very beginning, I don't even think most of us would be able to hold some pieces of it. Everything regarding the journey of Bitcoin contributes to where it is today.",

Learning that bitcoin started in 2009 and could not make a cent from it is another recent source of sorrowful thought these days when I read online about success stories of bitcoin investors.Just a simple question that it answer could help you relaxe a bit on yourself, as far back as 2009 when bitcoin was first lounched did you know about if?And even if you hard about it, do you have have the fiancials knowledge that could male you take the risk of investing in bitcoin back then?So if your answer to any of the above question (NO) it then means tou cant blame youself too much, there is no doubt that you have misssed out on the many profits that comes with early adoption of Bitcoin.But being too aggressive on bitcoin now that the price is relatevly high may be a bad idea and you need to apply caution while putting your money down to avoid buy at high price, so you need to buy low in other to.make a exceelent entry that could lesson your risk level.Quote from: Grasper on April 24, 2023, 11:15:54 AMThe recent reality makes me see it that investment is better than keeping money somewhere for a little interest.

And bitcoin has given us that great opportunity and there is no time that could be late to buy some Bitcoin, you can start accumulating today and in the next 3 years from now, you would have stashed enough Bitcoin that could aid your early retirement.",

      "body": "Everyone will certainly be biting their fingers now that bitcoin is finally that coin after missing out on the early days. But I tell you it is for the best sometimes for some people. How would you be feeling now had you invested in bitcoin but you lost it without proper knowledge of safeguarding it, since it was easier to get scammed or a wallet got hacked then. No need to worry but just appreciate that you have found out now which would still be early for some in the near future. Although aside bitcoin I would say you made a mistake of holding on a large fiat for retirement. Even before the knowledge bitcoin became widespread many people actually invested their retirement savings into ROI that had store of value. One of the most popular ways then/now is to open up a business that could bring even a little profit with this not much of a large amount will be in fiat. Regardless it still not bad to start with bitcoin but do not invest all of it in bitcoin and be expecting to make huge profits in future, although we all could agree that bitcoin would have a price in years to come. But there isn’t full certainty what period we will face during your retirement days and when you need your savings, as there still certain things that determines bitcoin price every time and not just the halving and it’s supply",

Many of them made various mistakes, because of which they lost their btc (= money). Forever. Therefore, the past should not make you unhappy. It's not a fact that you would have been able to keep btc all these years. Take it philosophically: you learned about BTC and encountered BTC when you were ready for it. Not earlier and not later.Exactly. Such phenomenal profitability from bitcoin, as it was in the initial periods, will certainly not be. You shouldn't be sad about this. With btc you can increase your wealth even now - thanks to high volatility and high returns.Those who are looking for opportunities will definitely find it.",

Banks are only there to use your savings for their own personal business to generate incomes for themselves and at the end they give you peanuts as interest for using your money,without your concept.Bitcoin investment is resistance to inflation,unlike fiat currency and the government wouldn't want to accept this fact because it wasn't their creation. So many people have regretted keeping huge amount of money in banks for a long period of time because inflation has devalued their savings. You shouldn't see bitcoin as a get rich quick project,but see it as a store of value to secure your funds. So that you don't get worried about the fluctuations in it's price.

The story will not be like this having bitcoin bought over 10 years ago.In my opinion, investing can be a powerful tool for growing your wealth and potentially countering the negative effects of inflation meaning that by investing your money you have the potential to earn greater returns than you would receive simply by keeping it in a savings account with low interest rates. .Moreover, the reality of today's financial world is that investments, including Bitcoin, have experienced substantial growth over the last decade. While it is not possible to go back in time and invest in Bitcoin 10 years ago I think there are still opportunities for growth and profit in today's market.Because of this, it's important to approach investing carefully with a long-term mindset. No investment is guaranteed, and it's important to research thoroughly and understand the risks and benefits of each opportunity before making a decision.Quote from: Grasper on April 24, 2023, 11:15:54 AMThis is not going down with me, it is me that will not let it break me.

There is a strong motivation I see and it is very normal to feel frustrated when things don't go according to plan but this is where the stepping stone begins, To take control of the situation and use it as motivation to make positive changes and if there is a plan Delay is not denial.",

Back in my fathers time if you had college degree you could get a comfortable job that can pay for a house and a car every 5 years, that was the reality. Imagine how much money you would have to make per year in order to buy a house with 10 year mortgage and renew your car every 5 years in today's world. People are having trouble surviving let alone buy those things and those are the big costs, we still have surviving issue these days let alone any of those things. So all in all do not compare yourself with people who started working even before you were born, its not going to be fair. Compare yourself to people at around your age, however old you are, compare yourself to people who are 5 years younger and 5 years older, that would be the generation you need to look at and if you are dine \"fine\" there, then its ok. You don't have to be best there, you don't have to be the greatest, you just need to be fine enough and that's all you need to care about.
