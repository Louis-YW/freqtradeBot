      "body": "Ruiz sometimes will surprise the audience with his fast KO punch. He made it not just once so it's possible. Although out of shape, he does wilder swings that KOed hitters. The last 3 fights of Ruiz are not as impressive however I'd say 50/50, his fight with Ortiz was a UD. Wilder was given the shot against Fury because there is anticipation. He easily beat Helenius in the first round.",

I'll definitely go for Wilder judging from his physique I think he has more chance of winning than the Ruiz guy. And also Ruiz has won more than 37% of his matches by decision and the remaining 63% by KO meanwhile Wilder has won close to 98% of his matches by KO.I doubt if Ruiz will stand a chance with Wilder but let's see how the match will turn out to be. Who knows if Ruiz will have some trick up his sleeves that might help him win the match.",

It’s like a rubber that can deflect punch with minimal damage received only. The only weakness of this kind of fighter is typically the glass chin but since this is heavy weight, Fight usually happened very quickly and anyone can be kissing the canvass with one solid punch so the body build is not that much being consider on this weight class.Besides Tyson Fury has this kind of build too that is not muscular type yet he beat so many fighter with muscular body build. My money will go to Ruiz because he is pretty impressive and already proved himself when beat Ortiz",

In the rematch, Joshua beat him and then he start from the beginning again. Here' he has a big chance to upset Wilder and make some noise in the boxing industry, who knows after this fight, he might be able to be given a chance to challenge the gypsy King.

Until no other boxer would beat Wilder except Fury, I believe he is next to the best, even compared to the other champion in the heavyweight division. Oleksandr Usyk vs WilderJoshua vs WilderThat's the kind of fight that I think more challenging to Wilder than this one.",

Ruiz does have that power and good in technical but not something good when it comes to defense just like you do said.Just like the rest been saying that about KO decision then it would be likely to happen.",
