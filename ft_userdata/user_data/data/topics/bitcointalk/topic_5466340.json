But when I gain knowledge to some level where I notice I can also earn from the forum, why then do I have to be given attention to other places looking for green pasture when I can get it here? So going back to your question, I'm here to gain knowledge and experience and also make some cool earnings. It won't be complete if I don't add the earnings aspect, because that will be me lying to myself.",

I've always had a keen interest in technology, leading me to acquire various technological skills such as UI/UX design and development. However, at a certain point in time, when Satoshi introduced blockchain technology and people started embracing this new phenomenon, I became curious. I felt the need to immerse myself in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency that pioneered it, which is no other than Bitcoin.",

Newbies have been reprimanded a lot for asking questions about how to earn and start bounties, so I think you saying you’re here to learn and acquire knowledge about bitcoin sounds like you’re only trying be politically correct and win favour from the community. Bitcointalk has its advantages and there is no crypto forum or community that comes close to what’s being achieved here.",

I am still learning, and at the same time investing in bitcoin which wasn't part of my agenda when i joined the forum,but if one have the knowlegde of bitcoin without having the experience of owning bitcion,your knowledge isn't complete yet. Earning from the forum is something that i have also benefited from because it was when I registered and was consistent with the forum that i understood that one can earn from signature campaign,I must say it signature campaign has really helped me finacially.",

Apart from to gain knowledge on Bitcoin, interact with like-minded enthusiast and earning, what others respond are you expecting to get and when you do get those respond what do you intend to do with them. I believe I talk for other when I say we careless about the reason why others joined the forum but since we all have found ourselves here we have to work together in making to the forum conducive for productive discussion. Quote from: Perfectbaby on September 10, 2023, 07:06:31 PMI do find this platforms helpful as it focuses on information that gives a full interpretation of bitcoin utilizations.Is this thread of yours doing just that? I guess not and that's why this thread isn't that necessary. This is the beginners and help board, so create useful threads that'll be of help to those browsing through the board. If you find the platform helpful then you owe it to others to also make the platform to be helpful to them by contributing positively to the forum and the best way to do that is to always drop quality threads, replies etc.",

Obviously this is a discussion forum for Bitcoin and other whatnots, and if you have any interest whatsoever in Bitcoin you would find your way to register here. Quite a lot of people register just to ask questions and seek solution to some Bitcoin related problems that they have, and after that they don't log in again.Having said that, signature campaigns help to maintain the forum's traffic and keep so many of the users active, thus they earn from their contributions to discussions that take place on the forum, and it is a win-win.",

Whether it's banned or legalized in their country. Learning is the aim of the forum, that is why what you wish to learn in this thread isn't relevant to your stay here. The answers will always revolve around learning. So, the right method to learn here is to read and share what you've read in the forum. It'll help enlarge your horizon on that specific subject, as many views will be contributed, which boost the understanding of any topic about bitcoin. Therefore, creating value to you and other readers in the forum. Some ranked members will also need to refresh their memories on that topic or subject. In a nutshell, knowledgeable threads will fetch you important resources to further read or study bitcoin.",

Because I could easily ask it if there is something that I didn't know I mean yes you could just do research about it but there are some that you can't really find on research accurately something like instructions or you are just new to a Bitcoin wallet and then you want some suggestion or can you do something like this on your Bitcoin or something like that on your wallet, members here are going to suggest you because they already have a lot of experience about that. That is just when I find this forum really useful. At the same time, one of the reasons I was really motivated to post on my account was because there are some bounties or signature campaigns available that you could probably earn a decent amount of money, for sure you are kinda familiar with bounties, and not every time you could be lucky and earn on that project since there are a lot of them that is just a big scam. learning and earning at the same time was just great, I mean you dont really need anything here in the forum you dont need to post you could just post if you need some help or you could help them as well if you experience there questions you want to put some suggestions.",
