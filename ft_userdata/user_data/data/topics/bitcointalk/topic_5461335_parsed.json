People invest for different purposes so those who sold might be aiming to cash out on short time, some more projects will rise with bitcoin.I think this is the reason why we should stick to Bitcoin. All the other altcoins are just not that good for long-term investment plans. People are still making profits out of it no doubt. But one's profit is another's loss, right? That's how the whole market works. But if you wait long enough and which you invest in is capable of providing the return that you expect. The short time price impact like this won't matter that much. Nowadays, new altcoins are not what it was back in the day. All we see now are scams or not worthy. They are either a part of a pump-and-dump scheme or their promises are all fake and unable to provide what they have promised. It is so hard to find a legit one these days. That's why people always choose altcoins for short-term gain. Follow the trend, buy low, and sell as soon as it reaches its peak. Because once it reaches that level, people will sell and it is unlikely to reach that level again. I left altcoins investment many years ago. Now all I focus on is Bitcoin.",

We need to do thorough research, grasp the market, and invest wisely. We shouldn't think of Binance listing as a guarantee for profits all the time. Some projects may do well there, while others may not. We should analyze each project carefully and then make our investments accordingly.",

Since it was a Binance Launchpad project, the launchpad investors were expected to receive it once listed on Binance, and many of them were likely to sell it. Consequently, the exchanges that listed it early were more likely to experience substantial gains, which indeed came to pass",

This is not the first time I have seen this, especially after a coin has been listed on several exchanges and then later got listed on Binance, you will see price drop.

It is more risky if they wait for higher prices and many times they will miss chance to take profit.Nothing is bad when you take profit and exit. It's only bad if you are too greed and wait for higher highs, higher highs and miss all of them, eventually exit with a draw or very minor profit or worse with loss.Trading with new listed coins is very risky and I don't recommend newbies to touch those newborn and recently listed coins. If you bought them from seed rounds, received from airdrops, let's only wait for good price to take profit. Don't use your own capital to buy those tokens if it has been listed for about 6 to 9 months.",

Which already increases the price by multiple folds, this way, the tokens becomes overbought and when the actual listing occurs, the price plummets. So, it's not a good strategy to buy an already increasing token and the general public always would be late to the party as internal people certainly leaks the info prior to listing to their group of people.",
