If I may ask,why do people always want to  create chaox in the society during politics?Greed and uncontrollable hunger for power is the reason why some politicians would do anything to grab political power. They don't care how many people loose their lives or the level of destruction their actions or inaction might bring because they are power drunk. Apart from Donald Trump and few other most politicians in Western Europe and the US are matured enough to accept defeat and relinquish power. Some of them even resign if they perceive that they have lost the confidence of the people. But my continent has the highest number of greedy politicians that are always desperate to grab or retain power by all means. You would hardly hear that an African politician resigned from political office. The hold tight to power as if it is their personal property. But the greatest politician in my locality is Nelson Mandela, who even when he was persuaded to remain in power, decided to serve for just one term. The war in Ethiopia, Sudan and Eritrea has the same undertone; political ambition of greedy politicians.But sometimes I blame the masses for supporting these politicians in their quest to destroy the country. Politicians always use tribal and religious sentiments to brainwash the people and instigate against their own fellow countrymen. These politicians pretend as if they a fighting for the rights of the people while they are merely fighting for their personal ambition or bank accounts.",

Humans always want treasure, throne. if there is wealth, definitely want a high position. and only some people can control their lust.excessive passion can destroy everything. therefore, we must not be too greedy and must live this life with gratitude. control your greed and always guard yourself from bad traits.",

This politicians are not the one doing the dirties themselves,neither their children but they pay the youths to carry out these havocs. They also use some corrupt policemen to backup the youths.Let's look at it this way,if the politicians go to the youths to help them out in their political atrocities,and they refuse will the politicians force them ? No, because it is impossible for you to go against your wish. The politicians will be disappointed and will have no choice than to accept his fate in the election. The problem lies with the youths let them not also be corrupt and greedy like the politicians. The painful thing of it all is that after elections,politicians abandon these youths back to the streets or sometimes jail them,if the youths are not scared of them.",

I think as humans we have this inherent need to always satisfy ourselves and we can go out of the norms and moral ways just to achieve it. In the case of politics, it's quite a norm for humans to make enemies as they go about their various ambitions of climbing the ladder so I'm not surprised that it could eventually lead to a war.",

If these people get into politics, they use their widespread influence to trigger chaotic situations on a larger scale. It is just unfortunate that these people are empowered further by their political positions and have sufficient money to finance their propaganda's and influence people with it.",

      "body": "In this post, I just want to highlight about the war. and there is a definition of war by experts. The existing definition continues to  change in line with the times that bring new forms of conflict between countries. I remember one of the figures who is famous for his writings about war, Clausewitz is a figure from the 18th century so that his works such as \"On War\", refer to what happened in his time.  Clausewitz views that war always has an objective.no one starting a war or rather no one starting a war with common sense should do so without first having it clear in his mind what he wants to achieve in that war and how he is going to do it. to achieve what they want, war is often the way they choose \"politicians, or a country\". According to Clausewitz, war is an act of violence intended to force the opponent to do what we want. violence that occurs in war, is not the main goal for the state. Countries do not go to war just for the sake of destroying opponents, but have other goals. so, war is nothing but a tool used to paralyze the enemy. Putting the opponent in a position of pressure is the ultimate goal of war because under these conditions, the state can enforce the importance it wants.well, so in essence the occurrence of all the conflicts that exist on this earth is an interest of a group or country.",
