The most relevant answer for your question. https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-max-supply-of-Gala-cryptocurrencyThere's was a small note for that as coinmarketcap was also erasing the maximum supply like another site. That means if the maximum supply is still remain unknown and it may have unlimited supply. The circulaying supply will be going up as more and more new tokens will be unlocked. You must have learned a lot from SLP and how it has become a shitty token with no value due to the hyper inflation and no maximum supply.",

If the order is achieved, the price will increase regardless of the final price that the currency will reach.But in general, if the currency has an infinite supply, it is not good for long-term investment, unless you are confident that the demand will continue to grow.If the quantity supplied for that currency increases in a clear and specific way, and there is no way for developers to suddenly add millions of them, then the final supply will not affect the price in the medium and short term.",

Does it make sense to invest in a project with none fixed max supply? Supply is not the deciding factor for the success or failure of the project. It is true that bitcoin has a limited supply and it becomes more expensive when the supply is limited, but bitcoin is a special case. Look at Ethereum, it has no supply but is still growing and continues to be strong today. The coin is good or not depends on each use case, the utility it brings to the user.",

(I made that mistake with FARM)Some projects have a low supply, which is better for investors but may affect the long term viability of the project. Projects like XRP and CNDL have settled for 100 billion, and that seems to be a good number for blockchain projects because the low initial price per coin makes it very attractive to investors.",

Its case to case basis actually how the economy of such project would affect it. I agree, that not all projects are created equal and we cannot make a general statement, it all boils down to use case and platform, I have seen projects with massive supply and ended up burning their supply because they cannot keep up with use case, you cannot compare Eth to a gaming project which hardly can keep up with the competition.So it's better to check on the project you're investing in and check if the use case, platform, and community can keep up with the supply.",

Yeah, you are very correct, investors don't seem to have a problem buying and holding eth for long-term profit despite its infinite supply, and I still wonder how eth manage to rose to this amount with such a huge supply, I get eth has a lot of user base with high demand but does that enough for the price to be this high?No doubt eth ecosystem is very large but now there are similar blockchains offering something close to what eth is providing to the blockchain community. Hence the demand is less than what it used to be but that didn't really affect the price if not for the current bear market.",

Regardless of what you ask, basically the coin game has a lot of high competitors. The hype over the same concept and inconsistent profits made the hype temporary and then early-entry investors walked away with all the profits. Only a handful of investors do not know when the time is right for CL.",

A good thing to look forward actually.

Now, what benefit is there to limiting the number of coins? There will be less probability that the currency will lose its value, and it also allows the project to have a potential target value. So if you invest in a coin with no supply, the only way that it can increase is based on demand. Thats why most altcoin tend to just increase upwards with no plan or goal (speculation).",
