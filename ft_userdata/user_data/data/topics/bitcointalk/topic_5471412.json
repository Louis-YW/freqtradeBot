Well, this should be an indication that next bull market will be bigger than we thought because a lot of fundamentals are lined up to happen the same time. We have Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin ETF and the global political and economic situation that has create so much uncertainties in the conventional payment system, all are positive news for Bitcoin. Many people might resort to Bitcoin as a hedge. The future truly look bright for Bitcoin",

The information that could have come from somebody inside the inner circle at the SEC might have been somehow misinterpreted, but the point could have been that certain spot ETF applications such as BlackRock's are already as good as approved. I was actually a little curious why the price didn't fall when the supposed fake news was finally clarified by BlackRock itself. I was expecting that the price would go back to $26,000 after that clarification. I was surprised it didn't. There must have been something. A little update, the price is now almost at $35,000, a 15%-increase in 24 hours.",

After the boredom of these months it is time for some fun. If the ETF spot is finally approved, there will be days of great joy ahead, but I still don't believe in phantasmagoric predictions.

Will a Bitcoin spot ETF be certainly approved soon that insiders have already relayed to their bosses the good news and the accumulation has secretly grown stronger? I do believe this could be on the horizon, particularly in the lead-up to the SEC's decision regarding the Bitcoin ETF. Such occurrences are quite routine and tend to accumulate nicely, considering that there's still plenty of time for Bitcoin to rebound if the initial announcement isn't favorable. Even in the event of rejection, Bitcoin is likely to persist and progress until it gains ultimate acceptance. There's a substantial number of advocates striving to legitimize Bitcoin as an official investment instrument recognized by the SEC.Now, what if, following this steep ascent, a bearish trend ensues? I'm confident that Bitcoin's halving will be poised to propel it once more, ensuring that no one incurs losses due to ill-timed purchases. For the time being, my optimism for Bitcoin endures, and I'm closely monitoring it for my designated target price.",

It's not just you or I who are surprised and amazed at what's happening. Everyone just hopes that bitcoin will increase, but no one will know or dare to confirm that bitcoin will increase to $35k like it is now. It was a real surprise to all of us and it showed once again that bitcoin is unpredictable, and we don't have anyone who is an expert in this industry. The only thing we can do is DCA whenever possible and trust BTC, it won't let us down.",

The only thing that we can look is Bitcoin's past history as far as October goes. And with that it seems that we are very bullish right now. Specially with the biggest news about the imminent Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved as it was already listed by Nasdaq.So maybe those who is good at technical analysis might see or not see this kind of bullish movement. And it could really fit on the narrative that at the end of the year, we might see at least $40,000-$50,000. So everything is falling right now as compare to last year wherein we have seen the lowest low around November. But this year it will be very different.",

We knew there was a high chance it might be approved because blackrock usually gets all their applications approved with almost 100% approval rating. Right now everybody is buying because they know that these spot etfs will need to buy physical bitcoins for their etf and they need to buy it on spot. With the small amount on exchanges it causes these huge spikes due to high demand and low supply.",

To me nobody had any clue that this was going to happen, like is always going to be a surprise for both investors and traders, seeing Bitcoin price at $29k in the night and the next morning boom it has bumped to $30k the next morning up to $34k, like what's happening? Is only October that has a better explanation to this, and we should expect BTC to continue increasing it's pace to $40k-49$k, because that's the next price.I said it that October is a very promising month and we should look out for it, those who talk more about next year that that's when we'll see a better and bumpy price, well here it is, the price can't stop getting better at the moment I also said it HERE we should expect it getting to $35k-$39k before we exit October.",

I was shocked by my BTC balance increasing in value.Will the series of ETFs that are still on the SEC hearing schedule also be approved in the future? If this happens Bitcoin will have a new history, really positive news. If Trend continues $43K it may be until end of october (my hope)The Nasdaq is a great place to attract FOMO 😅",

Nobody expected for this to happen, but I believe that some of the short term holders already sold some of their holdings to take profit already. While others are getting FOMO'ed, and buying the top, there are some who are selling at the top, then wait for the price to go down again because that's what happens all the time. I did a quick research, and the reason why that pump happen is traders are very optimistic that a Bitcoin ETF will be accepted. Maybe let's also add the fact that the ticker symbol for Blackrock ETF is listed. That's a good sign already, but like what I always think, nobody is assured until it's from the SEC themselves, and since SEC is still silent about this, I believe that it's just a hype because the market is becoming boring already, and nothing's happening.",

Will a Bitcoin spot ETF be certainly approved soon that insiders have already relayed to their bosses the good news and the accumulation has secretly grown stronger? The market is now pricing in a possible ETF approval. After last week's fake news, it became clear that everyone, including the big players, had been waiting on the sidelines. Therefore, in order not to be caught in the reverse position in the same way with the real news, everyone has been slowly taking their positions for a week. In this situation, it is very risky to stay in a net short position.ETF approval could come at any time and when it does, no one will want to stay short. In this case, it would make sense to slowly collect bitcoins in a spot position. But there are also signs that things could go the other way. Total cap 1.25T, fib 382. Total2 has reached its weekly resistance of 588k. Total3 is at the top of the downtrend since August 2022. I would say bullish if Btc maintains above $34,592 at the end of the month. We have reached the critical point now and we should act carefully.",

Larry Fink has been on TV saying crypto is a flight to safety and quality and much more. I believe bitcoin could rally to 40K in a retracement move, not going to new all time highs similar to what it did in 2019. Because, it never goes up in a straight line. It's a roller coaster ride, and right now it's rallying very hard. Some may say we're going to new all time highs. I am standing on the fence here. Historically, that is not how bitcoin has played out. I may be wrong, though, if bitcoin goes to new all time highs in the next few months into the having, we all will be happy.",
