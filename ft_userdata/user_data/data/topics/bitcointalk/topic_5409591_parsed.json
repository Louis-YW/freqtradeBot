If it is expensive or unprofitable, look for other opportunities to earn money.",

I understand that crypto mining can be addictive at times but bro if you aren't making enough money from it look for another way, mining 12hrs per day sucks, remember 360 days make a year and you will end up earning a year worth of rewards in two years. Not good, for me at least but the decision is yours .",

Basically peak period which is usually in the afternoon and evening has the most expensive rate than say in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night it’s usually very little demand so his bill is cheaper.There are scripts you can use which can automatically start and stop mining during certain hours. However with ETH going POS you really are better off selling the rig if you can get a good price.",

Do you have cheap electricity? What’s your hashrate? What’s your rig’s  ROI?I personally don’t like to waste time with mining. Holding the coin brings less headaches. Your mining devices will need maintenance and they’ll get broken sometimes. You don’t need to deal with this shit when you are a holder.",
