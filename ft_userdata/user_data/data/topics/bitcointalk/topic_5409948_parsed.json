      "body": "Privacy coins like Monero or Zcash have their own niche and will be here to stay. The usability and functionality without regard to price are essential for some people, but not the mainstream. So, if you are purely looking to increase your networth, I'm afraid choosing the privacy coin is a bad choice.Even let's say a cryptocurrency that is not focused on privacy is also getting scrutiny from a centralized entity. So there is no doubt, that privacy coins are more prone to get regulated and watched.",

Is this something to worry about? Or notIt must be said that today privacy coins are being targeted by the government for being involved in terrorist activities, money laundering...What is your original purpose in holding these privacy coins?, are you holding them for a certain privacy or for profit. As for privacy, just being anonymous with bitcoin is enough so you don't have to worry about government tracking. If you are aiming for profit then you better sell them and invest in other coins. Today, privacy coins seem to be used for only a few purposes and there is little hype so it will be hard to make a profit.",

Is this something to worry about? Or notFirst of all what exactly is your reason on investing with privacy coin. Is it because you valued the privacy the most or you are just expecting  to have a lot of profit for believing privacy coin will be boom someday?Privacy is the number one coin affected when the regulators step in to regulate crypto because they are the opposite on what’s the government stand so if you want an investment token only then you should find other project that focus on making money since privacy coins are meant for untraced transaction not for investment purposes.",

Is this something to worry about? Or notIt's hard for the government authorities to bring down privacy coins. They can create n number of regulations but they will always stay around because a certain group of people will keep on using it. Privacy coins are meant for a niche users and they will keep on using it. But yes, these coins will always have attacks from the regulatory authorities because they can't track the transactions made using these coins. But as an investment, these coins are not great because the utility is very specific.",

Is this something to worry about? Or notIf you're worried, you better dispatch all of those and turn them into a good one that has no red flags by the government. We can't blame you for being worried because your money is on it and we can't do anything against the government if they keep on attacking and flagging down privacy coins.Most likely the flagging down will only be on the exchanges until no one has the way to sell them off there but only through p2p trades. But remember that we're on crypto, the governments can only regulate and manage to enter the exchanges but not the entire circulation and economy that it has, still depends on the privacy coin you hold.",

In the grand scheme of things, these coins are left out since they offer little return on investments, and that they are hugely a target of  the governments, making the buyers of these coins uneasy as if someone is always on the lookout for them. Also, there isn't that much of a market on privacy coins save for a few percentage on the total crypto market. Investment wise, this isn't really the best option to put your money on. But if you're just looking to make a transaction super discreet and you're looking to do it only once, privacy coins are for you (because apparently crypto mixers have become a huge target for the government when compared to privacy coins.)",

You are wrong on that. The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent and they have platforms like Chainalysis that can trace transactions over the network. They're still not okay with the use of mixers but they are not bothered with normal on-chain transactions anymore.Monero continues to be the an eyesore to Government regulators because it remains untraceable.

Or noti dont this so , privacy coins will be very usefull if we look current geo political condition , while government trying banned cryptocurrency or regulate it , our assets will easily hidden by this coin. government may regulate our cryptocurrency but as long as they didnt track it it will secure for us. in future privacy coins will be new trend again , since alot war potency in our world.",

I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but it's clear you made the wrong choice. unfortunately the future is KYC, there's nothing you or I can do to make sure we don't have KYC, all we can do is respect KYC. look at the whole system: bank - exchange - wallet that is: the person creates a bank account, the person puts money in the bank, the person creates an exchange account and the person buys bitcoin on the exchange with the money from the bank account, all this was KYC is required and then the bitcoin arrives in the wallet. then the person wants to pay water in their country, so that person sends bitcoin from the wallet to the exchange where they made KYC and then withdraws to the bank where they made KYC. so it's clear that the future will be KYCQuote from: S3300 on August 15, 2022, 01:59:05 PMIs this something to worry about? Or notOf course you need to worry, because in the long run your coins won't increase in price much, because KYC won't disappear, governments won't change their mind, on the contrary they will be tougher with these anonymity altcoins",

Is this something to worry about? Or notDon't after them as they are not profitable. Their market price is quite moving down and even during the bull season, these privacy coins had never grown that much, in fact, whales have no interest in them for they are not worth enough if we talk about investment. Not really a bad choice but for some reason, this is not a smart choice either. You'll just be keeping coins like collectibles and the value is eventually declining and prone to be regulated by the government. For me, it was still best to consider the top coins in the CMC, or you can just have BTC only if you want.",

I used to just think this coin has a slow trend because the privacy part of the coin doesn't have the hype like utility coins. but with various government regulations also making privacy coins very difficult to move around, it would be better to choose to invest in coins that are high hype or have good utility.it is not against the government but because it is so private it becomes the target of the legislature, privacy coins are very easy to be used by criminals, privacy has become both the pros and cons of these coinsmost privacy coins like monero are old generation coins so the hype is almost gone, holding them is very difficult to make a profit, i think op should sell them and move on to newer potential coin investments",
