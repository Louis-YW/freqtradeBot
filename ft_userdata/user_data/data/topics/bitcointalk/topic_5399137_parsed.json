      "body": "Naturally everyone tends to take care of themselves first before looking out others and make their lives better. Nowadays the survival becomes harder so they have no time to care for others than their family members probably in future the condition will become worse and we may only save us from hurdles of life. However we didn't make the life of others we should not make the life of others worse in that sense I don't make anyone's life worse which itself is missing in this profit making world.",

      "body": "It is very easy to blame other and not take responsibility for our actions. It is also very easy to just want them to change for the better. But the thing is the only person we can really change is ourselves. As for blaming authorities I think it's fair game since they are supposed to do a job. If I own a restaurant and I'm not getting enough customers than maybe I have myself to blame and need to make changes. If however I was doing fine and then now not getting customers coz the road leading to my spot is being dismantled and and is delayed for more than a month, then I think it's right for me to blame them for my loss. Sure I can't do anything about the road and can only change what I can (focus on deliveries rather than dine-in), I could be forgiven for being pissed off.",

The process of change starts when we make our selves better human being who is kind, cooperative, compassionate and helps those who really need support to make their lives better. The world is passing through very difficult times due to regional conflicts, wars and COVID-19 pandemic which has created economic crisis world wide, we need to raise our voice and press upon our Political leaderships to do something to address these issues to reduce  the difficulties people are facing to survive.",

We first need to change our mentality and how we react and response to certain circumstances because whatever we do has adverse effect on the whole world starting from our home nation. If we can all have a positive mindset to all happenings that affect our life and look for solutions to it, it will be better. As to what we do or say have its effect on the leaders ruling us. The world will be a better place if we all are positively minded in all affairs.",

For anybody to succeed at this task, you need to have a positive mindset, try to ensure you are not living pretentiously and being judgemental all the time, be a solution bringer too. It is also important to follow peace with as many as we come in contact with and try to be law abiding even when the people we find ourselves around are not.

EG England has been more welcoming to Ukrainians with passports compared to syrians without passports. even when both countries had to leave due to war.its not about apathy, empathy or sympathy. its about politics.england will turn away undocumented immigrants even if their lives are at risk on the open sea between calais/dover.. yet those with a passport get a train/flight into england funded by UK government. I as a british person can go to america without even a second look and just stay..but a mexican without a passport cant just get on a plane the way i can. and cannot just walk around like a tourist, freely.",
