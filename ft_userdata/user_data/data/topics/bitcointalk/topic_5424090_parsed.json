But this is not easy you need to have a good strategy, cards, and knowledge to be able to win in the tournament there are many smart players there but if you have good skills then you can win the game.Sometimes the game tournament rewards are around $1,000 in Dec.",

      "body": "I'm sure if I ever find such game I wouldn't tell to anyone since it's where I will make large amount money in short time without need to deposit large amount lol. If I tell it to people, it will make me harder to maximize my profit since I need to share with the other players, more player will play the more difficult to get money. I remember Axie Infinity isn't a hard game before the hype, but during the hype the difficulty increase from 10 to 100. But the thing is there's no such thing anymore, all P2E and NFT games are worthless.",

The rest of us that are discouraged to try will probably regret it.They're literally cheap and peanuts today but even with that, many players have already addressed that they're out and totally gone from it. Because if it's no longer profitable, why stay? It will be a total waste of money, from the little amount that they'll use to buy still, it's not worth it.Yeah, unless the market for that game and the others booms again, there will be a lot of come backers to this game and willing to invest and lose money again.Quote from: bittraffic on December 02, 2022, 02:11:56 PMWhat about Alien Worlds in WAX?
