On like the smaller projects that have no track record and are based on hypes this can be best taken for shirt terms speculations alone since most times their market depends solely on the market of the other bigger coins,  and that is the reason why sometimes you see that whenever there is Bitcoin bull market other smaller coins also follow the trend.",

Investing on a good project are more advisable though since not all popular coin are ok to buy, sometimes its also about your timing that can make you more profitable. Most of the popular cryptocurrency are already in the top list, you just have to choose the best and make profit out of it.",

AI and space travel, huh? I bet you want to make robots and ship them off to Mars or something, right? C'mon even a kindergartner could probably come up with a better concept than that!Stop underestimating people's intelligence!",

So altcoins in the top 10 could be a good investment for them.Quote from: Adigvcdh on November 17, 2023, 08:08:01 PMPerhaps one reason is inertia - to stay with recognized, established projects instead of taking risks with young ideas.

The question is how much the community is willing to pay attention to such projects, despite their current status.Don't get me wrong here, it's obvious that you are shilling for this project, it might affect them negatively and backfire as investors might see this kind of shilling very negative to be honest. If the project is what you say it is, then investors are going to flock and invest their money. But if this is just a way to shill and then they found out that this project has nothing to offer, no innovative approach, then they won't even put a sat on it, just saying.Quote from: Adigvcdh on November 17, 2023, 08:08:01 PMWhat is more important to you in the world of cryptocurrencies - their prominence or their potential to make a real impact on the industry?Doesn't matter though, again if you think that your project can make an impact because it is unique then it will be known to crypto industry. But if it is just like a copy cat of previous project, definitely we will go with the original one, just saying.It has to be unique like Bitcoin or Ethereum or any other projects in the altcoin crypto sphere.",

Judging from market cap,total in supply, scarcity market dominance and 4 years for each halving. So there is always a promising future in bitcoin. So it has all what needs to be invested on.

Interest in the first place stems from the inherent capability of a project to be, well, interesting. It doesn't really matter most of the time how, it just has to be interesting. Popularity then just snowballs into it. The more interest you have, the more popular you are and said popularity, once grown to a big enough amount, just grows and snowballs by itself. And the market isn't really anything about \"impactful\" really, it's mostly which projects can stand out the most. Investors then invest, no matter how bad the project is. The important thing is they can make money off of it. It's not like investors are only long-term ones, a lot of others just buy the coin for a day, sell the next. A perfect example is meme coins.",

But there are some small projects too which starts with low but with the passage of time them become worthy.People remain stable on well known projects we should think about the transparency that projects like Cogitex have or bring. When we think about how important cryptocurrencies are we need to find a balance between how well known they are and how they are impacting or can impact. Established projects may be more famous but thing is that how they are performing and which idea they are establishing in cryptocurrency world.By paying attention to promising but less known projects like Cogitex we can  make positive changes in the cryptocurrency world.",

Yes they prefer a legit one or more bigger names on crypto if they wanna shelter out big funds like bitcoin and eth and many more. If you are big investors youll dwell with lots of factor and they want to eliminate potential risk to other coins which could be a scam or what.

Regarding your comparison with lesser known ones, even popular ones of today were lesser known ones in past. It's only fair.

You won't want to see something below standard! I like that statement and that's more reason we are always told to do research on these coins, check their road map and the type of community they keep. This reminds me of SOL over and over again. After its massive fall from that FUD down to $8. Sol has a great community that supports it primed with the team, they keep building regardless of the situation. Now look at them trading well like there was never a problem and currently ready to give to its society by airdropping various wallets",
