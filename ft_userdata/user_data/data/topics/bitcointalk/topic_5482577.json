So for me there is no need of creating another price prediction thread here. But for the news about Saudi Arabia it's another wise investment that will also increase the Bitcoin adoption over there because more citizens will want to follow the countries decision and invest in Bitcoin (if only the news is true).",

If we look the history, Bitcoin should begin to increase massively after the Bitcoin halving.I was also not sure about this all but after having some search and looking things around about this all now I was also having this update as Saudi Arab is having bitcoin as legal tender and peoples can buy and sell this without any problem so look like things are taking good change about this, and we can expect some good movement for the bitcoin as well if things like these are going to happen as announces.UAE was doing good work about crypto related technology and now after their some success we are having more Gulf region countries which are preparing to have their share in this market as well which will create good competition and better results for the investors as well.https://coinedition.com/saudi-arabia-qatar-rumored-1m-btc-buy-could-come-next-week-analyst/https://cointelegraph.com/tags/saudi-arabia",

Yes it is true that the Saudi government is very prudent with money because they have spent a lot of money on football and boxing in the past few years. The amount of money they spent on buying various stars created a stir all over the world. But in this case I am not making any theory that they can definitely buy bitcoins if they want to.

Their money is unlimited right? so by releasing what we think is a very large amount can provide a strong boost. What the Saudi government may realize is that this year Bitcoin could make a profit as it faces a halving year.
