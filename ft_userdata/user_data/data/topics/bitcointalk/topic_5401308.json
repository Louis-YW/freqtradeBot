  "content": "Hello people!Way back in the day (2014) I created a site called chiliphone.com. I announced it here on the forum as well, in this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=757391, and a bit later it stirred up some discussion in this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=911228.At the time I didn't think of it as anything but an experiment. After that second post and the article I started to see some traffic though, and it started generating a small but steady stream of deposits. I got a bit scared and stressed out at this point, because I didn't fully trust my underlying tech and program. I took it offline with the intention of refactoring it, and never ended up putting it back up.So I want to ask you guys if you think this still would be a useful service? I have looked around a bit, and can't really find another site that provides the same service. Is it worth spending time on getting it back up?To explain very quickly how it worked:1. Pay some bitcoin to an address (or in this day and age, why not lightning network).2. Cal any international phone number using WebRTC directly from your browser.",

Is it worth spending time on getting it back up?I think it's well worth spending time on this, but you need to provide some proof that this is really untraceable phone calls and not something to collect information and spy on people.It all depends how much I would have to pay per minute, but I would use it for some reasonable price.Problem is that this could be used for some illegal stuff, so it would certainly get attention from regulators and law enforcement at some point.Quote from: limikael on June 04, 2022, 06:04:47 AM1.

It's something new, but if you can provide a service to call/text to/from regular phone numbers or rent them, you will find more interest.[1] https://btcpayserver.org/",

Although, the only issue is you'll likely have a lot of malicious users using the service, which could potentially cause some issues for you. Just something to think about. Phone calls are a pretty niche department. I'll echo what has said above SMS numbers that you can use, would have far more use.",

Now that I'd pay myself. Countless situations where I needed to make a call or leave a message when roaming's not working or simply not possible with bad signals.And that means it's a viable business.",

By either requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) information on you or by cross referencing from the data collection honey pot. Even sim cards that you buy online now need to be registered to an address, and while at the moment I do believe you can buy sim cards at a store without KYC, in certain countries they've even began to require that. So, I can see the appeal for a service like this, but as time goes on it's likely to be considered a illegal operation, especially as times become more constrictive with KYC.",

      "body": "Thanks guys for all the feedback! Will not answer to all the posts individually because that would make the thread quite messy. Will summarize my take aways and conclusion.Regarding untraceability. I will rely on an external SIP trunk to connect to the telephone network, and only god knows what the telco in charge of that SIP trunk wants to do with the traffic. The point was not to make it super-private. It is more untraceable in the same way as good old burner phones that you buy for cash. I.e., the phone call will not be more private, but at least the way you pay for the phone call will be. I would imagine that a WhatsApp call is more private, but with WhatsApp you can't call the regular phone network. I don't have any special measure or secret sauce to make it more untraceable than that. Also, I will not store any information about anything, but you will have to take my word for it, there is no way I can prove that I won't.Anyway, my key selling point was not really the untraceability part, it is more an \"extra\" feature. The initial idea is really to scratch my own itch. The main use case, i.e. the itch to scratch is more like the following. I'm a digital nomad, and sometimes I have to call my bank, insurance company, embassy, tax man, or some something other government related back in my home country. If I just buy a local SIM card, it will be expensive. I could of course use Skype or Viber and pay with a credit card, but the process of downloading, signing up and jumping to all kinds of hoops just to make a phone call with those services is quite a hassle. It would be more convenient to just make a Bitcoin or Lightning payment here.So I think I will tone down the \"untraceability\" in my marketing, and just call it a service to quickly make phone calls in the browser and pay with crypto.Yep maybe in the future I can add the possibility to receive calls too, and to send and receive SMS. But just have to start somewhere first... Related to technical aspects I'm planning to use Electrum running as a daemon. The reason why is that in this case I don't need to download the whole blockchain. I think that with BTCpayserver I do. Please correct me if I'm wrong, and also let me know if there are any specific reasons why BTCpayserver would be better than Electrum.Alright, will continue to hack on it for a bit, and post an update when I have something to show...",

      "body": "Thank you so much guys for testing!Will summarise some points here...- Regarding the delay for the echo test. Depends on what you mean... The way that echo test works, is that it records for 5 seconds, thenreads back the recording. So that part of the delay is by design. But then also, I have noticed a bit of delay which I think is because of the location of my server. Ideally it should be close to where the caller is. Since I'm in Indonesia, I put it in Singapore. Which I don't think is close to where my costumers will be, so I think I will move it. Eventually have several servers in different continents, but should probably start with North America or Europe rater than Asia.- I don't have a \"rate table\", because there are many different rates depending on the number you are calling. The way to get the rate for a number is to type it in the number input field and it will be shown. It is not 100% clear that it is supposed to work that way though, so will add a note about it.- Yep there is an echo test by calling the number 801. But it is a bit hard to find, so will add a note about that too.- The reason why you have to create an account is because I thought it will be too easy to lose your credit otherwise. If you don't have an account, the only way to associate you with your credit would be through a cookie in the browser, so if you clear your cookies, the credit will be gone. But then again, this is actually the way e.g. lightning-roulette.com works, i.e. with a cookie. And it is also the way good old phone booths worked, they didn't have an \"account\", you just paid the money for one phone call before you made it. So I think I will introduce a kind of signup-less temporary accounts, where the credit will be associated with a cookie. This is actually the way my old service worked, and I think this is OK as long as it is clearly stated. Either that, or I could add meta mask support, which will give a more anonymous signup. I have thought about both of these options, which one do you think I should prioritise?- I don't know where that SSL error comes from... () I tried with Firefox just now, and it worked fine for me. I haven't done a lot of cross browser testing though, so I think I will get myself an account at Browsersack to do that.Alright, thanks a lot for testing and feedback! This gives me a to do list which I will chip away at. Will let you know when there is something new to test!",
