You and members of the forum manage a multi-signature address, let's say 3 out of 5, each one deposits 100, where the grand total is 500 dollars, if a profit event is shared and if there is a loss it is shared as well. amount can be increased if confidence in the parties increases.",

One side providing capital and bear the risk if it gets dirty but share the profit if it goes well? What type of partnership is that? Well just like @mk4 said, if you are truly experienced as you claimed how come you lack capital? What happened to your previous profit you made? If you are an expert trader, you shouldn't be scared to borrow money from your friends or even take a loan to start and pay back within that 1-3 months. Risk with yourself and not the hard earned of others. You have nothing to prove and justify your expertise.The sharing formula is insane considering the risk involved. I'm sorry but this forum is not like a Telegram and it will hardly work for you here.",

No one is stupid enough to believe any words except for your actions. If you can provide good results and you are able to show us your involvement in it, maybe one will try to reach out to you. But without that, this deal still looks suspicious. Why not share your signal with some people before offering such deals? Let them try it out on their own. If it's a success, then they will be sure that you are really good at what you are doing. And not with one proof. We want multiple. Also, if you are that much pro, how come you do not have assets to trade right now and searching for investors? I hope you will read this and give us an answer OP.",
