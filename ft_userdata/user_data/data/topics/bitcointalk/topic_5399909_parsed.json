The amount of batteries you would need to keep it going through the night or cloudy days would be so much that it isn’t even worth mentioning that you plan to install solar. It’s nice to have solar to help with long term electricity costs, but it’s really more of a home choice than an addition to a home mining setup. Even if you spend nearly $50K on your solar setup like I did, it would still barely power a small mining setup.",

At that time, it was fashionable to fork bitcoin. It is not the price of the coin that matters, but the profit. But this coin will not save the situation with mining after the end of ethereum mining.can you explain how a so cheap coin gives profit?you mean its easy to mine MASSIVE amounts of this coin and the sell it or exchange it?",
