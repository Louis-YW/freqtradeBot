Do share experience with usmost often both. nowadays bitcoin is very valuable, as a medium of exchange, or even as an investment tool. people often use both. they hold back when they feel that the price of bitcoin will be high, and make it an investment, and sell it when they need money, or exchange it for a product when they need that product. the great thing about bitcoin is that its use is very flexible. even by having a large amount of it, it can already be considered an investment. Personally, I use bitcoin in both ways depending on the circumstances.",

But it seems that we will be able to see this if bitcoin legalization is implemented and it becomes possible to pay in BTC officially.",

      "body": "I think a better question is, in general how much of your BTC do you save for long term vs short term vs spend.There is always the cost of money, be it BTC, fiat, gold coins, whatever. You should be figuring out what is the best to spend vs save in any given situation.Obviously, I am not going to do that on each and every transaction. But in the large view everyone should be doing that if possible.Example, on bitcoin pizza day bitrefill was giving back 50% of giftcard purchases to certain pizza places. NOT spending BTC and getting some gift cards to places I eat anyway would be a bad financial idea. Yesterday I picked up dinner at Chipolte due to this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401107 it was only $20 and I wanted to test the app anyway BUT at 10% off I would have had to weigh that vs potential short and medium term BTC gains. And so on....-Dave",

I wish I could buy things with Bitcoin directly more often, but it's just not an option because of how rarely it's accepted as payment. It's also possibly an obstacle that Bitcoin is in a gray area or treated as an asset or property in many places, which means it's not exactly legally recognized as money, and that can be discouraging for merchants to start accepting it. At the same time, given how well-performing Bitcoin is in terms of gaining value in the long run, it would be unqise to not hodl it and spend all of it.",

Actually, actively seeking out companies/services that accepted it. These days, I'd much rather save it, I guess as a reserve currency rather than something I'd spend regularly. I probably haven't spent my Bitcoin over a year. The last time I remember was to join a competition here on the forum, and then before that was buying some things in the collectible section, which you couldn't get with fiat. Otherwise, I wouldn't have spent my Bitcoin for a few years now. I imagine this is the case for a lot of users here, especially those that have witnessed the price change over time. It becomes hard to justify spending it, when you could spend fiat, and not be at risk of losing out over time.",
