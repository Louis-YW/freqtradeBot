  "content": "Hi,After upgrading to version 4.3.2, Electrum wallet requires two-factor authentication. But I never set it up, i.e. I don't have it paired with Google Authenticator. Is there any way to set up Google Authenticator and Electrum Wallet now to make 2FA work? Or the other way around, so that Electrum Wallet does not require 2FA, as it did before? I should add that I don't have a seed! And I do have the password for my wallet.",

If it turns out that it also requires 2FA, I think you are opening the wrong wallet file.To disable a 2FA wallet, you must use the seed of the wallet to restore the wallet.",

Something like \"default_wallet [standard]\" or \"My wallet [2fa]\". What does yours say?Next click on Wallet -> Information. What does it say next to the headings \"Wallet type\", \"Script type\" and \"Seed available\"? Does it then show you a keystore with 3 keys to choose from, or does it simply show you a master public key?Wallets cannot change from one type to another, so if this wallet is indeed a 2FA wallet then it has always been a 2FA wallet.

Which really wasn't happening before.One realistic scenario is (for Windows only): you might had set-up the 2fa wallet on a portable version before, then switched to a non-portable version & created your non-2fa wallet.Then to update, you've downloaded v4.3.2 portable version (saved to the same directory as the first).Since the portable version uses a different data directory, it failed to find your non-2fa wallet and only found your old 2fa wallet in the portable wallet directory.Same thing will happen in vice-versa scenario (non-portable 2fa->switched to a portable version & created a non-2fa wallet->updated to non-portable version).For that, try to download both portable and stand-alone versions and see which one can find your correct wallet.Or just search for electrum_data folder, the portable version's wallet should be in \"wallets\" folder inside it.But it seems like there's bitcoins that you're trying to spend from the 2fa wallet which can't be spent without the seed or 2fa device.Aside from that scenario, nothing.Wallets wont suddenly change from standard to 2fa.",
