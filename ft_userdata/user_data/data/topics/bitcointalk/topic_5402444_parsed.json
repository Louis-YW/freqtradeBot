  "content": "Binance gives more reasons to remain decentralized and by now i believe this would have been an eye opener to those using centralized exchanges.Binance halt Bitcoin withdrawals, should this be a thing of concern?. As this was officially announced by the Binance CEO, many are taken into consideration the better advantage altcoins could have over bitcoin but i can boldly say that this is one of the unavoidable lapses of using a centralized exchange like Binance, they are in custody of the coins and have right to do whatever they wish to implement over your financial assets with them, I'd rather prefer users having a second thought to stop the use of centralized exchanges and go strictly decentralized.QuoteBinance, the world’s largest exchange, is pausing its Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals today, June 13, due to a backlog caused by a stuck transaction.https://coinquora.com/binance-halts-bitcoin-withdrawals-due-to-stuck-transactions/",

Another situation to remind crypto users not to store their coins in centralized platforms.Quote from: jackg on June 13, 2022, 04:43:01 PMYeah they've done it quite a lot before and they might've been responding late to the block that took about an hour to be mined this morning (afaik it took that long - as well as increased withdrawals from holders and dip buyers).It might come from funds being less accessible from cold wallets too but I'm not too sure how likely that'd be - especially since cz probably has a reserve of their own somewhere. What I like with binance, is that their CEO is very visible to the public. And he will use social media to announce any important news or updates. Not many centralized exchanges' owners are known to public.So for me, it is easy to reach out binance if in case you really have important case to settle with.",

      "body": "Imagine using an exchange which charges a withdrawal fee 100x higher than it needs to just to just so it can pocket 99% of it as pure profit, and yet still can't figure out how to use a high enough fee for their transactions so that they don't get stuck in the mempool, or how to use RBF or CPFP. Embarrassing for Binance, and embarrassing for anyone who is still using such a scummy exchange.Or, alternatively, perhaps Binance were caught without adequate BTC in their wallets to process all the extra withdrawals which suddenly hit the mempool and had to stall while they readjusted their fractional reserves.Either way, they are ripping you off and risking your coins.

And then use a DEX to build a long term stash into your cold storage.I read about the Celsius situation last night and it is quite messier in comparison to the promised enabling of withdrawals after 30 mins.Most of the people that used Celsius to this day were there because the 17% APY (which is quite good-to-be-true if you ask me), on the other hand people use Binance and others exchanges to trade mostly, there are other products and services provided by Binance like Staking, Mining... but I believe we all can agree their main function is to serve as an exchange of crypto-assets.It is quite messed up to see people on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/) wondering whether they will ebe have their money back or not.I'd dare to say that this is not looking good at all for the people who trusted celsius, even if they had the needed liquidity to honor their costumers some weeks ago, because the FUD and bad image this news provide, obviously more people feel urged to withdraw all their coins. Binance does not offer such a high yield for their savings accounts, but at least they seem to be liquid at the time being.",
