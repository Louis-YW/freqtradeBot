Any new big thing that grabs a lot of attention from customers is always a target for phishing.ChatGPT is currently extremely popular, with millions of users which is an excellent basis for scammers to try to get some benefit out of it.At the moment, the problem may be that its creators obviously did not expect this much fame in a short period of time, so they did not pay enough attention to the potential of fraud and phishing. When we add to that that social media have weak control over such phishing offers, the risk is more than obvious.Considering that it is artificial intelligence, surely there are ways to at least minimize this problem if it cannot be completely avoided.",

Although it has its shortcomings it is a product that will assist workers in different areas of life. As usual, scammers will always take advantage of new inventions and use the opportunity to swindle people. One of the ways of avoiding this scam is to get information about the AI tool you want to install or use. Gather enough information about the producers and the kind of service they offer. If the company sells its package and another website is offering you a free service of the same product, you need to be careful. Be cautious about cheap or free AI services. You can get relevant information about an AI tool from the website of the creators. I have had to contact some universities that offer the AI service I need and we had a good deal. Many top firms offer services and you can access them through their verified website.",

According to its head of information security, the AI-based chatbot is “the new crypto” for bad actors and the social media giant is preparing for various abuses.This information was obtained from .Bitcoin.com and coming across this thread made me think that it is critical for the ChatGPT developers to strengthen their security because scammers will use anything they see as an advantage to scam people.QuoteAdditional Tips:There's no app or websites for ChatGPT yet where you can download or get the verified app through an official website, some may demand money from you to make payment before they can offer you such, recommend you a link or require you to provide some information about yourself, know this that ChatGPT is meant to be freely provided from a genuine source, anyone claiming they already have this are likely to be scam because it has not been fully operational yet. read more here:https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-spot-fake-chatgpt-app-on-apple-app-store/I haven't paid much attention to AI yet, so I'm not aware that they don't have an official website from which to download a verified app. This means that developers must be very cautious and strengthen their security in order to avoid directing users to the wrong website or providing an official website from which to download or access the genuine application.",

IMO, only naive people will always fall into the trap, we should be knowledgeable always.",
