From what I’ve gathered just with personal experience is that most of the earlier “coiners” tended to be male and relatively younger (under 50 years old). I don’t think that’s changed much of the course of time but it would be nice to see it do so.",

I am happy to see new generations buying bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.I found this website with some different stats based on Google Analytics:Quotehttps://bitcoinist.com/google-analytics-bitcoin-demographics/#:~:text=Most%20Bitcoin%20Users%20Are%20Male%20Between%2018%20to%2045&text=And%20a%20lot%20of%20them,about%20silver%2Dhaired%20boomers%20here.",

The second largest which might have a huge size gap from the largest is probably coming from Generation X or those who were born from 1965 to 1980. But there is probably a growing population of Generation Z as they are getting more mature and more responsible in terms of their finances. And since they are the ones who are most exposed to rising technologies, they could more easily embrace Bitcoin.",

I'd say @bitmover's graph is the most accurate so far. It's just interesting if old people with 65+ ages are still interested with Bitcoin while they're mostly doesn't know much about technology.",

Which as of right now, is probably the contributing factor to younger ages generally being more involved with Bitcoin. It's a currency, the only real difference is it requires a certain knowledge of computers to secure effectively, which is harder the older you're because you haven't grown up with computers. Unless, you have a specific interest, you've likely steered clear of them. Although, computers are becoming more common in older people now, I imagine in the next twenty years this won't be an issue at all. As pretty much every generation will have some sort of familiarity with computers, and I imagine most will depend on one whether it's for personal usage or within their working environment. I mean phones are pretty much owned by everyone these days, and the majority of them being smart phones.",

There is nobody under 18 and also just one person from 18-22 so far.
