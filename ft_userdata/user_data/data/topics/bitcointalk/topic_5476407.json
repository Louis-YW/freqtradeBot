      "body": "I tried opening both of them; the first one gave me “404” error while the other one just kept loading and gave me “timeout” error, so I was unable to check the site out. But nevertheless, it’s a scam… as long as they are requesting you to put in more funds before you can remove the one that you currently have there, it’s a scammy move. Normally when you have coins in an exchange, if you want to withdraw they’ll take their fee from your current account balance they won’t ask you to deposit a different fee (from even typing it, is sounds stupid. Although some might still fall for it cos of the amount the have in the exchange) and you should comply with it you’ll only add to the amount that they want to scam off you. A link has been provided that contains lists of exchanges, use one of them. Don’t just go around the internet searching for random exchanges to use you’ll only end up in the hands of scammers and no matter how hard you try you won’t be able to recover your money back from them once the deed is done.",

So, definitely a scam. There is no doubt.",

I doubt he traded there at all, because one address isn't even registered and free to buy, and the other address exists but doesn't work (404).

It's quite dangerous for newbies who don't know about these types of scams. Just make sure you don't use such shady services. Choose the right platform when it's related to your funds.",

Yes, it's long gone. The account or the address given to you to make your deposit is not even your own, as you don't have the key to it, the owners of the scam site have it, and the figures you see on your account are just mere figures, which anybody with admin access can increase your balance to whatever they want.  The best for you to do is advise your uncle to leave the site and advise him to stop communicating with the friend, because they will convince him more to make some more deposit through other means and turn you, who want to help him escape the plan, to be the evil one, as they will make him believe, you don't want him to take profit. Your uncle is too eager to make profit, that is why he falls for that scam. You should educate him and make him have a reverse from such a mindset to save him from similar scams in future.",

Never heard of this exchange before, anyway this platform is fake because they are asking you to pay some fine, or money in any type, although we do have to pay the withdrawals fee but it is deducted in the native token, or the token you are going to withdraw. So, if your uncle funds are in Matic or BTC form, so when he will be withdrawing, the fee will be deducted from the same type of token.I will suggest you to avoid that exchange because the domain name also looks fishy, but I know when platforms are suggested by your near ones, then you don't think for another second, especially those who are newbie in crypto space.Even if your brother is asking you to use a exchange, you have to be skeptical about it, and should check the exchange by yourself.",

Opt for exchanges with higher volumes, as they are often more dependable.

As far as I know, trustworthy exchanges don't operate this way. You might want to steer clear of such requests.
