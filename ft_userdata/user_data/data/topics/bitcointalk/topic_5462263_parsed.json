I've heard some chatter about a few options, but personal experiences and insights are gold. Would love to hear your thoughts! I will be honest with you on this one, Binance offers one of the best services for newbie person, intermediaries and professionals but there is a comma to this, Binance have good features and are very update with new features but when something is too good to be true, there is always open back door which can cause a catastropic damage to you later or even earlier than you may expect. Binance exchange is a centralized exchange, using it means you have submit your privacy to them because you will have to be verify before you can even be allow to make a deposit, and in addition, you don't own the keys to your funds.If you are looking for alternatives to avoid the above problems, try a P2P exchanges but they are not designed like Binance and the rest, they don't request for KYC, you can trade on the exchange without revealing your identity or even hide your IP adress from such exchanges and nobody will question you for that but Binance and the rest may even lock your account for changing an address or even the device you use to access their exchange.",

I've heard some chatter about a few options, but personal experiences and insights are gold.Actually you have to choose your best exchange which fits you. Because you can't get your desired trading pairs in every exchange or every exchange will have some of their uniqueness. You could try top ranked crypto exchanges and then choose the best one. What do you prefer to choose an exchange? Is it about lowest fees and secured exchange or popular exchanges? No centralized exchanges will be able to provide you the full security of your assets.I personally use more than one exchange and I think Binance is in the top of all centralized exchanges with the highest trading volume and best services. Another most popular and my used crypto exchange is Bybit. It has a great user-friendly interface and a lot of popular trading pairs. Both of them need to verify KYC to use them. Huobi and Coinex are in my favorite list and they don't need to verify KYC. So you should add details about your interests to choose the most appropriate exchange. Quote from: Best-mary on August 06, 2023, 05:05:43 PMI kinda value my privacy. So, non-KYC Exchange suggestions would be really helpful.Then you should choose Houbi, Coinex and they are also top ranked  exchanges. Anyway Kucoin can be used in a limited way by protecting your privacy. You can see the details here about Kucoin: KuCoin can still be used without KYC",

It is not about picking the \"best\" exchange anymore, but rather the one that meets your specific needs. So, first off, you gotta decide if you wanna deposit or withdraw fiat currency to/from your bank account or credit card. If you wanna buy bitcoin with fiat, then your best option is decentralized exchanges like Bisq or P2P.",

Hmm, Seems like OP is really a newborn in the market as you are asking for the trading platform, Hmm if you are really newbie then I will suggest using the centralized platform for the early time, and after getting some experience you can shift to the custodial wallets and Decentralized platforms. So as Bianne is the leading platform I will recommend you can directly use the Binance or KUcoin or OKX for your initial career. After that, with proper research, you can choose your Dex and DeFi services.",

I have read about a few reviews too–according to TokenInsights it is ranked as the fourth-largest CEX by trading volume in Q2 2023, its derivatives trading volume also had a surge. Additionally it is one of the few exchanges like Binance that has released its Proof-of reserves, and best known for being the largest Copy trading platform.",

But in my opinion, if he want for a better feature and experience I prefer CEX especially with Binance. If he's a not reputable person, I think it's okay to go KYC but if ever they do something bad with users identity, trust me they will not choose. There's a lot of users in CEX and most of them did a KYC because if they don't KYC they can do a limited action only in their account. There are some cases of stolen identity in the past so if they're a reputable person and want a better security of their identity, just go with DEX.",

No go-to exchanges are the same for everyone as it depends on your demand and priority on either security, privacy, quick rich games and your risk acceptance.If you want very high trading volume, choose tier 1 centralized exchanges from Coinmarketcap, Coingecko lists and do your own researches as well. Centralized exchanges especially tier 1 means mandatory KYC.If you don't need to by high trading volume, you can consider decentralized exchanges, no KYC.If you want to have private deals for big trades, choose OTC.",
