  "content": "\"Christmas Vacation\" For all our Staff and Students!1) All development and publicity efforts are being 100% shut down for at least 36 to 48 hours, and probably several days/weeks after.2) No payments (zero) have been accepted for any of my current efforts. At this point that is a good thing. No refunds to do, or other related issues. Why?* I have two close family members facing surgery soon, and will be moving \"Home for the Holidays\" right after packing and making travel plans. * When I make it back here, some of you really will not want to miss out. Please don't \"let yourself down\" by forgetting the future is created by people who jump ahead of the crowds. The future can still be bright! Sponsored by +++ Positive Coin +++Happy Holidays :: (This is an interesting, non-promo thread) Do You Know The First Times Bitcoin Ever Had Real World Value? ps. Remember, every one of you has great potential to succeed - and/or what do you lose by trying... ...lol?* There is a talented dynamic group here, and many of them are interested in a co-op effort to become certified Blockchain & Smart Contract Experts.* That alone, has great future value.",
