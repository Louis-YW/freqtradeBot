  "content": "Guys, never play on that scam casino. I've won just few bets on tennis (Wimbeldon games), wanted to withdraw, but administration asked me to complete 3 lvls of verification, which I've successfully passed. After it they confiscated my winnings, without real reasons. Told me something about arbitrage bets, but that was just regular bets on TOP tennis match. Firstly they told me, that I have withdrawal limit, just 300 usdt, but they will withdraw all my money. After my withdrawal of 300 usdt they've just closed my account. Rest of money was there,  That's sad.

Try getting all the necessary details, screenshots if necessary, the name of the casino, the website, and all of that, and if they have a profile here on the forum, you can also provide a link to their ANN thread and their profile link to their representative.Just check on the bottom left part of this thread, and you could see the move option.I doubt you will even visit this thread again.",

Don't play there, save your money.The conversation is not a valid proof but its helpful to understand your case. Your only defense against arbitrage betting accusations is just the sports you made is the largest tennis tournament while arbitrage betting can happened on any type of sports because it only involves the difference on odds of different sportsbook.As I understand correctly your case, Your account is under the arbitrage restriction which results to hold some of your balance until investigation is done. Just ask them for update regularly about your case. You need to provide screenshots about your conversation and your account balance in the casino.

But to be clear his initial funds were successfully withdrawn. It is very rare we would act in this way (even when it is well within our rights too), but if you remember a while back we came under a sustained campaign of abuses by multiple accounters using arbitrage betting, so we had to amend our measures to ensure it was a wasted venture for these type of users with no actual gambling intention It would be helpful again if the community realize such posting like OP's are very rarely to be factual, nor had he attempted contact with us since early June.

I'm not sure why but I think something is suspicious about @OP as well about the ones who replied to the post as duckdice.io support team. A few replies back they were claiming that the user has broken the rules by creating multiple accounts and after some time they approved the withdrawals of the user. This type of activity is always suspicious from a casino and that's why I also want an explanation from Duckdice.io team that what made them approve the withdrawals if the user had broken the rules and created multiple accounts? If the user didn't created multiple accounts then why were his withdrawals unapproved? Kindly reply with a valid reason so that anyone else if wants to play on that site could understand the policies of the casino better.",

Are the approved withdrawals a good gesture or was the accusation against OP got clarified internally and proven to be wrong?For you and the other enquirer. Initially, my statement was made based on out-of-date information on the case, we had paid out just his initial deposit some time ago and declared his additional winnings forfeited as both the sports provider and we had clear evidence that he was using multiple accounts for arbitrage. It was more of a goodwill gesture to close the case, though we have reasonable evidence that we were correct in our first action, we have also now improved our measures since that time to make what we believe he was doing a lot less possible. Whether or not this is the appropriate action, the OP has his funds now, winnings as well as what he already had (his initial deposit returned). PS. to the person doubting my claims of being able to talk on behalf of DuckDice, a little searching on the forum will hopefully clarify that i am indeed bobstone, a person who operates duckdices (and tower.bets) support and can probably sort out of my profile to be a bit more appropiate for times like this. Hope that clears it up a little,BobstoneDuckDice Support",

That seemed strange to me, but in general I have the money and I'm glad that my issue is closed.Sending fund to the deposit address instead of another address that's been specified as recipient for withdrawal is a known practice to fight against AML/ATF for accounts that's raises suspicion. As you still have control over this wallet, and given your account's situation, it's an understandable measure taken by duckdice and shouldn't be a problem.In regards to the accusation, there is a difficulty to check whose said the truth if case being involved is a multi-acc. The platform will not provide their findings in concern of their security and privacy, and the accuser's statements themselves can not be taken as the whole truth. We're in a moot here, and given that the case is solved with all the funds successfully withdrawn, I suggest you both to go separate ways [that is, OP, you never play on DuckDice anymore]. Meanwhile, I'll take my note of the situation surrounding this case and use it for future reference in case other accusations ever raised.",
