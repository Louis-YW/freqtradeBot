  "content": "It's no news of the widespread reach of Bitcoin and how the knowledge of it is slowly creeping into the nooks and crannies of the world. Leaders around the world are calling for the inclusion of Bitcoin study into the curricula of students and the ruler of Serbia is no different. Speaking at a conference on Thursday at the casino de Barritz to a coin telegraph personnel, Prince Filip of Serbia gave his two cents on his opinion of Bitcoin.The 40 year old business man is unlike any other typical ruler you may know as he believes that Bitcoin is unlike any other subject and should be taught in schools as knowledge of the coin is quite important. Although not having the ability to making it a legal tender like El Salvador and Central African Republic did, he feels that it's a better form of \"Sharia money' for any Muslim country. Serbia is another country that is Bitcoin friendly and although exchanges like Bitpanda, Bitstamp are used there, is there a way that more Bitcoin related hubs and villages can be built borrowing a leaf from El Salvador to help a better spread of it? https://cointelegraph.com/news/prince-philip-of-serbia-suggests-bringing-bitcoin-into-the-classroom",

With someone with the knowledge and who can tell his citizen what to do, he would be making the adoption spread among his people. And starting it with the young people in the school will be a better idea to educate them on blockchain and BTC.Serbia will not be the first to add blockchain and BTC to thier curriculum, there were already countries before them.",

Academic institutions who have heard of his opinion might consider looking into the possibility of integrating Bitcoin-related courses. I agree with him that it is important for \"the history of money\" to be taught in schools. I suspect that more than 90% of a country's population don't know how money actually works. I cannot remember having an in-depth discussion in my university days of what money actually is or why it is basically founded on debt or whatever. I think everybody should be aware of it.",

Financial education as a whole is not taught enough in schools and many people are unaware how money works, besides earning and spending. Mandatory financial education will make people understand why they need alternative assets which hold value, such as Bitcoin. (Although Bitcoin does one better by functioning as a payment alternative).The reality is not everyone would be interested in Bitcoin or keen to use it, it doesn't have to be imposed on kids, if they do not care for it. Financial education on the other hand is pivotal to everyone.",

I mean think about it this way, I never learned about finance when I was going to elementary school, but then I never learned about it in high school if I wasn't on that class schedule neither, meaning if I wanted to study something unrelated, like arts or whatever, then money was never a subject to me, which means never learned it in college as well if you studied Literature like me.All in all, I spent 16 years in school and never once had any class regarding finances. If you do not teach kids about finance, then you won't have people who understand how they are getting screwed every single year by the taxes and the wealthy people who do not pay it, and the corrupt politicians who steal it.",

Therefore, it is not clear to me why so much attention is being paid to a prince who just wants some free PR at the expense of Bitcoin and nothing more than that?Perhaps this quote by @Pmalek explains it best :Quote from: Pmalek on March 23, 2022, 11:02:32 AMQuote from: pooya87 on March 22, 2022, 07:32:27 AM(I'm assuming the Royal family has at least some power). I am going to use something one of my all-time favorites, Del Trotter said for something completely different but parts of his statement can be applied here as well. The Royal family of Serbia is almost as important as a gin salesman in Iran.  In addition, Serbia is one of the biggest supporters of Russia and has at its head a man who denies the most terrible crimes committed by his people (including him personally) in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Does anyone think that Bitcoin will ever succeed in such a country where a big leader controls absolutely everything?Those who can't get enough of princes and fairy tales about them -> Prince Philip of Serbia: \"only way around inflation is Bitcoin\"",

It's hard for me to tell if his actions in Serbia are really bold or if they are not. You have already pointed out that the most positive thing about him is the work he is doing at the moment as a 40-year-old businessman because helping people become educated about new technology, such as bitcoin, can be extremely helpful for the future of those individuals. As soon as the rest of the world hears about what he does for students, I'm sure he can gain more reputation for himself.",

As a matter of fact, some months ago I watched one of his interviews and I so much loved what he said about bitcoin. According to him, Bitcoin, it is only bitcoin is freedom. And this is something I want for everyone. And this is something that everyone has to learn and they will learn slowly. Some people will not want to learn it because they are not used to it. Because they want to protect the system that they do well in but they don't realize that that system or maybe they do, that that system is not advantageous to everyone else in the world. So billions of people around the world are not having a good time right now. Well we need to take the money away from the states. Sooner than later, we are going to have bitcoin being taught in schools in all levels.",

This will also lessen the doubt of people on how bitcoin operates. Many thinks it still a scam and some were just lucky being able to get profit from it. If it will be teach in schools students will have more ideas and probably they can use as sideline in having profit or atleast if they plan to invest early. It’s a good thing that high profile people appreciates what bitcoin can do. Even no enough knowledge in bitcoin can earn if they study hard so what more if it will be taught by knowledgeable professors to make their bitcoin/crypto journey less riskier and more worth it.",
