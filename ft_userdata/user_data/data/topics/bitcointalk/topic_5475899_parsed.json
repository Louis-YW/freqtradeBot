Perhaps it is best to follow what is happening with mempool, and if the number of unconfirmed transactions starts to decrease (as is the case now), we can assume that the fees will start to decrease in the coming days. We currently have about 163 000 transactions that are in the range of 1-24 sats/vB out of a total of 183 000 unconfirmed transactions, while the fee for high priority is about 30 sats/vB.If there is no new ordinal madness, it is realistic to expect that soon the mempool will start to be cleaned of transactions that pay less than 25 sats/vB, which is exactly what is happening.",

If you have to spend as much as you have received, you can make small size transactions, as low as 113 byte and pay a lower fee.

There are many paid transaction accelerator like ViaBTC paid service, Binance's transaction accelerator, F2POOL's accelerator. These are legit paid services but they ask you to pay so much that it doesn't really worth it.Just found another accelerator on Bitcoin.com (I know it's a shit website owned by Roger Ver, don't remind me please), so, I have no idea about them but anyone can check it if they wish: https://txa.cc",

As long as the input doesn't become too big, you should be able to save some money too. If this is related to making regular payments to services you regularly use, that depends on the service I guess. Some support LN so you can just open a channel with some amount of money that can last for several payments, for example. You can also look for other services that support LN, RBF, or something similar. For example, I paid for my VPN with BTC, they allow RBF transactions and the confirmation window is quite long so the risk of being uncredited is small.",

Which doesn't seem likely in the near future since a small part of the community still insists that preventing this type of abuse is considered \"censorship\"!!!!Or the other solution is to wait and wish for the scam market where they rip people off with the junk they inject into the blockchain to die.

Now as for free accelerators, ViaBTC is the only one that is working, if you can successfully submit your tx to be accelerated by them amidst the current congestion, with too many people also waiting to use the free service, you can be sure they accelerated your tx because it would be in the next block that they mine.
