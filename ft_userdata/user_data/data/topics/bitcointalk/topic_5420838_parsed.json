  "content": "Like in the world you need to know things what Are For sure. First detect things what Are For sure then you Will remove emotions and do calculations what is the truth.For example: We have sky and earth and gravity law.We have sure thing gravity but not sure earth or sky.So we follow by this we Will know that sky is temporary but earth is one day for sure.Now same thing like geo political powers If something going on in the world we know that USA Are boss of the world anything else can happening but USA sure thing boss. So then we know it's imposdible to attack USA by military becouse BOSS is boss World Are run from where ? Off course from new York and chicago.Now If we look that way trading and Investment we know sure thing Are WHALES whales Are king in Investment markets and trading.What whales want ? People think whales want money...no whales get money from their Banker buddies.Whales want assets they want crypto they want real estate and they want FTT coins.How to get asssets? Fud fear and more fear and If people don't sell then more fear and fud must come until the strongest people Will give their assets away for cheap to whales.They don't want your money they have their ownWhales want your assets bull can not start until most of the people are scared to sell.If anything happens you always look first the things what is for sure then you know everthing else.",

You are simply not understanding what you are saying if you say whales don't want money or coins. Every rich person wants more to maintain the standard, whether a philanthropist or miser.",

People think whales want money...no whales get money from their Banker buddies.Because that's what they really want. They want to have more money so that they can get more assets and have more cash flow for which will make them easy money through passive income. And as I know with most whales or big businessmen or investors, they're actually buddies with the bank. It is because the bank knows their net worth and they want to give them piles of cash for them to earn from them with interest.While these whales knows a lot of avenue to invest that money and will make them free money.",

It's all about making money and most people in crypto do not care about technology or use cases.He just said the reason why. They invest because they want the assets but they can't just hodl these assets forever as that doesn't make sense. Once the value of the assets they invest increases by so many folds, that's going to be the time that they will sell it for cash.Cash or money is still the number one reason for all of this. There are people who enters in crypto because they want to invest/trade and make money but I think the number of people who care for the technology behind cryptos are still more than them. We should give credits to them because if not them then cryptos won't be known and won't be big as what we are seeing now.",

They cannot move the market for theirselves but rather the use fud like spreading bad news thru media sites they paid so that they can spread out fear to the people for them to dump their own positions or holdings. Although this is quite crazy but somehow effective since we see several times market dumps when there's big issue happened, so we need to be smart and ride always with the news since from this we can earn if accumulation stage will happen.",

The pope manipulates any news well and they even have a special media that is used to spread some FUD san News that is deliberately made. The pope gains a lot from the manipulation. The whales will buy more bitcoins when the market has crashed enough, when they have bought they will start to manipulate the market again. Our psychology as small traders will also be played.and as for some of the wrongs, the pope has committed, of course it could have happened. Because nothing will work perfectly, the crypto market cannot be completely controlled either. The Pope wants a lot of profit in every market movement.",
