You can share the link broQuote from: Cryptomultiplier on October 26, 2022, 06:34:18 PMDo you think the effect of redesigning the nations currency note will be of benefit to the economy and nation at large? Let's discuss!Definitely it not no where a benefit, not in the Nigerian context where people have no value for anything anymore.The Nigerian currency have been redesign several times but today the exchange rate keeps dropping against foreign currency. Today a dollar to naira is 752/5 and in the last 18 months ago it was around $1 to #390. You can see the difference and madness running in the Nigerian economy.It is needless to say that redesigning of the naira is not the solution but to demonitize the Nigerian political system and get serious minded people who will be selfless to service not to have shenanigans going their for personal profit and to make name as a past president, governor, senator or other political offices. Yes, Nigeria government need to focus on more serious issues than mediocre agendas. A chance to try fresh blood is what is required.",

Let's discuss!https://nairametrics.com/2022/10/26/cbn-redesign-naira-notes/If you polish a turd, it's still a turd. Having a fancy looking currency fixes nothing about the underlying economy and it's a bit of a silly question to ask. Often times these are actually hidden deflation methods, for example removing a few zeros off the end and re-issuing currency in new denominations. If your governments fiscal policy is revolving around whether to redesign the currency, instead of spurring growth and new jobs, then they might just be rearranging unimportant stuff. Just look at Zimbabwe, who actually ended up creating hundred trillion dollar notes, but you still needed whole wheel barrows worth of them to buy anything useful.",

If their concern is with counterfeiting, then I suppose the redesign would help in that regard. Won't help inflation.If you wanted to help a country's economy, ditch the currency system for a currency that's deflationary or at the least is tied to a physical asset. The problem with any fiat currency is that the supply is infinite -- there isn't anything stopping the government from merely creating more. Obviously, overhauling the currency system is a radical approach that has detrimental economic effects in the short term. Long term, it's a viable solution to save a country's economy IMO.",

You have the explanation in the same article you've quoted:Quote“In recent years, the CBN has recorded significantly higher rates of counterfeiting especially at the higher denominations of N500 and N1,000 banknotes. Although global best practice is for central banks to redesign, produce and circulate new local legal tender every 5–8 years, the Naira has not been redesigned in the last 20 years.It's nothing special, every country does so, even the Eurozone launched a new batch of banknotes designs in 2019,  the US has changed the design of the $100 in 2010, and Britain just replaced two of their banknotes just to change them again after the death of the Queen.Nothing to do with the economy, its standard procedure.",

In a nation where the naira is constantly devalued against the dollar and pounds, I doubt there's anything the rebranding of the #200, 500 and 1000 notes will do because we'd still experience the inflation.  This time wasted to change these notes can actually be invested into something more productive like making provisions for the country to become a BTC hub or something else to help the naira and not to rebrand! Or possibly, why not take that time to fix the flooding problem that is slowly but surely putting the economy at risk?",

I wonder if you’re really serious about the question in your topic. A change in the design of a country’s currency doesn’t add any value to the currency nor does it improve its economy in any way. I think anyone with the basic knowledge of economics would know that. If a change in design did have an impact on its value and on the economy in general, we would have every country designing and redesigning their currency notes. The most beautiful and skillful design gets to be the one with the highest value",

Others are opposing this move because they see is an avenue by the government to loot funds by inflation of the contract sum.But in recent times Nigeria has experienced a high rate of fraud which includes currency clowning and counterfeit banknotes. There are even times when commercial banks' ATMs dispense counterfeit currency notes. This move by the Nigerian CBN will at least check this financial crime to a large extent.",
