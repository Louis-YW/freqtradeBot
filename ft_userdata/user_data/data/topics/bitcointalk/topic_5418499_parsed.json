      "body": "Good luck with your sale EA! A set like this will only surface once in years, or maybe even decades. I agree with Cygan on verification and time stamping for safety and security. Status, or amount of BTC you hold, should not give you a pass for following forum ethics, rules, and protocols. Most of us who buy/sell/trade often have learned this the hard way by being burned. We want the physical cypto collectibles world to gain in popularity, and we always welcome new members. Some members may not even know who \"THE\" members are, nor do they give a shit.
