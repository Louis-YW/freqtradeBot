  "content": "Will demand for Bitcoin Spot ETFs/ETPs reflect on Bitcoin's value in the cryptocurrency market?How can we prove that Bitcoin purchased through a Spot ETF, thus resulting in the creation of a \"trust unit\", reflects the purchase of real Bitcoin?I have done some reading that tells us that none of the applicants have done any work to come up with a transparent way to prove the underlying Bitcoin is being bought. If that is true, logic says \"how can we trust ETFs and the institutions behind them to reflect demand for ETFs in the real Bitcoin market?\" Or in short...How will ETFs effect the economics of Bitcoin and existing Bitcoin market liquidity? (edit - changed markets to market liquidity as it seems people misunderstood \"markets\" for \"price\")Or are we expected to blindly trust applicants to buy the Bitcoin that is bought on the ETF?",

I mean in a way they will provide more ETF shares to their customers than the real bitcoin that they bought. But I think the amount of bitcoin they hold to provide bitcoin ETF shares will be transparent for people to see, but I do not know how people will verify the total amount of shares they created from it to be 1:1.About the second question. Trading the ETF directly will not have effect on bitcoin price, what will have effect on bitcoin price is if more people are buying the ETF shares and then the company that are providing it are buying more bitcoin when there are needs for it as more people are demanding for the ETF. As the company are buying and holding more bitcoin, it will make bitcoin scarce and the demand also will make the price of bitcoin to increase.",

My topic has nothing to do with price. It has more to do with liquidity and the change in one of Bitcoin's most valuable fundamentals - limited supply - and how this will be effected by ETPs (as well as, how liquidity in the cryptocurrency market will be effected by ETPs)Quote from: Blitzboy on January 11, 2024, 08:37:47 AMAsking if Bitcoin's value is affected is like asking if waves affect the ocean.

Third parties can manipulate their investors by claiming to hold bitcoin from their customers' investments - but when transparency does not exist, there is every possibility of something going wrong. Previously - Bitcoin ETF were considered a strong fundamental for bitcoin market capitalization growth this year, but things look different now that everyone is starting to figure out how they work.So maybe - halving is another hope that could possibly make the market more profitable. High demand for bitcoin after the halving is certainly expected - it will have an impact on the growth of the bitcoin market cap automatically.",

The IIV will be calculated by using the prior dayâs closing NAV as a base and updating that value during the trading day based off of more recent bitcoin pricing information to reflect any changes in the value of the Trustâs underlying assets and, therefore, the Trustâs NAV. the IIV is not used on ARKS public market intraday NAV chartits used within brokers order creation where those AP wanting to make an order get a price from IIV that lasts 15 seconds to accept or reject...its worth noting that the ETF are not selling direct to end user investors. this principle nav and more intuitive IIV \"real time\" nav is between ETf and brokers.. the demand of end shares for investors is secondary market stuff between brokers and their customers..so the IIV and principle NAV will be more stable then the trades of end users with the brokers on secondary markets",

Â I have no idea what is up with this ETF thing nor do I have a desire to understand it.It is a hard thing for me to believe even that some of the Exchanges we see have 100 percent backing of their supposed balance. Â Particularly more sketchy Exchanges, but even some of the top ones.Â  I wonder how that will work with the ETF.Â  Is it truly backed 1 to 1 by Bitcoin?Â  Or is it just in theory and we will only hear about successful audits with no proper evidence to back statements with.Unless among the other reasons for approving a Bitcoin ETF or doing other such actions is a desire to help Bitcoins Decentralization too, I am highly skeptical of the scope of the product, Service or what ever it is. Â I understand that a Bitcoin ETF is only useful to those who want to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without owning Bitcoin the traditional way, which includes the 'headache' of creating a Wallet, backing it up properly et cetera.Once the Rich are in the game, to me it is not a happy life or a great purpose any more. Â Probably a great purpose to their pockets. Â But not to the future of Bitcoin. Â They have no intention to make Bitcoin a better Currency or any thing like that. Â In fact most of them wish Bitcoin would NOT exist because it takes away a chunk of their power now.I could speculate on how a Bitcoin ETF can result into a manipulation of the Bitcoin price but I do not think it is worth the effort considering I do not clearly understand what an ETF truly is. Â The point is. Â I believe the Rich are in it for a reason and it is not for the better future of Bitcoin.",
