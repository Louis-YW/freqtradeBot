In case if you lost the wallet due to data corruption, device lost or anything then you can simply import the same wallet into another device with Recovery seeds.In case if someone hacked your wallet there is no reason for them to keep the bitcoins there and if still do then just create a new wallet and move whatever funds are left in there ASAP.Blockchain wallet is non-custodial but its not really a best as you think. If are looking for alternatives to electrum then you can consider  BlueWallet  which is open source Bitcoin wallet.",

Electrum is an open source wallet. The code has been reviewed by many people and no vulnerability has been detected. Your keys are stored locally on your device and they are not kept in any server. So, we can be sure that electrum is safe enough (if it's used in the correct way). But take note that any online device is always prone to hacking. It's possible that your device is infected with a malware and it's compromised. If you want to be completely secure, you should run electrum on an airgapped device, make your transactions offline and your keys should never connect to the internet.",

How can I recover my Bitcoin with my seed phrase in case of a breach of the Electrum system? Are these downloadable wallets truly decentralized? With the use of the hot wallets, most likely it's just on the login only that there's a verification after that you can now access your wallet, if the hackers know your seed phrase they can easily use those to login into other device and use your seed phrase and steal your coins. Reason why electrum supported the use of the hardware wallet which like the Trezor and the Ledger, this wallet has another layer of confirmation for each login, and transaction so only in your device authorization can accept the transaction. If you have a budget don't conserve yourself to a layer of security.",

How did you obtain this information? If you don't know what blockchain is, it is where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. You might be just heard blockchain to any site and social media but Blockchain.com is only a blockchain explorer that offers a web wallet and their wallet is not as safe as Electrum. They have many issues with their wallet that have yet to be resolved. So you shouldn't use a blockchain wallet; instead, use Electrum, create an offline wallet, or purchase a hardware wallet. Then learn how to make raw or offline transactions, which are far safer than using an online device or a web wallet that stays connected to the internet.",
