The Odd in my Favour you said ? But the casino’s is not built to be in the Favour of the players but that of the Casino owners. No odds appears to be to be in my Favour, I just treat everyone as equal, and place my bet just as I would in other odds, sometimes smaller odds or games that appears to be in ones Favour is even the ones that are most risky to stake on, we just have to give it a try not having the favorable odd aspect in mind.",

And maybe it could be a huge price, but everything is still based on luck here, or maybe the more you play the better the chances but I don't it.But in any case, online casino's are really a boom right now. It's a tough competition and so there are new casinos that are making promotions and marketing and thanks to this community, everyone should be aware and who knows, maybe one of us here can win that big money.",

You know that it is not really what you think. Those words are up to attract you in simple terms, it's usual marketing for them.There are even casinos that do say that they're the best of the best even being made a few days ago. So, it's no biggie as these are marketing gimmicks that's typically made.@chipstars, I saw that you also made a thread for your other promo. I think just make one thread either from this one or the other one and stick into that thread for posting your events and promos like this.",

      "body": "It seems to me that your thread belongs to the Games and rounds section and does not belong in this section, that's because it is not an ann thread, it is not a discussion thread, but rather it is a thread with the aim of doing some promotion, therefore it belongs to Games and rounds section. I could see in your casino that the person who participates in this promotion must be aware that they will have to go through kyc, I have nothing against a casino asking for kyc but as long as they only ask for it when they detect any suspicious activity. and in your casino they will ask for kyc as one of the requirements for this promotionI was wondering how many people will take the risk of participating in this promotion knowing that they can earn little or not win anything and even so they have to go through kyc as a condition for this promotion, in my opinion few people will take this risk, so I see this promotion as only aimed at people who already use your casino frequently and have already gone through kyc, now for new customers I highly doubt that many new customers will appear thanks to this promotionA few days ago I saw a new casino making the same mistake, I don't know to what extent the marketing department of certain casinos have researched before creating and launching a promotion, but I must say that I am shocked by what I have seen. People like everything simple and practical and that have a chance of making a profit, and that's what attracts people. now when you have things like kyc immediately, an unclear bonus that isn't very advantageous, these types of promotions hardly attract much attention from people, this is my opinion, I could be wrong",
