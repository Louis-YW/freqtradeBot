Clicking telegram link won't do anything, you can view content without actually following, signals are posted, results are also. Of course clicking the Telegram link can do some thing and that is it will redirect you to the channel or group although you can manually type in their name in the search box of the Telegram app and view the channel/group there. It's normal that we can see the contents even without joining them. That is the difference of a telegram channel from a group but it's going to be a hassle if you are going to check them from time to time if you won't click on the join button. Another perk of joining a channel/group is that you will have the option to receive notifications.

Conversations inside telegram are also faster.",

So you are trying to create a pump group, not that I'm against it but most of them groups just generate profit for their buddies or people who pay the most is this one of them groups.  Signals just means a pump group with a fancy name.  Either way I hope.ou don't screw people over like most of these groups do.",

No matter what you have to do or any promotion that you have this will just be wasted and rejected, maybe some will fall into that but the majority will ignore you. In fact, I couldn't really imagine what is the purpose of doing signals for free because if I do that, I simply ask for money from my subscribers. No, it wasn't just free, so I don't believe that word, sorry.",

Create a tradinview account to prove your track record. If that confirms that your signals are making profit, you could just charge people for that service. Right now only reason for such a channel to exist is an attempt to have a crowd to pump your bags. AKA illegal manipulation tactic called pump & dump.If you however would have a tradingview trackrecord where you can't just erase your bad signals from the history, you would be taken seriously. If you have a system that works, you would be mad not to advertise it via tradinview account. Unless your system doesn't work, which is more plausible.",
