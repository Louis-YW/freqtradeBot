  "content": "Hi everyone,Im new to the forum and I just wanted to share my experience with Binance P2P and how I was scammed, please forgive my english its not my native language.I have been using Binance for sometime and everything was working great, until I was a victim of an elaborated scam for a lot of money using his P2P service.Basically some user made an offer in one of my advertisments and canceled inmediately, but in my payment method my telephone number was written.I got contacted after sometime by whatsapp by a guy in venezuela named\"Ramon Rangel\" he said he wanted to buy my crypto and in order to do so we should use binance so both of us will be safe.He said I had to make an offer on a specific advertisment by an user and that I had to copy paste a name and a number given by him, that this person was his friend and he will inmediately know what to do, I did as he said.Not even 3 minutes passed and i realized that the counterpart deposited the money to the number I gave to him, suddenly I understood that I gave a bank account of a third party in the chatbox, however i never specified that the funds had to be transfered there.At the beginning I thought everything was going to be alright because I never said any keyword like \"deposit in this account\", \"send money here\" or something similar, the payment method of the order was displaying my real name and my real account.I opened an appeal and I lost it, binance kept asking for \"evidence\" that I did not have, \"please show us a video accessing the account where the buyer deposited you and that you didnt receive any payment\"I told them many times that I could not access that account that it was not mine but they kept asking a video of me accesing that account.I did everything that was in my hands to provide further information, I wrote a letter, sent a video of me explaining the situation and they kept asking for the same video.I lost all my funds, binance decided to release them to the buyer.I do not know if the buyer was colluded with this person that contacted me, maybe he was, maybe notI thought my funds were safe with Binace, I never released funds before checking my bank account and never accepted payments of a third party.I was a proxy in an elaborated scam where the scammer told me to offer in an advertisment and I copied and pasted a number and a name that never matched the original payment method.Binance gave all the support to the buyer, I got ripped off, they never read or listened my case, even when I told them that the buyer deposited in an account that didnt even match the one in the purchase.All the \"advises\" that binance gave were generic and useless at this moment:1 - Please dont share your telephone number in your payment methods (which is stupid because my payment method requests a telephone number)2 - Please dont share third party accounts (I didnt even realized I was sharing a third party account)3 - Please show us the video evidence of your account not having the money (How am i supposed to show them if it was not my account?)4 - Please notify the police in your region (Cmon guys I was scammed by someone from another country)It even sounds stupid: I lost all my funds because I copied and pasted a name and a number in the chatbox without specifying anything else, buyer recklessly deposited instead of asking for confirmation or even realizing that the names in the payment method and the chatbox didnt even match.Lessons learned:- Crypto world is a cesspool full of scammers- Binance support team is crap, generic answer, no telephone to call, a lot of time to review cases, dont even try to provide arguments to them, they will keep asking for the same over and over again.- Binance owns your funds and they decide what to do with them, they say that they are not responsible for user transactions in P2P, however they are judges during an appel.- Once their CS team decides what to do with your money, you cannot do anything anymore, nobody to write or to complain, impossible to make a demand.Binance is acting like \"bank\" but without wanting to be a bank, they are actually worst than a bank, I have never seen a bank giving funds to someone that deposited to a wrong account, binance however can do it.Do you really want to keep your hard earned money in a place like this? a place where you cannot demand, where you cannot call, where they give generic answers with a bot? and where they decided what to do with your money? seriously trading in real or by whatsapp is safer,I think crypto has a lot of future ahead but not in the hands of the exchanges that exists now.I do hope for future regulations someday.",

You said he deposited the money to your number/bank whatever which means you owe the crypto to him. Then why would you even need the customer support?",

A user accepts the offer.You paste down a name and phone number in the trade. The user proceeds with the transaction using that information.Binance probably sees nothing wrong with what the user did - in fact, you're the one that looks shadier here!That might not be the truth, but those are the optics for whatever support agent handled your case.You did get conned, but that's why trading platforms demand stringent caution.Here's how someone in your situation could have been a legitimate scammer with your grievances:Fake those third-party message logs requesting c&p, either beforehand with a sockpuppet account or afterward with image tools/imitation apps, to an account you control.Create a trade offer with your original information, but message your trading party the details from the logs.Pretend that you got scammed to Binance support to get your crypto back after the trade.",

It was fault on your part that you copy paste a number and name which was not yours. You could have pasted the name only, why did you pasted the number of a payment method which was not yours. When dealing with financial transactions and especially online ones, you need to be extra careful and think twice before performing any step. A simple mistake like you have done, could cost you a big financial loss.",

Didn't you find his request to copy-paste a name and a number is a bit strange? Didn't you ask your self why he asked you to do that?If you were OK with the rate the buyer was was offering then why didn't you trade with him directly (without the need for a middleman)?Quotebuyer recklessly deposited instead of asking for confirmation or even realizing that the names in the payment method and the chatbox didnt even matchI've been using binance p2p a lot recently and can guarantee you that most merchants don't check if the payment details matches the name registered on binance(although it's a must according to binance p2p user transaction policy). They process a lot of orders and just don't have enough time for that.",

Don't know until to what point you sent the crypto, or whether the scammers sent the money first, I don't know. Until when your case was made public, I just found out that a phone number is needed in Binance p2p transactions just for communication.

If the amount involve is huge then maybe they the affected person should file a case so that binance will cooperate then this guys will be in jail.",

He got scammed in a pretty lame way, so here is the TLDR1. The scammer got his mobile phone number2. Scammer called and he offered him a very good deal with a trader, telling him that in order to get that deal he must tell he was referred by him by copy-pasting his name and a number in chat3. OP entered the chatbox, and copy-pasted not only the referral name but also the scammer's bank account4. The scammer sent the money to that bank account which was obviously his and took the coins tooOP can't do anything because he entered in the chat the scammer's payment details instead of his own, so Binance can't do a thing. Imagine that everyone would claim tomorrow that the own payment details he entered in chat are not his own..Quote from: cryptomaniac_xxx on November 13, 2022, 10:25:26 AM3. So I make a trade with him4. I received a sms message saying that I got the local money already (I didn't check my wallet, that's my fault)Sorry for the loss but didn't you find it weird, as I assume you had multiple transactions that there was a different number and no sense id? Of course, I might be wrong but here all the banks have a sender ID and you can't buy any name resembling a bank from any SMS provider.",
