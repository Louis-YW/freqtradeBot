      "body": "Although the domain was purchased in 2020, I have never heard of this platform before, nor has it been listed on any of the famous crypto sites: https://www.whois.com/whois/moneta365.comI have not tried the platform yet, but I want to point out that in addition to the advantages that you mentioned, there is a recommendation text at the top of the site’s main page, which reads as follows:QuoteOur exchange office performs automatic AML verification of all incoming transactions using specialized services. In the event that the transaction is identified as high-risk (darknet, mixer, gambling, sanctions list, etc.), we reserve the right to suspend the exchange operation to verify your identity and source of funds.Can you explain to us the tools and methods used to suspect the source of deposits, especially those referred to as “darknet” and also gambling?I believe that according to this text, any deposit transaction can be suspected and frozen pending verification. I also want to ask the question according to this text ; Will KYC verification procedures not be imposed during registration, and will it only be if one of the deposit transactions is suspected?",

      "body": "I like instant exchanges for their simplicity and relatively instant transfers, and here are my takeaways about yours. 1) You have handful of cryptos available, others have it in hundreds minimum, few go in thousands. 2) Minimum amounts to exchange are high. 3) 30 minutes in and support agent haven't replied yet. It should be faster than that, try to keep response time within 5 minutes. I understand you asked for my email and I will receive mail when your agent responds but it's different when you can do queries instantly with a live agent.",
