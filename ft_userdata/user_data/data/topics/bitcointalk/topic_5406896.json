  "content": "I am trying to find alternatives to withdraw some of my Bitcoin to my credit card after so many exchanges keep asking really really extremely private details from where you get the money,nevertheless I provided them all needed details and they say status is verifying transaction.I saw at bestchange.com that when you give Bitcoin you had an option to receive to your credit card,it was a site among many others which I liked their simplicity and is the website in the title of this thread coinshop24.org,I don't mind selling Bitcoin for 21.000 dollars when the actual rate is 23.000 or a bit more but I want to be sure they are no scam,the reviews were all positive but thought before trying to ask the forum as I make no deal without reading some reviews here.",

      "body": "I never used it before. Bestchange tries as much as possible to vet exchangers that they partner with, but the tricky part is when that KYC and AML policies come in. Even if the exchanger has good reviews, I think it's better to extensively read the ToS especially parts involving KYC and AML so that as you sign up, you know what kind of exchanger you're dealing with.",

For a long time now, all registries offer free WHOIS, it's not a big deal since is enough just to check a box through registration.the fact that they don't respond to emails does not show a line of professionalism, maybe even the email from the sender ended up in spam, which they didn't check in time. the number of visits to the site is also not a measure of whether someone is honest.I'm rather interested in how it is that all the feedbacks on the BestChange page are in Russian. even those that came from non-Russian IP addresses. looks like they used VPN for the fake positive feedback.https://www.bestchange.ru/coinshop24-exchanger.htmlfor example:",
