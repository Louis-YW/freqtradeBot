He has already tried to keep the gas prices down, so can save his popularity among the citizens, he may be scared OPEC timing could play against the incoming presidential elections in the United States.",

I was surprised to see that this is still a news today or the news that I've read before was just the plan of cutting the production and it has just came into reality this time? I thought that we're already gonna see a shed of light that the prices were already cut down for the past months. But then, just like the usual thing to be expected, it won't be forever at the low and now is the time for them to increase the price through this cutting off. Oh my, 2023. There's also the news that Saudi Arabia is planning to go with the BRICS. That might be another factor for us to see whether it'll be a positive or negative impact to the oil prices.",

It's a different era now though, Saudi Arabia has been growing richer all this time and the new ruler MBS is looking out for himself only. He was probably very annoyed to be embarrassed after killing that journalist inside the embassy in Turkey, showing he is not beyond stooping to new lows in seeking to punish people who he thinks have wronged him - this put him directly at odds with democracy.We also saw that he is mending ties with Iran now, probably as a method to get more leverage in the region and is tilting towards China - who have a big appetite for energy resources and no moral qualms getting in the way due to their equal authoritarian stance.",

Thanks to this era of great technology, which is rapidly spreading in every sector of life, Tesla has already developed vehicles that we can drive around without needing any form of petroleum, which is a moving development. We also have solar systems as a backup power supply, which is also less time consuming, less stressful, and in some countries, less expensive. Currently, we also have generators that regenerate powers and store them for later use. Let them try to manipulate the oil market as high as they want; it will only affect us and a few other citizens who are not exposed to the latest technology, and in those areas where we can't actually do without the need for petroleum.",

America will lose control if Saudi Arabia stops using the dollar, and Saudi Arabia's presence in OPEC was one of the most important guarantees for this. In fact, Saudi Arabia stopping production within OPEC affects the global economy, not just the United States.For its part, Saudi Arabia does not have an interest in entering into a confrontation with the United States, especially since its foreign currency reserves are in dollars.",

Russia ain't the US supporting Crypto, China supporting crypto even aiming to lead with the Hong Kong crypto hub project, India Wolrds the biggest market supporting crypto on some level, Sudi Arabia holds huge stakes in the crypto market UAE we all know their contribution in the crypto. So all over it, a new block is being created by China that is somehow related to the crypto market and this is why many believe this bull run will be going to be supported by the Asian Market.",

I am sure that the members of BRICS such as China and India will still enjoy discounted crude. But this influence will not last for too long because crude oil will soon become obsolete.That is true about Joe Biden, but Joe Biden also is not dependent on oil from Saudi Arabia and hence couldn't care less. What if he was the president of a country that is mostly relying on oil for its industry and also for households? If I see this correctly the USA is still heavily relying on fossil fuels, even for the production of electricity. I am sure they are all for renewables and are speeding up the process, but up until shortly ago the US still has been a net importer of oil, but is now very close to being fully independent in terms of the numbers according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.But it can't be denied that there are countries in the world that are still fully dependent on oil imports. For them any cut in the provision of oil is bad news, but I assume that the US still doesn't care because they would probably be able to increase production themselves and export it. Though I have no idea whether importing oil from the US is a lot more expensive than importing from the countries mentioned by OP. In the end what this cut does is it accelerates the development and innovation in the renewable energy sector. The day will come where these oil rich countries won't benefit from their oil anymore, but that is exactly the reason why many of them have been investing their money all over the world in companies and infrastructure and they have done it while almost going unnoticed. I think many of them are all set even when they couldn't sell any oil in 10-15 years from now. It would be interesting to do some further research on how much the oil rich countries already own in the world.",
