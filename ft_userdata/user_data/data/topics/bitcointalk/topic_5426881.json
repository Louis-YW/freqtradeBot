      "body": "your offer is very poorly made. you ask for a minimum of $250 for the service, without a precise explanation of what you do and who you really are. so let me ask.what exactly is your service? Hosting or DDoS protection or internet communication or all of them? Also, what is \"Prometon\"? Software, company or service...?who offers this service, an individual or a company? if it is a company, where is it located and where are the servers located? The minimum cost is $250, but what does the user get for that? software license, server or just a conversation on Telegram?Does all communication go via Telegram? isn't that a bit risky for potential buyers? Sounds like a scam.Since we don't know anything about you, I must agree there is complete anonymity, but what about your potential users? what kind of guarantee do they have for anonymity and security of data by random Telegram username?I will quote this for reference.Quote from: Prometon Service on December 08, 2022, 11:55:23 AMGood day, we present to your attention the service for protection against network attacks with anonymity and system support \"Prometon\".Prometon is a service created to support the crypto industry.

And is that $250 per year or per month?",
