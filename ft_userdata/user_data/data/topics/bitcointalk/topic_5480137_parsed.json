  "content": "Maybe this is another in a series of topics about how the fees are too high these days, but considering that a lot of members are literally disappointed that they can't use Bitcoin the way it should be used, maybe we should clarify some things so that everyone would not continue to pretend that we live in a world where we should continue to expect that Bitcoin will become a global means of payment that will be used by just about everyone.Bitcoin has long since become a money-making machine, and in order for the machine to work well and be profitable, it needs to be given a little extra energy from time to time, even if this means that it will have a negative impact on its main task. While the average user who just wants to send an on-chain transaction has problems and is looking for a solution to the problem in a single free transaction accelerator, let's try to summarize who all benefits from the fact that fees have exploded.Miners certainly benefit from what I personally call \"ordinal madness\", and suffice it to say that in recent days the rewards per block amounted to over 10 BTC, and considering that the reward without fees is 6.25 BTC, it is clear how much their profit has increased. Without going into any conspiracy theories, isn't it logical to think that some of them (miners) have their fingers in all of this? Who knows, maybe we'll find out one day.CEXs (centralized exchanges) also benefit from high fees, not only because they can increase their service fees more than necessary, but because high fees discourage most of their clients from withdrawing Bitcoin to their non-custodial wallets. Let no one be fooled that the people behind such companies have any good intentions towards Bitcoin, they only care about profit and they don't care what they will generate it from, that's why they support hundreds of shitcoins without any problems regardless of what they know that bunch of people will lose their money trading with that garbage.Creators of altcoins who will use every opportunity to say that their project is better than Bitcoin and that their transactions cost only $0.01 and that you should invest in their project. What they will not tell you is that the security of their transactions is so great that you have to wait for several days to be sure that your transaction will not be messed up in some way.Economic and financial experts are perhaps the last, but no less important in this story. For them, moments like this are a time in which they rejoice because they think that the idea of Bitcoin as a currency is collapsing before our eyes, and of course they say this all the time. On the other hand, they have nothing against Bitcoin being \"used\" to generate profit, which again leads us to the fact that the idea of Bitcoin as a currency should be \"killed\" in every possible way, and on the other hand, trading should be encouraged.In the end, it's no secret that the whole world has its foundations in centralization, and above all, finances are important because they control people most effectively. Bitcoin as an idea is dangerous in that sense and I have no doubt that \"they\" will do everything to reduce that idea to mere trading and nothing more than that.However, you should not be pessimistic because I believe that there are millions of those who own Bitcoin and they will not give up so easily, and if we have ever been at an advantage, it is today, because we understood what Bitcoin is much before them and we have much more of it than them. If they want it, I tell them \"the price is $10 million per BTC\" and only if you ask me nicely",

I don’t agree with the bolded part above as I believe it is probably a typo from you. I don’t see bitcoin been used as a currency for transactions due to the recent high transaction fees most especially for small scale transactions rather an asset for investment because of its ability to hedge against inflation making it a store of value.

The exchanges are charging a high fee for faster confirmation and I am not sure whether they have any hidden charges.

Also, the world will not agree to a decentralized asset and there will always be individual countries' currencies, which is why fiat will always remain. The to-and-fro exchange of the two is good as we see now, and I believe it will continue to remain so.But for cross-border payments, Bitcoin has done what most fiats can't do even with the current fee issues, it effectively replaced it, my friend. I have moved money through a wire transfer and was charged about $59 due to the correspondent banks involved. This is as some countries will disallow my country to use some fiat services to send money speedily and cheaply thereby forcing me to pay more and wait more. It can't be that bad now, so Bitcoin is trying so well in this regard. But developers should help to make people be prouder of the coin.",

However, I am confident and optimistic that the problem of high Bitcoin transaction fees will return to normal. I'm sure it will be finished in about two months.",
