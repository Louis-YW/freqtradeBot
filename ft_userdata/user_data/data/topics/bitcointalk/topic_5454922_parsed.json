Then ask ask again once the site is in final stage before its official launch because we cannot give you enough comment if the site has minimal info on it. Tried to register earlier and it doesn't work using mobile phone.",

What is the point of asking for members to comment on a site that is still under construction  You won't get as much input as that of a site that is at least functional. You would even get the benefit of some members doing the beta testing for you. Hell I just signed up on your site and even agreed to the terms and conditions that are not there and I have an account now.",

At this stage, you can receive suggestions, but we cannot provide you with more,  it is better to lock this topic or change to Proposals.",

It's discouraging to see the landing page asking to log in while most casinos will allow you to explore their platforms.",
