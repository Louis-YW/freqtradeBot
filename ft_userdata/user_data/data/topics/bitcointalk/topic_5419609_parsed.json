In that case, it's better not to.I would also advise you not to do that, because the probability that something will go wrong is high, and that will surely cause you to be blamed and ultimately bad relations after all. recommend some of the exchanges to them, let them be your referrals and that's all.in the end, it's their money and they need to worry about it, not you.",

I was in a similar situation in the past and I can say that I regretted telling some people that it would be wise to invest in Bitcoin, because some were careless and lost their backup or were hacked, others invested much more than they could afford to lose...At the end of the day, they all blame whoever gave them the idea to invest in something like that, so I advise you not to get involved in such things, let everyone be responsible for their money and what they will do with it.What is even more problematic in your case is that this is not only about investing in Bitcoin, but about which coin to invest in. This is equal to gambling, because there is no doubt that some projects will pay off, but many more will fail very quickly.",

You can teach them how to invest (and learn yourself from credible sources) but I don't think you should invest for them - there's no way they can learn from that either.Taking the security precautions of 8 people as one person also isn't something you should try to do, what if you end up losing everything because you did something wrong (especially if you're fairly new here).Investing in coins that aren't btc is also going to be a unnecessary task as you're likely going to lose money..",

I've experienced something like this and I highly recommend that you don't accept requests from them (to manage their money), I have lost 2 closest people because I used to manage their money but the bear market and the value of their assets decreased made them think I cheated them.They will think you look arrogant at first for refusing their request but in the future, you will still maintain a good relationship with them. The point is don't pretend to be a hero over other people's lives, especially when it has a relationship with money.",

It is not a good idea to invest with friends and family members, because if something goes wrong you will see their true colors very soon, regardless of what they say right now. So, I would kindly advice you to be extra careful dealing with your friends and family.Risk is inherent in any type of investment and speculation, that may not satisfy their expectations and/or needs. In the end, be honest with them if your goal is to maintain a good relationship. If they want you to handle the work, don't promise them a profit, but point out the risks involved and explain that you cannot guarantee anything. It is not your job to guarantee that they will get something out of it, so don't make false promises. Instead, explain what you are doing and why you think it is a good idea, then let them decide whether they want to invest or not. If they still want to invest, then be sure that they understand the risks involved in doing so.",

If you invest in bitcoin then it has to be long term (a couple of years at least) and they may not have enough patience to wait years to see profit more so if the price drops and they are in a loss (like buying at $4000 then price falls to $3200 like it happened in the past).If you invest in altcoins then you are taking an even bigger risk since they are pump and dumps and you may actually end up losing a large portion of their money which you won't be able to recover either.It simply is not worth the troubles. Just tell them to educate themselves and if they wanted they should buy bitcoin and store it in a safe place (like a paper wallet). You can help them in creating the cold storage.",

But before telling them that, you should clearly explain to them all the advantages of bitcoin has over some other altcoins, so they have all the info and can decide it by themselves.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 06, 2022, 12:00:36 PMAfter thinking this through and through I started feeling like they are doing this to hold me responsible if something goes wrong. If you really feel like that, I would suggest to sustain giving any advice on what to buy and instead focus only on educating them about cryptocurrencies, like where to buy, how to safely store etc and leave decision to them.",

First ask those friends and family members how long they are willing to hodl if the have intentions of long term investment then put all in Bitcoin while the wait but first there should be a legal agreement  so no one puts you under duress to how the investment is going. Stick to Bitcoin if the agree on a long term investment.Since it looks too obvious they will want to hodl you responsible if things goes wrong avoid shitcoins even if they persuade you to try a few shitcoin keep your investment lone and it should be strictly on Bitcoin",

First of all, I wouldn't do this at any cost because mixing up family, friend emotional bond with finance always bring bitter experience which even many successful investors advised to the people.And if you are still want to be a person to invest for them then first point you need to make sure is those people understand the risk associated with the investment and it can completely goes to zero at any cost so ask them what will be their choice if the investment goes ultimately on the negative side.When they accept the outcome then you hold much greater responsibility because its others money so I won't like high risk just go with bitcoin for long term.",
