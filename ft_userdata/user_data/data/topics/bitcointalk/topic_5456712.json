Faucets are a waste of time. Yes, it was a bit easier in the past. I could join a signature campaign with only 39 posts. Spammers have ruined this pretty much for Newbies though and if they continue I am afraid they will ruin it for all of us. This is not the topic though, sorry for the distraction. You dont believe me that I joined a campaign as Newbie? Well I can proof it to you and I can show you how. By signing a message.The post quoted below was written by shorena. It was not edited and it contains a bitcoin address. If you click on its link you will see that it has no dotted line below the time and date. See here for an edited post. I changed it today. Here is a picture.Quote from: Z_MBFM on June 11, 2023, 04:27:29 PMHere is mine.

So what, a signed message, you might think, but its very important here if you want to trade with someone. There are currently at least 3 accounts in the meta section that are contested. The main problem with all of them is: someone was unable to sign a message, someone did not request a signed message for a trade or someone has no idea how to sign a message. I will try my very best to show you how to sign a message and how to verify a signed message. For this I will use pictures as I know not everyone here speaks english. I will also update this thread over time.If you want to get your address witnessed somewhere for the future, use this thread by Tomatocage -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=996318.0Someone will quote your post there to make sure a hacker that has control over your account can not change it. Make sure you only post addresses you can sign a message with. You can use this thread to test signing message, I will verify them all and Im sure other users will chime in when I am not online as well.If you want to thank me because this thread has helped you, post a signed message. If you just tell me it helped you, Ill probably think you never even bothered to read this.Index:IntroFormatDos and Don'ts\"multi-sig\" or pay to script hash addresses (those with the 3)Creating a signature (ordered by date [oldest 1st])Bitcoin Core version v0.10.0Electrum v 1.9.8 (& 2.5.4)MultiBit v 0.5.18MultiBit HD v 0.1Blockchain.infoBlockchain.info v2Mycelium 2.3.0 - 2.5.2 on Android LollipopCoinbaseBither v.1.3.7.1Ledger Wallet Bitcoin v.1.10.1 (thx 2 JeremyB!)Trezor Wallet (thx 2 JeremyB!)Verifying a signature (in alphabetical order)BlocktrailBrainwallet.orgChain Query Alphacoinig.comTrezor (thx 2 JeremyB!)TranslationsLicense (CC BY-SA 3.0)Services/wallets that can (currently) not be used to sign a messageANX Vault v. 1.6 for iOS 7.1.2Bitcoin Vault for iOS 7.1.2BitGo.com (2016.07.31)Bither Hot v 1.3.9 for iOS 7.1.2Bither Hot v 1.6.1 for Android 6.0.1 with HD WalletbitWallet for iOS 7.1.2BitX Wallet 1.2.6 for iOS 7.1.2Blockchain.info v6.1.38 for Android 6Breadwallet by Aaron Voisine for iOS 7.1.2Breadwallet v34 for Android 6BTC wallet by freewallet.org v1.0.38 for Android 6Coinbase for iOS 7.1.2Coinbase for AndroidCoinomi v1.6.5 for Android 6Coins v0.1 for iOS 7.1.2Coins.ph v1.31 B 84 for iOS 7.1.2Coins.ph v2.6.08 for Andoird 6Copay v. 1.1.3 for Windows (tested with 8.1 Pro 64 bit)Copay v. 1.1.3 for Linux (tested with Ubuntu 14.04.

If you sign a generic message it could be reused by someone else.When you sign a message you want to present it to someone else and they want to verify the message. In order to make this extra easy its important to use a certain format. You can modify it as needed, but there are certain things to keep in mind.Every symbol is important. The symbols > and < in my examples have to be removed. When you sign a message and somewhere have two spaces between two words, both are important for the signature. Thats the whole point of a signature. It detects whether someone changed the message or not. The board here has a \"code\" environment thats perfect for this. It will make sure no linebreaks are added and the other person can easily copy it. I used the same format above.If you write a post/PM it should look like on the picture below:and for everyone else reading, it looks like this:Code:-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----<insert message here>-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----<insert address here><insert signature here>-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----I added an example how to post the signed message for the blockchain.info part here.Dos and Don'ts:return to indexDO include the current date. This ensures the signature can not be reused on a different day.DO include the reason and be specific. This ensures the signature can not be resued for a different reason.DO include your nickname and where you use it. This ensures the signature can not be reused, e.g. by Shorena on AcmeCorpTalk.DO NOT use a compromised machine (virus, keylogger, etc.) to create a signature. Signing unlocks your wallets protection the same way spending bitcoin does. DO NOT upload your private key somewhere in order to create a signature. DO NOT give your private key to someone else in order to create a signature for you. You think something is missing here? Leave a reply below.Pay to script hash (P2SH) addresses:return to indexThere is no way for pay to script hash addresses without private key (yes, they are possible) to sign a message. For multi-sig-addresses (a subset of P2SH addresses) there are private keys, but there is no consistent definition on how a signature for a message would be verified. Thus, its impossible to sign a message with an address starting with a 3 in a realiable way. With the addition of P2SH-P2WPKH addresses (SegWit, but starting with a 3) this did not change. At least it did not in bitcoin core, other wallets may still allow signing or verification.Creating a Signature:return to indexBitcoin Core version v0.10.0return to indexlink to picture -> https://talkimg.com/images/2023/06/18/HS7zm.pngElectrum v 1.9.8return to indexNote: Electrum 2.3.1 and 2.5.4 are exactly the same in this regard.link to picture -> https://talkimg.com/images/2023/06/18/HSB0J.png   MultiBit v 0.5.18return to indexlink to picture -> https://talkimg.com/images/2023/06/18/HSimC.pngMultiBit HD v 0.1return to indexlink to picture -> https://talkimg.com/images/2023/06/18/HS8Jb.pngBlockchain.inforeturn to indexNote: Blockchain.info is an online wallet, thus their interface could change.

You didn't read the first part about OP saying that he/she is not the owner where OP only reposted the topic with the images that are now visible because images uploaded on imgur are no longer displayed. In order to make it display again is that OP used different host image such as talkimg and other similar websites. My guess why OP reposted this could be the thread of OgNasty where he rewards merit when you sign a message correctly and by the way, the thread is now locked but OgNasty created a new thread that is now self-moderated thread for a reason and I think it is helpful because some forum members abused OgNasty's generosity by applying alt accounts or whatever they can think of just to get merited.Quote from: aysg76 on June 21, 2023, 03:59:06 PM<......>It is now locked (the old one) because OgNasty created a new thread that is self-moderatedThis is the new one https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5300698.0",
