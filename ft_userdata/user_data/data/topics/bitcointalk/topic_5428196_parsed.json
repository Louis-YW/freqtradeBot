Really?I understand that this happens in practically all licensed casinos in the Caribbean. They put some AML/KYC conditions in their ToS that they very rarely comply with because they know it would screw up their business. At least that's what I've heard, although I have no way of checking if it's true, other than asking people who gamble and pass the supposed limits.",

Thus, Kryptosino reinforces once again their friendly environment by not processing KYC. Of course, in extreme situations – whether for security or suspicion of illegal activities, aka money laundering – you could be asked to provide some information.Isn't the Caribbean Island, one of the countries, where the KYC system is not questioned by Kryptosino, I think if they don't Due Diligence especially in your case, I'm sure they suspect you as an illegal user.However, if you still insist that you are right, they are wrong in terms of AML/KYC violations, maybe you can leave your complaint in the review, I'm sure they will respond to your complaint.",

BTCGosu has a \"Blacklisted Bitcoin Casinos\" page: https://www.btcgosu.com/bitcoin-casino-blacklist/. but this casino is not on that list.As I get it he is complaining that this casino is not enforcing KYC... I guess he is in the wrong place, most of us don't like KYC.",

      "body": "KYC and AML Due Diligence are completely separate.  KYC is expected by the Regulator which is now Curaçao Gaming Control Board.  But they would also be interested in any AML Breach.  I can't provide the evidence here as all evidence from the player's involved has been passed over to the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force.  The laws and regulations state that anyone depositing or wagering over $2500 must go through the Customer Due Diligence checks to make sure they are not laundering money.  The Casino is responsible for this and they were allowing customers to wager over $50,000 and not once has Due Diligence or KYC been performed.  Its extremely worrying that these kind of amounts are being wagered without requesting any documentation.  When I raised this directly with Kryptosino they decided to ignore the correspondence.   This is why it has now been passed to CFATF.  I believe 2 weeks is enough time to defend yourself and not one single response from Kryptosino.I will keep this thread upto date with any further developments",

I don't see any logic in stop using less popular gambling platforms. Like you want to use those shitty popular platforms that continuously scam customers but grow massively just because they are massively popular for their marketing campaigns. You are confusing two different words, popular and reputation. I will go for a new, fair, and well-reputed platform but not a popular platform.",

Exactly and the more reason why I can not trust all those small casinos with my documents, is that one can not guarantee whether they're going to be used for identity theft scams since there don't have the security to protect those data.Most of those casinos, just provide kyc just to get licensed after that whatever the player does is left on the check.",
