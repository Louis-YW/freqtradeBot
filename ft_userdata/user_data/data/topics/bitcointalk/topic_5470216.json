  "content": "Quality bitcoin mixer (or derivative -- LTC, DOGE, et al) here that I'm not currently using due to business partner suddenly disappearing on me.  You can view a demo at the below links.  Please note, I did go bline 6 years ago hence it does need a theme overlay, but theme engine within Apex (https://apexpl.io/) is very straight forward and any designer will easily pick it up.Homepage: https://mixer.envrin.com/Example Mixer Status:  https://mixer.envrin.com/status/mjovfd8qWzqMjiufnfg3tpu9mYbhoFCS1y Admin Panel:  https://mixer.envrin.com/admin/Typical coin mixer with some nice additional features.  No user registration required, you just submit your payment address you'd like mixed funds sent to and are redirected to a mixer status page as linked above.  Users can continue sending funds to their mixing address anytime they'd like, or have a new mixing address generated.Also supports premium mixing at a higher fee allowing user to specify multiple payment addresses instead of just one.  The system will randomize the output amounts and send one transaction to each.  Also has a REST API allowing website owners to modify their software system and have incoming funds automatically mixed.Obviously, needs to get skinned with decent theme.  Functionality is 100% though,  I'm blind so unable to do the theme myself, but do have an excellent designer base in Reno if necessary.  Otherwise, theme engine is very straight forward and any designer can easily pick it up.If you have the right audience, these are excellent passive income earners.  You do literally nothing except watch funds come in.  Lots of utility for porn and other grey / black hat areas as well.  For example, maybe you run a web cam site that allows tipping to models via crypto.  Add a little checkbox that says, \"For additional privacy, mix my coins before tipping\", and have it bounce off the built-in JSON API off the coin mixer.  Would be more than happy to help you get setup with that type of thing.If anyone is interested, please drop an e-mail to matt@apexpl.io for my WhatsApp / Telegram info.  Looking forward to it.",
