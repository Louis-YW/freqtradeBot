  "content": "They promote themselves as:QuoteBestChange.com is a free online service that helps to find exchangers with the best currency rates.And they state this:QuoteEvery exchanger presented on our website has been thoroughly checked before listing, and the BestChange team constantly monitors exchangers' services quality. This minimizes risks when making financial transactions in exchangers listed on our website. Should an exchanger fail to properly fulfill its obligations, a number of measures would be taken against it which stimulate the exchanger to solve the issue as fast as possible.Actually, they list only exchangers with referral program and all they care are their referral earnings. If you take a look at exchangers list, most of them are with 0 (ZERO!) negative reviews, because if you post negative review they invite the exchanger to comment and all that exchanger have to to is to click \"cancel claim\" and your negative review becomes a comment. Today I have found that there are many exchangers listed there with more \"comments\" then positive reviews, but they are still listed.Some exchangers, like Changelly, next to it's name have icon which shows:\"This exchanger can require verification of client's documents\", meaning that they might ask for KYC.But when other exchangers who does not have this icon ask for KYC, freeze the money, like in MY CASE, they won't do anything and they will take exchangers side because they are the ones who are paying them.They have multiple domains:bestchange.combestchange.ru and mirror bestchange.netProfile links: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1073450https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1978649Threads on Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3309245https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5179115Signature campaign:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5217201.0",

Are you saying Bitcoin isn't fungible?Quote from: http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-adam3us-fungibility-privacy/Coin validation proposed to offer as a service to trace coins and try to give you a rating about how the history of the coin from your point of view and to offer that as a service to businesses. I think this could be quite dangerous because it goes back to that 17th century court case where now you could receive a coin that is perfectly valid at the time that you receive it, but a few weeks later a crime is uncovered and now your coin is tainted. So if this coin validation service is advicing many of the merchants where you would want to spend your coin at, it's tainted and now the merchant would refuse to accept your coin. That's a strange experience for you; you're holding a coin that you might have to sell at a discount to get rid of it. The aggregate effect of this might create a run on the bitcoin price. So it reopens this long-set legal principle that currency or currency units are all equal.Quote from: rokuen on May 09, 2022, 06:14:21 PMservice which i wanted to top up blocked my account.The solution is simple: don't use services that tell you your Bitcoin is different than another Bitcoin.Quote from: LoyceV on May 10, 2022, 03:55:14 PMQuote from: rokuen on May 09, 2022, 07:29:52 PMQuote from: LoyceV on May 09, 2022, 07:03:44 PMQuote from: rokuen on May 09, 2022, 06:14:21 PMtainted btcWhat's that?

The exchanger you named is one of the largest on over-the-counter and such appeals are the matter of exception.In any case, your situation requires our involvement. We will certainly get in touch with the service representatives to find out the technical details of your transaction and offer them to change the counterparty, if necessary, if they use some compromised custodial service to store bitcoin.Please send us the transaction address and, if possible, the order number in this service, so that we could check the information in blockchain and request the details from netex24.BestChange supports the (crazy) idea that 1BTC≠1BTC, which is a huge threat to Bitcoin and it's users.",

BestChange could mark these exchanges they redirect to, in a way or another, but... there will still be some who fail to read the signs and such classification may also not be great for the business.What has happened to OP is pretty much not unique also.I don't understand why people don't read everything thoroughly before sending their money here and there.I don't understand why people don't test new services with smaller amounts of money, which don't have the potential to \"hurt the budget\" much in case things go wrong.Since the service OP was using has stated that it uses KYC/AML, it's somewhat at the limit between scam/stealing and not (although I guess that there's a bigger chance they keep those funds instead of sending them to the authorities).

I wouldn't be surprised if they use this as an excuse to keep funds for themselves, AKA stealing. It's not as if they know Bob stole the Bitcoins from Alice, and they return them to Alice. So what's the plan after announcing some Bitcoins as \"tainted\"?Also, I'm concerned about what LoyceV said and what i've seen for myself.Quote from: LoyceV on July 01, 2022, 09:42:55 AMNote that the feedback has been bumped 48 times: BestChange allows the exchanger to cancel the claim (this happened 20 times).

Whether you want it or not, but if you wish to exchanger bitcoin to dollars or rubles, you have to be so kind as to comply with the rules for handling fiat currencies, and they imply a tough policy of AML legislation in many countries of the world. With that, if you make deals within the crypto community nobody and never will censor your operations, this is the essence of decentralization.Meanwhile, you want to shift the principles of decentralization to centralized services, such as exchanges, exchangers and simple shops operating in KYC-enabled jurisdictions. This position is quite popular and understandable, but it is fundamentally wrong and contrary to the laws of many countries.Use bitcoin within cryptocurrency ecosystem, and don’t try to exchange it to fiat currency, then you won’t have to complaint at “AML-discrimination”.Quote from: icopress on July 01, 2022, 10:49:25 AMKnowing the mentality of the country in whose jurisdiction such a legal exchanger is opened, I can say with 100% probability that not a single confiscated amount will be transferred to the authorities under any circumstances.

This is why we have an automatic system that switches the exchanger off when it has several active claims. We understand that this is a somewhat old-fashioned scheme of work with financial claims, but it was implemented for the sake of protection from \"consumer terrorism\" in the absence of our moderators.Currently, our staff number has increased sufficiently to process the majority of these cases manually, that’s why we are already working on changing this system — soon exchangers will have a very limited number of attempts to lift a claim on their own, without our interference.

This is tricky. A part of Neuromarketing. Nothing wrong with Neuromarketing but your approach is misleading. You are giving the users a look that there are all positive about the exchanges you list. An internet user who do not have time to look at every details for different sites, do not know how different exchange sites function in details, mostly they are your visitor. They see everything good about all the site you listed. It does not always raise in mind that why there are no negative for the sites listed, they check for the best exchange rate. They see reviews but easily miss the part of no negative review, eye balls are are always on the numbers of positive reviews. They do not see any negative for the selected exchange too because eye balls are always in the positive ones. They make the exchange.So, even you are saying this is not the best UX but this is obviously misleading approach. I do not think loyal visitors which you think regular apply for site like yours. In a site like this (listing sites) internet users do not spend much time. They know the site exists, visit, find the service, leave the site. Almost all the users in your site do not really need to know how the site functions entirely. They only see the first page and the data left on the table. It is important that you present your data correctly.I am not blaming you for anything. A service always can not serve everyone as the client expects. Thing can go wrong sometimes which is absolutely fine when there is intention to make it correct. I think you really need to improve this feedback part and be real. Right now this is not a real feedback system, not from the look of it.",

Make it 4/128/512 instead of 0/132/512. That looks much more honest.If they only keep positive feedbacks as \"reviews\" then thats plain shilling. Just my opinion.A suggestion:Before cancelling claims, how about asking the customer if he agrees to cancel his claim or how about having a buffer like number of days so if the customer failed to respond if he/she agrees to void his claim, it will not be a dead end.",

That's very shady!QuoteAllowing OpenChange to repeatedly close his claim despite it being unresolved is incredibly shady.BestChange helps scammers to hide the truth. I'm starting to think this may deserve a Newbie warning Flag:QuoteDue to various concrete red flags, I believe that anyone dealing with this user has a high risk of losing money. (This flag will only be shown to guests/newbies.)@BestChange: any chance you can make your business more customer-centered? If an exchange has negative reviews: show them! Make it 4/128/512 instead of 0/132/512. That looks much more honest.Also: since you've mentioned \"AML legislation\" a few times, why are you advertising exchangers with only an email address to identify them? Example:Quote from: LoyceV on July 01, 2022, 08:34:07 AMOpenchange.cash's Contact page shows an email address. No phone number, no company address, no country of origin.Despite this, the anonymous site demands KYC from their customers. I don't think that's right.I agree with this 100%. @Best Change, you know I have a good opinion of you, at least so far, and I also think this case can't just be left at that.",

      "body": "Quote from: LoyceV on July 03, 2022, 09:06:06 AMBestChange helps scammers to hide the truth.Out of curiosity, I clicked through some other exchanges they list with a perfect 100% feedback rating. Here's an example: https://www.bestchange.com/exwallets-exchanger.htmlWith 8 pages of feedback, and 30 pieces of feedback per page, this exchange has ~240 pieces of feedback. It is rated 0/57, meaning it has ~183 claims against it which it has simply cancelled and therefore do not show up in its ratings. It is incredibly misleading, and I agree, bordering on scam territory, for BestChange to allow these exchanges to simply nullify any and all complaints against them without any kind of resolution or verification the complaint has been settled.A cynical person might suggest that BestChange allow this to happen since they are paid commission from all these exchanges, and so it is in their own interest to continue allowing users to be scammed by them despite a huge number of red flags.",
