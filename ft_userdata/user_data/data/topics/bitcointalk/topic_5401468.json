  "content": "After many discussions in Announcing Wasabi Wallet 2.0 and elsewhere, I came to the conclusion that we need a community-curated summarized list of untrustworthy services that I call 'taint-proclaiming services'.These services ignore one of Bitcoin's fundamental values of being fungible, usable and acceptable everywhere and anywhere. They each come up with their own arbitrary set of taint rules by which they allow themselves not only to deny your Bitcoins, but also to steal them from you and / or directly share your data with government agencies. Some people may not be aware of this, some may accept it for the convenience of the service in question, and others may prefer to stop using these services.I'd like to encourage everyone who had such an experience or a reliable news article about something like this happening, to share it and I'll add it to the list.|Paxos Exchange|Rejects mixed funds|Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/another-crypto-exchange-discourages-the-use-of-bitcoin-mixing-services/||Binance Exchange|Rejects mixed funds (Wasabi)|Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/as-fatf-regulations-galvanize-crypto-mixing-applications-are-targeted/||Coinbase Exchange|Closes accounts that deposit mixed funds|[need source]||Wasabi 2.0 Mixer|Blacklists UTXOs by working with Chainalysis|Source: https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/zksnacks-blacklisting-update/||BestChange.com|Supports 'clean and dirty Bitcoins'|Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3309245.msg60225919#msg60225919||Gemini Exchange|No funds from gambling; 'Attempts to conceal the origin are not allowed'|Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398316||Betcoin Casino|'Strict Anti-Coin Mixing Policy' ( 8.8 )|Source: https://www.betcoin.ag/support/betcoinag-terms-service||Playbetr Casino|'Strict Anti-Coin Mixing Policy' ( 8.13 )|Source: https://www.playbetr.com/terms||Openchange instant exchange|Mixed funds labeled as 'stolen'|Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404704||[banned mixer] Mixer|'Coins with dark history are never let in.'|Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458437.msg62501094#msg62501094|I remember there are many more such cases, but can't find web articles about them right now, so I'd appreciate any additions.PSA: Keep in mind, any centralized exchange may at any point in time start closing and freezing accounts, rejecting UTXOs and sharing your information.

I think this could be quite dangerous because it goes back to that 17th century court case where now you could receive a coin that is perfectly valid at the time that you receive it, but a few weeks later a crime is uncovered and now your coin is tainted. So if this coin validation service is advicing many of the merchants where you would want to spend your coin at, it's tainted and now the merchant would refuse to accept your coin. That's a strange experience for you; you're holding a coin that you might have to sell at a discount to get rid of it. The aggregate effect of this might create a run on the bitcoin price. So it reopens this long-set legal principle that currency or currency units are all equal.I can't stress enough how important this is!",

We pondered about that a bit on a tangent in this topic [How to leave KYC for good] and I don't think there's a really '100% safe, but also tax compliant' solution yet.I believe if someone were to open an exchange in a crypto-friendly country like Portugal or El Salvador, that exchange may not be pressured as much when it comes to AML and maybe even KYC; while still providing European / American official documents that you can use when doing your taxes.",

I mean, yes, there are probably a lot of crimes in which Bitcoins are involved as there are countless others which involve fiat, but do you think that Bitcoins involved in these crimes are tainted and are therefore dirty and shouldn't be accepted by different Bitcoin platforms?This is not so much our moral position, but the forced adherence to generally accepted norms. Regardless of our or anyone else's opinion, AML purity for cryptocurrency transactions has become as important a property as it is for fiat currencies. Most crypto transactions end up in centralized custodial services that adhere to standard rules for the entire global market, in particular, the fifth AML directive of the European Union (5AMLD). Therefore, in a sense, the widespread introduction of AML made BTC an analogue of NFT of the ERC-1155 standard This site explains very well what it's all about:Quote from: http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-adam3us-fungibility-privacy/Coin validation proposed to offer as a service to trace coins and try to give you a rating about how the history of the coin from your point of view and to offer that as a service to businesses.

Or are you talking about mixing/“polluted” coins specifically?Yes, I'd absolutely add such sites that just arbitrarily reject certain 'coins'.Anyone trying to come up with a definition of 'pollution' of BTC is actually attacking Bitcoin's fungibility and should be called out. That's what this thread is for.An easy way to understand it is the comparison to 'dirty fiat' that LoyceV has brought up: nobody rejects a paper bill you got by winning at a casino or a lottery or one you got by selling drugs. Nobody inspects bank notes for illegal substances or checks the serial numbers.Another point to consider would be that laws differ around the world. I may live in a state where growing and selling marijuana is legal, so selling it for BTC would be absolutely legal; however if I send the coins to someone in a different state or use the BTC to pay for coffee, and someone would somehow label it as 'drug money', it couldn't be spent anymore. Wouldn't that be pretty crazy?If this seems far fetched, think about something else: booze. In most parts of the world, nobody would label me a criminal if I were to sell home-brewed beer. But there are places where alcohol is indeed illegal.What I'm trying to say is: we can't restrict Bitcoin that was used for activity X because it is illegal in state Y. Bitcoin knows no states, borders or laws.",

Or are you talking about mixing/“polluted” coins specifically?I'd say it's about any reason to consider some Bitcoins more equal than others.Note that this isn't about exchanges freezing funds owned by drug dealers, that's understandable. It's about freezing funds from the bar where the drug dealer bought his coffee.Do you have any evidence that this is happening? I don't think it would be difficult for a blockchain analysis company to see the difference between someone buying $100 worth of drinks at a bar, and a someone selling $100,000 worth of coin.When you spend 1BTC, you are spending a very specific output of a previous transaction, or a very specific set of outputs from previous transaction(s). If you are spending that 1BTC, the transaction fee you will need to pay will depend on how many outputs you are spending.",

It sounds arbitrary.And what if the miner gets a transaction fee from a drug dealer? Or if the drug dealers pays a very high fee to a friendly miner who gives him back fresly mined coins?For who hasn't read it yet: ChipMixer explains it nicely:Quote Furious you go for coffee. Barista shows you printed QR code. You mindlessly pay 0.1 mBTC with your mobile wallet. Your blockchain privacy has been lowered. How?Baristas deposit address is printed which means it has been used by every bitcoin-using customer. Everyone around seen you pay with Bitcoin to public address and they can check your transaction to know your public address and how much Bitcoin you have. Bob is not there but he also knows where and when you have been drinking. Your coffee-induced habit has been recorded on blockchain forever.You go out to your favorite vegan store. You try to pay when owner checks something on their computer and visibly reddens. They start shouting about unfair practices and slavery of coffee plantations. You are banned and cannot come back. What happened?Baristas public address is well known. Vegan store owner may check if somebody transacts with them. When you paid for coffee - they did not know. But your vegan transaction is linked to previous transaction making it impossible to hide. If you could mix your Bitcoins you would have avoided that.So, we now have cursed Bitcoins. I bet church can sell blessed Bitcoins at a premium. And vegan Bitcoins. Meat Bitcoins. Coffee slave Bitcoins. Drug Bitcoins.Or just Bitcoins. I'll go for that.",

Feel free to add any similar experiences you've had (maybe with funds coming from poker sites - as your name suggests) and I can add them to the OP! I know some exchanges and other services complain about funds from gambling sites, but don't know exactly which ones, so any feedback in this direction from a long-time forum member would definitely be appreciated.Quote from: Poker Player on June 11, 2022, 04:39:35 PMDoes anyone believe that over the years these companies will change their behavior? Because what I see is that the list of companies will get bigger and bigger. There will be more control, less privacy, more KYC/AML and more blacklist of supposedly tainted coins.I personally don't think so (short-term), however if services realize that large amounts of users stop trusting them with their coins if they show such (unreliable / untrustworthy) behavior, they might stop considering going more strict with KYC/AML and blacklisting / 'taint definitions'. Long-term it might convince companies who already went 'down' the 'taint route' to do a U-turn; it's much harder to do though, since they'll have to somehow explain they you suddenly accept 'dirty criminal coins' that they previously deemed 'bad' and unacceptable.Quote from: Poker Player on June 11, 2022, 04:39:35 PMI already expressed a similar, rather pessimistic opinion in my thread: Goodbye, privacy, goodbye, it was nice while it lasted.Convince me otherwise, please. It's a good thread; however as pointed out there, we still have alternatives, some of which are P2P and / or fully decentralized. I strongly believe we can educate people to stop conforming with outrageous, unreasonable rules that e.g. exchanges put in place and stop doing business with them. If enough people understand this (which is a pretty reasonable / logical thing - since good alternatives do exist), the centralized services will be forced to back-pedal if they don't want to go out of business.",
