And would they all appear \"together\"?think of it as  \"Your_Recovery_Seed_Words + new word (Passphrase) = new seed\" Thus, it is as if you got a new seed with 13/25 words, and whenever you change the new word, a new wallet will be generated with new addresses, and so on.Theoretically, your wallet seed \"12/24 words\" is enough to generate a wallet, and you can leave a small amount in it ( i.e. $10,) to inspire hackers that total money you have is $10.each additional word gives you a new wallet with a new master private key (new wallet start with old seed + new word.) which can contain your balance. here hacker need your wallet seed and that word.Quote from: Sumarokov on May 12, 2023, 11:46:20 AMI cannot access the hidden wallet.... but is there still a way to access the coins, if I have the seed, but not the passphrase?Passphrases are not stored anywhere, you need to remember it. read next replyIf you have correct seed and don't remember Passphrases, you need to brute force it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack",

Including other applications. Thanks for the replies on this thread. It was also useful for me to know for sure about such nuances. During this process, I had some questions. Here's what it says on the trezor's website:\"Using passphrase in other appsBy using the same combination of recovery seed and passphrase, the same wallet with identical addresses is derived - no matter which application is used:\"There is also this video, which describes an example of restoring a wallet in trezor and metamask. Ok, thanks to this video, I made sure that in metamask you can restore access to a hidden wallet using the passphrase.Now the questions:1- Metamask supports coins of a certain standard (erc-20). If a user has coins of other standards in a hidden wallet (for example, bitcoin), then he will not be able to access this. How to be in this situation?2- In what other applications can restore a hidden wallet? Is this possible in electrum? I already know about trezor and metamask (information from the official site). If trezor suite stops functioning (don't even ask for what reason).",

My question was that by sending a coin to a hidden wallet (during long-term storage), will it not turn out that access to these coins will be lost? Due to the fact that trezor suit ceased to exist, and other applications that allow you to restore access to the wallet simply didn't exist in nature (that is, there were such wallets, but initially didn't support hidden wallets).What government surveillance and control are you talking about? If now trezor hardware wallet is considered a very bad choice, then it’s not even clear which wallet is considered a good one.Actually, this is not surprising.

Someone made a recommendation of Trezor hardware wallet  but from what I am seeing here, I don't think it is recommendable to use it again. m2017 don't take one particular object as the best because production of things are differ. So if you didn't take Trezor as one the best, there are others that can still take that position. Though knowing the secret of all those devices is the best.

That depends on what you consider challenging. A simple passphrase could be bruteforced in seconds or minutes. A complex one would perhaps require millions of years. It's easier to say never in that case.Quote from: Sumarokov on May 12, 2023, 10:55:37 AMBecause as I understand, I have one seedphrase for the two wallets (hidden, standard).Would I need to enter the seedphrase in another device (eg. Electrum) to get my coins back? And would they all appear \"together\"? If you have 0.1 BTC in your standard wallet and 5 BTC in your hidden wallet, here is how it would work. If you enter your seed in Electrum and choose BIP39 and the correct derivation path in the options, you would recover that 0.1 BTC. To gain access to the 5 BTC, you'll need the correct passphrase on top of that. So those are two different wallets. And the passphrase has to be exactly the same because there is no such thing as a wrong one in the protocol's eyes. 'Sumarokov' will recover one account, 'sumarokov' a completely different one. The recovery of your coins depends on you entering the identical passphrase.

And would they all appear \"together\"?The software you are importing your seed phrase doesn't know if an additional passphrase exists (calling it a password is incorrect at best because the implementation is completely different, but unlike other cases, in this case, the implementation does matter since it helps you understand better how to not fuck up your setup), so if it is not engineered following best practices, it may even not offer you an option to specify it (a passphrase) when accessing a wallet. Think of a wallet created out of a combination of seed phrase and passphrase as something different from one derived from a seed phrase only: it will generate a piece of information completely unrelated to a single seed wallet so that all addresses, keys, and results of derivation path equations will be impossible to reconstruct without knowing initial passphrase. The reason this wallet is called \"hidden\" is likely due to the fact that it leaves no traces inside the wallet itself: inserted passphrase is not remembered or hashed, it creates temporary wallets that matter for a single session, and any passphrase is considered a \"right\" one regardless of whether it contains funded addresses or not.",
