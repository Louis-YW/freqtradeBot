The change to the dictionary definition of a vaccine has several damaged the acceptance of a valuable medical tool ( when it is used correctly ).I watched the video and I think we need to have a deep reflection about this Covid 19 issue. Some of the explanations of Dr. Phillip Mcmillan are true because my country is also a case study. Many people were not vaccinated in my country and we have the lowest death rate in the world. The truth is I have never seen anybody that died of Covid 19. I can't speak for other countries but I am sure that this disease was politicized to get grants from some international organization.The presence of malaria in Papua New Guinea might be another factor to be considered. Just like in my country we have a high rate of malaria because of mosquitos. And most of the symptoms of Covid are the same with malaria. I can assume that malaria drugs might be potent in the cure of Covid 19 or it has some element that resists the disease. During the pandemic markets were opened in my area and it was highly overcrowded and it didn't lead to an increase in the spread. I don't doubt Dr. Philip's explanation because there seems to be a hidden agenda about the Covid vaccine.",

The change to the dictionary definition of a vaccine has several damaged the acceptance of a valuable medical tool ( when it is used correctly ).Thanks. There are several professional people who are explaining this kind of thing about Covid and other diseases, and about vaccines, as well. One of the more famous people is Del Bigtree. Del has been saying some of this, with logic and proof to back it up, since the beginning of the so-called pandemic. Del's website is here https://thehighwire.com/, and you can more easily watch his videos here https://www.bitchute.com/channel/okiFK5CwQrZS/.One person who Del has been sort-of working with is Robert Kennedy, Jr. RFK is running for President, and is simply stating that there are no safety tests for the Covid vaccines and many others.But... if you really want to know what is going on, check out Dr. Andrew Kaufman. His website is https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/, and you can find many of his videos here https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=andrew%20kaufman&kind=video.The point that Dr. Kaufman is explaining is that the so-called viruses are simply exosomes - parts of the cells - that have been expelled from the body... and that the virus idea as expressed by the medical is a hoax. We have been lied to about viruses for so long that we have become believers in the lie. Dr. Kaufman is all about bringing us to good health through things like nutritional therapy, and whatever goes along with this nutritional natural healing.Possibly many of the medical drugs besides Ivermectin and Fenbendazole will heal us if used for a short time, and then are followed up with natural nutrition, and things that go along with it.Note that in the early time when the Covid vaccine was being introduced in Africa, It was not accepted in many areas. Covid illness was almost non-existent, and results were similar to New Guinea.Peer-reviewed studies suggest that cardiovascular deaths from mRNA jabs are largely under-reportedhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-07-03-peer-reviewed-studies-suggest-cardiovascular-death-mrna-jabs-underreported.htmlPharmaceutical propaganda continues to reassure the public that covid-19 vaccines are SAFE, but the truth about the #DiedSuddenly holocaust is all around us, no matter how hard the corporate media tries to gaslight us. Peer-reviewed studies from Japan, Qatar, and Korea suggest that cardiovascular death from Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA jabs has gone largely under-reported. In the medical reviews, thousands of young adults under the age of 50 died within weeks (and sometimes days) of injection, but most of the deaths were never properly investigated and the experimental jabs were never even considered as a probable cause of death.Japanese researchers find 1 in 8 post-vaccine deaths are related to heart damage from the vaccineIn one of the peer-reviewed studies, a team of pathologists from the Tokyo Medical Examiner’s Office conducted 54 autopsies on young adults who died within seven days of receiving one of the covid-19 vaccines. After looking strictly at the pathological evidence, the researchers singled out seven cases where the mRNA vaccine had caused serious damage to the heart. In three cases of young adults under 40, the mRNA had induced myocarditis, leading to fatal outcomes. In four cases, the vaccine was related to thrombosis-related deaths. In one of the cases, a 52-year-old man with no other serious health problems suddenly suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage following vaccination. According to the strict analyses, approximately 1 in 8 post-jab deaths could be directly related to the heart-damaging effects of the mRNA vaccines.The researchers concluded that myocarditis from the vaccines is under-reported and that “the Japanese death investigation system needs to be reinforced to adequately evaluate causal relationships between death and vaccination.”Researchers from Qatar find 1 in 50,000 young people died from covid jabResearchers from Qatar took a closer look at 138 sudden deaths that took place within 30 days of vaccination from January 2021 through June 2022. The researchers used strict criteria, looking at only the deaths that took place within 15 days of vaccination. They found twenty-three sudden cardiac deaths in people under the age of 50. All twenty-three deaths were determined to be caused by the mRNA vaccine. Approximately 2.3 million people were vaccinated in Qatar, so the risk of sudden death within 15 days of getting vaccinated is about 1 in 100,000 according to the researcher’s initial analysis. ...",

So you are throwing rubbish into the process and will get rubbish out of it.b) Papua lack of effective generalised medicine mean that people die younger, thus the population that is most affected by the virus is already dead.A usual, you are trying to use information that you are not qualified to interpret (even things that are common knowledge for the average person to be honest) thus systematically getting it wrong. Are you even able to draw any conclusion from the graphs below???",

If we didn't have the media/government/medical blab, there would be extremely few who died from the vaxx, since the people would have understood that it wasn't needed. And, of course, deaths from Covid would have been as they always have... a few deaths each year.The big killers regarding Covid are, the covid vaxx, hospital misdiagnosis/mismanagement of the people, lockdowns (mostly the elderly), masking (because it depletes oxygen in the body), and the various media lies.",

The populations most affected are the old and the very very young. People do not get old enough to die of Corona in Papua and in many other places, but what do you know about any of this living in your eco-chamber of Brexiters and decadent Victorian houses.

Dr. Andrew Kaufman (and many others) has shown us the science that proves that viruses are only exosomes - see https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=andrew%20kaufman&kind=video and https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/my-story/.What this means is that many, if not all so-called viruses have been around since the beginning of people. Of course, people's bodies might be developing new exosomes at various times. But with the devolution of humans, it's probably the other way around.",
