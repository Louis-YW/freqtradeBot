There is no need to waste much of your time on posts like this where users claim they have an agent who helped them recover a scammed or hacked wallet; they are just looking for means to steal from those who have already been scammed, as they will be asked to pay some money in order for them to get their lost money back, and if the user still has some money left in their wallet, they make away with it.Â These are just scammers looking for means to scam people who have been scammed through the means of fund recovery; these scammers don't have petty for the scammed.I believe the moderators will delete the topic with time.",

      "body": "I have been having this thought all these while. Why is that it is newbie accounts with no activities that is always coming up with services. They have no reputation and are not well established or is that they are afraid of using their real account identity for this service with the fear of being flagged? Well I have no doubt this is not different from other posts I have read on this platform about recovering lost keys and lots more. There is no difference between this post and how scammers do in their dirty jobs mate.",
