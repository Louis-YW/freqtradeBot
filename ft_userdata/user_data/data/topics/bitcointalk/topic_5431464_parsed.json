My hope is that it helps to increase and improve your betting knowledge. Most betting types relate to the score of a game, but sportsbooks try to make things interesting. Players can make wagers on which team will win, the number of scored points, and the margin of victory.In-play bet: Some bookmakers call it live betting, yet the concept is the same – bettors have an opportunity to make wagers while a game is active. In live betting the odds change during the match.The point spread: Betting sites like to encourage action on both sides, and the point spread makes it possible to place a wager on an underdog, while they still expect them to lose. The point spread allows players to guess the numerical point separation between the teams. For example, when a team gets favored by 4.5 points, they will need to score 5 or more points to cover the spread.Proposition bets: Prop betting is a relatively new option and the principle is that bettors get propositioned with a question. For example, Messi to score 2 goals, Messi to score a penalty, Messi to score a freekickOver/Under bets:  The over/under bet forecasts the total score of both teams, but also the number of points scored in a half. Players select if the final score will be over or under the offered average. For example under 1.5  or over 2.5Parlay: A parlay (also known as an accumulator) is a combination of multiple wagers into one single bet. Each wager, or leg, must come through for you to win a parlay. Parlays are much riskier than betting on each game individually, but you also get better odds. In addition, you can wager on more events with one stake.Would be happy if other veteran gamblers can add any gambling type that I may have missed.",

These are normal betting types,but there are truly a myriad of sport betting option that newbies I know for sure have no idea at all that they exist because I had no clue about such bets when I was a newbie myself.I will add the most typical one.Both teams to score yes/no This is the most typical sport bet that most of the gamblers bet on statistically speaking because it is one of those bets where you have hopes until the end of the game to win it.For example in a typical soccer game if you bet on team A to win and if team A within 30 minutes is down 3-0 chances are high you lost the bet,while if you have both teams to score yes you keep believing until the end of the game or you win if team A scores at least a goal.",

Parlay betting also works for me although in the real sense, parlays are not worth the money. Even if we know single betting is better and more safe than parlay betting, but somehow I realized it’s good to take some risks somehow and just play small amount of bets which if you get lucky, you will win such a huge amount out from a minimal bet. Though the odds are better in parlay, but this type of betting is usually like a lottery bet, the small bet is still capable to win a jackpot amount, but the bigger chances of profiting is still the house itself.",

I‘m only become familiar props betting this world cup because this is my first time to check that category since most of the Duelbits sportsbook promotion is on that category aside from both team to score. The point spread is what I don’t understand before and I’m too lazy to do the search since I’m not interested on other complicated bet type. I believe there’s still a lot of bet type missing base on what I’m seeing on Duelbits sportsbook that I still don't know there. Keep the list updated mate.",

In NBA if one team let's say LA Lakers can reach 120 points in total for their team only. There's also a betting line for that. The other bets when it comes to points are the consecutive points they can make, mostly the minimum is 9 points in basketball which is difficult.

Instead of guessing very adventurous results you just check football teams and how they play and you can easily guess which teams can score goals easily, or concede. Its really not that hard to guess which goals will be scored if you are familiar with teams in my opinion. I mainly talk about football matches here tho I believe same strategy can easily be applied to basketball teams or players. Its what I suggest to beginners.",

For newbies, this is more recommended if they are confident on their predictions in multiple events - brings more juice to their odds and brings more value to their bet.

Most memorable one perhaps is a hit with x57 with $2500 stake on it. Kinda forgot who it was but it was the Eastern Conference finals parlayed with some Dota games back in 2018. It kinda inspired me to parlay each bet but meh, I'm just not that good in predicting multiple outcomes at the same time.",
