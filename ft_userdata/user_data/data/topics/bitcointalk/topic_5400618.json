And in my own opinion, the merit's outweights the demerit.I took out time to really ponder on the option of bitcoin and the cypto market. The idea that a decentralized currency can be created which defeats the quest for control by the Government and their numerious policies is just awsome. But let's consider this question. What is man with out these policies and law's? Have you considered a world without any form of financial law and policy to govern it? The pros of the decentralized financial system could be all glitering and good, but who really stands to gain from such a world? THE INNOCENT whose just want to be free from regulations like a child who want to run away from home OR  THE CRIMINAL WORLD whose very agenda's can only be distrupted and or made difficult by these Government policies we are so eager to get rid off.I am no fan of laws to be frank, but the truth remains, can we really survive in a world where every individual and easily place an order and pay for the death of another (or commiting any other form of crime) by using his phone just like ordering for a box of pizza and there is no systen to trace such transaction?.",

Whether there are beneficiaries to this policies, the point still remains that this is just an elaborate plan to enslave humans. I don't really think there are any merits to this as when you look at it, there are loopholes even in the merits.Â Fine, a man nothing without laws and policies but then, not at the expense of his freedom.",

And in my own opinion, the merit's outweights the demerit.We don't need to overdo it, because fiat actually existed before Bitcoin. Moreover, with a system that is contrary to centralized finance, Bitcoin is inevitably considered a newcomer as well as a threat because the government cannot control it.Plus we live under the auspices of a government policy, so at least to be able to play it safe and be able to use Bitcoin officially, the first is the rules and laws where we live remain the main rules. Regardless of the policy that then considers Bitcoin as an investment alternative, that is what we must accept.After all, you can drop as much money in Bitcoin as you want without needing to lure the government into legalizing it as payment.Btw, a bit off-topic. Just wanted to ask if you two were born in the near future and give each other merits. Are you twins? if true you are very lucky only a difference of 23 minutes and 32 seconds. lol Forget it, I'm just kidding!!",

I was somehow confused and frightened if the world has just decided to go completely cashless that will prompt such repetitive topics.Tbh, this doesn't need to raise a new topic. It would have fit as a reply to the topic you referenced.It could be a coincidence of date of account creation, coincidence of merit and coincidence of cashless policy idea",

Other than that don't get yourself merits *_* I know it's a slow and steady process but it's worth it.",

Regulators just need to adapt to this, and they do.Whether crypto or fiat, illegal activities and those criminals would still exist but of course there are some differences on how they would really be able to do such thing when it comes to laundermoney or something in related. For a cashless society then if we do talk about decentralized then miners would be the beneficiary on pushing up transactions since its decentralized thenthere's no other that could benefit out but for centralized one then we do know with this very basic thing. Lets just accept the fact that if ever crypto space would made it big or become one of the payment options or gateways then expect that fiat would be still overhead.",

Maybe if all crypto platform will ask KYC if you perform transaction that could change the story because all people will be identify including those criminals.",

It's worthless to discuss a flawless system, because it doesn't exist and isn't applicable to this world. After all, we can't blame fiat or crypto for actions executed by humans. Therefore, there is no reason to criminalize or heavily regulate currencies like the mainstream society tries to do with bitcoin and altcoins in a point it's going to be insuportable to use them at some point, since enthusiasts will have to pay large profit percentages to their local authorities, completely give up their privacy and fulfill bureaucratic requirements which aims collecting more money from the average citizen's pockets to the government and its partners.Crypto market heavily regulated benefits big corporations, governments (politicians) and oligarchies;Crypto market lightly regulated benefits the society as a whole;No regulations benefit nobody.",
