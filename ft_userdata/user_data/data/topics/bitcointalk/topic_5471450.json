And if we look at the movement today, there may be a correction after the increase.And if the situation remains good, Bitcoin prices can continue to increase but we are still determining how long this will continue. Hopefully, there will be positive news that will be released so that it can support Bitcoin's movement.We should keep an eye on price movements. Those who trade, especially future trading, have clearly made big profits. Congratulations to them",

      "body": "It can happen. Who would have thought that in the space of two days, it's price can move from $28k to $34,299.83 as at time of writing? We don't know the factors behind the sharp increase in Bitcoin price, but I'm all for it continuing to go up. We shouldn't be carried away by the rapid flight and forget that it can go down sharply because when I checked earlier today, the price was teasing $34k but then decreased, only to rise up back to $34k . Maybe at the end of today, prices will either go up or decrease towards $33k. Â The remaining months of this year may see the price of Bitcoin rising up as experts believe that at least one Bitcoin spot ETF could meet approval by the SEC. Although it's still a \"maybe\", who knows, this sudden jump in price could force investors and big whales to buy.",

If this pace is followed then definitely there is huge chances that Bitcoins will cross the 35k usd mark. Why I am so confident about this? This is because as the price goes up, more people will panic and start buying the coin. This will increase the demand to accumulate the coin and in order to maintain the demand the price will go up. So definitely before October ends, we will see something really big.",

Your insights matter, so cast your vote and share your crypto wisdom with the community! ðŸ“ŠIf I'm not mistaken, we have hit $35k already, but it slowly goes down to $33k. So it means that $35k is the next big barrier that we have to break. And I think we will retest that price again, if there is really some positive news around not like the Cointelegraph fake news or the ticker being displayed and then suddenly removed again.As per CMC:QuoteHigh$35,150.43People think its some kind of manipulation from big entities and wanted to see what will be the reaction of investors. And true enough, the bite on that hype pushing the price to $35k. But it has settled down a bit for now. But we are in a good position this October-December to at least be in the $40k-$50k region.",

The outcome will depend on if the spot bitcoin ETF is approved or not. If not approved, I am expecting the market to calm and if calm for long the price will fall back. But if spot bitcoin ETF is approved, the price will increase above $35000.The next approval is on November 21. This is 3 weeks from the present date. Bitcoin is pumping because everyone is speculating that an ETF approval is a certainty. If the strength of this pump continues until November 21, where do you reckon bitcoin will go? I am quite certain it will be to $40k once another pump causes another short squeeze again.However, on November 21 we cannot predict how much bearish overreaction this market might create if the SEC announces a rejection. Similar to how short squeezes make pumps stronger, liquidating long buyers also make the dump also stronger.",

The news lately can't be trusted Cointelegraph said that BlackRock has been approved by the SEC and the price spike touched 30K level after that it turned it is fake news and bitoin price go down again. Watcher guru said that the ETF is on listing but it turned out that the list already there from the august. What a joke. The conclusion is if the bitcoin manage stay 30K level wich is a crucial point the price can go beyond the 35K",

Does this factor in the result of the approval of bitcoin ETF? Some of the post are saying that if it's approved then it's going to improve the market prices but if not then there's a possibility that the price will either calm down or go down. @mk4 said that we've gone up too high too fast and I can agree with that too because this all happened before, price going up fast and people getting in the hype only to have their hopes up pulled under them giving them losses.",
