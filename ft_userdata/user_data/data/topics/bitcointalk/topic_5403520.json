  "content": "DOOCOIN  - a crypto exchange - a fraud - based in Europe or maybe China.What happened: given link to #DOOCOIN by a social media contact.  Link loaded on iPhone without going thru apps store.  Sent bitcoin.  Made $ mining and options.  Went to withdraw some money by wire. Waited 7 days ... no money. Contacted DOOCOIN help.  They claimed my wire info was erroneous.  It was correct!  Froze my withdrawal privileges.  Told me to send 600k to 'resolve' issue.",
