  "content": "We developed a patented crypto product for the community. It will only be sold in bitcoins and have a very affordable price. The idea is to help people like us, investors, and crypto enthusiasts. We are trying to gauge the opinion of other crypto members of the community, so to understand if the prototype should be or not be developed.So it will be 3 to 4 questions to collect your feedback, so we can understand if there is a market for it and what kind of changes would be necessary.We will pay 1 USDT at the start and the rest after finishing the research. Its a brief process. The USDTs are on BSC chain.Thanks for your time.",
