It's backed up by a bit of research if they're doing well or not for them to have that type of chart.Quote from: NIrish on May 11, 2023, 04:47:44 PMHow do you decide where to take the plunge?  A certain %drop from the top or a %above bottom?It varies but if you're optimistic with a certain project, DCA.",

However if i do want to catch the bottom i will include some support fib lines to my technical analysis, those work surprisingly often. But with the 2 altcoins you asked about, if i would like to buy Optimism for some reason, i would wait for $0.9 and lower. It might bounce from $1 but i think it could be temporary bounce. As for IMX i can't see any reason it wouldn't go under ATL. I can't see any future in that and there's no way to tell where the bottom is.",

I don't immediately buy in any altcoins. For instance, if I wanted to invest $100 in optimism coin, I would initially invest 20% of the money, then 30%, and then 50%. As the price of the altcoin declines, that's how I will be investing in the altcoin gradually until I exhaust the money I mapped out for the crypto investment",

Anyway, if you are not so sure about when to buy, always look at the chart and see the good price. There should be no pressure in buying, you have to take your time to analyze and make sure you didn’t miss anything, trading can be very tricky most of the time, and the fees can’t tell if its a good time to buy.",

      "body": "First of all your choice about OPtimism and Immutable is good choice in my opinion layer 2 is on the rise nowadays but the bitcoin price is not good making this is not the good moment. Im gonna share my opinion though the price of bitcoin now is testing 26K support or 100 EMA and it seems the price reject at that point. When bitcoin price reject for couple of days and show bullish I think that is the right call to buy altcoin like Optimism. If you look at the chart the yellow line is previously a resistance and now turning into a major support although is not there yet. you need to be carefully since the price already broke the 200 EMA and I would say the good entry point for OP is $1.2 and take profit on $2",

In case the price of my favorite altcoin is falling, I will use Fibo or some other price analysis tool to see if the price will stop falling. Then I will use DCA to maximize its bottom-fishing ability. The important thing is to wait and patiently stick to the plan until you have 50% success already.",

And when we have studied them and spent a lot of time observing, the risk ratio will certainly have to be greatly reduced, the method that I recommend is DCA, you should buy them gradually with the right amount of capital over time. When that investment pays off for you, you'll feel better. Personally, there are some coins at this stage that I also have high hopes for in the future bull cycle, but in general everything revolves around the volatility of bitcoin.",
