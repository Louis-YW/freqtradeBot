Except for those who are jailed and properties such as cryptocurrency and others are confiscated, the peoples Net worth by the year 2025 when Bitcoin recorded a New ATH will definitely (assuming BTC will be around $210k) be way more.(assuming that the holdings is in BTC)Legend B = billion",

If we remember last time Binance exchange has many FUD and if you are not verifying it you will believe that FUD news. But I agree with you, let us be strong despite the condition of the crypto market, and forget for a while that you have a crypto asset while the price had a bad position. I believed that the BTC price will reach again into the next ATH.The image above clearly that if you are new to this you must have faith in BTC first, look at CZ and Brian Armstrong, they don't have huge losses because they know how to deal with the market while those new below have lost millions or billions of dollars.",

More still, the minions of investors tha focused on using the FTX platform for there investment or build a crypto portfolio. Yeah, this seems enough to spread FUD for the weak hands but, I think if you focus your attention on what is lost other than finding the cause to this lose, you wold be loosing out on an opportunity to better yourself.If you look at all the names to have futures on tha list, you would find sorting common about them and that is nothing short of some bad investment.  Trying to profit without weighing the risk. As much as there is a statistics to failure, there are just as much to success. Focus on the sucees and study the errors to a lose then, you might find yourself making good investment choices.",

Honestly speaking I think it isn't just on crypto but for almost everything, everything that have risk is not for those who are weak.If you're not ready or prepared for the worst scenario whenever you are taking a risk then you are just fooling yourself.Expecting everything to be on your expectation is so childish we need to grow and learn that not everything works that way.And for those Investors they haven't lost it yet for me it would only be considered lost if they already traded their crypto into Fiat and quit.",

People who have not started believing and are reluctant to invest in bitcoin or crypto are of course only beginners who don't know what to do, but those who have been in the crypto world for a long time will understand that now is the right moment to just keep logging in and take advantage of it to your advantage. Like CZ who wasn't swayed by drama FTX and such, he continued to innovate and make FUD a vehicle for greater profits. Every investment will definitely have risks, but these risks can be overcome if we know how to minimize them.",

Once bitcoin surges, these names will top the list of billionaires once more and people will wonder how they get to there. Not everyone is trained to trade like these guys do, and not everyone has the heart to take all of the loses like these big guys do. Pretty sure at the onset of the reds, most people will find it easier to just sell at a loss than to bear seeing their losses materialize right before their very eyes. Even in stocks, a lot of losers have emerged too. Everything you can invest on performed relatively bad in 2022, and there's really no performing asset that you can hold onto on the previous year save for precious metals that retained their value pretty well. No one was safe from the harsh reality of 2022 that we have just experienced.",

Whoever is smart and strong will win, this is a game. So I find it funny that people keep blaming the project developers when they lose, but if the developers don't cheat on them then I can assure you that, when the token price goes up, you will also be dumping causing the project to crash and the developers to lose. Instead of waiting for you to dump, they will let the project fall apart. It's a game, whoever is faster wins.",

Of the altcoins, I think that in the end by pure statistics some will survive that are useful to the system, but very few, counting that CBDCs will be implemented, which means that those who are investing in these tens of thousands of shitty projects will lose their money, while those who bet on Bitcoin in the long term, not only will maintain the purchasing power but will probably get a higher appreciation than with any other financial asset.
