If you want to search out hyips you will find bucketloads of them all over the internet, some accepting fiat while others accept crypto.What we can do is to call them out of their scamming techniques and deception so that a wise newbie does not fall for them while inciting a thinking mind to those who might be cautious but less experienced.Reporting the domain to the registrar is another step many of us can perform.",

      "body": "The site is not working now, good work guys, your reporting has been taken into account by the registrar sites and the HYIP site has been taken down, I hope these scammers do not restore it again, Ponzi and HYIP sites have multiplied in our days, so we must not be lazy about exposing them and reporting their sites so that many victims with weak experience do not fall into the hands of these scammers, and it is clear that they take the appropriate times, such as popular events and their approaches, such as the New Year and others, to create their sites and target investors and attract them through investment plans with huge returns. So always be careful.",
