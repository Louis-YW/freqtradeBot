  "content": "I am trying to get a standalone PHP code without any external dependency to generate an Ethereum address/key pair. So I asked OpenAI ChatGPT to write the code for me. I got two different versions from it...Version 1Code:include \"keccak.php\";use kornrunner\\Keccak;// Generate a random private key$private_key = bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32));// Compute the public key from the private key using elliptic curve cryptography$public_key = '0x'.bin2hex(gmp_export(gmp_mul(gmp_init('0x'.bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32)), 16), gmp_init('0x'.bin2hex(gmp_powm(gmp_init(2), gmp_init('0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0', 16), gmp_init('0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A1', 16))), 16))));// Compute the Keccak-256 hash of the public key (as a hex string)$address = '0x' . substr(Keccak::hash(hex2bin(substr($public_key, 2)), 256), -40);echo \"Private key: $private_key<br>\";echo \"Address: $address<br>\";Version 2Code:include \"keccak.php\";use kornrunner\\Keccak;function generate_ethereum_address() {// Generate a new private key$privateKey = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));echo \"Private Key: \" . $privateKey. \"<br>\";// Derive the public key from the private key$publicKey = hex2bin('04' . str_pad(gmp_strval(gmp_init(substr($privateKey, 0, 64), 16), 16), 64, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT) . str_pad(gmp_strval(gmp_init(substr($privateKey, 64), 16), 16), 64, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT));// Generate the Ethereum address from the public key$address = '0x' . substr(Keccak::hash(substr($publicKey, 1), 256), -40);// Return the Ethereum addressreturn $address;}// Generate an Ethereum address$address = generate_ethereum_address();// Output the Ethereum addressecho \"Address: \" . $address. \"<br>\";For Keccak, this code is used - https://github.com/kornrunner/php-keccak/blob/main/src/Keccak.phpSample o/p of Version 1 is...Code:Private key: 1941069a40cc71a83b8df773e0b45cdb8aa70b748710c82eace662c07ede4cf8Address: 0x753215ef5214d2494df5e19dafa5644d034d201cSample o/p of Version 2 is...Code:Private key: 1941069a40cc71a83b8df773e0b45cdb8aa70b748710c82eace662c07ede4cf8Address: 0x753215ef5214d2494df5e19dafa5644d034d201cClearly, address generated by both versions are wrong and AI is unable to fix the code. Can any of you please fix it?",

Lol. yup. This dude is not lying. I tried it. 1 week. Pisses me off so much.  If it's not indent issues..then they give you the correct code..but indentation issues again... I somehow realize too... That they are limited by the a certain number in their response. It always seem to cut off before completing the code.",
