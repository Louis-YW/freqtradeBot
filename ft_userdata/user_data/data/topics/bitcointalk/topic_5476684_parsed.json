Most of them are people who are renting their signature space.In 2024 there will probably be less signature campaigns,  but I believe most of the best contributors of the forum will stay here.

As we quickly head into 2024, do you think there many real (unpaid) people still posting here at BCT? Have a great day.Yes, there are active members who don't get paid for posting, yet they are very active in this Forum. Someone like Vapourminer, JayJuanGee, and many others, who are mostly just active on the wall, observers can see, how active they are there, even when there is no signature displayed there. But are quality posts being graded by you based on the amount that the Poster is being paid? There is no doubt that the pay is what increases the post-quality of many, but also don't forget that when you don't have anything to produce, even if you are being paid a higher amount, nothing can still come out of it. There are people, who are just active on the forum and contributing the way that they can and not minding the payment, and their are still those, who get paid and still giving their best to the Community. Every person has different goals.",

As we quickly head into 2024, do you think there many real (unpaid) people still posting here at BCT? Have a great day.There will always be - yes, there will be. Signature and spam are related - but spam would also exist without signature. Some famous users who do not use paid signatures are gmaxwell, qwk, Vod, vapourminer, Foxpup and many others - so they will always be there although I don't need to mention them to you one by one.I guess they all have their own ways of making money - so signature campaigns aren't the only way to get it. I guess many of them are traders, miners and investors - so it's natural that they're not interested in a signature campaign.",

Many of the threads from ~2010, when BTC had literally - or close to - zero usd value are challenging for me technically, but I love it anyway, great stuff.As mentioned above, the technical discussion still exists and is centered around the technical discussion board. There is a reason why some signature campaigns ban sub-boards to begin with, likely due to spam. You should at least read a decent post nowadays unless it comes from a bounty hunter.You can also lurk around the Serious discussion board if you don't want to see spammers, since any post posted there doesn't count toward the post count at all.",

The WO people would continue as they are now, the other members mentioned who do not wear a paid signature and are not regular WO members would continue as they are now, a small percentage of those who wear a paid signature now would continue to post on the forum, although less, and most of the traffic would go elsewhere. Just look at what happened to some members of the old CM campaign as soon as they stopped wearing a signature or went from being in a signature campaign that paid for a maximum of 50 posts to one that paid for a maximum of 25 posts per week. And I'm not criticizing it, eh? It is largely a logical consequence.The WO's are a case apart because most of them are loaded with Bitcoin, and I would say that most of the other cases cited as well.",

The amount of challenging, high-quality topics combined with no spam or sigs is a refreshing retro experience for me. As we quickly head into 2024, do you think there many real (unpaid) people still posting here at BCT? Have a great day.There are so many members who post regularly on the forum and they don't get paid for their posting. The ones who are in signature campaigns try their best to make very high-quality posts because they are getting paid for their posting and in a way their posts allow other to see their signature space. The signature campaigns have been on the forum for many years and so far both the members and the ones who run their signature campaigns both have been getting good results. The ones who aren't in signature campaigns also make good and informative posts. There are many good members in WO thread who doesn't apply any signature on their profile but they make awesome posts. philipma1957 used to be one of those members. He's now applying a signature on his profile but I have seen him doing so many posts without having any signature on his profile. If I'm not wrong then Phil got into signature campaigns because he wanted to help out Talkimg.com an image hosting site created and hosted by a reputed member of the forum for the members of the forum who were facing issues due to imgur image proxy error. There are some members like JayJuanJee, JetCash, El duderino_, BitcoinBunny, Biodom, OutOfMemory, AlcoHoDL, vapourminer, JimboToronto, Hueristic, and many other good posters who don't apply any signature on their profiles but they make outstanding posts.",

As we quickly head into 2024, do you think there many real (unpaid) people still posting here at BCT? Have a great day.First, let me correct you, it's either you call it Bitcointalk or BTT, not BCT.Regarding your question, yes, there are many of them. Just like in many activities of life, people will do things for different reasons. Some are here to learn, some are here to learn and earn, some are here to learn and impart knowledge, while others are here to learn, earn and impact knowledge.For you to get this distinction among users easily, anyone you see the signature embedded beneath their posts is making money through the forum, and anyone without such signatures is not earning anything at all. For the latter, some situations are also temporary for the fact that they might either not be interested in a campaign yet or they are still searching for one.",

I have always called it BTT all my days here. From the analogy you discussed, BCT best fits. But then if we try to follow the right acronym of bitcoin which is BTC, it will be nice to say BTC best fits but just that it will not be smooth in pronouncing. Howbeit, we do not use audio in the forum.I visited the reference thread you dropped and discovered that BCT was just slightly above BTCT in the pool.",
