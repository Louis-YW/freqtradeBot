The cryptocurrency market is no longer as easy as it was five years ago, and there are many fraudulent projects out there. As for using the project's products, there are currently many good projects like Uni, Pancake, Sushi, etc. I'd like to know what aspect of the issue you are genuinely concerned about.",

The market does have some truly laughable aspects. If a project collapses early, it's called a scam; if it collapses after raising a lot of money from investors, it's also called a scam. Is there anything in this market other than scams?",

I understand your perspective, and you also share a common view with most people. However, to label a project as a scam, it usually requires the fraudulent actions to have taken place, just like in previous scam cases where investors didn't realize they were being deceived until the project collapsed.",

I just want to gather more information to assess the project myself. For example, the history of how decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uni, Pancake, Curve, Balancer, etc., became successful could provide valuable insights. When it comes to evaluating the product, it's difficult to make comparisons because Atisfy is relatively new. Monitoring the development process of a new project can indeed be time-consuming. Perhaps I'm someone who always seeks something new, and who knows, with every project, there might be an airdrop campaign to discover. https://app.rango.exchange/ it is not doing?",
