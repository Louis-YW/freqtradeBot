All these will give us more insight to suggest or advice you on the probable situations around your wallet that could have led to what you experienced.",

It would be better also if you can put some addresses so anyone can examine what happened.Hacks can happen due to these common poor OpSec.- exposed private keys/seed phrase- infected machine/pc with malware- phishing",

Unfortunately your bitcoin is long gone and nothing can be done to get it back. One thing seems certain though that the person who did it is most likely someone you are very familiar with, someone you informed that you were into crypto currency, trust and usually let your guard down to. That is another reason to be careful of the people you tell that you are a bitcoin hodler and watch the company you keep. OP yo didn't give us the value of the bitcoins you lost, but I presume regardless that since you were not paying so much attention to your bitcoins and it took you a while to find out that your coins had gone, if it is not inexperience in the field, then it sends a message that you have another source of income and can bounce back from this temporary setback on your investment. But in the future OP, be more careful.",

Do you remember the apps you've downloaded and the links that you've signed up for? It's likely that you've downloaded a malware or you've been phished, either of the two.Or, someone who you know personally stole your private keys and he took it and robbed your bitcoins. Although even if you tell more details as long as it's already been sent, no reversing will happen.",

Unless you are using unknown wallets and funds from your account are gone. If you can provide more details on what exactly the wallet or website you are using maybe we can give you more insight about that wallet/site there are many phishing sites and fake wallet apps out there that you should avoid. If you are using one of them there is no way to recover your funds back or if you are using well-known exchanges the only thing that you can only get is the IP of the last login who transfers your funds from your account to another wallet.",

Maybe your machine is infected by some kind of malware. So it's better to check everything or even format your pc/laptop just to be sure that it won't happen to you again.",

Bitcoin transactions are a thing where you can never find out the address of the recipient.If you are not familiar. Since you are someone you know in some way, you do not see the possibility of getting this money back.However, you can post the transaction of your account on the phishing site.",

It is gone and gone forever but however, you can trace the transaction and wallet to know if it is a third party wallet so as to know if the wallet account belongs to a exchanger or so. This can aid you monitor the transaction and movements taking place on the wallet. If you are new in blockchain, I would advise you to go do a little research on wallets so as to guide you through to making a good choice of wallet to use, guiding you on how to setup a wallet and measures taken to safely protect your digital assets when using the wallet.",
