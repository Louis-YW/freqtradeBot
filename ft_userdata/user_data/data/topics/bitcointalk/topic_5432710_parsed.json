You can set certain amount to buy bitcoin weekly.You do not have to wait for bull market to start, you may think bull market has even started while buying, but the price might fall back to or slightly below the price you bought bitcoin. Just start to DCA and enjoy the buying as the market is less volatile and also as the bottom might be closer or gotten to already.",

Basically, heatmaps helps you determine which stock/crypto are the biggest gainers and losers in a 2-dimensional view which make it more difficult to read especially for an average joe. However, it is just a tool that you can use for technical analysis.",

Have you ever done such before? Please share me your strategy. They say the trend is your friend and I get what you are trying to do here which is a smart move btw to ride the trend, but this strategy could some how be a late entry on your side as this is as good as getting signals from volume profile indicators, EMA's and moving averages crossing... I would suggest you go the smart money way of trading and look out for order blocks waiting to be mitigated before the next trend and this will give you a higher probability of catching the next trend , Goodluck.",

Have you ever done such before? Please share me your strategy. How would you know the timing when money keeps pouring on the market? It isnt right? Its like saying that we should buy now cause sooner or later there will be new money coming into it. Its not like that, and we cant totally say that there will be source or trend. But everyone expecting new cash flow into it by 2024 and so on.",

      "body": "Just look at the circulating volume on coinmarketcap, you will know. But are you going to enter when the volume starts to rise, is it not too late to buy cheap now. When the volume goes up the price will also go up and see also BTC Domination, it will affect the market.You can buy crypto now, but if you want a lower price you will have to wait, but now is a pretty good opportunity. But don't expect too low a price.If this is your first investment, I must say that you have to be really confident to start investing. Choosing bitcoin is the best advice for the long term. and diversify or share funds to buy bitcoin and some other potential coins. Or if you only want to invest in bitcoin, do DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) it's the best strategy.",

You can set certain amount to buy bitcoin weekly.~snip~Because of the attitude that is actually a characteristic of all those who adhere to the \"fast in, fast out\" strategy, that is, the plan to invest their fiat in as short a time as possible, while making as much profit as possible. That's why we have something we call FOMO (fear of missing out), which is most pronounced during the bull run, when people buy the most, and they are usually focused on some number that serves as their exit point, such as $100k in the last bull run.The OP is actually asking \"how do I know when others start buying so I can do the same\" - and let him look for the answer in a possible price increase, although any (even significant) price increase does not mean that the trend has reversed, but that it may be a small pump with great prospects of pulling back.",

      "body": "From my experience the market is so illiquid that a big move can happen overnight, while you sleep. That's why people recommend to do DCA because your risk is very low, you're putting some money aside and you're always in. There are 2 most popular ways how people approach investment in bitcoin. One is to DCA and keep adding to it without looking at the price. The other is to wait for a 50 % correction from the high and then start buying. At the moment we're down 70%. If you're still afraid to buy than I doubt you'll ever be confident enough.",
