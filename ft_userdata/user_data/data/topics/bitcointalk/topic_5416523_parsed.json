The same webpage shows on the bottom chart that you’re barely active, which is therefore playing against any chances of earning Merits.You could check out what the 217 accounts that have reached the Legendary rank so far under the Merit System have posted, to get an idea. I can’t think of a better way to gain insights on how they did it (starting-off at different Rank levels). Likely, common factors will include time dedication, consistency/persistence (in terms of posting), and content that is generally interesting and with some degree of depth.",

Unlike some members with lots of merits that could have qualified them to legendary but their activity count is holding them back. You see they is nothing to be ashamed of, merit is holding you back and you just need to get them through active participation. Cheers.",

I have read those boards when I was looking for diversifying my crypto investment; I did and realized you must not go with shits, LOL.Most of the signature spammers post their to fulfill their weekly quota & that's it. I have hardly seen a good quality post in altcoin discussion. IIRC, I have enjoyed reading an article from tk808 (can be someone else either) regarding monopoly of Binance. I can't remember if I ever enjoyed the board that much.",

That is why it is always worth concentrating on the content you bring to the forum, rather that the merits you are recieving at that present time.",

I could even see that you have been away for sometime from the forum. Not being active is one major effect of it as the reason you are still where you are. Your activities is still far to show you how you have been inactive. If my calculation is correct you are suppose to be in senior member by default at the time the merit system started if you had enough activities by that time. The solution now is that you have to start making meaningful contribution to the forum but sorry unfortunately at this time that merit are not got on a platter of Gold, you will have to be a super knowledgeable writer to achieve what you desire now unlike in the beginning when merit giving wasn't a big deal and some of us still didn't realize it then because we also desire to rank up from where we are. But do your best at least you can get somewhere if you are ready to do some serious content work.",

The Merit system is implemented in the forum with the aim that every user who has the desire to achieve a higher rank can make quality, constructive and informative posts.You need to underline, Merit is not a barrier for you to rank up. Lots of users have proven that Merit isn't hard to get, they've reached the highest rank in the forum quickly.As a first step, you must leave the old habit (shitposter) to become a quality poster to get the attention of Merit Sources and generous Contributors on the forum so as not to downplay your posts. There are 110 merit sources with a total merit generation of up to 33989 sMerit per 30 days which have been selected to help anyone to immediately enjoy a new rank.The decision is yours, want to change or not.",

Another thing, stop with those mindless one-liners as even if you start posting in other section where there's a lot of merit, you want get far with that approach. Forget about signature campaigns and weekly quota, simply start communicating with others (which you haven't been doing in 5 years since you joined this forum) and post only when you actually have to say something and merit will come, and therefore higher ranks.

They actually put their thought into their post compared to users that only post to meet their quota on their sign campaign, parrot on what other people in here want to hear.Post quality isn't decided by merits alone cause you know how some opinions might not popular hence the lack of merits. This also created an illusion that merits always equals to good-quality posts. Heck, might give you a fresh example (below) to show you about a user with a good amount of merits doesn't mean they've good post quality. aylabadia05 has 313 merits, mind you.Quote from: blue_hurricanger on October 10, 2022, 08:36:35 AMQuote from: aylabadia05 on October 10, 2022, 06:02:33 AMYesterday I said about 3 important points that must be obtained by both teams. Arsenal to shift Manchester City in 1st position and maintain the opportunity to win the trophy, while Liverpool to return to compete in the top four.I dare say Arsenal will win against Liverpool by a narrow score.Liverpool have tried their best to achieve a draw, but because of a penalty incident, Liverpool lost points.Come on dude, at least put effort into your post. Not WILL. The match is over. Arsenal won 3-2 against Liverpool. And no, Liverpool will not back to the top 4 in the Premier League. Yes, the season hasn't ended yet, the race is still ongoing but they had a lot of problems with their lineup and strategy. See people in here starting to talk about Klopp's chance to stay at Liverpool before the season end?",

All Legendary members were also beginners at one point and invested a lot of time, and in the last few years, a lot of effort to become what you want now. My advice is to start from the beginning, start reading the forum, don't open meaningless topics and ask questions that already have answers. To begin with, concentrate on how you will reach the next step (Full member).",
