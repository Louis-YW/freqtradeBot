If you see gambling as a way of making money, that is the worst indiscipline that you have in gambling, never depend on gambling at all other than seeing it as fun and entertainment and not going beyond that.",

But if you are a plain gambler targeting $100 per day, I doubt you could make it. Between a gambler and the house, there is not even a fair equation. The house is always a step ahead. Although there are times when you get lucky and win against the house, in the long run, it will always be the house that prevails. And, of course, casinos are not a place to make a living. They are more of a place to squander money.",

All you're going to do is lose money in the long run, even though in the short term you may have winning sessions. To win money in the long run you should try sports betting, poker or some say horse racing, things like that. But those disciplines need a lot of study to be able to make money, as well as self-control and good bankroll management to withstand the rough patches.",

I have 2k balance.. is there methodTo get 100 $ per day for example, how can you benefit when you come to a nightclub? whereas you bring 2k for extra beers and food it's just a bonus. whereas on the other hand you come to an entertainment place to seek pleasure, not a place to earn income, unless the entertainment venue gives you a ticket when you enter and there is a lottery and if you are lucky you get the prize. it's highly unlikely an entertainment venue will earn you a profit if it's built to make a profit.simple explanation maybe you can understand.just as gambling is built to turn the gambler's profit and it is difficult to give you $100 profit daily, it is almost impossible unless you are really lucky. whereas luck will not come every day.so don't expect too much in gambling, just enjoy each of your betting sessions enough to entertain yourself and if you get a win consider it as a bonus.",

There might be a few days when you might hit a jackpot but most of the time you will lose your money. If you can afford to lose 2k then go ahead and give it a try.
