See Nigeria as Nigeria and other how most other African countries are and be wise about your life.

And also, seeing as you love your country so much, you know you can help make it better in your own little way, however you want to.Though the country's oil price is soaring high, it doesn't mean we don't have a refinery, because we definitely do. We just happened to still be depending on the imported refined products, and then the subsidy case.So, Nigeria at 63. It'll surely be better, someday.",

No matter how bad a nation is, some people will be rich, think towards the direction about what can make you rich.Thinking towards the direction about what can make we Nigerians rich is a very good idea in this dilapidated economy with yet no blueprint for restoration of the situation. But that doesn't mean we should lose hope on the nation by believing or thinking that there can't be any salvation to the nation's negatively affected foundation. What we have right now is 99% of bad people in governance and nothing more short of that and if these bad people are reduced to a drastic percentage of %15 with good people on a higher side then we will have the foundation under construction and repairment and Nigeria will start working great again. If am using the administration of late President Umaru Musa Yaradua as an example of a good leader how Nigeria economy turned up competitively among other nations of the world even though the Yaradua's was cut short by his unfortunate demise due to sickness.",
