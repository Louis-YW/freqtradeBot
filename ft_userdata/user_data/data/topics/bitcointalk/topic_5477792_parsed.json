I know we can calculate the price  of Bitcoin during the time of the transaction if we have this \"USD value at the time of transaction\" but it's not really convenient, maybe  there's some explorer that it will show you.Blockchain.com explorer can provide you similar information for total value of a transaction at the time it was created, like Blockchair.com. It seems Blockchain.com explorer changed their feature recently as when I wrote this post, I checked it again and saw that today the Blockchain.com explorer no longer provide a value of a transaction at the time it was created like the explorer shown before their latest change. Now it shows the value of a past transaction with a price of bitcoin at the moment.I thought you want this before you made this reply and I checked all explorers in List of useful Bitcoin block explorers and did not find any explorer can help you.This block explorer is interesting for coders https://yogh.io/tx/8c14f0db3df150123e6f3dbbf30f8b955a8249b62ac1d1ff16284aefa3d06d87/It breaks down the raw transaction.",

Maybe we can inspect the element and see the script to see how they calculate the price and modify it depending on what we need. I checked Blockchair APIs and can't find how to do it the easiest way either. Seems like they only offer the market price for each request instead of the price at the time the transaction was made.

As far as \"the amount in USD transacted\" during the time of the transaction itself is concerned, I guess you already know that blockchair.com provides it. What I can't find is \"the price of Bitcoin when the transaction is created.\" Blockchain.com has this advance details of previous transactions like the hash, block, time, age, fee, size, weight, and so on, but it's a bit funny and pointless when it comes to the BTC price because they're providing the current price. I wonder why they have to add that detail in old transactions when it's reflecting the real-time price anyway.",

If they didn't record the time, they also wouldn't show the USD equivalent when the transaction was created..They can do this if they want and they can use average price of Bitcoin for all transactions in a same day. I mean all Bitcoin blocks and related transactions that were confirmed in a same day will be applied with Bitcoin price on that day.They can use this price tag method that is not 100% accurate but they can note it in their method and I believe no user will complain. With a note on this, users will know the method and its pros and cons and having a price on a day that transaction was confirmed is better than a today price of Bitcon for value of a 10-years old transaction with today price, not with past price.",

      "body": "Indeed, if there is a price that is executed when bitcoin is confirmed, it will be easier in general, of course if there are other currencies it will also be very easy but maybe sometime in the future, it could also be because it is a form of anonymity too.  CMIW, maybe we should know usd with those stored in wallets or in exchangers only because it is more potential hodl or activity paid or trading, in the number of bitcoins that can be traded, not in explorer because it is a checking account (I like its transparency). I don't pay attention to that sir, because every bitcoin shipment that is sent I only see the hash and transaction quickly, I am more often manual just to simulate converting to other currencies with cmc or coin gecko, even though it only calculates fee  For me, explorer is simple and brings out the important things without reducing its personal / sensitive nature, that's what I think has the characteristics of explorer technology and is awesome.",

I already use it it does not work on TXID but if you just explore your own Bitcoin address it also shows you all transaction history it includes the historical price of Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin's \"USD value at the time of transaction\".I can't see any other explorer that has this feature only bitinfocharts have it.",
