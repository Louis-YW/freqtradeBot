Market is due to crash because it has pumped enough, it has to correct and start another leg of chart.For Cz, he is one of the biggest fishes in the industry so he must always be dragged and his name and the name of his company must always be used to create fud.As for the news you broadcasted, can you please help and add a link to it?",

BTC is not the issue but it can be dragged as we can see the price also dips. CZ will battle with this. there are a lot of winning chances for him.Somewhere I saw that Binance is covering over 60% of the global Bitcoin trading volume I think, so it is quite normal when there are some not so great news that the price slightly reacts. But often it looks more like a quick test of some weak hands whether the market is going into panic mode and then every single time when we had some bad news these days and weeks, there is strong resistance coming up quite fast. It is not like we are dropping double digit percentage points because CZ is getting sued.",

The government is claiming that they violated the control laws of the United States and helped customers bypass these control measures. The market is just responding to the news and I don't also think this news will affect the price of bitcoin that much. This will be a good opportunity for people to move their coins to decentralized wallets. Binance has urged its customers to avoid FUD because everything is under control. The banks are failing the government want to attack the cryptocurrency industry by discrediting it so that investors will be scared. The timing of this suit is a clear indication of the government intentions.",

Oh c'mon this is ridiculous: they're just looking for any pretext to get rid of CZ. I guess this is going to end with Binance eventually pulling out of the US or (hopefully not) a huge fine and Binance going bankrupt. Bitcoin is suffering now because of this FUD but it's going to fade in comparison to what is going to happen if Binance will go bust. Remember Covid dump down to $3k?",

The last time I read was just a fine, and now slapping additional suits means that their offence is grievous. First, the market is not crashing and Binance is not stressed, only that they are lawless. Those guys (CZ and the likes) think they can do as they want in the US just like the global branch with little to no overseeing. Just last week, Binance (global) stopped the withdrawal of all coins, while some lasted for over 24 hours without stating the reason or issuing an apology.

Nobody means anybody, we should face the reality, and don't think this is a vendetta, it's their job and Binance is not the first and won't be the last. This is why CFTC is the number regulator in the world. They have been seeing and warning Binance for years without a change according to their statement.",

It is believed that there are currently three major cartels in the crypto industry that control the majority of crypto transactions.  These are Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex (together with the Tether ecosystem).  Accordingly, the destruction of all three cartels will deal a very strong blow to an alternative financial system built on crypto transactions.  The US government is currently declaring its intention to launch a digital dollar (CBDC) as soon as possible.  However, the successful implementation of this project may require the elimination of competitors (alternative stablecoins).  It is possible that the current attack on Binance is closely related to plans to introduce a digital dollar.  We recently saw a very similar attack on Coinbase.  Will the head of Binance be able to negotiate with the bosses from Washington?  Yes, if the claims against Binance are purely fiscal in nature.  Not if the claims against Binance are part of a global game to implement CBDC and eliminate a competitor.",
