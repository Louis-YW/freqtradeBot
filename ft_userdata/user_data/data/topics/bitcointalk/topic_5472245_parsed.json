Do you agree to this?Crap!!Increased compliance will spur the government to tighten the ring around privacy and anonymity and demand that everyone make their crypto transaction information available to them in real time and anyone who seeks to stay off the grid will have to do that at an increased cost as they clamp down on all privacy related services.Everyone should consider that centralized exchanges will in the end reveal your info to the government and that's just one of the risk using centralized exchanges poses, it also exposes your information to be stolen and you're dependent on their security network, not something you want to do with a decentralized asset.You also don't own the keys.",

They fought back for just a year and Jessie probably just thinks it's not worth it as the IRS will be poking his ass every now and then. IRS was hiring and training more than 87K agents that will enforce their laws, I heard these agents are gonna be carrying guns this time. So those who are in Kraken I guess can expect these agents to come knocking on their doors.You link doesn't work, here it is https://www.ccn.com/news/kraken-crypto-tax-info-shared-with-irs/",

The most likely hypothesis is that the authorities are searching for information related to specific users as part of investigations into a specific case or incident.It is true that it was and still is dangerous to trust central platforms in general, especially since we are in a market that is still not completely regulated, but it is noted that users in the United States are the most vulnerable to detection and tracking. This may have advantages within certain limits, but the extent of the violation of privacy cannot be overlooked. This will not only affect the reputation of the Kraken platform. All platforms will become more unreliable.",

Are we heading towards the stage where other country's government will require same info from exchanges operating in that country. The main difference between crypto and traditional finance is the financial freedom and empowerment which users enjoy but with this type of force regulations from the government will raise concerns.",

Now when they got it trough, they can just demand latest data and Kraken has to comply if they want to stay open. They don't have any point to fight and use more money anymore over that. I am not sure how people think that data was private in the first place. Or why kraken lawyers thought that they had a change. You don't have to know much to understand that IRS has total legal access on those.For someone who doesn't know, this is how every exchange operates if they want to keep working on specific area.I see regulated DeFi and regulated crypto coming. It might be against original ethos, but i really think that this is just too big of a machine to fight against.",

Though, it is important to point out that these kind of information is most likely to be shared to the European Union and the USA, other countries like those in Latin America, Africa or Asia are less likely to find exchanges willing to comply with such big request of information.

It's the downside of KYC and of centralized exchanges. In this case, at least it's limited by transaction volume, although the limits are quite low over a course of a year, and I suppose the IRS is asking for that, so that they can act on it and fine those who haven't paid their taxes properly?",

If it benefits the crypto community, there should be no need for data tracking.I have no intention of protecting suspicious activities, but it's crucial to remember that the government can exercise its authority without constraints, and it's deemed legal. therefore, concerning any crypto-related activities, as long as cryptocurrency hasn't been universally adopted, the government might exploit it to extract from crypto users, whether through substantial taxes or asset seizures without substantial evidence.",

They wanted data from 2016, so if that happened in the EU they'd be able to prosecute only those who did not report taxes after 2018 and by the time they go through all the data and find the exact numbers, it will be late 2024, meaning that only people who traded since 2019 will have something to worry about. Anyway, I got burned by a similar situation. In 2017-18 banks were blocking transfers from crypto exchanges and I didn't want them to report me anywhere, so I found a local exchange that allowed to withdraw money from an ATM, without the need to send it to a bank. At the time it was the most anonymous way of turning bitcoin into cash that I knew, so I used it for a few months.Then the exchange announced that they were asked by the government to share the data of and all transfers of people who withdrew from them. They did not have much of my data, but they had my full name, email address, the location of the ATM where I was withdrawing... That was a warning for me to hide everything I do, so I immediately closed my account with them and started looking for an even more anonymous way to exchange.Bottom line, don't send your private data anywhere. If you just use your full name and address, you can always claim it wasn't you and it had to be someone else who knew you and wanted to hide himself behind an alias. If you send them your ID and withdraw to your personal bank account, it's game over.",
