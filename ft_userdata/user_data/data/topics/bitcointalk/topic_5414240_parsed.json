If you think it's different, let me know.This is actually wrong statement. The tech from the bitcoin is the best innovation that happened in the last 22 years. If there would be no bitcoin ever exist and you would never see crypto exist in the market. It seems true that if only scam token will always be dead during the bearish market. The bearish market will always be wiping so many scam tokens in the market and make these kind of tokens have no volume and then go to the hell. I can't deny the fact that sometime shit scam token that already dead can be pumped drastically by pumpers or whales.",

If you think it's different, let me know.Lmao, Hahaha. Approximately 90% of all altcoins will not survived if the bear season that hits 2017 will hit again that will give a long crypto winter because those team will surely out of funds to support there developers salary as well as for there resources. You can simply pick those shitcoins on low ranks to determine who will not survive because they will surely not gonna last longer with that small marketcap in case crypto winter hits due to few liquidity in the market.It’s very easy to determine what project who will not survived because you can easily spot them by just looking on how slow there development process as if they want to make development slowly to kill investors from waiting.",

Well, I still stick with BNB because I think this is an altcoin that has a strong backing and its founder is still optimistic about the crypto market. So I have good expectations about this token and I believe it will continue to survive in this bear market.",

It's hard to predict which token from so many legit tokens in that market that will be dead. In my opinion if people were also predicting so many scam meme tokens will be dead. I can only say that as the time already proven that if meme token is not worth to be owned. The bearish market will always be killing the scam token to the hell.

Those 2 don't necessarily go hand in hand.It seems to me that BTC and Ethereum thank their growth prospects to their established names, rather than the tech behind it. Hmm. I only partly agree with you. Of course it is true that Bitcoin and also Ethereum have the huge advantage that they are just so well known by now. If you talk with people that are not into cryptocurrencies about that topic then for them in most of the cases Bitcoin = crypto and they no no other project of that category. If they know another one, then it is probably Ethereum. So i agree with you here.I also think though that Ethereum has achieved it's huge market cap because of it's technical abilities and the wide arrange of functionality that it offers. If Ethereum would not be there we probably would still not have the smart contract functionality that enables pretty much every big crypto trend of the last few years. Of course there are other projects now that have the same functionality but they are all copying Ethereum in my opinion.",

If you think it's different, let me know.Instead of identifying what coin/project will not survive this market, why don't we identify what project is better than Bitcoin or Ethereum?I won't even question it when it comes to Bitcoin. So let's go to Ethereum. How about the number of ICO created with the use of smart contracts under ERC20?Up until now, it is still the first choice even though the fees got higher.

If the projects can't survive, that means they will be gone with the money, which will cause less value on the market cap. It's sad, but it's the reality we must face. And I believe that these events will occur on the meme token maximum. Because I think 95%+ of meme projects are going to go away. And almost 10–30% of alt projects might face a brutal moment. But yeah, we are wishing you the best of luck so that you can carry out your project and you do need to face that moment. all the way to every project.",

I'm here to find multiple opinions on hashgraph tech (HBAR). They claim to be gen 3 after BTC and Ethereum, completely outperforming blockchain in terms of energy efficiency, in terms of transaction costs and amount of transactions per second. Also in terms of safety. I'm looking for as many people as possible to tell me why that project is not as bright as the founders say it is. But if asking about details about a certain coin gets users accused of advertising, I guess I'll have to move elsewhere.",

If you think it's different, let me know.Well, I do not think so. If we deconstruct your statement that Bitcoin is having its growth due to its established name not the underlying technologies, it does not have any causation. Let's take a closer look, in first hand, how do Bitcoin gain its establishment? For being a pioner? Or just simply the network and the community stand its time and battle-tested here and there. There is a reason why Bitcoin is established, and the cause of it is what some or many people realize the condition of why the coin itsels has growth potential.",
