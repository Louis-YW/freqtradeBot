Such kind of buying from the open market will surely push Bitcoin price upward, at least temporarily. As per the released audited report dated 30 June, Tether actually holds around 80,667 Bitcoin (4,734,040,881 USD in value) as reserve. You can visit the link below and open the latest report. https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=reportsSo I don't think they will have to buy it from the open market in case the court case goes against them which is highly likely to happen. I am more worried about the sell off as a part of the liquidation process of Celsius. Not now, but eventually it will come to the market.",

What if they have to go and buy it on the open market? Tether claims they are about $12 billion in backup funds to protect investors if the court goes against them. I don't know how many Bitcoins they own, but they might have to buy to settle their debt. If they buy in the open market it will affect the price of Bitcoin positively. Just as the news of dumps makes the price drop, this news will bring the reverse. Both parties might also agree to settle with the fiat equivalent of Bitcoin which will have no effect on Bitcoin market.

Not now, but eventually it will come to the market.   The case might not go against Tether if they can prove that Celsius violated the terms of the contract. If the agreement states that Tether has the right to liquidate the BTC if Celsius fails to bring additional collateral, then the latter has no case.",

What if they have to go and buy it on the open market? There is no need for that, according to Tether's justification, they were given these tokens with a guarantee of 39,542.42 BTC, and when the value of Bitcoin fell and Celsius was unable to provide more guarantees, Tether sold Bitcoin in order to pay the value of the tokens given to Celsius.QuoteAs the price of Bitcoin dropped, and per the two parties’ agreement, Celsius was required to provide further collateral to avoid liquidation.According to the lawsuit, Celsius claims Tether liquidated the BTC at a price point that almost exactly covered the debt without giving it the opportunity to provide additional collateral.Dealing with cryptocurrency collateral lending is very risky and may result in losses if the collateral value decreases.",

That is standard in most collateral contacts. Either way it's on average less then 10% of the daily BTC trading volume. Not enough to make that big a difference in the price.-Dave",

News of Tether's fraud and demise have been around for years but they persist to this day and consistently rake in billions of dollars in revenue each business quarter. The cryptocurrency industry is becoming more regulated and controlled and Tether no longer has a monopoly on the market, they are facing competition from many different stablecoins. So I wonder, if they really have problems, why haven't any agencies or opponents exposed their true nature? https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/11578157228385",
