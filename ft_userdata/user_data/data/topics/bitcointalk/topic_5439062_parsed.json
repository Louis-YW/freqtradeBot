Quote from: KupaCrypto on February 09, 2023, 07:36:48 AMsay no to underageI'm OK with occasional bet, maybe once in every six months or more. And if they must bet they should be supervised by responsible people. And the  stakes and the rewards in bets for underage/children shouldn't necessarily be financial. They could win good books by staking some valuable points on right answer/solution to issues. Quote from: KupaCrypto on February 09, 2023, 07:36:48 AMdont allow greed to take the better part of you whenever you are bettingBet with what you can afford to risk no matter the rewards. Quote from: KupaCrypto on February 09, 2023, 07:36:48 AMso betting responsibly is what every bettorust adhere to to avoid the harmful side of Gamble.Bet but don't gamble",

There are serious consequences when one has a gambling addiction. I’m pretty sure that there are studies out there with negative effects. Perhaps, if there are studies that are made with positive effects, gambling can be done in moderation. Well that is just being optimistic and perhaps parents can monitor and set boundaries to show how gambling can be done in moderation. We were all young once, there is this game monopoly that is somehow that shows moderation in gambling at a young age, eight and up. That’s something we all can all ponder.",

So if you're young, it's time to make mistakes, go broke (but don't get into debt), and learn many life lessons. If you happen to be a problem gambler, you still have plenty of time to change. Shits do harm to our younger self, but it makes us stronger and wiser. It really depends on your perspective whether or not exposure to \"dark things\": gambling, cigarette, and alcohol are good when we were young. I've seen people with no exposure until their death, I've seen people get late exposure and it ruins their life, and I've seen people with early exposure who can recover. Therefore another perspective, gambling does more harm to middle age+ people.",

In most cases, underage boys and girls engage themselves in gambling. I have seen cases where most students use their school fees to gamble, and some businessmen use their capital to gamble, which has caused their businesses to collapse. Some married men starve their families because of gambling. Gambling have done so much harm than good.",

Therefore, if you are a gambler and you pays less attention to it there is no time it would ruined your life even getting to level of becoming an addict. I have some friends who do gamble and smoke but they don't allow all their thinking and concentration being channelled to those things rather developing a serious attention to their work, they knew what they were doing.In summary, as a youth or a young teenager always lessing your thinking on what you know that is not helpful to human living.",
