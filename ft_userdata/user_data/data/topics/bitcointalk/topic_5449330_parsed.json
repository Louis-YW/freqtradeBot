I guess we all have to stick to what we are used to Bitcoin pow is the bee because I can't imagine anyone having to pay such high gas fees to send Bitcoin, and for the fact there have been so much media stunts spreading the falsehood of the proof of stake being the replacement for proof of work which have proven to be lies and false hold. With Bitcoin green energy and renewable energies, bitcoin proof of work energy consumption can now be converted into some other eco-friendly products that can help provide other resources needed to propel another sector such as agriculture.",

You can set your gas limit manually or choose from advanced options or just click from 3 send choices: Low, Medium And High priority. If you don't know what you are talking about it might be better to choose from those 3 options. I admit that edit button is too tiny and i didn't click that before either.",

I paid $17 for a single transaction in ethereum to bridge from L1 to the L2.

It claims to have an \"advanced gas control\" when you hit Send, but it's not showing me that. Controlling the gas will not help you a lot in this case. If you continue by paying less than what already showed in https://etherscan.io/gastracker Your transaction will have no ETA to be delivered. it's caused by your tx waiting for the gas fees to decline first. Quote from: NotATether on April 18, 2023, 06:36:08 PMIs there a way for me to lower the gas fees from metamask, or otherwise import the wallet into some other software?There's no way to lower the gas fees. You will have needed to pay the recommended fees or your transaction will be stuck for so many hours. I recommend you use L2 blockchain like arbitrum or optimism if you wanna using ethereum. It cost even less than btc transaction.",

For sure the OP knows that, and that's why he is asking if there is some kind of control just like in Electrum wherein we can chose how to pay and how much for a single transaction.And in the much touted upgrade of Ethereum, it's supposed to solved the gas fees but it didn't.

It is more cheaper after we have good adoption for Bitcoin Segwit and Lightning Network.Ethereum failed to solve its issue and after some upgrades, that chain always costs its users very expensive fees. It would become more hilarious expensive when many altcoin projects which use smart contracts on ERC20 chain have their hypes in next bull runs, in altcoin seasons.",

They have followed all the marketing ploys needed to keep the blockchain smart-contract game going. I call it a game because thats what it is right now before, if ever, it evolves into something serious in terms of delivering actual value to businesses and the people.The NFT craze was something else. I don't know anybody who paid 1500 as fee but can confirm that I paid significant fee (20-50 USD per transaction) buying a few NFTs myself back in the craze.
