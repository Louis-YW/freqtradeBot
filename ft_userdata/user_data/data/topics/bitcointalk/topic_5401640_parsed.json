  "content": "Hi all,I have been mining almost for over a year now using 8x RTX 3080s (approx 92 MH/s per card). I have always used Nicehash for mining (using Windows 10). If I were to use a different mining software, will I be able to get a better hashrate than what I get on Nicehash these days? One of my friends was telling me that there is a huge difference in hashrates between Nicehash and some other miners but I haven't been able to try anything else yet. But if the difference is indeed large, I am tempted to give it a shot. Also, once ETH goes to PoS mode, won't it impact Bitcoin market and make it more valuable to mine?",

Again I will benchmark for myself and not bother with this forum.you can't properly benchmark nicehashyou can get an approximate estimate that varies like a mofo.nicehash is a rental service for mining it is not a mining pool.So if you point a rig to it and someone rents your rig you could get lucky and get a high paying renter.Or you may get an average paying rentertop renter is paying 1.0048Order#   -- price ------ hash--workers- hashrate5795c8de -1.0048--0.0500-395-----0.052403b5aa1d--1.0047---0.0010-10-------0.0010b2913e9f--1.0046----0.0040--37------0.00446de02a7a--0.9100---0.0010--4--------0.00105fdbaf35---0.9000---0.0010--16   ------0.001076830842--0.8900--0.0010---17------0.0010a76318eb--0.8700--0.0010---13------0.001056c11119--0.8700--0.0010--11-------0.00102c47863c--0.8500--0.0010--18-------0.0010...96b20c65---0.8011---0.0010---9------0.001295efd139---0.8000---0.0010---9------0.0010   I did maybe 20 top renters.so how do you clock nicehash against any other poolVery long test time on nicehash and another poolidentical rigs. and at least 100 days of testing.when you rent your rig out the renter may stick with your rig from 1 minute to 10 days no longer but up to 10 is possible.  So if I do a clock and grab a renter paying top rate for 10 days I could be 10x 1.0048 top rate or maybe 10 days at  0.8000 lower rate. So no short test will tell you how good you do.only a long 90 or 120 day test with 2 identical rigs one on nicehash and one on  Cryptotab.So if you decide to do a 90 day test with two identical rigs you could get back to us and let us know.",

They used to post the exact amount each algopaid. If payouts are as you say posting the average would make no sense. The fat finger does happen and when it does everyone gets the high payouts. On the other side when a high priced,high hashrate, order expires (or the bots reduce the hash rate to minimum) payouts drop significantly as the hash hasto be redistributed to lower paying orders.Since Nicehash is more like an exchange than a mining pool benchmarking doesn't really apply. The payouts are dependant onwhatever people are will to pay for hash, decoupled from the actual mining.Arbitrage used to be possible because order prices could get out of sync with mining revenues. Sometimes Nicehash would paymore sometimes direct mining was better. The bots changed all that because they are all progarmmed to do arbitrage automatically.Nicehash tracks mining pools more closely now.",
