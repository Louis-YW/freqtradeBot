I have seen this news recently in many media and I had not stopped to look at the detail, but now that I do, I have to agree with Sithara007.\"Russia is believed to have defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998 after missing a key deadline.\"Lol.\"Russia has the money to make a $100m payment, which was due on Sunday, but sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors.\"Come on, the allies are eager to break the news that Russia has defaulted. If we want to call it a default, well, more as a matter of semantics than as a description of reality, because it has nothing to do with Argentina's default in 2001, for example.Basically I understand it, in a war, propaganda is also important, and this is propaganda on the part of NATO, that since they do not enter into direct conflict to avoid a nuclear war, they make war with things like this.",

This is how international sanctions work. Even if Russia can pay this amount, but the sanctions have made it such conditions that it cannot do it. Sanctions are designed to make sure that the aggressor does not feel free in this world and put pressure on him in any non-military way so that he stops the war he unleashed in Ukraine.",

On the other hand, forex reserves of Russia is one of the largest in the world, and they have enough funds to make the interest payments. These two countries can't be compared side by side, as the situation is entirely different. One similarity that I could notice is that the ruling class is extremely corrupt in both the cases. But at least in case of Russia, the rulers have made sure that their corruption won't result in the total bankruptcy of the country.
