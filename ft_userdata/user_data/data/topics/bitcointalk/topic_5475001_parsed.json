The reason is simple, because in gambling all possible things can happen and the risk of you losing money is greater there. Unless you are a casino owner, an influencer who works with a gambling platform, or an investor, maybe you will be able to get a steady income from this industry, but if you are just an ordinary player, this will not be possible.",

If that's what you're looking for, unless you are a great referrer or influencer and you can monetize the gambling activity in different ways, in the long term the system is designed to make you lose.It has nothing to do with self control, it has to do with maths: the more you play, the bigger the regression to the media, and the media is loss.",

It is important to have self control to end profitably with gambling ventures online. Do you agree with this ? I don’t believe that there is anyone who can make a steady income from gambling because this is very risky. Gambling should be approached as a form of entertainment rather than a reliable source of income. Even professional gamblers often experience periods of losses, they also go broke. The winnings that pop out are just one-time big time, no consistency. I you already heard that some individuals manage to make a living from gambling, maybe they are very rich, and they can afford to lose how big it is. But for the vast majority, it’s a losing proposition.Whatever strategy you use, none of them guarantees a profit.I agree that control is important, remember your limits, it makes you a responsible gambler, otherwise you have a gambling problem.",

Having steady income for steady winning in gambling os impossible and for that,  anyone who thinks he can achieve such is just touring around with risk and he will eventually lose everything he ever won before and this should be checks and avoided at all time,  and also anyone offering such tips on steady gambling winning may be risking too much already since there is not workable mechanism that guarantee that outcome at all time and the event that anyone is lucky to have won some games for a long time,  he should still know that his luck is what have made that possible for that time,  and it won't be long before he experience loses also.",

Gambling is not designed to make a stable income, no one has succeeded in making it as a source of income as you are risking your money without a guaranteed return. Finding a job will give you a steady income and not gambling.Even with having a lot of experience in playing, being an expert in gambling, or even with skill in some of the casino games, there will be no future if you decide to make gambling your source of income.",

There is no guarantee in gambling and it has a 50/50 chance of winning, you ate advised to gamble at your leisure and gamble for the fun and not be so fixated on winning. There is no strategy that guarantees 100% win rate they only increase your chances of winning. You already show that you have a little knowledge about gambling aand gambling should be at some intervals and not be played regularly and also there shou be as certain percentage of your income you allocate to gambling and always stick to  it no matter what your outcome may be.",

Depends on whether you position yourself as an ordinary gambler a professional gambler with many followers and affiliated with a casino or another type of gambler? Now after you are able to position yourself just measure the income you get. But generally beginners come with the condition of a regular gambler and hope to gamble as a means of steady income. Surely that will not be achieved especially if you rely on luck based games. For example today alone I spent about $70- 100 at the casino just to measure last week winnings. Now with a simple example I am increasingly convinced that making gambling a permanent income focus is a big mistake that should not be used as a reference.",

In theory that is what everybody should do,however since this topic has been brought up many times it means that human greed is much more prevalent than it is the human logic,that is in our DNA so we cannot do anything about it.It is exactly this greed that keeps us coming back,yesterday I was lucky to hit to huge multipliers within the same hour one x8000 and one x6000 in Fish Eye slot yet I withdrew the profit and I still want to play today with the remaining amount,the logic says today is going to be a bad day as you cannot win always yet my greed tells me to try again to hit those huge multipliers.",

This has been tackled here several times, and most of the people who said this to a question like this said that it is difficult to make gambling a source of income. Because it is no longer like a company where you have a stable income every day.Also, no one can say that they will 100% win big money every day in the casino here in the crypto space. And how can that happen if most people's only basis is luck, and without luck, they won't win any games they choose?",

Do you diversify to multiple games in order to ensure that end result is always profit ? Yes, I am able to make consistent earnings in gambling, but this is not in all gambling aspects and I was able to embrace my strengths and guide myself against my weaknesses on where I am not good at in gambling. For casinos as a whole, I wouldn't say that I'm consistent, it has always been winning and losing, to the point that I don't even know the actual one if I had more winning or losing. But I don't care because I mostly play casinos for fun and enjoy it very well that way. This is why I use a small amount when I bet on casino games too. But for sports betting, I give myself a very good pass here, my winning has been steady and I make sure that I do not bet anyhow.I only bet on the games I fully understand and I do not go extreme in any game as many do. I only do straight winnings or losses, and this has been ever helping me stay out of much gambling trouble. Another thing is that I manage my betting account very well, I make sure that I divide the money in my account into 10-15 equal parts depending on the amount present there for each betting. This has been a very useful managerial means for me to make money by betting with ease without allowing emotion to force me into doing what I didn't plan for.",

Fixed income is obtained through real work which is paid depending on the agreement.Gambling is just a test of luck. There we will experience victory and defeat.It seems you already know that the chances of earning a steady income by gambling are very small. The control referred to in gambling is understanding that the gambling system is regulated as well as possible so that they can survive with the number of deposits made by each gambler so that gamblers must make gambling not a place to get rich other than for fun by being ready to lose money.",

As a regular player, I think the content OP is wondering about will be answered by the house. Yes they always win in every activity they participate in, I think the player (addict) will not have many choices about losing a little or a lot. Because I only see more risks than opportunities to make money in this field, I only see it as forms of entertainment.It can be seen that gambling to make money is only for a very few people, and most of them are people who do not like publicity. And let's be more frank if someone loses money in this field, someone else will also win, that's fairness. However, this fairness is built on a game that wins in favor of those who orchestrate it, so there is no wise strategy for anyone gambling. Most of the advice received would be to not seek money opportunities through gambling.",
