  "content": "Many are saying this is the next big exchange. I have a small investment currently as feel it is worth a punt at current prices , market cap is only £49m so plenty of room to grow if it does do well. If it was to 20x in price it would still be less than a billion market cap, BNB market cap is currently £40 billion!Anyone else invested? Be interesting to hear thoughts on this.",

In less than 4 weeks it has seen an increase of over 400% and yet it is still only a $255M market cap. Big things to come for LCX this bull run , anyone else invested?",

It's normal for me that this project doesn't get much attention on this forum, by the way I just realized that this topic was created in 2023 when the price of LCX (LCX) was around $0.07. That means you've already made a lot of profit from your investment, right?Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 28, 2024, 12:40:46 AMBig things to come for LCX this bull run , anyone else invested? I used to be a holder of this token, but not anymore. You said big things are coming to LCX (LCX), do you have any more information on this? I think it would be a good move to invest before the big things you mentioned happen.",

I think it would be a good move to invest before the big things you mentioned happen.LCX pumped in March earlier this year and I took out my investment once I hit 300% return so now holding a bag for free and plan to hold till $1 minimum before I start taking profit. The current market cap of LCX is only $245m which is nothing for an exchange token , I expect it to reach $2.5B market cap minimum which would still be 10x from current price.",

You bought at a low price and now have made a pretty good profit? That's a good profit.I have LCX tokens on this exchange but can't do anything because KYC is now restricted for our country.That's quite a lot of money if sold at the current price but unfortunately KYC keeps getting rejected due to restrictions.",

BTW, In the past few years, LCX (LCX) has experienced a relatively stable price decline. What news could have caused the price to pump up to its current price? I really wonder, because I didn't think this token could get public attention.",
