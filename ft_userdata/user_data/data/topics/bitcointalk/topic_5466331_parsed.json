But you are supposed to have a backup of your wallet dat file before making any changes. If you do then try replacing it.Another problem is entirely different, your address created by HD Wallet will be there so either you send funds to the wrong address or copied the wrong address which is the reason you can't see the address. You can try to import the HD wallet into another HD wallet using the mnemonic phrase so it will work in case if the previous wallet is having any issues related to syncing.Check the address on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer to see the balance.",

Please !?I wasn't very \"in the know\", when I started this recovery, I didn't have the blockchain... I thought it would be easier but this log once again showed me that it wasn't!I had to be more careful, that's it...but here I am listening...?!an idea, ? I have to do what ? If it's too old and recently modified, could that mean that's the problem?I modified it a long time ago now... 1 time dump, 2 times modify, and tree times encrypt, but no coins... after import dump ??what I do import ?",

The actual message that you'll see when encrypting a wallet:As you can see, the unencrypted backup is useless once you've used the encrypted wallet to generate new keys.The reason for that message is because the HDSeed and keystore are replaced with a new one after encryption (setting a passphrase for the first time).",
