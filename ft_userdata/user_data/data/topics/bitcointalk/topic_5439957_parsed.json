It could have been written in a more generic way. Problem gambling depends on an individual. Gambling houses have no role there. Gambling is a legal business and there are several medical resources available to counter/handle problem gambling. The link you have shared is one of such resources.",

If this platform is proven to be a good site with promising results in terms of at least effectively reaching out to gamblers and providing them with all the mental and other forms of assistance they need except monetary, cause we all know where they'd probably spend it on if given the chance, then that's great and I'd be more than happy to recommend it even along with you guys. Gambling addicts are as self-destructive and dangerous as addicts of other objects, so it is important that they get all the help they could to recover and get back to being functional members of society.",

Casino games are mostly based on luck alone, unless you are playing different poker variants or other types of online games that also require skills. Sports betting is a combination of both. If you think about it, gambling in general (sports and casino) produces quick returns that are hard to come by elsewhere. You can double your money in the two hours that a sports event usually lasts. Not to mention bigger profits. Even if you just get 15% or 20% back from your initial wager, it's still incredible. I guess most people don't think too much about it.

I think so too, but it doesn't work that way. Addicts don't stop. They keep chasing that rush. We who aren't addicted don't understand that they have to play and are too weak to do anything about it. It's the same as drugs.",

Right now I can control myself by limiting the time I consume on gambling. I play only whenever there’s a giveaway or promotion which my campaign helps on spotting them because I visit various post here due to gambling post requirements.Working for a gambling company and avoiding being addictive on gambling is really a pain in the ass but still it’s manageable with rate control on your priorities in life.",

I think it's the reason more are into online or crypto gambling now than in physical casino as well in cash basis casino. There are more ways to pay now thru mobile apps or mobile banking but when it comes in crypto we we're urge to play more knowing it's value can increase in time that causes more thrill to some players to play.",

Going all-in on a big win might seem like a good idea, but it's not worth the risk, fam. Trust me, it's best to take a step back and do your research before taking the plunge. Personally, I've found that trading and investing for the long term is a more solid choice than gambling if you're looking to make some real bank, ya feel me?",

OP doesn't have a problem (or at least hasn't told us about it), he's just sharing a site that helps people who do. Casinos won't fix your addiction for you. It's like asking a pizza seller to make you stop eating pizza. The site may help, OP, but I think that if someone really wants to quit he'll do it with or without such sites. On the other hand if they don't want to quit, they won't. You can spam them with support groups and make them self-exclude but they'll still go back to gambling.",
