      "body": "Review:I tested the site out after receiving UBUCKS successfully by placing some bets in various football markets since I usually deal with Cricket and Football betting. Below are my observations.User Interface:- I loved the entire black and green site theme which blended well with all the UI elements of the site. I liked the name and symbol of the site too which I felt were quite unique.- Demo markets in various places are very helpful for beginners and I like the fact that they are explained properly through the information symbols.- Placing bets was a relatively simple process and vigorish being updated in real-time is easily one of the biggest pros of this site.- I was surprised to see no scroll bars in various parts of the site. Checking places where we can manually scroll is annoying which is why scroll bars need to be added asap.Payments:- I didn't check metamask since I opted for the magic option. Linking my email account through magic was a breeze. After confirming my email, logging into the site basically took around 2-3 seconds. If you don't log-out, you will stay logged in for future sessions.- I received 2 deposits pretty quickly though I didn't withdraw anything, but I am expecting it to work smoothly without any issues.- I was able to redeem my winnings successfully, but I noticed one of my bets never got settled and it still shows 'Live'. This is a bug which needs to be resolved asap.Goals:- Ubet is aiming at doing something completely unique which is pitting punters against liquidity providers using their automatic algorithm. They are taking advantage of Web 3.0 tech to provide a completely decentralized experience.- Centralised sportsbooks pit punters against the house while exchanges pit them against each other which is why Ubet's approach is completely different and worth appreciating.Community:- I checked out their Discord and Telegram communities and observed that their mods were doing a good job answering any queries that bettors had pretty quickly. For example, Daniel(Telegram mod) answered and resolved all of my queries quickly.Rewards and Promotions:- Beta phase rewards are very, very tempting. They are currently running a tournament where everyone bet with UBUCKS(Free and Fake currency) and whoever lands in the top-10 end up receiving USDC rewards which is real money basically.- You simply join their Discord/Telegram communities and request UBUCKS which you will receive in a couple of hours. You can use them to place and win more UBUCKS in order to try and join the top 10.Overall, I had a great time testing the site out and am looking forward to playing here primarily because of their unique betting approach and their willingness to accept sharp bettors.",
