Even bitcoin loses a ton of its value during bad economic conditions, so I'm not sure how people still believe that it does not and will not lose its value and be a solution to inflation. Keep some bitcoins and help yourself, but do not expect that bitcoin can retain that value 100% of the time. It's not a magical object that is immune to anything negative, it has its flaws too, so better stop believing that it's here to always save the day.",

Small part, but it already is part of it! Bitcoin is not meant to prevent any collapse, is meant to replace the collapsed system. And it is still volatile just because there is still not enough liquidity to be able to absorbe the bigger transactions, that's all. We need to give it time for adoption, education, etc. Bitcoin is and will still be perfect for storage of value and also as a global economy. Don't forget that LN is part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.",

It tries to convince us that Bitcoin is a good investment to mitigate inflation, but it doesn't talk about its volatility even once. It's trying to say that Bitcoin is a good investment because it's immune to inflation, but in the same breath, it admits that Bitcoin's prices swing up and down based on people's opinions  . So if you're thinking about investing in it to save yourself from \"inflation\", you'd better be prepared to ride the roller coaster lol",

Basically inflation is when the prices of the commodities are increasing thereby increasing the percentage of expenditure we do on a certain commodity. I think after bitcoin our percentage of expenditure would still remain the same as the price of the bitcoin will increase we will eventually get lesser income in our hands which too will be sort of an inflation in itself just something absolutely reverse. So how will this problem get solved?",

      "body": "It both can and it can't.Technically because bitcoin has limited supply it should not have any sort of inflation and its value should be stable. But the problem is that we are not yet at mass adoption levels which means the price is very volatile. On top of that we have a small market that can be manipulated at times. For example we saw how the recent crash took place due to panic sell and market manipulation.Good news is that this is short term. In the long run the price is not affected by short term fluctuations or even crashes so the effects of inflation (in fiat) is well covered if you own bitcoin.",

Bitcoin itself is decentralized and no one can control it. Bitcoin isn't supposed to prevent an economic crash. It can prevent inflation because the supply is finite, and deflationary by definition. The current inflation of most currencies in the world are cause by the Ukrainian war, but not solely due to the war. A lot of the inflation was due to money printing in 2020 where the government though of the genius idea to pay people to stay home for a disease that has a 99.5 percent survival rate.You think if a country's currency was Bitcoin only, they would elect to enforce lockdown measures? The only reason lockdowns were affordable was because most governments thought they could borrow from themselves (aka money print) and make up for it with future economic growth. Problem is, the economic growth fell behind and wage increases are unable to keep up with inflation.Bitcoin could have prevented all this.",

Bitcoin has burn addresses. You can send BTC to these addresses but no one owns the private keys to spend from them. So that's Bitcoin's burn mechanism. You can google Proof of Burn or Bitcoin burn addresses for more information if you want.I remember that someone said that some of these burn addresses were created by altcoin developers. I guess the goal is to remove a certain amount of BTC from the circulation to mint an X amount of altcoins.",

In US this year's inflation is about 10-15% if I remember accurately. Did Gold increase with that amount? --> Heck no. It is a lagging indicator. People will choose to save in Gold because it is durable and has been historically used to store value by banks and states. So.. you see.. the society has a memory.Bitcoin is still not mature enough to be stable during economic recessions because many people still view crypto as a risky asset. This is due to it being a rather new asset. We had Gold for thousands of years. Bitcoin is only here for about 13 years, BUT the adoption is rising, institutions are starting to integrate it.I'd say that Bitcoin can be used to fight inflation, but only for the long-term.

The example of a person who bought 1 BTC in early 2017 for about $1000 shows us that this person could have profited even x69 if he sold at the peak, but even a solid x20 if he would have sold the same BTC today.In the long run, it makes sense to keep your valuables in Bitcoin, and in moments of crisis that will surely occur at least every 10-15 years, fiat will lose its purchasing power much faster than Bitcoin. Therefore, I would say that it is possible to fight inflation with the help of Bitcoin, but not in the way that some people think - Bitcoin is not magic money that will solve all our problems overnight.",
