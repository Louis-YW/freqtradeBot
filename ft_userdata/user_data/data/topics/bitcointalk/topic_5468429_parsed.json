But then we have to five room for new coins development so for that we can't deny them the right to promote they coin here in the forum and this is one of such but rye ops need to add more information and content to the top.",

I'm not saying it happened here, but I've seen such strategies in 2017. Super successful ICO, tokens sold out in 1 second. Then the listing and the price cascade down. Reason? The ICO was fraudulent, the buyers were developers themselves, to then spam social media about the huge demand for their tokens.What happened to the previous project you hyped? \"DingDang Bubble\" From what I see, it is not listed on CMC and coingecko. is it Dead?",

However, it didn't last though.Again, it's very obvious, when the market is going to be saturated with this kind of \"X bot\" project and this shill in this community to be the biggest, but then again who knows as it might be just used to create pump and dump for this kind of projects, sorry to burst the bubble to the OP.",

Im not fully trusting this platform but let's wait till the launch of its token on uniswap. Bubblebot already guaranteed the investors in the pre sale if the price will be trading above the ico price. It sounds kinda scammy combined with non sense APY that being offered by the platform. Let's see how it will be going but im sure that price may be also dropping below the price that already promised by the team. The era for yield token alreadyd one. Anything about yield token is now BS. Any garbage site was never publishing the contract used to raise the funding. Shit scam project will never be transparent. I expect this to be pump and dump token after listing.",

This is an old school trick which we have seen earlier and after all it's a mere 97.25 ETH which can be contributed by the dev team themselves for purpose of marketing I think it's one more pump and dump coin which will either dump once it's launched or will not even reach the exchange.  I can name dozens of such shit coins who have boasted about the pre sale numbers and dumped everything on the day of launch itself in a third grade exchange.",

This type of fraud does not require large sums of money to rise, so by controlling the supply by freezing or slowing down withdrawals and pumping demand. By investing $200,000, the price of this currency will easily rise 100%, and whenever someone invests in it, even if the total investment is the same, these scammers will count their money and the currency will decrease.",

The scammer was manipulating the frontend from its site to lure its victim. Kinda funny how OP posted the site instead of a reliable source like coinmarket. Pretty sure that's already a red flag for investors since any of these websites can be artificially manipulated most of the time, and those without the knowhow don't even know how to check if the data pulled was from the devs ass or from an API of a legitimate exchange or something. Though looking at the candles, if I got the right coin, it seems like the coin was indeed bought instead of front end manipulation, just that it was the devs who did that to artificially pump the price. Probably dumped it immediately once some idiots bought.",

It's obvious when they are promoting it here in the altcoin section that they are going to do a pump-and-dump scheme, one of the reasons is they do shill marketing, only dubious projects will do such a thing they've been doing this for two months already.People should be quick to spot projects that will turn into a pump and dump, they do shill marketing, the platform is being blocked by anti-virus and the APY id not realistic and is just made to entice you to invest because of the high profit.",
