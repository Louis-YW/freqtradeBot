  "content": "Alik Bakhshi  New military-strategic alliance in the CaucasusA significant event took place in the South Caucasus region; Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey concluded a military-strategic alliance at a meeting of the defense ministers of these countries in Baku. This union is not unexpected, but quite an expected regional event and is the final stage against the backdrop of the existing economic ties between Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, and, most importantly, having the prospect of further expansion to the East, if we take into account the revival of the Great Silk Road, which connected in ancient times Mediterranean civilization with China.
