  "content": "This Bitcoin bubble index can be a good extra tool for you to watch the Bitcoin market and be alerted of time when people are starting and probably most FOMO in this market.It can not tell you when Bitcoin hits its all time high or a peak of bull run but can signal you about time to seriously consider of market exit.It is from Coinglass.https://www.coinglass.com/pro/i/bitcoinBubbleCoinglass provides some charts but I like two charts for Bubble Index and Google trendYou can visit Google to get data for Bitcoin-searched Google trend: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=bitcoin&hl=enWe are like warming up but still calm before a storm too all time high.",

Quote from: dzungmobile on December 19, 2024, 02:07:27 PMDo you think, oppositely, that this correction is nothing like a bubble, and it's only good opportunity for Bitcoin accumulation?BTC is still above $100k and many people may not see it as a good time to accumulate, especially if they haven't bought any when the price was low. However, for stronger hands, every correction is a chance at further accumulation.",
