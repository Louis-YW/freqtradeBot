It's amazing how the rise of ordinals, or jpg monkeys as you may name them, has increased network fees for Bitcoin. And the cherry on top is that individuals are now turning to meme coins as a way to avoid the exorbitant fees! It truly demonstrates the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market and the inventiveness of people involved.",

They need to do something about this.how do you fix the 12 to 1 advantage scrypt has over btc.what ever you do both doge and ltc can copy it.My suggestion is very simple end the dust for two jumps. See what happens.no send of btc under 0.0001 can go on the chain.maybe it works.we ended the 0 sat sends a while back.right now LN is not ready for prime time.So shunt the sends to other chains see if it works.The main pools and big miners have a plan..  this is simply testing for the plan.blocks drop to 3.25 in april how do I make fees stay over 2 or better three coins.pretend we should be 6.25+.75= 7 coins a blockthat becomes 6.25 + 2.75 = 9 coins a blockgo to the next ½ ing3.125+ .875 = 4 coinsthey can get3.125 + 2.875 = 6 coins a blockso the reality is we drop from 7 with no fee  manipulation to 6 with fee manipulation .basically no ½ for the miners.test is their early testing.",

The thing is that there's nothing much we can do about the whole network congestion situation, since at the end of the day we chose this back when we're warring about blocksizes. I myself use a different network/coin when transacting nowadays, just makes it easier to track in my opinion, and sometimes you get the off-chance that you placed your money on a coin that's bound for price hike, so you get that bonus profit too. Anyways, until we finally find a fix regarding bitcoin's blocksize and all that shit about scalability, we'll have to make do and scrape for solutions ourselves.",
