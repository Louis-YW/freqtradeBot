Please, try to inform me as to why this is not a Great Idea for Starting Today!What are you trying to say or propose here, to be honest with you, i don't understand anything you said in this thread. What is \"a huge multi-seed, multi-season \"TV smash Hit Show\", what does that mean and how does it even concern crypto. Maybe if you want suggestions or advise, you should make what you say make sense to readers.",

Please, try to inform me as to why this is not a Great Idea for Starting Today!OK, it's not a great idea because any decent producer is going to be able to get more funding and resources if anyone sees this project as viable. Otherwise you are just going to be throwing money into a black hole.1st come up with the production budget. Then come up with the sales and marketing budgetAfter that find a decent producer who is willing to put an established name on the project and they are the ones who get the funding.That's TV & film production 101.-Dave",

Has someone \"suggested or tried\" this before, or is the team we start in this thread the first ever?I have never found anyone who run such kind of funding for tv smash hit show and I believe it's really a new concept so far. But, the worst thing is that no-one is going to fund a project like that because without knowing the makers the investors won't put their money into something like that.

Please, try to inform me as to why this is not a Great Idea for Starting Today!I'm not interested in it and I believe it isn't a great idea at all. It's something that most people will avoid because they find it as a trap to grab money out of their pockets and nothing else.",

How do you fund a show, if you do not provide the information on what the show will be about and who will be the producers of the show? (Anyone can take their cellphone or a camera and video tape something and do some basic video editing and call it ....content) Â Do you actually have a groundbreaking idea for a show... or are you asking people to crowd fund an idea... that are not formalized yet? Yes, adding the word \"decentralized\" to a concept.. sounds nice, but it has to have some kind of business plan.",
