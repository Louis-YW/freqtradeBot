You can import your wallet addresses, master public keys or connect directly to supported exchanges to automatically sync your transactions and balances. They provide real-time price updates, portfolio performance analysis, and even customizable alerts to keep you informed about market movements.Be careful, though, as there have been reports suggesting that some apps might collect and share user data with blockchain analytics companies. I would not use these apps if anonymity is of utmost importance to me.",

This would allow the OP to get the current balance of each address, albeit it wouldn't provide him with a total sum. Is there any command that he could use in CLI to sum each value from the provided addresses and spit the result at the end? JQ[1] seems very promising to do this kind of filtering but I'm not sure what the command line could be:QuoteUse JSON for Simple Calculation by ValueUsage Example: Automatically calculate the value of the UTXOs used in a transaction.You can now go one step further, and request the .amount (or any other JSON key-value) from the UTXOs you're retrieving.This example repeats the usage the $usedtxid and $usedvout arrays that were set as follows:$ usedtxid=($(bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction $rawtxhex | jq -r '.vin | .[] | .txid'))$ usedvout=($(bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction $rawtxhex | jq -r '.vin | .[] | .vout'))The same for script can be used to step through those arrays, but with an added pipe in the JQ that outputs the amount value for each of the UTXOs selected.$ for ((i=0; i<${#usedtxid}; i++)); do txid=${usedtxid}; vout=${usedvout}; bitcoin-cli listunspent | jq -r '.[] | select (.txid | contains(\"'${txid}'\")) | select(.vout | contains('$vout')) | .amount'; done;0.90.4At this point, you can also sum up the .amounts with an awk script, to really see how much money is in the UTXOs that the transaction is spending:$ for ((i=0; i<${#usedtxid}; i++)); do txid=${usedtxid}; vout=${usedvout}; bitcoin-cli listunspent | jq -r '.[] | select (.txid | contains(\"'${txid}'\")) | select(.vout | contains('$vout')) | .amount'; done | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'1.3Whew!OP: In order to achieve a better degree of privacy, I would recommend you to run your own node and then you could retrieve this information without relying on any external entity by using Bitcoin Core CLI.[1]https://thunderbiscuit.github.io/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/04_2__Interlude_Using_JQ.html",

As the old saying goes, if you are getting something for free, then you are the product. These services are almost certainly harvesting your data and sharing and selling that with third parties. Setting up an Electrum watch only wallet synced via your own node avoids all this.If you do want to use a crypto portfolio app, then I would suggest manually entering aggregated balances rather than linking it with your wallet or specific transactions, so it cannot track your specific coins.Quote from: RickDeckard on June 11, 2023, 10:56:04 PMWould it make sense to use listunspent[1] afterwards? This would allow the OP to get the current balance of each address, albeit it wouldn't provide him with a total sum. Is there any command that he could use in CLI to sum each value from the provided addresses and spit the result at the end?He can use the command listaddresses(balance=True) to get a list of all addresses alongside their individual balance, or the command getbalance() to get a total wallet balance.The reason I suggested just doing listaddresses() on its own is because even if he imports a bunch of empty addresses, it means his watch only wallet will automatically stay synced with all this other wallets as he uses more addresses (until he exceeds the gap limit on a wallet, in which case he will need to import the next set of addresses).Quote from: RickDeckard on June 11, 2023, 10:56:04 PMOP: In order to achieve a better degree of privacy, I would recommend you to run your own node and then you could retrieve this information without relying on any external entity by using Bitcoin Core CLI.I obviously agree as discussed above, but actually if OP is going to be running his own node anyway, then he could avoid the Electrum watch only wallet and simply use Core, importing the master public key from each of his Electrum wallets in to a single Bitcoin Core descriptor wallet.",
