If there was anything wrong with your account,  it should have been started in the agent's response to you,  you can still create a reminder for the agent letting them know your issue is still pending.",

How it is possible if your country is in the allowed list ? Or you mean to say that the documents you provided for KYC are not satisfactory ?Did you talked with the agent and what exactly did he said about the KYC documents ?At first, i thought that you will get your withdrawal as 16 hours or so is not a big deal but now things seems complicated and Rollbit seems to have a valid reason denying you payment. However, your case is not clear as i don't think you have told every details here at the moment",

Now the agent is telling me to kyc but apparently documents from my country are not accepted but my country is not on the 'restricted countries' list Perhaps the reason is that you just deposited your money without any wager and you try to deposit. If I'm not mistaken, there is a wagering requirements not just in Rollbit but any casino for that matter and probably it trigger that in their system and that's why they are asking you to do a complete KYC as this is mandated by law (and I hope you know that).I don't understand what you mean by your documents are not accepted. But for sure you have a passport or even a national ID that the casino might accept so at least make it clear to them.",

Because you consecutively withdraw both huge amount and typically casino already will require KYC with that activity and amount.Can you provide screenshots of conversation with the support? You ch use talkimg.com to upload image and share the link here.It’s odd for a withdrawal to become pending for over 16hours without any verification pending because Rollbit has a fast withdrawal feature.",

There's a reason why some withdrawals are delayed. You mentioned that you deposited it, but did you wager the funds you deposited? If you did, then your funds will likely be released if you haven't violated any of their terms of service. However, if you didn't wager the funds, there might be a wagering requirement for every gambling site. In that case, you'll need to meet that requirement before you can withdraw the funds.",

When there is a long queue in the withdrawal process it would take 24 hours to be released. And you have not waited for 24 hours, you just come here to create thread. At least you would have waited for one day before complaining. This days the support service team is not an experts in gambling and not even from the technical unit so most of the questions gamblers and clients asked them, they could not answer them. Op still wait for more hours and in the process of waiting, still communicate with them the best out come of the pending withdrawal.",

And from the look of things,  I think the ops have more cases with the casino because I can see that from the reason stated in his KYC document rejection is stated that the ops document is not from the accepted country.",
