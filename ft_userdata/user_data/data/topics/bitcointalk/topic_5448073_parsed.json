      "body": "I rarely play in live casinos since the pandemic, but in the few times that I was able to get my hands on real cards and play real blackjack, I tipped the waiter not out of satisfaction but out of empathy. Keep in mind that this is during the period at which COVID-19 is losing social media traction, and offices/businesses are starting to react by reopening and reactivating operations. I tipped the dealer because I know for a fact that they had the same rough year as I do, to give them some money to work with so they don't have to starve for the day given the fact that not everyone got paid once they started gettign back to work you know. Still to this day, it was one of the most satisfying donations (if you can even call it that) I have ever made, no regrets whatsoever.",

And you're right its a way of saying thanks to them and also its considered as oride status, if you don't tip they might look like you an alien but in some countries you don't because where tipping is seen as some kind of bad behaviour so just adapt to it where you are playing.",

You gave tips because you are satisfied for their services and for sure that guy enjoyed well playing with that dealer. Tipping a car a big one, lucky for that dealer maybe that gambler won millions of money. Tipping is fine for me as long as I make profit.",

      "body": "I don't play in live casinos and it's not that common to tip the dealer in an online game. I mean it happens, but it's much easier to walk away since you're anonymous, so people don't do it as often as in real situations. When I go to a real casino I play slots so I don't tip. I'm also from the EU and unlike the Americans, we don't tip often here. I once saw Americans complain that people in Europe don't tip at all, but the general opinion here is that you need to provide exceptional service to get a tip. You are paid for doing your job and a tip is not a right but a reward.",

But on my side, I will not give tips once I lose, I give tips when I am in a winning situation. However, they know already that tipping should never be seen as mandatory or expected, while it is a way to show appreciation only. That is a lucky dealer who has received car as a tip, probably that player who gave tip has won a big amount.",

I've tipped also before but barely amount like a dollar or five.",

Just a chip tip and the dealer appreciate it.And I guess it's normal to give tips to them from time to time, at least that's how I saw like the norm when I started to play table games in a land base casino. Even in hotels or restaurants or any other services, most of the time people give tips.",

But, this is not for a poker dealer who always sits dealing cards to gamblers, I will give him tips If I finished the game by winning, So it also depends on what game we have playing, if the dealer does seem to be hard working, we should give him tips as a reward, not a bribe for giving a good card.",
