The initial inflation phase just ended and the real bull ru n is starting soon.My suggestion would be better if a topic like this is placed on Speculation (Altcoins) because it is about altcoins even though you say PLSD is a combination of dogecoin, bitcoin, and hex. But I think altcoins are always more suitable to be discussed in the Speculation (Altcoins) sub, regardless of any combination, because for me the inflation phase has not ended and the Bull run has not yet started.",
