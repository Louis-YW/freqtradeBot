  "content": "There is a new scamming strategy on the horizon, newbies be on the watch out Optimism airdrop is still active and that's why some scammers have come up with a NFT/Coupon Ticket style way to trap unknown victims, especially their ones that have interacted with the optimism chain before. The image of the NFT has all the information available, I can swap this NFT for 1000 OP token, I believe this will be confusing for newbies who aren't familiar with scammers way of doing things. Optimism.market is the place or the right place to sell this NFT for 1000 OP tokens and I do visited the market place and I got a very bad warming from my browser to stay away, here is what the warning looks like. I bet what's ahead is very dangerous, you will have to connect your wallet and that is where all your assets will be moved out automatically, Be cautious out here.",

For all those who can't resist all those \"lucrative offers\" I can only advise to be extremely careful, and I would also agree with @Upgrade00 that the best way to protect yourself is to not deal with such things.The Internet is something that offers countless possibilities, but in addition to the good things, it also has its bad side, which is full of lies and deceptions that lead to where no one wants to end up. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies (and by that I mean altcoins and NTF) are a perfect tool for all those who have bad intentions, and there are a lot of them online.",

Thanks for this warning. I got the same warning when I tried it out. It's now been obvious for everyone to be careful with the coins, tokens and NFTs offer these days, many of them are not genuine but are just there to steal your money.Albeit, it will be foolish of anyone in this internet age to connect their account with an unfamiliar website. Such shouldn't happen no matter how trusting they could appear, especially when what they are offering is too good to be true.Be wise!",

The only way to avoid phishing attack through them aside totally avoid them is to use a separate wallet aside the wallets that is used to store ones funds so that when a phishing attempt is made you won’t have to bother or worry of losing your funds",

      "body": "Unfortunately, such phishing methods are very common. You can see many scam ads about them especially on social media. There are plenty of them on places like Facebook and Twitter, there are similar scams on Telegram and Discord. You shouldn't connect your wallet anywhere you don't know. Protecting your multicoin wallet is more difficult than protecting your Bitcoin.Remember that no one will give you money for nothing. If you do tasks for potential airdrops, only follow the official announcement channels and remember that they can also be hacked. Always be on the alert. Money is hard earned and easily lost in this business. If it's too good to be true, it's probably a scam. Although there are many warnings about this, one can catch it in a careless moment.As for Optimism, the airdrop has already been done. I don't think there will be a new airdrop. Be aware of new projects that don't distribute their coins yet. I see too many scam airdrop links for ZkSync and Starknet lately. If the project is popular, there is more and more scam promotion about it.",

These scammer could actually make an unnoticeable change to a site like putting a dot or a comma or anything of sort that at a click in your ignorance it redirect you to their phishing site intercepting your data unknown to you.

But I have always known that the days of getting any coin for doing nothing have come and gone. So we need to be careful when these platforms come up with certain packages that are too lucrative. High profitability will always be the bait that will entice people to embrace these platforms. I have decided not to take part in most of these coins, tokens, and NFTs this is because I have not developed the needed skills to identify these fake coins. It will be better to only deal in coins that have shown to be reliable and genuine.",

Airdrops sound like casino bonuses to some newbies to Cryptocurrency, they are interested in getting something free that is why they still consider airdrops.

I am glad your browser saved you and you stopped there and did not fall prey to this website offering high rewards. But many people with less knowledge will definitely fall for it. You have done great work here, but you should also share the source from where you got that link of earning this many tokens because that depends more, and you should report that post to and account also.I wasted a lot of my time in airdrops back in 2022 but got not that much profit because i afraid to perform all that tasks (idk why i was afraid but i gave up by participating in a few). We all should follow the official platform of such airdrops and should not connect to any website, and should remain more careful after the big airdrops because that is when real FOMO starts and people starts to perform a task in every airdrop they hear about.",

Even when it comes from the project that has proposed the airdrop directly, it's also highly advisable for one to know which wallet he or she is connecting to on a third-party site. Any Web3 project in which I find interest, I usually create a separate wallet for security reasons so as not to completely lose my holdings because of some careless move.Thanks for the information and the warning to newbies who might not be informed of the scam.",
