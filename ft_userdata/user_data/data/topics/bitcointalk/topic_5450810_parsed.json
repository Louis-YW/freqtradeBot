  "content": "Binance team detected Justin Sun trying to cheat Binance launchpool event of SUI tokens using his TUSD. The launchpool event partners Justing since Binance allow TUSD to stake and earn SUI tokens which basically trying to cheat with his huge bag of his own token.Quote from:  https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1652949031524376579?s=61&t=KvAyBeyzVhJJLph8n5IBkgOur team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will \"take action against it\". SMH.Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.On the bright side, blockchains are transparent...Justin on the other hand post a silly explanation that his team is the one controlling his wallet which is a joke since the person that he wants to put a blame is a mere intern. An intern that has an access to his million of dollar funds is a big joke. The community bash him for this.Quote from:  https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1652954970000617474?s=61&t=KvAyBeyzVhJJLph8n5IBkgRegrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns. Upon realizing this error, we immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund of the funds.Luckily blockchain is transparent which record all the shady transactions of con artist like justin. When jail time to this guy?",

Also the issue here was he is partnered on this particularly launch pool event which means he is not allowed to participate since he literally controlled the majority of the supply of TUSD tokens. This is a breach of contract between Binance and him which CZ stated on his recent post. If Sun do this on small giveaway, I’m sure he is doing far worst than this with his scam USDT and other project that he has involvement.",

Second, trying out to cheat on SUI airdrop on putting up his baghold is never been ethical in the first place.Good thing that Binance didn able to detect it out and find on whose the owner of such wallet. If ever this wasnt caught then for sure they would be laughing outand making some easy profits on SUI drops.",

Justin can be considered as a guy with tremendous influences. taking wrong step will be only destroying the reputation that is owned by binance exchange site. I can even imagine once justing was taking legal action against binance since disabling an account without inappropriate reason leads the reputation of exchange site to be destroyed. Binance considers there will be so many consequences by banning him from the exchange site. There will be so many people will be also taking legal action or withdraw their money from binance. I can't agree if binance to ban justin. He has not made any mistake.",
