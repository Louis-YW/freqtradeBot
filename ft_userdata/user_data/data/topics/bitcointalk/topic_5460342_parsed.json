You have tried enough. But in case of next time, you need to be careful because some sites may contain malware. But if you do not give your device permission to download automatically and if you use another device and you format or reinstall its OS after finding out, I think you are safe. By looking at the site, it is clear that it is a scam site.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on July 19, 2023, 02:41:47 PMPeople are using Opay for transactions not because it is free transfer or because they don't put charges, people are using Opay because it very fast when it comes to transactions, whether some one will Send money give you, or you go send give person especially if na Opay to Opay.

So in situation like this, I think when people ask questions in area where they have little or no knowledge about it, it helps them from falling victim to fraud, which is a habit I go like make every newbie inculcate both on and off this forum.",

Just the other day one called me at about 7am telling me that he's UBA customer care agent. He was so foolish that he didn't know that that was too early to call an customer and besides no UBA customer care will call you.Well back to the gist, before we click on a link for any Bank you have to double check it because they clone websites and you wouldn't even know when your information is copied from the back end.",

      "body": "Bitcoin/cryptocurrency traders truly use Opay a lot for their p2p trading and at that,  hacker mind will be on okay since they know that their customers base has increased since their lunch into the Nigeria market, so this is no longer a new thing and for that we must have to avoid click any link or answer anyone claiming to be from opay customer care,  I don't know how some of those scammers managed to know all pay customers details and sometimes it looks like an insider job. Because pay scam is not only in phishing attempt but also cut across another type of scam attempt,  what I will advise Bitcoin traders or any other cryptocurrency traders is that,  use only the mobile app from the play store to access your Opay account and stop using the website,  because websites can easily be cloned.",
