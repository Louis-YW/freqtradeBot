Once you send the TRX to transfer the USDT out of the wallet. The TRX will be stolen and won't even be able to move out the USDT.",

Had you had a little bit of reputation here or a good enough activity. I would have sent you the TRX without having any doubts that you would refund it.",

Can you tell me which website to use to buy TRX with paypal or my credit card?Use centralized exchanges since you're going to your credit card, that's the easiest way where you can buy TRX as you need it. The exchange that's commonly suggested on this one is Binance:(https://www.binance.com/en/blog/fiat/can-you-buy-cryptocurrency-with-a-credit-card-421499824684903691)Also, you can do that with Trustwallet.https://trustwallet.com/buy-tron/",
