Open source wallets enables you to control your keys by yourself as they are decentralized noncustodial wallet.For you to be able to exchange your bitcoin to fiat and vice versa,you will need to register in an exchange like Binance or Kucoin,so that you can use their p2p to buy and sell crypto. After registering make sure that you have completed their KYC verification before sending bitcoin, and don't leave your bitcoin in the exchange because it is centralized and they are in control of your keys. You can loss your funds in an exchange as they are vulnerable to attacks.Bitcoin wallet- which,what,why",

Tokens aren't my best suggestions to invest in. If we look at history we go see say most projects wey dey do well for bull market no be tokens but coins (that's projects wey get their own tokens) some of dem dey start as tokens but as time dey go on dem go change sharp to coins and get their own blockchain. Na mostly tokens wey whales dey use do pump and dumps but most coins dey actually build so some level. All the layer 1 projects na coins and na project dem wey dey do well as people dey build on them. We get Ethereum, Solana, BNB etc all of dem are coins not tokens. All smart contract projects gets to be coins at some point. If na tokens wey OP dey talk about just forget those ones or no hold dem for long time unless dem get plans to change to mainnet for future.

CZ has a tendency to exert control, yet he is not someone who takes security for granted. CertiK audits Trustwallet and other closed source wallets both internally and externally. Centralized exchanges have the full control already and there is no privacy while using Binance. Noncustodial wallets are different.You meant that Trustwallet is the best for altcoins, and I was only implying that you can use it for a lot of things like staking, but it is a close source wallet which is the reason I can not recommend it.We weren't discussing the features; Op was simply asking about decent wallets for altcoins, and I have no doubts about what you said. Closed source wallets are not recommended, however if there is one that supports more Blockchain, it has to be Trustwallet. The main issue I experienced with Trustwallet, and the reason I stopped using it, is that it does not broadcast transactions when the amount of UTXOS dust is high.   Trustwallet support 70 Blockchain + 4m assets + NFTsQuote from: Charles-Tim on September 11, 2023, 09:10:21 PMQuote from: Igebotz on September 11, 2023, 08:35:59 PMCertiK audits Trustwallet and other closed source wallets both internally and externally.To believe in someone when you have no idea of what is going on? There is nothing that is transparent like open source wallets because their codes are available to the public to review.I don't trust closed source projects but I somewhat trust CertiK audits.  They have a reputable to protect.",

Na the best wallet to use wey get all the feature of a good Bitcoin wallet like RBF, multiple addresses etc. Yes electrum na the best bitcoin wallet if you no get money for hardware wallets which me I no go tell newbie to jump into using because it requires proper knowledge. Better still you fit even use am as cold storage. But all this features na for the desktop version oo because the mobile version no get all these features like coin control and some others. The best for mobile devices will be BlueWallet, you go just import your electrum seed into it on mobile for easy use.

Seriously there is no better multi coin wallet that supports many coins like trust wallet. They were even open sourced before but went closed source later on after announcing it was for the protection of the community as stated here. Funny enough since this transition they have been having multiple issues of bugs like transaction fee’s getting higher after an initial one was initiated. Early this year they even had to return some users funds due to certain bugs. Since people don’t know what is going on behind the scene it is risky to trust them even if CZ seems like a good guy. Also they have one of the most frustrating support. My advice will be to use unstoppable and then use trustwallet for tokens or coins not supported there. It is risky to trust open source at all even if we don’t have any option than to use them",

And preferably Bluewallet is good to use because it easy and reliable the the second recommendation that I will make is Electrum wallet which is one of the best for newbies. And all are open source wallets and if you like to use custodial for extra Monetary transaction at any time because such case happens sometimes, that is apart from the main wallet you are using there are sometimes someone might ask you to send another wallet to him to send coins, as of that stage you can send the person Trustwallet. Open source wallets: Electrum while close source wallets Trustwallet.And please make you no keep your coins for exchange platforms wallet because dat place anything can happen at anytime since no be you dey in charge not the wallet fully. If government close down the platform sef your money e don go be dat, or in case all dis hackers hack di platform, your money don go so make you avoid dam with maximum way. But you can send coins there and sell it instantly. You can buy coins from there too and send di coins to your main wallet you keep your coins. Op stay safe.",
