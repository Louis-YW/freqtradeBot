He can do this using other name and start fresh if he just want to continue posting. I agree on @Pawel on this one. The only downside for starting new account was he can’t post images and post interval is long compared to his account limits when he is a senior rank. His account is a participants of long running signature campaign so there’s a high chance that want to recover his account to regain his previous position campaign or to join on other existing campaign.",

I'm always of the opinion that people have the opportunity to defend themselves and show the reasons why they did what they did. Even if that doesn't free them from a punition, as is logical.But, now I was intrigued about this case. The user is normally only banned permanently if he repeats his mistake, or am I mistaken? If so, then you have repeated the same error over and over again.Another thing, if the account is banned, it cannot have activity, right? The user with a banned account can't log in, can he?So how is he active today?",

Temporary ban is usually issued for spamming. Quote from: joker_josue on January 28, 2023, 06:13:22 PMRight, that's what I thought. So how is he active today? Wasn't he banned a month ago?

You will be permanently banned if you make a plagiarized post and the appeals are very unlikely to be accepted. Temporary ban is usually issued for spamming. We have exceptions. There were many who were given a second chance and unbanned with the condition that they can not participate in signature campaign. Their signature space is disabled for a year or two. I don't know the gravity of the offense OP did but if it is slightly tolerable then a signature ban can give him a time for redemption.",

Is it possible that you are banned for plagiarism and spamming the same time?Did the admin or moderator tell you that you were banned because of plagiarism and spamming?Could it be that you feel you have plagiarised unknowingly?I have read where people say about auto ban and it looks as if only a moderator will know the type of ban.But if you were banned because of spamming, I think you have a good chance of getting your account back because I have checked your history and it doesn't look like you were spamming recently.",
