  "content": "Security of your Bitcoin investment is one of the biggest challenges that most newbies face, to the point that some of the newbies who have fallen victim to the various security attacks be it on personal Bitcoin wallet attacks, where newbies get exposed to phishing that steals security keys and thereafter taken control of the wallet, or exchange hacking that leads to lost of wallet balance on the exchange, etc.This scenario has a large-scale negative impact on the overall motivation of newbies in the industry, but as a member of Bitcointalk we have the privilege to access good information that helps shape our understanding and approach to security safety, even though we still have a few security challenges but it has been reduced to the barest minimum if only you as a newbie can play your own role to safe guide your investment.Let me share with you Newbies a few elementary security guides that helped me through the journey The first tip is that your first primary assessment should be to build knowledge on the best security method to use with your wallet.1: type of wallet to use: make sure you make the best choice when it comes to your choice of wallet to ¬†¬† ¬† store your Bitcoin.2: level of security of your wallet, what is the level of the wallet security and how well does the wallet allow you to add another level of security of wallet e.g. multig 2fa, etc?3: avoidance of greed tendency e.g never being involved in anything such as investment unless just to buy Bitcoin and hold, because doing so will allow you to always be 8n control of your wallet, since most other investments may require you to transfer your Bitcoin to third-party platforms that may or will become scam or victim of security crisis like exchange hacks.The above tips may look theoretical and lack technical analysis, ¬†but they help a lot and I advise you to apply them as a newbie in other to have a good start in your Bitcoin journey.",

      "body": "Well said! The safety of the fund is important since if the fund is lost, the whole thing is pointless. I believe that there are different wallets and platforms with their different offers for security, all should be weighed and used appropriately. I prefer to use smartly combined passwords, email and SMS altogether and I've never been scammed whatsoever. It's also advisable that the gadget of your wallet is not the gadget that receives codes for your account verification. Even before anything, as part of the measures for safety, the choice of wallet matters so much. The non-custodial wallet with open source is arguably the best, and if one must trade with a centralized exchange, trusting it with little funds is better and all possible security features are advised to be put on.",

I knew then how important it was, I know how important it still is. If a newbie becomes a victim of loss of bitcoin, it is very discouraging and can make the newbie not want to continue investing in bitcoin because they will feel that bitcoin is not safe to keep.",

The first is entertainment, games, etc. But mostly, it is on such sites that we get a bunch of viruses that remain on devices for a long time, causing some kind of inconvenience. Therefore, if you are going to deal with financial issues, separate the places where you will use the Internet for entertainment from the places where you are going to deal with investments and handle wallets. That is a serious matter. Computer security begins with the understanding that you don‚Äôt need to be distracted by bright banners, tempted by calls for easy money, or trust that someone suddenly gives you prizes. Even if you don‚Äôt have the money for an air-gapped device, a hardware wallet, or even a quality antivirus, you can safely use your Electrum wallet, provided you are confident in your Internet surfing skills.",

Clicking on links that says they are giving away BTC in reward and bounty's for certain promotion online should be avoided totally as a vast majority are phishing links and malware with which they get access to your wallet.I always advise newbies that there's almost nothing as Bitcoin investment outside HOLDING, stop patronizing these scammers who come with such ideas as Bitcoin doesn't give such turn over in such a short period of time, never will you see a legit Bitcoin turnover yielding such huge amounts they promise in very short time especially when it's not a bull run, even Bitcoin trading is not very ideal as some of this scammers come with the idea of trading and making it look very appealing, but I can assure you from experience if you are not the trader do not entrust your portfolio to another to trade for you it's not safe.¬† HOLDING in a safe wallet still remains the best way to invest in Bitcoin.",
