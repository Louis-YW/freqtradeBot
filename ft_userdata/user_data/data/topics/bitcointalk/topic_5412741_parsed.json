Obviously, California is on top of the list by a long shot but the rest may surprise you (or not).The research focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum between May 2nd and august 21st. With that, the firm has measured the two asset’s web traffic on their platform to find the highest interest comes from which states. Putting California aside as the number one, Illinois and New York came in second and third on the list.However, California has had over one third of all Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) web traffic on CoinGecko. So, when the central banking system collapses, the Californians are probably readiest to and on their feet.\"",

But, beyond that it's about what I would expect.Florida has (although it is shrinking) a large population of tech workers so being in the #4 spot is about right.Washington has a lot of tech too (MSFT & Boeing)After that it just kind of shrinks into whatever / population bars IMO.-Dave",

As opposed to an anti-bitcoin state, in which citizens would not be interested.That would be consistent with seeing a state like California knowing for e.g. they wanted to make bitcoin a payment means to pay taxes, licenses, and other stuff. Look at NYC, Washington...by the wayThe graph makes me think about hip-hop music in The US. The same old battle East coast VS West coast",

I would have thought with all the financial stuff going on in NYC I figured it would be higher. Chicago is somewhat of a financial center (for example is home to the CBOE, and various futures exchanges). I suspect that a greater percentage of people working in finance in Chicago live in IL compared to the percentage of people working in finance in NYC living in NY (they often live in NJ). Further, there is a lot of infrastructure located in NJ for people located in NJ, so some may appear to be in NJ when they are actually in NY.",
