You really expected Ponzi schemes classified as Defi's with too good to be true high APY's to last for years? People never learn.Secondly, a bitcoin market always corrects after smashing through to an all-time high. This is not new.Quote from: LDL on December 11, 2022, 11:29:17 PMDozens of unexpected events have struck fear into the minds of investors.  Starting with investors, governments and central banks have taken a cautious stance on Bitcoin.  So we are almost at the end of this unexpected year.Nothing new except that people are still so foolish enough to keep their money with Ponzi schemes",

But is Bitcoin failed due to such scams / fails? No, Bitcoin is still working and I'm confident it'll stay like that.  Sometimes, we'll have more scams and the BTC price will go down, sometimes we'll have less scams, resulting in a rising BTC price. Just take Mt. Gox as an example. It might have resulted in a declining Bitcoin price but the overall Crypto market came out stronger because people learned an important lessen: not your keys, not your coins. And sometimes people even need to learn twice as FTX has shown.",

Despite all the mentioned incidents in the OP though, Bitcoin remained resilient with its price holding on above $15,000. Isn't it amazing to think that Bitcoin's bloody year means its price will have to fall to $17,000? That's a lot better than its bloody years in the past. And this has already priced in the failure of the giant FTX and other big platforms. So despite a low price in the end of 2022, it has actually grown stronger.",

Investors can only look at this bear market to be an opportunity to make millions when they have money but for those who have lost because of these scams, it is a horrible nightmare.

I still have my doubts on the adoption of Bitcoin by the Central African Republic, perhaps it is because it is not a case which has had so much attention as El Salvador, because I have not heard anything from there; not mining plans, plans to build a Bitcoin Treasury, wallets for the population, etc. Last thing I remember was the document itself about Bitcoin and the choice of that country to adopt it.",

The more that it is becoming popular around the globe, the more scams and hacks were being attempted in the last several months. I guess we should take advantage while the price is this low- the fact that it reached a peaked $60,000 means that there is the potential of it recovering again at that price.With all being said, I guess the smartest move to make is to HODL for the meantime and sell at a convenient price.

Sure, short-term especially the ones that have been burned will take better care of their keys etc.In the great-scheme of things, with all the mainstream-media-attention that the FTX fkup is getting, this may help to increase general awareness for good Bitcoin-security-practice.
