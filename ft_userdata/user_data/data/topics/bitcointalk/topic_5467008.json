Especially for the people who say bitcoin mining is bad for the environment and this Cambridge University's Updated Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index Reveals Lower Energy Consumption update serves as where the bitcoin mining usage stands and its compared to what even though it is somewhat inaccurate still it shows which we can compare with and how governments are exaggerating and blaming bitcoin for mistakes they are making.",

We don't need too much study; just see the whole Bitcoin chart and realise where we are now and what will happen in the future.I just scanned through the materials and found out that they contain relevant topics that will be helpful not only to newbies but to everyone. Most of the news we get from the media are designed to promote some kind of agenda.  Some politicians and economists use the media to spread FUD in the Bitcoin space just to discourage people from embracing this decentralized coin. One of the frontline a piece of news is promoting news that Bitcoin consumes more electricity and destroys the environment. Meanwhile, the energy consumption of Bitcoin is highly overestimated just for the sake of achieving their agenda. I will have to find time to read the recommended materials and I encourage newbies to check them out.",

If the investor’s prospect doesn’t agree, then it’s okay for them to go with whatever gives them peace.The only time I feel i might have a course to argue is in the event of me having to put out a proposal and have needs to defend it against them critics.
