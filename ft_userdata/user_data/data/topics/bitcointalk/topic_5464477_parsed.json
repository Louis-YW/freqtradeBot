I had attempted it back in 2017 or 2018 and wasn't too successful, if I'm honest, and gave up, and it was completely my fault because I put in no effort whatsoever, while I had no experience back then and fortunately, only suffered minor losses. After I started getting involved with cryptocurrencies in early 2021, I decided to involve myself again after spending some time on the forum. I aimed for at least 8% to 10% profit on each trade, and I'd conduct 2 to 3 trades per week, depending on the market situation, of course. I was far from being ready to trade on a daily basis; sometimes I'd hold for a few hours, other times for a day or two, and sometimes even more, as times were much more volatile back then.It was honestly a fun and interesting experience; however, it's extremely nerve-racking and stressful. As an anxious person myself, I wouldn't be able to keep up for long because it would start affecting my mental health and free personal time. So yes, trading isn't something everyone can handle; thus, I decided to keep holding my Bitcoin until I'm satisfied with the results.",

In cryptocurrency market it is time that makes the difference in our profit-making.Right on, trading isn't for everyone but everyone can be an investor and a holder. There's the track for those that are frustrated with trading and that's why you don't have to quit the entire market just because it's not working for you. Those that have experienced and thought that trading is the only way to go have already seen that they've got no future with that. But there's nothing wrong in trying as long as you can afford to lose the money that you're putting there as your capital. While in holding and following the strategies like DCA, you'll just have to endure the painful market for a while and will see how effective it is in the long run. We've been there and done that and that's why it's a good and perfect strategy for those folks that don't like to see themselves lose with their trades. In short, you'll still have to trade but that's only the time you'll do when you're going to buy and take profits.",

Trading is a battle of mind and experience, so only trade if you think you’re already capable enough.^ It is because not everyone has these requirements which require a combination of knowledge, skills, experience, and emotional control. Without a thorough understanding of market dynamics, technical and fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies, the potential for losses can indeed be high. Engaging in trading without the necessary preparation and competence can lead to unnecessary losses and frustration. Because for me, trading is not guaranteed us as always success it demands continuous learning and adapting to changing market conditions. So if you will win, someone loses.",

It's because newbie traders mind tells trading is the way to get out of a poor life. Their mind is full positivity, and positive emotions where even they don't have enough knowledge in trading they think that it's easy. It's also what mostly mentors taught that you will be rich in trading, and that's what I also taught before. Realistically, it's possible to happen but if you only have a small amount of funds it's difficult to be in that place because you're not always win in trading,  there's no always a good setup in the market, and sometimes you experience a couple of loses. And that's what I see in trading that make our dreams to hold but we have to pursue trading especially if we are profitable because you will only fail if you quit.",

Stopped for at least 2-3 months, saved some money then do trading again. Same result. Did the cycle at least 3 times, and after that I didn't trade anymore. Currently, I stopped trading already, but will I try trading again in the future? Yes I will, and will lose again.  Kidding aside, I will try trading again in the future for sure.Trading really isn't for everyone especially for those who are BI-POLAR who change their mood very easily. Trading isn't for those impatient people as well. Trading isn't for those who can't control their emotions as well (like me). Trading isn't for those investors who are thinking way ahead to the point that they want to get X amount of dollars in a short amount of time where in fact, they can't get it. Trading is only for people who has self-control, patience, have knowledge in trading, and for those who are ready to lose money. Kidding aside, I always like to go the safer route which is DCA. Trading can give you more profits in a shorter amount of time, but at the same time, you can lose money doing trading in a shorter amount of time compare to just doing DCA that it takes a long time, but it's safer.  For those who like who tried, and failed multiple times already, come to your senses, and decide whether you still want to do trading or not.",

If you are inspiring trader, make sure not to skip the learning process.I realize that in trading, no matter how good your technique or strategy is you have to use the stop loss strategy alongside incase their is volatility and it is only traders who have seen this experience often times that will keep to it. If you don't apply the stop loss, you may be succeeding until a certain time that it will backfire on you and you go back to zero level. If you don't have the right emotion, you won't have that sound discipline to trade with stop loss even if you reduce your leverage.",

You said good points about bitcoin and also good points when talking about shitcoin. In bitcoin I think in the beginning we also followed others, it's just that the difference is that when we followed others and we looked for reasons why we decided to follow them, and after we found the answer we (me personally) did it until now. It's different when talking about shitcoin, I see most people who fall into it are people who don't want to be left behind (FOMO), and that's a bad thing. More worryingly, sometimes people who already understand are also trapped in it.",

Day trading can give you profit occasionally but in the long run you are deemed to lose. Yes, but indeed all traders have their own way of trading, maybe you are a trader who likes fundamental analysis and there are also some of them who like technical analysis in doing so. But, all back down, they have their own ways and of course they also have their own ways of balancing the level of risk and profit, there are no restrictions on choosing both of them here. It is true that someone who is experienced does not mean that they can fully benefit, but they can also experience losses. What's more, Bitcoin is volatile, every time the price will always change and that means it is indeed very difficult to predict where the next price will move.But besides that, we can still have a chance to survive by using several factors of self-control in our trading and also maybe with definite plans and targets, it will be able to balance everything there, especially to minimize losses.",
