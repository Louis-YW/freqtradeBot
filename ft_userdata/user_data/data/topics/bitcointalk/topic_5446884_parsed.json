Don't be pessimistic with your post, always remain optimistic in all you do. This post absolutely negative minded in all ramifications. The absence of mixer and signature campaign entirely will never bring down the forum. The forum was working fine before the introduction of signature and will continue on that path even after signature are ban either temporarily or permanently.

The future is always uncertain and there are many factors that can influence what will happen tomorrow.However, based on past experience, we can make some assumptions or predictions about what might happen. For example, the sun will rise in the morning and set in the evening, people will continue to go about their daily lives, and various events and activities may take place.It's important to remember that unexpected events can also occur, and these can change the course of what will happen tomorrow. Therefore, it's always a good idea to be prepared for different scenarios and be adaptable to changing situations.Well, it seems like the only things we can really count on are the sun rising in the morning, setting in the evening, and people going about their daily routines. As for everything else, it's just a guessing game.",
