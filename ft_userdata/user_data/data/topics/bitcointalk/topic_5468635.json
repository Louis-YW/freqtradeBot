Also, many Bitcoin users adhere to the laws and regulations, and most of them pay taxes. It is true that the expansion of Bitcoin will reduce government control, but caution and the availability of options that enable it to achieve a good return from the strike may make many governments choose the path of making Bitcoin legal and it is necessary to report what you have to the authorities, which does not reduce the decentralization of Bitcoin.If governments want to harm Bitcoin, they can start sabotage attacks, but why would they do that when they will not make any profit from it? Bitcoin is not an enemy of a country.",

The main feature of Bitcoin is that you have complete control over your capital, and you will not face any problems in any unexpected situation, but since there is no physical status of Bitcoin, no matter how much money someone invests in Bitcoin, the government does not get any profit from it.I think one of the reasons for the fear of the government is that if a big investor invests his capital in a production industry side instead of Bitcoin, then the government will get tax as well as employment for the people. There is also a possibility, from which the government gets benefits from both sides. Both the government and the public are happy with the investor, and such investment is encouraged. On the other hand, the government does not see any benefit from investing in Bitcoin for itself and the public.",

Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? Are you not aware of the hacks going on in crypto space recently? I don't think that it's the tax government that is making government to keep contemplating on whether or not to give green light to the adoption of bitcoin. Whether you have bitcoin or not, you're paying tax directly or indirectly. Government of Arab countries most especially the Islam practice ones perceived bitcoin to be illegal as it is not traceable which I think it's the reason in some other states as well. They consider bitcoin as a support of fraud.Frankly speaking, scammers are hiding under the umbrella of bitcoin to continue their fraudulent activities and disguise as bitcoin investors. It's trending in my state now. Internet fraudsters use bitcoin to cover up. For things like that is why some government are yet to give approval for it adoption. Despite the the advantages they focus more on its otherwise.",

Both can work together if bitcoin will just gain positive adoptions coming from big merchants and other big institutions. Also they are not afraid of bitcoin's existence its just they are not sure about its true usage and for now they have impression that bitcoin is use for financial crimes like money laundering and etc. But if they would know that something great happen in this technology and see peoples lives change for sure they are also going to adopt it and put some law that can protect all bitcoin users or rather the whole crypto industry then think about putting some taxes so they can get benefits for this adoption. For now don't get confuse about what you see since its normal reaction for regulators that want to protect their citizens. Focus to earn more bitcoins since this kind of thoughts is not worth to think about and you will just get stress on that scenarios build up on your mind.",

One can comfortably say it is the hope of the common man since the value of fiat keeps reducing.

Bitcoin is the real multipurpose digital gold.Definitely, the government cannot completely ban bitcoin. But I do not also believe bitcoin and the government are at war. Satoshi himself did not create bitcoin to be at war with the fiat, rather to complement it.
