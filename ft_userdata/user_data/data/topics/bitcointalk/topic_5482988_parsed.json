The best way to store your seeds phrase is to write them down and save them in a place that you are the only one that have access to such place  in case anything happen to your system or phone, your coins in your wallet will not be harm since you still have the seeds phrase to restore them back and continue having access to them. The worst way to store seeds phrase is to save them in your phone or laptop and the day you misplace your phone or laptop, there is no way you can gain access to your coins again.",

This was went dogecoin was like fractions of a penny and when ETH was in the single digits. So instead of sweeping those addresses I just erased the wallet when I was done with it, coins lost forever pretty much.Also I used to send in whole numbers instead of exact figures. If I had 1.04 ETH or so, I would just send 1 ETH because the rest wasn’t worth typing out.",

What are the best and worst ways of storing a seed in your opinion?So far over the years of my crypto journey, I didn't experience that I lost my seed phrase or forgot about it, maybe because I have my own way of securing it and accessing it. Honestly, in my first years or early days of my crypto journey, I only typed my seed phrase in a notepad on my computer and let it sit there, but luckily I didn't encounter someone who hacked my computer and accessed my passwords and seed phrase. But maybe because I have knowledge when it comes to technology and the internet, I know what to avoid and what to do to secure my properties. Remember, if you are storing your seed phrase on the internet, like Google Drive or cloud storage, then stop it immediately because hackers could easily access it. But if you are storing your seed phrase on your device only or on a computer, remember to encrypt your files containing seed phrases and don't access malicious websites because there are places where you can get malware that could access your device and steal what it can.",

What are the best and worst ways of storing a seed in your opinion?I have never made a mistake or lost my seed phrase since entering the market until now. There are many ways to store seed phrases such as writing them in notebooks, engraving them on small steel plates…you can use whatever method you feel is safest for you. As long as you always store them offline, never store your seed phrases on an online platform. Another thing is to always have 2 to 3 backups and store them in various safe locations so that in case one of them is lost, we still have access to our bitcoins. For me, I write my seed phrase in a notebook and have 2 more copies stored in different places and of course they are all safe.",

It can be hacked. There are real life examples.Storing your seed online generally is badStoring your seed phrase where people can see it is not goodStore your seed phrase offlineStore it on paper, laminated paper, steel or titanium sheet. Do not use aluminum.Have like two or three copies.You can use passphrase with it but store separately in different locations.

If you lose either your seed phrase or passphrase, you lose your coins.Think about natural disaster and if it happens, how you will not lose your seed phrase When I saw the various natural disasters that happened last year, I realised the importance of storing seed phrases in waterproof and fireproof materials. Another important condition is to save the seed phrase in locations that are far from each other. The earthquake in Turkey, Syria and Morroco affected large cities, while the Libyan flood destroyed the coastal city of Derna. It might be good to store your seed phrase in different locations if possible different cities because of large-scale natural disasters.      Quote from: Text on January 26, 2024, 07:14:15 AMThe best way to secure Bitcoin, especially if it has a significant value, is to have a hardware wallet.

Writing down your recovery seed is a safe method if you can keep the book safe, but I recommend multiple recovery backup, just in case, you only have to make sure it's back up offline, you can write it down in two separate locations and keep your mouth shut about it. Avoid taking screenshot of your recovery seed, do not store them in any online cloud storage, if possible you should get a hardware wallet, they are always safer than software wallet, make sure the bitcoin wallet you are using is fully open-source like Electrum.",

What are the best and worst ways of storing a seed in your opinion?I am not just that careless person unless I do not have an interest in a thing. But I must say that I'd lost access to my wallets, not even once, but the good thing is that I do not have money in any of them, which could also be responsible for the careless handling. The first one I lost access to was the one I forgot my password and also lost the seedphrase. That was around 2014, I never took it seriously. But recently, I made a terrible mistake, still, I do not have money in my wallet, if not, it would have been disastrous. I got to know of an issue when I wanted to move money to the wallet.As a smart person, I first uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to be sure of the seed phrases, it was then I discovered that I copied the wrong seed phrases. I later went back to the registration page of the app to find what was wrong, and that was how I discovered that the pattern was not as usual as I thought. The style was confusing, so I copied the right words but in the wrong arrangement. Thank God I've never sent money into it.As for the best ways to keep the seed phrase, I don't think there is a better way than to write it down manually and also duplicate it. But ensure that you keep them in separate places. I also like to code one word out of the words there to make it more secure in case an uninvited eye sees it. However, I think the worst way to keep it is to save it on your gadgets.",
