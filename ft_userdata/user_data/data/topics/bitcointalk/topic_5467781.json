Before the use of bitcoin for this many of the citizens of developing countries usually save their money in top fiat currencies like dollar just to beat inflation heavily affecting their own local currencies but the amount of this international currency like dollar’s available to them is not enough and also getting then through banks is a long procedure, right now bitcoin had breech that gap. Not only about saving into bitcoin but many from this developing countries can now purchase goods or services without converting their currency to any international currencies but rather with bitcoin from platforms that accept bitcoin as payment. Quote from: Tellek Garing on September 23, 2023, 05:45:32 AMor hold onto their tokens as an investment. It should be noted that tokens shouldn’t be used as investment because most of them do not have a long retention period and as such they should be as just things that can be traded. An investment is something that can be hold for a long time and only bitcoin has that potential",

A hedge against inflation is also an asset and an investment, like gold for example. They are not opposites.If we talk about third world countries in general, the only way I see that they can take advantage of Bitcoin to try to beat inflation would be to legalize it as a currency, as they have done in El Salvador, to try to attract investment and have an alternative to remittances and the dollar.On the other hand, if we are talking about people living in those countries, it will depend on the individual situation. Someone who has such a low income that he spends it all and still lacks it, the Bitcoin will not help him against inflation because as soon as he gets paid he will spend it, besides paying transactions fees and surely a fiat conversion fee to be able to spend. People in those countries that have a higher income and can save can use the Bitcoin against inflation, but as in the rest of the world.",

Simple, the Weimar Republic!The country would have to spend its own currency on buying hard currency in this case Bitcoin, but nobody wants crap coins like Argentinian pesos or Russian rubles or iranian rials, so by them trying to buy Bitcoin they devaluate furthermore their crappy curency, so ending worse and worse and making inflation also worse.Bitcoin won't save a country, gold didn't save countries in economic peril in thousands of years of gold standard, so neither will a bunch of code that wasn't really designed for that.Now if you don't believe the theory how about this:Over 50% of Turkey’s Population Invests In Cryptohttps://beincrypto.com/turkey-crypto-adoption-bitcoin-dominates/vsQuoteArgentina and Turkey are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the G20.
