We can't neglect this fact and many more as Bitcoin has helped create many jobs in so many facets of the economy. But what I am not comfortable with is your topic of this thread, the global economy is vast, and the decentralization of bitcoin could not help in impacting it much as most transactions are private, not to talk of you using \"all\" in your writeup.",

Because some people expect to become millionaires overnight. However, Bitcoin has become a part of the global economy, despite government opposition. As a result, Bitcoin has a minor impact on the global economy, and the global economy has a direct impact on Bitcoin. It all comes down to investor sentiment.",

And when I conclude how it has advanced along the years I really don't know how I could have earned what I earned without Bitcoin in my life. If I relied on fiat, I wouldn't have made 5% of what Bitcoin proportinated me. But you have to be careful. Since Bitcoin is a very valuable currency and asset, it will lure attention from scammers from every kinds. If you don't keep your coins well protected and if you fall for investment promises over your Bitcoins, there are serious risks you can lose it entirely or partially, prejudicing your financial growth on long term.",

And probably it will inject some of that in the economy too, and that's the beauty of having an extra money because you have the purchasing power. But not all have succeeded though, investment or to make money here is not that easy as it sounds. It's not an easy or get rich scheme. You really need to have a lot of patience and you a strong mentality and be intelligent when to buy and when to sell to enjoy your profits and then make them sustainable in your end.",

What make Bitcoin different is because of its unique nature which involves privacy. The problem this other assets would have is that, they are not available for purchase without our identify been exposed but with Bitcoin you can invest anonymously without having to expose yourself. This is one of the reasons Bitcoin has a better chance of helping those struggling financially to get some break. Bitcoin makes it easy that the playing field becomes level and everyone is opened to the same opportunity unlike other assets.",

I am not talking about actual crypto billionaires who have been rich long ago, but this is about users who started trading and investing with a low budget and made money from it. Bitcoin and other crypto investments have driven billionaires richer and changed the financial status of ordinary users for the better. This is real, and not just a success story about a few users.Governments can also profit from it despite until recently they mostly only legalized bitcoin and crypto as investment and trading assets. Governments through tax regimes have benefited greatly, after all they also make profits from exchanges or other crypto companies apart from traders and investors.",
