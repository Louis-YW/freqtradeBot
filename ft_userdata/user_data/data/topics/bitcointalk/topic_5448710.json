It's like a formal promise that someone will fulfill their part of the deal. It's pretty handy in situations where there's a lot of risk or uncertainty involved.@PureMixerio, how do you expect your customers to prove their deposit in the event of a dispute?

The minimum amount for performing the mixing service is: 0.001 BTC, and the maximum amount for today is 56 BTC. But the maximum value of 56 BTC may vary (downwards). This is because our system automatically displays to the client, who is on the payment page, the liquid amount available at the current time period. This may be due to the fact that, for example, PureMixer has successfully sent a transaction to the client, but has not yet received the change. As practice shows, this is quite a frequent phenomenon, since the turnover of transactions into and out of the mixer is quite frequent.As for your offer to provide confirmation of reserves, unfortunately, this contradicts our strict privacy policy. The service was created and is intended for anonymization and privacy of digital traces in the blockchain. Therefore, in our opinion, it will be ridiculous and uncharacteristic if the service for providing such services does not adhere to them itself. We are convinced that if the two sides are equally strict about the caution and privacy of their affairs, then the result will be appropriate. We call it \"rules of business hygiene.\" More about this and about our strict privacy policy in general, you will be able to find out very soon in our telegram channel. We are preparing a post on this topic. We perfectly understand your distrust and wariness towards us today - this is normal, because we are a business in the field of finance, and not in the field of children's toys. But just give us a little time, and we promise that you will change your opinions about PureMixer for the better, because that's where we're going.Quote from: LeGaulois on April 13, 2023, 05:56:40 PM@PureMixerioQuote We are not and will not be on social networks and forumscontradicting   Hello, LeGaulois! We would not call this a contradiction, but rather an exception. The fact is that during our 4 months of existence, we have faced a number of different problems directly in practice, namely: a) Problems with trust in the project. In general, it is understandable, because there is not much information about us due to the specifics of the organization. And so, in the future, when users have any doubts before using the mixer, they will be able to go to this branch and read various kinds of discussions, like the one that is happening now and already visualize everything much clearer.b) In view of the first point and the fact that the site of our mixer itself does not have any detailed explanation in detail, and in the Telegram channel we have not yet physically had time to post posts that would exhaust many questions. Because of this, we had to constantly answer many users' questions in considerable volumes, of course, describing and explaining how our product works. This, let's be honest, turned out to be very tedious.c) Well, another reason why we found it necessary to come to this forum is that we really believe that we have created a good and effective tool, but you, crypto enthusiasts from all over the world and with a huge background in this area, will be able to help us bring PureMixer closer to the status of the best in the world.",

The order number key function is identical to the letter of guarantee function - in case of problems or disputes, this will be your personal and only proof that a certain transaction in the mixer belongs to you. Of course, there is no scam here. In addition, if problems or disputes arise, the letter of guarantee will testify and be proof that your ownership right (in this case, bitcoins) was sent to the service and at the moment of misunderstanding is in it, and not with you or anywhere else. BUT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE a REFUND of these funds, as you yourself mentioned, if the operator turns out to be a fraud and decides to appropriate your coins. To sum up: the letter of guarantee guarantees the evidence base of the actual location of your funds in the service, but not their return back to you.There are no additional risks for customers due to the order number key, once again - there is not and cannot be. Perhaps you just don't understand how this element functions. Well, dear LoyceV, we will tell and describe both to you and to all other outside observers how the order number key works in the system, because we are here for this: After filling out the mixing order form and confirming it, a mixing order is created. At this moment, the Order Number Key is automatically generated, assigned and attached to it (the order) to all other data you have entered, respectively. In other words, order number key combines and becomes one with all the information about your order, and, accordingly, it is broadcast on our servers together with it. Order number key is unique.",

So, you may not have any clue who am I but you will surely know a lot of my addresses, I mean ABCDEF owns all these addresses. Can you please explain it more because I'm not an expert here as I said?Hi Little Mouse! Indeed, our commissions are among the lowest on the market. The total majority of mixers today have commissions starting from 0.5%. And for a considerable number of mixers, they even start at 1%.As for your misunderstanding about PureMixer code, we have prepared for you and all readers a short FAQ on this topic:How is the mixing code arranged and how does it work ?- We mark transactions with a unique identifier. It is the marking of transactions that allows our system to recognize and distinguish your funds from all other funds in the pool, which prevents the receipt of previously deposited coins when using PureMixer again. Each incoming transaction into the PureMixer pool, accordingly, is already tied to a PureMixer code. And it will remain marked on the address in our pool (to which your deposit eventually arrived) until a certain point.(up to what specific moment , see below) *Could the mixing code undermine your privacy?Important! PureMixer code is assigned only to transactions! neither to your IP addresses*, nor to your dates*, nor to your wallet from which you deposited into the mixer*, nor to your wallet for receiving funds from the mixer*. Consequently, there is NO direct linkage of PureMixer code to the service user himself and his personal data.****Reminder: PureMixer does not maintain and does not collect any logs and information that can somehow be associated with the user. All information is immediately erased from the servers upon completion of the service. The service fully adheres to the no logs principle.Will your PureMixer code be saved in the database ?-Not for long.* The address in the pool that has accepted your funds will sooner or later use them up on other customers of the service who have come afterwards. Your code will not be passed on to customers who will receive your funds in the future, as it is unique. The code will simply be exhausted. Consequently, in the base and from the data regarding PureMixer code, which were INDIRECTLY connected with you, in the end - there will be nothing left.",

Tor version doesn't make request to google server anymore.Isn't it contradiction when .onion version of your website make request from fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com? I don't know much about it's privacy implication, but i believe it's enough to make privacy conscious person to seek different mixing service.",

Thus data is shared with google. There are ways to prevent this. But first PureMixerio should have its say. Otherwise he would get the answers on a silver platte.",

Everyone learns step by step and I can not imagine that privacy conscious people set everything correctly before using a browser for the first time.
