  "content": "Hi,I opened this topic to present: TOP69 Crypto Casinos - a site which reviews and lists crypto casinos in a more honest way, focusing on what players may actually need to find out.How does this site differ from others that review and list crypto casinos?1. The site does not prioritize earning money/commissions by providing misleading information or pushing players to whatever brand pays more. The reviews and ratings are not influenced by commission levels.There's a transparent rating system in place which we use to rate and rank crypto casinos.2. The reviews focus on facts, not on stories meant to influence players. As players, we don't like 20 pages long reviews, with each sentence trying to highlight how amazing the casino is. We know this type of content is better for convincing people to register and also for SEO purposes, but we don't want to display something like this. Also, we don’t believe that reviews with one personal experience are too relevant. If a player had a good/bad experience with a brand, it doesn’t mean that all the other players will go through the same journey with the same brand.Our ratings are influenced by features and functionalities we believe benefit players the most. Higher-ranked brands typically offer a variety of cryptocurrencies, many games, and diverse features. In contrast, lower-ranked brands might be more basic. However, we emphasize the importance of personal preferences and encourage visitors to make their choices based on their own needs and desires, which might be totally different than ours.3. The site is built to be easy to browse and helpful to players in finding what they are looking for. -   We don’t have banners, we don’t have tons of marketing materials or CTAs pushing players to “REGISTER NOW and GRAB THIS AMAZING BONUS!!!”, we don’t list 1000 brands on the homepage – hoping that someone will register and bring a commission no matter what.-   We don’t ask brands to provide us with any information. We check by ourselves.-   We have brands listed in various categories based on what they offer: cryptocurrencies (e.g. bitcoin casinos, shiba inu casinos, xmr casino, ltc casino, cardano casinos ), chat, provably fair games, NFT, tokens, lightning bitcoin casino, rakeback, cashback, crypto wheel, metamask casinos, chat, coin drops, rain drops, tips, shop, walletconnect casinos, bonus battles, no kyc crypto casino, game providers etc. -   There are reviews for tens of crypto casinos, including satoshi hero, 500 casino, coins.game, betplay.io and many more. Overall, we want this site to be an useful place where players can come, quickly read, double check on their own, then think by themselves before taking a decision. If this also brings us a commission to buy a pizza, then even better.  Discover interesting crypto casinos with the help of TOP69CryptoCasinos.com!We also post on Telegram when new brands are reviewed or when there are new interesting crypto promotions. We even consider to create some special promotions once we reach a bigger number of subscribers  -> https://t.me/top69cryptocasinosDon't forget to check out our  exclusive crypto casino bonuses. You can also find them at the top, inside the \"Offers\" story - for a quick access.",

Maybe we're wrong, but right now we don't believe these will be very useful for most of the players.We want to keep reviews focused on the specifications/features of crypto casinos + expand the content in the near future.However, we were thinking to allow players submit their comments and personal experiences for the listed crypto casinos, but there's a problem: we need to find a way to avoid fake comments. It's a well known fact that many operators are pushing their employees and motivating their players (offering bonuses) to leave positive comments on specific affiliate sites.",

Much appreciated!No brand has to pay in order to be listed & have a review. We aim to list as many crypto casinos as possible, but we are also enhancing our screening process to exclude brands known for scamming players or affiliates. Moreover, should we come across or receive significant evidence of any brand's fraudulent activities, they will be promptly removed from our site.We already removed 3 brands before even launching the site.  -------------------------Even if the site grows in terms of traffic, we won't be filling it with tons of banners, annoying marketing materials or change our CTAs from \"VISIT SITE\" to \"GRAB THE BONUS RIGHT NOW!!!\".  Since brands will not be able to purchase higher rankings, any potential paid exposure on our site will be limited and clearly marked with a \"PAID ADVERTISEMENT\" badge.But there's a long road till then...-------------------------We will think about improving the homepage. What kind of information would you like to see?We will be correcting the numbering of the ratings shortly. While the brands are ranked correctly, the numbering representation isn't ideal. Currently, the highest rating is 4.9/5 and the lowest is 4.2/5. Thank you for the keen observation!We will also offer insights into our rating system to ensure complete transparency.coins.game is among the highest ranked brands because we believe it has a pretty consistent package of features & functionalities.Flowery reviews? What makes you say this?Reviews are pretty \"technical\". Do you refer to the pros and cons?",

      "body": "well, in my opinion, review sites should talk about the experience they had using the casino for at least 3 months, talk about when they contacted casino support, how long it took for them to respond and if they had any problems, how long it took for them to be resolved, but this must be told from personal experience, because what has happened in my opinion is that review sites don't play in the casinos that are added to the review site, they make money from referral commissions. and as they don't keep betting at the casino they don't know to what extent the casino is operating well or notand when someone appears with a complaint, the review site will not believe that person and even when they contact the casino and do not receive a response, they still think that the casino is acting well and that the customer who is complaining must be in the wrong. . I have not yet seen any review site post on a review site that casino X did not pay you and that is why it is classified as a scam casino. I was wondering why I don't see this happening, at first I thought that probably the review sites are paid by the casinos and for that reason they will always say good things about the casino, it makes perfect sense. but I doubt that this payment will last forever, so at some point the casino stops paying the review siteTherefore, there has to be some point when the review site starts posting true information and the review site must post some proof that they use the casino and that it is actually ok to use the casino. but as I said before, it seems to me that review sites don't play at the casinos they review",

Good luck!Wow, replies are starting to show up. It's great!Lanatsa & Broadanbig, maybe I wasn't very clear in my first post, so I'll try to explain better.What I wanted to say is that our primary objective isn't to maximize earnings or commissions by misleading players. We want to provide accurate information, without favouring brands simply based on higher payouts. It's very important to make this project grow by using fair methods, no matter how much work and time it will take. 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, no hurry. - Ratings will be 100% transparent. The rating system will be public very soon.- Rankings (placements: no.1 brand, no.2 brand, no.3 brand, no. 100 brand etc) will be determined exclusively by our transparent rating system, which evaluates brands based on their features and functionalities. For example: if we say that a crypto casino accepts 30 cryptocurrencies and we rank it higher (in the payments area) than a crypto casino which accepts only 5 cryptocurrencies, the visitor will be able to clearly check this and calculate the rating by himself. That's why we don't want to include our \"personal experience\", but focus 100% only on facts that everybody can easily check. It's not ideal to focus only on functionalities, I know, but it's the only way to make it work. The alternative was to rank crypto casinos based on daily visits/monthly visits (using third-party services like similarweb). However, we felt that such kind of ranking won't bring any benefit for the visitors, as the big brands will always rank higher - due to their huge popularity and high amount of traffic. Who cares which brand receives more traffic? We may as well remove the rating and sort brands alphabetically. - No brand will be able to pay/offer higher commission to rank higher, unlike on some other crypto casino review sites.- We are using affiliate links, however we do not rank crypto casinos based on the commission levels or referral fees. We rank them based on the rating system - which, again, will be published very soon. - We initially wanted to not use affiliate links and we were exploring other means for visitors to support our work, such as Patreon, Buy Me A Coffee, Revolut, PayPal etc.  This option is still on the table, we are still thinking about it, it's not 100% clear if we will stick to affiliate links on long term, replace them or add other ways for players to support us. The website was just soft-launched and we don't expect it to deliver any results for a very long time. We'll take decisions in this area once we start seeing some real and significant traffic. For the moment, we add affiliate links/referral links where possible. Where it's not possible, we just add direct links. In fact, we have 20 more reviews nearly ready for publication. Out of these, 16 don't have affiliate links because the brands haven't approved our affiliate accounts in months, and it's unlikely they will.Therefore, I never said that there isn't any intention of monetizing the website. Whoever says that, in such situations, is clearly lying. What I wanted to say is that the focus will be in delivering useful information, without the obsessive need of pushing in front brands which may deliver higher commission levels.I probably repeated the same thing 10 times. Sorry for that - but hopefully it's clear now.I'll be back with the rating system when published, so we can get over it.Till then, if you have more feedback in regards to: what information you would need to find out about crypto casino, what's missing, if the website loads fast enough, if there's any error etc - I'll highly appreciate. Thanks again!  PS: great community you have here! fantastic!",

Unfortunately, no. It would have made our job way easier.It took us 2-3 months to check around 70 brands, open accounts, visit each section and gather the information manually - with no help from customer support or affiliate managers.We tried in some cases to contact the customer support, but they never helped. For example, there were 3 brands which were not listing the game providers. There weren't any game provider filters, no logos, no info at all. We have contacted the CS and they simply weren't able to help, they either didn't have this information or they provided some excuse to not help.We had to go into the all games section and manually check the game provider from each and every game in order to make a list.4. Hmm, we don't have such a filter. The existing date filter is for sorting brands based on the date when they were added on the site. However - it's a good idea to also sort them based on the date of launch. We'll include this as well. Thanks!",

Add more information on the review casinos, and remove your personal interest like not monetized and others.Thanks, Mate2237!The reviews will definitely include more details, but not useless information that could make them too long.Monetization will never be excluded. It will always exist in some way, either by using some affiliate links (no matter how bad the commissions are) or some other methods. Would you take a job, start a project or a business if there was absolutely no chance of getting some sort of financial benefit, either now or in the future? Don't think so.If by in-depth reviews you mean something like this: https://cryptonews.com/news/bc-game-review.htmIt will never happen.We focus on quick wins, fast info & facts that people need to easily check in less than 1 minute. If you want to find out crypto casinos that accept Monero, our goal is to give you the longest list of crypto casinos accepting Monero (updated and real), in the easiest and fastest possible way. We believe there's an audience for this type of content as well. Much lower, but there is. As for good and bad casinos, I have one suggestion: don't use casinos based on what other people tell you on the internet, no matter how trustworthy they seem. Gambling is risky, especially gambling on crypto casinos licensed in Curacao (which basically means nothing) or unlicensed. Literally all casinos can easily decide to block an account, stop paying, without delivering any reason. Players can't do anything. It's that simple. Google any \"Brand name + scam\" or \"Brand name + stopped paying me\" and tell me what you find.  If you want to be safe, play only on locally licensed casinos. If you encounter a problem, you can go to the authority issuing licenses, you make a complaint + deliver proofs, and in 99.9% of the cases there will be some sort of repercussions for the casino. Want to be even safer? Then it's a good idea to stop gambling.",

      "body": "Hey guys,We have this section: NO KYC Crypto CasinosAs we'll continue adding new brands, the section will grow for sure. How does it work: We check FAQ, Terms & Conditions, pages with Rules or look for AML & KYC policies and Verification sections from the reviewed crypto casinos.If we find Verification sections (where players have to input personal details or upload documents) + clear mentions that KYC is totally required at some point, we do not label a crypto casino as \"NO KYC\". We have noticed many casino review sites wrongfully labeling crypto casinos as \"NO KYC\" to mislead players and convince them to register.   So far, we labeled only 7 crypto casinos as \"NO KYC\" and we want to do it as best as possible. That's why I ask for your opinion to make it as useful as possible.Right now, we label \"No KYC\" based on the following criteria:1. No verification section + No mentions of KYC procedures + A clear and visible statement from the crypto casino that verification/identity check is not required. This is the ideal case where players should not expect verification to happen: we found 5 crypto casinos in this scenario.2. No verification section + No License info +  A statement that verification/identity check is not required under normal circumstances (but the crypto casino may request it if necessary). This is not the ideal case, there is still the possibility that the crypto casino may request KYC. However, since there's no verification section + no license info, we tend to believe that the chances of this happening are very low. We found 2 crypto casinos in this scenario.My question is: should we continue labelling crypto casinos from scenario no.2 as  \"NO KYC\" even if there's a small chance that KYC may be requested? Or should we label as \"NO KYC\" only brands from the 1st scenario which clearly state that they don't require identification?What would be more useful for you? Thanks! LATED EDIT: we have included 2 separated lists on that page. The 1st list includes brands which clearly state that they don't require verification.The 2nd list includes brands with low chances of requesting KYC. This will make things more clear, especially when checking each individual review. Hope it helps.",

      "body": "Of lately I have come across several casino review sites here and it just looks like there is a competition going on amongst the casino review sites as they are all justling for who has the best features  to be called a review site. Anyways it is all business as usual and the best takes it all.OP you have a good website design and the numerous list of reviewed casinos are quite alright but I did not see any review links to check on them to see what other people are saying about them. If you can be able to do that it would be nice because having knowledge of what others experience about the casinos would be of great help mate. I think you should look into it.",

      "body": "Hmm, no bad comment on this one, this is probably one of the best rating websites I've seen, very recommendable for others, I like how BC game and RollBit are on the list, all these casinos are top-notch, no complaints, and hands down.The design of your website is very slick, good looking on mobile view too, and you don't need to add anything more, as I can see a comment asking to drop your user experience, I think that's not needed because it could complicate things, there is also no need to open door fot users to drop reviews, I think that will just get in the way of why this website existed. The only thing that's missing is KYC requirement of each casinos, I think that should be available, because let's pretend if I am a newbie looking for a new casino, I won't know if they will ask for KYC verification straight up, I will have to find that out myself, it will be helpful if that's available on your website. Cheers.",
