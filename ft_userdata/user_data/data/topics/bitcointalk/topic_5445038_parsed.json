It is mindblowing to read a gov paper mentioning btt.QuoteAs explained further below, NGUYEN used the moniker “ChipMixer” on thepopular bitcoin message board BitcoinTalk (available at bitcointalk.org). On May 18, 2017QuoteOn June 15, 2017, NGUYEN responded to a BitcoinTalk post criticizingmoney laundering laws and know-your-customer requirements, stating,If your money is in a bank, it’s like bitcoin on exchange - you don’t have privatekeys. It can be frozen, it can be traced, it can be watched very carefully.If you have cash, you can do whatever you want. Nobody can invalidate it.Nobody can track it. Except police that can take it from you.Bitcoins are better. Nobody knows you have it (unless you use KYC exchange),you can exchange it for cash wherever you want. He must have hit a nerve with that post. Gov people lost their shit it seems.  How dare you promote bitcoin as an alternative to the USD? and you say it is even better?I guess they log everything we say in this forum. Shiet. To answer your question... I think it is a decision for the admins. If they think advertising mixers would be dangerous for the forum people, then they should ban it. I don't think there is such danger, yet.",

Furthermore, our service providers could also be subject to similar orders without our knowledge. Note that we consider PMs to require a warrant in order to be released.At our sole discretion, we may voluntarily assist law enforcement worldwide. Generally we do this only when we perceive that the target user has probably committed a serious and non-victimless crime.At our sole discretion, we may (noncommercially) share or extend retention on any of a specific user's userdata even without law-enforcement involvement. This is very rare.While we don't intentionally set up systems to do so, data may end up laying around for longer than the above-specified retention limits accidentally. For example, a sysadmin might copy the access logs in order to analyze an ongoing DDoS attack and then forget to delete them for a while.Computer security can never be guaranteed.From the above statement, I think we all know that bitcointalk complies with applicable laws in US jurisdictions. If the US government asks bitcointalk to ban that type of advertising then I think there is a possibility for the admin to approve it.",

Every product or service can be abused. It is not wise to just stop mixers advertisement because other users in countries outside of the US are not affected by this findings or investigation. The forum is an international platform that is not governed by the laws of any country that is why it might not stop the advertisement of mixers. Mixers are not generally bad but the wrong application of this service is what is giving this service a bad name.",

Mixers are just some way to ensure those who wish to tighten privacy by removing the links to track bitcoin transactions are no more. It has got nothing to do with scam other than render a service to all categories. How you choose to use it is up to you and no fault of there's.When it comes to money laundering, the idea of cryptocurrency have been accused to have been about money laundering and fraudulent transactions.
