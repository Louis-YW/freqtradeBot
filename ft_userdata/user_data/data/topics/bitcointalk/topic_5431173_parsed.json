This is bear market and FTX Drama was really big and that was total Disaster and I cannot believe that Billions of Dollars have been gone and they only gone to the main players of the game and they made such huge and better fortune from the Blood of People. FTX made people fool for many years and that's why for some time I was also believing on FTX. I can See that Money is always king and Now SBF has been bailed Out for 250 Million Dollars and that's biggest Bail fee we have ever seen in the world.",

These days they see the energy FUD and call bitcoin \"wasteful\", some years ago (pre 2013) they saw all the Silk Road drama and called bitcoin \"drug dealer money\", and a lot more.Seeing how centralized and scamy altcoins are or how risky centralized exchanges are and how they scam people is not new either. The media is also on the side of FUD which makes it very hard to counter it.",

Before now i was part of this set of people that thought so, and never actually wanted to understand btc and crpto currency more,If anyone is going to condemn a project to be a scam without actually understanding how it works and the network behind it, then they are better off not investing in it at all. Those same people would be the weak hands that would fomo in when the market is bulling and cut their losses when it turns bearish; complaining about how Bitcoin is dead and was a sham from the beginning.FTX is just one of many cases of frauds and scams around the crypto space, which is not directly related to Bitcoin or its operations.Knowledge is powerful in the investment and financial world. Arm yourself with it before considering any potential venture.",

Calling Bitcoin is decentralized currency and can't be controlled by anyone but you're hold your coins on centralized exchange are kills the purpose of decentralization!Which mean you're need to avoid any centralized exchanges too, those exchanges are evil to kill Bitcoin. Just use Bisq to trade and hold it on your hardware wallet.",

      "body": "Well like there is a saying that says \" nothing is hidden beneath the sun\" I know one day the truth behind the ftx saga will be revealed and the whole wide world would be updated with what really transpired to the crash of the ftx exchange. Many investors funds were all gone just within the snap of time. When I first heard of the ftx hack, I strongly believed this was as a result of carelessness and recklessness and not really a hack. Here we are now hearing according to OP  that the ftx hack was not really a hack but a fabricated story to cover up what really happened to investors funds. I would not be surprised court would grant him bail and he extradited to the US and there he would be granted bail. At the entire end, he will be free.This ftx saga caused the Crypto and bitcoin market really bad. We pray no further actions as a result of this causes another issue again in the near future because it is long overdue.",

It isn't news that FTX was lending money to another company, it is part of their service, the fault there was misappropriation of customers fund because they abuse their power by giving loan to Alameda, a known sister company owned by SBF half of the customer's fund.",

How did I know better, it was surely not from whining, complaining and wallowing in regrets, but because I was motivated to find out more from when I was scammed. This should be the attitude that people should adopt.
