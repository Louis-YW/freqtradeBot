There's no age and gender boundaries in investing literally in bitcoin but that's just to make something to talk about, that's interesting take made by their research.",

Even if this data is not accurate, its good to know that many women are into crypto already and work for their own money. We are in an equal society now where women are no longer just an ordinary women, we should be more happy about this. Anyway, long term trading can still affect them when it comes to making profit, let’s see if they can sustain at this level of risk.",

Of course we would really be having that kind of gender inequality issue or talks but lets not just make things to be an issue.Doesnt matter if they are better because there's no gender criticism on here.Its good if girls turns out to be that better but in overallwe are all aiming on the same target no matter what your gender is.",

After all, women can also be more patient in waiting for market conditions to change for the better, while men are often impatient. Perhaps, there are other reasons why women outperform men in trades that we don't know. Or it could be that women are more thorough in learning the trade than men so they can make more profits than men.

That only men are crypto traders. I know that it might not be intented so but wording is weird.I seriously wonder why people think that this is \"manliest\" game of all. I know several women that are investing and trading that are actually doing better than me And like the data shows there are ton of women players in this gameThis might have started as a male game but it's totally not that anymore. And unless you think they are kids you can call them women vs men.Also it would be nice to have data about actual research about this rather then news of hear say from the net",

We are meant to be different and complement each other. That's a beautiful thing.In short, women are more people-focussed and have better developed the \"emotional\" side, while men are more focussed on things and tend to be more technical + have higher risk tolerance (which does not always pay off).How do reconcile the fact that when Bitcoin started, every poll showed over 90% of adopters were men?
