Maybe it will be helpful for all the players to be aware on existing promotion by adding the promo banner on the homepage of the casino. I will not be aware about tjis promo existence without starting this discussion thread for bjfun esports. Count me in on the lottery.I bet -1.5 for Fnatic even though I don't have any idea about the team stats for CS:GO.",

I just hope that everything is well. I'm hoping to see Dota2 on the next promo.",
