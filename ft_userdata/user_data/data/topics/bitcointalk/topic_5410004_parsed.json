  "content": "I use to look out and trust these little padlock icon on my browser every time I visit a website for the first time, and think it meant I was safe from scam sites until I recently got to find out that though the icon shows you that ''Your connection is secure'', and is usually a first indication that a website is legitimate, it is not an assurance that the website you are visiting and about to put your personal details is not for fraudulent purpose and owned by scammers. I learned that a browser shows that your connection is secured to a website you visit when the owners of that website have been able to install a certificate that causes data to be encrypted end to end, which means scammers who are technically sound and financially capable can go an extra mile to want to deceive people who are like my former self.To simply find out if a website is fraudulent when scrutinizing it and everything is looking pretty, You can check for the domain Age using (https://whois.domaintools.com/) and verify it with the age the site owners claim the website has been up and running for, which they usually attach to somewhere on the homepage. Another method is to check if the website you are about to access can be trusted by validating it on Google Safe Browsing Transparency Report . sourceI hope this is helpful to someone.",

If not, i start looking at review sites, but focus on the negative reviews since positive ones are very easy to buy (eventough sometimes a competitor buys negative reviews aswell).But yeah, ssl means nothing... Site age *can* be an indicator, but everybody has to start somewhere, so new sites could just aswell be *good*, just like scam sites can be around for many many years (so old sites can be *bad* aswell).Hidden WHOIS info is sometimes (but not always) an indicator of a *bad* site.If something seems to good to be true, it's usually also an indicator of a *bad* site.All in all, it's very hard to distinguish an honest vendor from a scammer, there's no 100% certain way of filtering out the bad apples.",
