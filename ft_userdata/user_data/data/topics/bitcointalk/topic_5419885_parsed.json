  "content": "QuoteA majority of Americans support the idea of new stimulus checks to combat inflation, according to a poll conducted exclusively for Newsweek.The survey found 63 percent of respondents said they agree—with 42 percent saying they \"strongly agree\"—when asked if the federal government should issue new stimulus checks to tackle inflation.Eighteen percent of respondents disagreed, while 15 percent said they neither agree nor disagree. Three percent said they do not know in response to the question.The poll, conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies between October 23 and 24, surveyed 1,500 eligible voters in the U.S.Inflation and economic concerns have been key issues for Americans as they begin voting in midterm elections, where Democrats' control of Congress is at stake.Inflation reached a higher than expected rate of 8.2 percent in September, and Republicans have heaped blame on President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats for the skyrocketing prices that American households across the country are grappling with.Democrats got a boost earlier this week as the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate from July through September, giving the Federal Reserve room to continue aggressively raising borrowing costs to combat inflation.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in August that the Fed's hikes will bring \"pain\" to households and businesses, but said \"a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\"And while some states have been sending out direct payments to help struggling Americans, economists have argued that stimulus checks could make inflation worse rather than better.\"In this economic environment, stimulus checks cause inflation, they do not reduce it,\" Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a scholar at The Heritage Foundation and former chief economist for the Department of Labor, told Newsweek.\"This is because America has 10 million job openings that need to be filled. This drives up the cost of labor as employers compete for workers. It makes goods more expensive because firms are producing less than they prefer. It makes services more expensive because service-providing organizations, such as restaurants, hotels and airline companies cannot provide all the services that consumers demand.\"Furchtgott-Roth said prior stimulus payments had \"encouraged people to stay home and reduced their incentive to take a job.\"\"The labor force participation rate is about one percentage point below its pre-pandemic level because more people are staying home,\" she said.\"America already has 3 to 4 million people fewer working than would be the case if it had the same labor force participation rate as in January 2020. The last thing that America needs as Chairman Powell tries to fight inflation is more stimulus payments.\"https://www.newsweek.com/majority-americans-back-stimulus-checks-inflation-poll-1755636....It has been longer than 24 hours since I proposed crypto having the potential to solve everything ranging from inflation to indigestion. I'm long overdue for crypto being used to fill gaps in income which are traditionally filled by stimulus checks. How might it work. We already have crypto alternatives to UBI which could be applied to stimulus programs. Concepts of free money and free value being so extremely popular in this day and age. Isn't it surprising that we lack a greater abundance of proposals for solving issues like wage deterioration and inflation? If Elon Musk can build electric cars and buy twitter, certainly someone out there must have a good idea of how to address reduction of consumer buying power in relation to rising inflation.Simulus checks (Milton Friedman called them helicopter drops) are near to 100 year old technology. If most people wouldn't drive a car that was built 100 years ago. Knowing that modern society offers better options. Perhaps its realistic to say that we should also have good modern options for handling things like inflation. The lack of invention and innovation in these areas could mean we're long overdue for a big leap forward. There is a high potential for innovation in the field, which could translate to material and monetary gains for the person who invents it.Do the majority of people support additional stimulus checks btw. I always have to ask. Its difficult to tell where public opinion stands.",

      "body": "Well if the poll asks people if they want free money, should we really be surprised at the results?Milton Freidman would also say that stimulus money spending would have favorable effects until people realized they've been fooled. I thought with USD inflation being 8.3% we're at the stage of acceptance that Americans had been robbed of their purchasing power, but seemingly they want to double down. The COVID spending caused the inflation crisis and it isn't unique to USD that it's happening either -- nearly every currency that saw mass amounts of COVID related printing is experience high inflation. And people expect the economic impacts of inflation to resolve itself by even more spending, unbelievable.Once you introduce people to the drug that is social welfare without any strings attached (UBI, essentially), they don't want to let off. It's why money printing's dangerous. It takes no effort for a politician to promise free stimulus if the ramifications of said stimulus will impact people years after they left office through inflation. They don't have to deal with the political blowback, just reap the rewards of giving people free money.",

How might it work. We already have crypto alternatives to UBI which could be applied to stimulus programs. Concepts of free money and free value being so extremely popular in this day and age. Yeah, let's print some cryptos because well, being cryptos they don't act as Fiat when they are in oversupply.Terra has defiantly proved that rptiing 6 trillion (?) I don't remember the number but I know they multiplied the coins in circulation by more than 10x in a day won't affect the value at all.You don't fight inflation by printing any kind of money, you fight inflation by directing your attacks at one or even both of the triggers, demand, and supply, you have two choices, you increase the supply of goods by investing in manufacturing, cutting taxes, subsidizing production (not the product) or you deal with the demand trying to make people unwilling to spend all their money.For the thousand time, everyone should look at how Japan was unable to reach desired inflation rates because the people didn't want to spend.Quote from: Gyfts on November 08, 2022, 01:24:23 AMWell if the poll asks people if they want free money, should we really be surprised at the results?Let's make a poll about a fork of Bitcoin in which everyone in the world gets a few satoshi for free.You're not going to like the result if we let only newbies vote for it!",

The economy experts have realized that all the things they have been teaching so far have been wrong. The economy as a whole is flawed by design and unless it is fundamentally changed, we can't see any changes in inflation. In other words they have to print more money because that is how the economy is designed to work.This is why the solution is not bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency because they too will enter into the same flawed economic environment and won't be able to change. This is why bitcoin is sometimes referred to as the \"exit\" not something you put into that flawed system.QuoteDo the majority of people support additional stimulus checks btw. I always have to ask. Its difficult to tell where public opinion stands.They do and that's the bigger problem. Majority of people aren't educated enough to understand that the \"free\" money they are receiving is not free at all. In fact it is coming out of their own pockets. Not to mention that the government propaganda will not let them know that either hence the name \"stimulus\" instead of \"inflation guaranteed\" checks.A better question I'm interested in is how many of them are going to invest their checks in bitcoin this time.

Never thought that!  If you were asking me out of the blue I could have sworn that there is no day in which you find a problem and you find the solution with crypto  Every problem can be solved with one token, the OP has supported this idea for a long time, even though those who think for themselves know that all these tokens and stablecoins (which in fact are not) are the biggest source of extremely negative consequences in the world of cryptocurrencies. For those short-witted, we only need to mention that South Korean scammer and fugitive who directly caused at least 30% of the BTC price drop or the current situation with another token in the direction of another fanatic Mr. Bankman.As for stimulus checks, I would say \"give them one every month\", but everything that happens in the US unfortunately has consequences for most of the world. I thought that the story was over since there is no free lunch, but people seem to be only concerned about the moment they live in, and the fact that they will pay for that lunch very expensively in the future doesn't seem to worry them too much.",

Don't expect too much from them.Completely agreed. Medical care in the United States is among the biggest scams on this planet. I will just give one example. A vial of insulin costs around $1.50 here in India. The same thing costs around $100 per vial in the United States. The cost of manufacturing is just around $1 per vial. So why this big difference is there? Getting a profit margin of 20% or 30% is still OK. But here, the profit margin is 10,000%. I don't want to divert the topic, but this has been going on for many decades and it is surprising that ordinary Americans are perfectly fine with it.",
