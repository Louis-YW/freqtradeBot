  "content": "Never buy your hardware wallet from any third party, even if the third-party sellers say that they are buying straight from an official source it's still not safe.There is this favorite YouTuber of mine called CryptoJay, who has always tried to warn his viewers about buying their hardware wallet from a third party, I am pretty shocked that this guy went ahead to buy his Nano X from Amazon because he has purchased a lot of stuff from the website before. Somehow these people knew or maybe receive an alert when this YouTuber starts to move his Bitcoin from his other wallets into this Nano X, all his Bitcoin and even ETH were wiped off.https://youtu.be/iebFLfKC2AoI can't even remember how many times I've watched his videos warning people about crypto wallet safety because he is one of my favorite YouTubers, seeing him lose all the Bitcoin that he has been accumulating for years got my mood ruined.I still can't figure out what makes him does something he have been warning others about, I mean, what could have cost him from buying from nano official website? I hope someone sees this video, could safe some one from repeating this same mistake, hackers and scammers can buy many hardware wallets and put something on them, and then sell them through Amazon or eBay.",

      "body": "No wonder, he would have alerted others but being a human he made the same mistake by himself. I am just stunned too after getting this idea that hardware wallets are also not safe if we buy them from third parties. I never watched this person's videos but it do not go well for him. Like, maybe he fall prey to those scamming cost-effective ads of a ledger hardware wallet and think of buying them at a lower cost but instead, the side had been turned upside down for him. I don't think so, now he can get them (money) back. He made a pretty big mistake by not getting advice from experienced ones he said there was a link to the website on the ledger's screen which he first thought odd but move on. after I watched his video why i am not convinced that he is telling the truth like he said my friends told me to not use this device from a third party but even then I bought, then this website link he sees on the screen even then he moved on and moving all of his money on that wallet instead he could just test it out like by sending little money to that wallet but no he transferred all of it. Plus I doubt him because he showed no proof of transaction on amazon buying that ledger.",

And they are;1. Buying from a third-party site: Because thou Amazon is seen as a notable site to buy tech & other related stuff, since he had been once told that buying a cold wallet from a third party is risky and yet went ahead to buy it, he is to be blamed.2. Not confirming the URL after having doubts the site was likely to be a scam. https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-x3. Putting his wallet password on the alleged scam site even after having doubts it's likely to be a scam.",

There are several reasons about why someone that knows the risks of buying a hardware wallet from a third party still does so anyway, the first is arrogance, it is often said that doctors are the worst possible patients, and this is because they know about the different diseases and the human body and often question the diagnostic and the treatment given by their peers and they do not follow it, so despite knowing the risk he was incurring he thought he was above it because he knew it so well, and the second reason could be greed, it is possible the hardware wallets were being sold for cheaper than on the official website and he thought he could save a few dollars by making his purchase at Amazon.",

Box.  Use a disposable E-mail address.  Now you are good to order from the official website.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "It is very risky to buy a hardware wallet through a third party or your favorite online store because after all, we never know whether the hardware was compromised or not, but if something like this happens, you have to blame yourself, why buy from another party? whereas the official one is much more secure from any threat and this happens often i see some other news about this case because they buy hardware wallet from third party.If, for example, from the third party it is cheaper in terms of shipping costs or a few dollars difference from the original, it is better to suggest an official one because it will be safe and the assets stored there are quite controlled in the sense of buying from the company directly without other parties. I always suggest to friends to buy hardware from official Ledger/Trezor and don't be tempted by other offers.",

When opening the hardware wallet, it is crucial to check for a pre-generated seed. Additionally, Ledger Live can verify whether the hardware device is genuine or fake. To avoid any issues, it is essential to rely solely on official sources. Personally, I purchased my hardware wallet from the Amazon Ledger official store, and everything went smoothly. The device was successfully verified with Ledger Live. Despite the fact that the device was new, I reset it before generating the seed. To protect yourself from hacking, follow these steps.",
