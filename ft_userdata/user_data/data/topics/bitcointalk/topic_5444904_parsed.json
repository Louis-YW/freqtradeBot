Here is his explanation and its probably true.Quote from: WebsiteAvid on February 22, 2023, 08:53:32 PMBasically I want to participate in new incentivised testnets and they tend to reject wallets that are pretty recent as they think you might be a bot.Which is why I'm looking for old wallets preferably with activityHope that clears things up  Quote from: ANSEL_2.0 on March 14, 2023, 06:24:09 PMAnd the fact is I try confusing one of them that the wallet they bought doesn't entirely belong to them, because the sellers still have access to the wallet since they know the recovery seed. True, that seems like a logical problem and he had an anseerr for that too.Quote from: WebsiteAvid on February 22, 2023, 09:36:48 PMThe testnets I want to do, you deposit crypto on their platform and the wallet is just used to sign messages and approve transactions so it's not a huge risk for me",

That could be the idea. They want you to feel you could outsmart them, and install a system that automatically sends out all deposits, then they put some amount in before activating it. You still have the keys and would want to withdraw the amount they sent to it by putting some in as gas few which you would lose out of.There would be a legitimate reason, but I consider the illegitimate ones only when I get unsolicited messages.",

And the fact is I try confusing one of them that the wallet they bought doesn't entirely belong to them, because the sellers still have access to the wallet since they know the recovery seed. Not just Ethereum though, but as far as I can remember there are also individuals looking for old bitcoin addresses, and yeah the same reasons to claim fork coins, in short to incentivised them. So if by chance you old address but doesn't feel like selling it, then don't, simply as that.",

Sharing seeds or private keys means the wallet is compromised. I won't sell or share my old wallet credentials. Because they might use it wrongly which we are unaware of. So avoid Telegram random DMs always you aren't familiar with something. You would have trouble as well later since we don't know whether they will use the old address for the crime or not.",
