So, you'll have to be careful with high profit services, the forum helps to identify a scammer by adding a warning box untop of the person's service thread stating that lots of users have pointed the user as a scammer, but that doesn't solve most of the problem, because people still go on working with such persons even after reading the warning. If you confirm someone is a scammer don't hesitate to drop a negative feedback on the person's account or open a thread on the reputation or scam accusation section reporting to the forum about the user with proves of chat and Bitcoin transaction hash. To avoid scam you need to work with users that have got quality reviews on their service thread. And always confirm by asking for a review copy of their services before paying; for a user with lesser reputation. Stay safe.",

As for dealing with older members, always check for their trust feedbacks, recent activity, etc. If they just woke up after a long period of inactivity and trying to suddenly make a deal with you, they are most likely going to scam you.Quote from: Belarge on February 13, 2023, 07:25:41 AMWhat should I do if I meet a scammer on Bitcointalk?As @Plaguedeath suggested, you may create a flag but you will need ppl to support your flag too. You must open a thread in the \"scam accusation\" board against the scammer.Quote from: Belarge on February 13, 2023, 07:25:41 AMWhat should I do so I won't fall a victim of scam?Just use your common sense",

There are some people with zero trust that can be trustworthy and later be given positive trust, or it can be otherwiseThere can be some people with many positive trusts but not trustworthy, example is yogg that let people trust him and gone bad, stealing people's bitcoin. Some people can build trust and later go bad.Someone's account can even be compromised, there was one case of this in 2021 or 2022, that an account was compromised and later used to scam. That is why signing bitcoin message or PGP key is very important.",

Also scammer will ask you to pay first, download something or send you a suspicious link via dm. To avoid being scammed then you should use the forum anonymously and never reply to anyone who contact you first. Use a trusted escrow when you are dealing with someone here if you have an item that wants to buy.",

Instead, make yourself big by extending your arms and standing on your tippy toes and then yell or growl at them as loud as you can.
