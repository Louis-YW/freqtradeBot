WIN Market is a platform that allows everyone to buy exclusive and official tokens, which can be redeemed for experiences and rewards.Have you ever imagined being able to invest in a football (soccer) player's transfer fee?With WIN, this is now a reality. WIN is a platform where you can acquire official digital assets that can be redeemed for experiences and rewards. Each token is backed by real-world contracts and is officially launched in collaboration with the best clubs and sports legends in the world.Transfer Tokens unlock liquidity in the Transfer Market. These financial assets represent small fractions of the transfer fees of the world's best stars. Token holders will not only receive income when a player is transferred, but they can also trade them on the Win Market. The funds raised from the sale of Transfer Tokens go to the Clubs, to foster and enhance their training and youth activities. At WIN, we leverage the advantages of blockchain technology, providing security, transparency, traceability, and efficiency in every step of our operations. Our model is structured around the FIFA Solidarity Mechanism , a crucial training right that allows clubs to benefit from up to 5% (0.25% per year between 12-15 and/or 0.50% per year between 16-23) of the value of transfers for players trained in their institution.In the competitive football (soccer) transfer market, WIN stands out as the only sustainable investment platform. The tokenization of real-world contracts allows us to fractionalize the future training rights that clubs hold over players.
