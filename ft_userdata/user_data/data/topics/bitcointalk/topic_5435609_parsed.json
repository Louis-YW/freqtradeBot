But maybe, with some luck, the support knows this.I'm sure the user probably has a good idea as well.  Was crypto recently deposited into Binance from a trade with a partner you may not know well?  Did you receive a wire transfer from someone else?  I would assume a person knows if their deposits came from their bank, legitimately earned coins, or if a 3rd party sent coins to their account for some reason.  My guess is that OP probably bought crypto or traded for it with someone who did something shady, or maybe they funneled their deposits through a coin mixer, leaving Binance feeling the need to send a warning to make sure the OP knows that how they're getting crypto is not the right way to do it and they won't be able to continue letting them trade using this method.",

      "body": "My first thought when I hear 'Binance email' is always phishing. It can get very elaborate, including mails sent from what can look like a corporate address, and it's hard to always be up-to-date on what's possible and what isn't with mail scam. So I don't know whether your anti-phishing thing is something reliable, to be honest.But I think this email is most likely legit, and not just a random reminder or the ToS out of the blue.My associations about the meaning are primarily with Russia. Are you Russian? Do you send money to anyone who is Russian or get money from Russians? Same questions with Iran. I don't mean you should answer them here. I mean, you should answer them for yourself. If you are unaware of dealing with sanctioned users or entities, then I'd follow the advice of NeuroticFish regarding contacting support.",

Prohibition of UseBy accessing and using binance services, you represent and warrant that you have not been included in any trade embargoes or economic sanctions list (such as the united nations security council sanctions list), the list of specially designated nationals maintained by ofac (the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury), or the denied persons or entity list of the u.s. department of commerce. Binance reserves the right to choose markets and jurisdictions to conduct business, and may restrict or refuse, in its discretion, the provision of binance services in certain countries or regions. Since you have seemingly received just a warning, and not a de facto sanction, it’s possible that they have linked one of your inbound/outbound TXs with someone that fall into the above vague categorization, but either through probabilistic heuristics, or a few step backs in the chain. I’m not sure if the message would be such as the one displayed if there was a complete certainty.As suggested, I’d reach out to their support to clarify the case, and see how they’ve reached their conclusion.",

      "body": "I've noticed lately that Binance seems to be acting as a crypto police. It seems CZ is very proud of Binance's achievements in coordinating with the authorities, tracking suspicious users, freezing funds, locking their accounts, and so on. As a matter of fact, in summing up plans for 2023, \"compliance\" has the number 2 spot, only lower than \"education,\" and above \"product & service\" and ignoring \"FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.\"[1] So this email is most probably in line with all of this. I'm a bit intrigued, however. By warning users to check the source of the funds and not to trade with sanctioned countries and sanctioned individuals, do they only mean directly? Or do they consider transactions and funds up to a certain level like when I'm dealing with a clean person who also dealt with a clean person beforehand but the last one had dealt with somebody who is sanctioned?
