  "content": "A phishing site for all kinds of walletsThe story in short I bought an LTE token and entered the telegram group for this token to ask some questions. Suddenly I got a private message from \"@listentoearn_officialsupport\" he told me that he was here to help me.I told him how? He said I'll give you the link, go in there and connect your wallet and activationAlthough I already knew it was scam but I told him ok to see what happensHe sent me this link: \"chainsyncfix.surge.sh\" The site describes itself (lies of course): Quote(Decentralized Platform Wallet)Our ServicesDapp Walletnode is a decentralized protocol. dConnect create an innovative open-source software ecosystem that is both secure and resilient. And it allows developers to create new online tools, many of which have piqued the interest of global business markets. Validation of wallet will be completed below as followsThe site has many types of services (all scams of course) such as VALIDATION, RECOVERY, Harvest and stakings for a large list of different wallet.           At first I pressed VALIDATION , a long list of different wallets appeared to meThen I chose the Metamask wallet and clicked on it.An error appeared as in the picture and asked me to manually connect                  I clicked on \"Connect Manually\" and a message appeared asking me to enter the recovery phrase           Of course, if anyone puts his phrase down, he will lose his wallet forever.There are many services on the site as you can see:          I tried clicking on the \"Stacking pool\" service and got the same result. The same message appeared before, asking me to enter the recovery phrase.After that, I went back to Telegram and told the person that it was a scam and that I exposed his fraud, so he deleted the conversation and blocked me immediately.I ask everyone to be careful not to write the SEED phrase or the private key on this site or any other site on the Internet for whatever reason.",

      "body": "Scammers are evolving as when you click on the link to the wallet all the tokens in your address are automatically withdrawn so it is always better to use an empty wallet when you want to link to an unknown wallets.The method you mentioned is old but seems to work for beginners.I'm starting to see more interest in fighting phishing sites, so maybe browsers have some artificial intelligence to track them or monitoring and tracking systems.",

All currency groups, exchanges or trusted wallets always put this warning, so I was sure that he is a scammer, but I just wanted to know the method he uses in fraud, so I decided to respond to his requests, and I verified that he is a scammer in the end, knowing the scammer's methods Very important to warn people of them.",

A simple psychological trick based primarily on beginners who have no experience.",

      "body": "There are so many red flags in this phishing site that is pretty obvious. Domain name is very unproper for a website like this, Their are a lot of unorganized buttons that makes it bad and Even simple things on design like capitalization of text is very shady. It seems that the owner of this phishing site doesn't put a lot of efforts in making it and trying to look it professionally. If a site ask you for a seed phrase, manual sign-in, private key or anything that will let them access your wallet internally is basically a typical sign of a scam. Remember that no professional website owner will message you first especially on common messaging apps that involves so many scammers like telegram, It's the first indication that it is a scam. I hope newbies doesn't fall for them or the lucrative offer they are proposing.",
