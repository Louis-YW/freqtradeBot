I want to make an inquiry on a thread I created in the gambling board title video assistant referee (V.A.R) advantages and disadvantages to football betting.. I can't find the thread anywhere on the forum again and what really baffle me is that I didn't receive any message about the thread been deleted on my email and on my messages so am just curious to know what is the problem, so I can take to correction and avoid committing same error next time if actually something was wrong with the thread. I haven't posted here before because this is a really technically aspect of forum so if this is the wrong place to ask, Â I will still be happy if am corrected",

Idk but I'm really seeing that topic as one that had been seen, read, and learnt overtime and doesn't need to be repeated since it's already becoming a common knowledge. So maybe it wasn't innovative? Or Maybe that was a mistake? Yeah sure, it happens....I just hope any of the MODS could explain this.We don't discuss technical things in Meta. Innovations, non-technical questions, discoveries, implementations...etc you would possibly bumb into any of these every time you come here.Sandra ðŸ§‘",

However, I haven't seen any technical questions about the forum posed here. Every topic brought here is mainly concerning the forum, such as problem fixes, challenges, thoughts on the forum's progress, proposals for adding or changing features, and so on. So your inquiry has been directed to the appropriate place.Quote from: Stalker22 on November 29, 2022, 10:58:10 PMYou cannot find your thread because it was deleted by moderators.Â  When a thread is deleted, it is removed from the forum without notifying contributors.When you say that the original contributor of a thread deleted by the moderators will not be notified, that sounds a little unclear to me. Is this limited to the original thread only? Because I recall 2-3 of my posts being deleted when I was still learning how to use the forum, even though they were replies to other posts and I was alerted about it. Could he have missed the message because it was an original thread rather than a reply to his? I'd like to understand more.",

Only deleted post will give you a notification through email or personal message here. In case the thread is deleted, All the post including the OP will not be notified about the deletion of all the post made there. This is probably what happened to the OP because it will be a pain in the ass for the mods to sent private message or notification to all the users who made post on that thread.All deleted post is reported by the mods thatâ€™s why they can manage to give notification to the author. I believe forum doesnâ€™t have a code for notification of deleted thread. I experience to have deleted thread as well as some post that posted on deleted thread which doesnâ€™t have notification. I can only verify that my post is deleted when I check on ninjastic.space",

The moderators that moderate the section would have move the thread to the appropriate section instead not deleting it. Because the thread explains what is happening to the football games including the world cup. And users are making reasonable comments on VAR. I was really confused why the thread was deleted. There are a lot of threads to be deleted in the Gambling Discussion section, mostly concerning the world cup. People are just creating unnecessary threads that can be a comment on the already existing threads. As it is said by the staff and others, the moderators in the section would have a good explanation on the deletion of the thread but if it was a mistake, then let the thread should be restored to the appropriate section.",

First of all your topic you're reporting a complaints about belongs to gambling discussion board, but if what you discussed onnthe thread does not tally with the topic you gave then it's likely that the moderators have moved the topic to another section it's best fit in or to off topic as the case maybe, try and check your last posts or topics created by you from your profile, check your email as well if it's tally with the one ised on the forum, but as far as you received not a personal message from the forum moderator then your topic wasn't deleted but just moved, it's now upto you to engage the search where it was moved to.",
