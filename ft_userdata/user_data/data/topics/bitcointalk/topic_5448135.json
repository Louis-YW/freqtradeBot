  "content": "I recently read, an article about WEB 2.5 a conceptual term used to make a gateway between WEB 2.0's products and services with WEB 3.0's decentralization. But the question that arises here is, Why is there a need for WEB 2.5? Because there was no mass adoption of decentralization, many projects were coming into the market based on WEB3 but most of them failed to get traffic. Why? the reason was difficult for me.Like, I thought, every new technology takes a lot of time to get mass adoption. For example, If we Observe BTC, then it took almost 14 years to get globular adoption but still I think it's not that mass. (maybe I would be wrong but that's the way of perception of every mindset). So maybe Web3 will also take time. I know many decentralized swaps and exchanges are in the market like Uniswap and Aave, which has great traffic and adoption but I am talking about other social media, games, and educational projects facing adoption. Like DeFi, which is one of the use cases of Web3. Why do i think that people did not care about decentralization?According to Worldometers, there are around 8 billion of the population throughout the world (not official) and out of which, 5.16 billion are using the Internet, and from that 5.16 billion, 4.76 billion of internet users are using Social media platform. (According to Statista)As we all know, Social media platforms are centralized ones, like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Tik Tok, etc. If we really want to remain anonymous by leveraging the features of Web3 then why are we using these centralized platforms? Maybe we are so dependent and addicted to these. Maybe due to mass adoption of it, because where there are more people there is more business and money too then why making effort to shift to another (easily)? The same scenario goes for crypto as well. Like, in crypto there is more trading volume on centralized exchanges while less on decentralized ones. Why? due to less adoption and knowledge may be due to less trust also. What are your thoughts on it, like if we really want to remain anonymous and want to get more control of the internet by leveraging Web3 then why we are riding on the boat of Web2? Why are we still sticking to centralized platform?",

      "body": "People care about decentralization, but we also cannot deny the fact that we also need the centralized system that's for those who need social media. When you want to protect your private life, you will not want to use social media, but even if you don't make use of social media, it does not mean that your life is completely private. As long as you have social gatherings, family, and friends, your private life has moved above being private. When you want to talk about the crypto community, those who choose to be on the private side and live free out of the control of others choose the decentralized technology. Why they can also live a totally different life on social media. There are just a few social media platforms out there that are decentralized and totally anonymous. That's why we still make use of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms out there. On social media, they know what we want them to know about us. But on the blockchain, no one knows who is who or who owns whose wallet.In conclusion, we care about decentralization because it's all about freedom. Anyone who wants freedom cares about decentralization.",

Banks arose more than 100 years ago, and almost all of us, since we were born, traded in cash, not gold, and even most of us believe that money is only in banks, given that cash payments have declined significantly Thus, the concept of decentralization is new to humans.Humans are afraid of anything new, let alone responsibility in decentralization. For example: - You find that many people forget their bank account. - All responsibility in the bank is to prove your identity or signature, and the bank is responsible for securing your money from theft and all risks. - In Bitcoin you lose out if you lose access to the private key, most people don't want to take that responsibility.If we take all these reasons, we will understand people's fear of cryptocurrencies.I have not yet mentioned the influence of media, fake news, fraud, hacking, and others.",

      "body": "Firstly I would say before the evolution of this web 3 many didn’t believe we could actually do stuffs in decentralized way mainly because that is what the government made us to believe or the technology as at then shaped human mindset to. But that didn’t mean they weren’t people seeking anonymity because even on social medias there are accounts created by individuals with informations or KYCs that are either wrong or has nothing connected to them. In the case of why there was less adoption of decentralized systems like bitcoin but mass adoption towards the social media I would say it is government policies because they many that believe without government regulating anything it seems more like a scam and when anything goes wrong they could have someone or some body to hold accountable for and that is why we see many centralized platforms like exchanges today. Also bitcoin adoption will be slow compared to the other platforms because it involves money and that takes a longer time for just anybody to entrust there funds to a new platform.",

      "body": "Op to clarify Your analysis of the adoption of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 You also have to look at the age of entering the two media, as an answer to what you are questioning, because I think why are there still so many people using Web 2.0 because those who use the internet from small children to old people have used it so the comparison will be very far away, because on average those who adopt Web 3.0 are young people who are between 17-30 years old at this time and even then it is still rare because it is not as well-known as Web 2.0 which has been adopted all over the world world. It's not because they don't want decentralization and confidentiality of personal data but rather they just know what social media has to offer in their local environment.Talking about the economy why are there still many companies or business people still using web 2.0 social media for their services and advertising, because basically they only follow market movements or consumers in places where consumers socialize, if there are already many Web3 users I think the economic rotation will shift also to Web3.",

Meanwhile, the concept of decentralization has only received a lot of attention since the birth of bitcoin, and bitcoin has only been around for 14 years, and that is nothing compared to the existence of a centralized system that governments created. Another thing is, nowadays, people need money more than decentralization. If you don't have money, you have nothing to store, then decentralization is useless. Just like what is happening in the cryptocurrency market, which is considered decentralized, but what people care most about is profit and not seeking privacy or decentralization.",

Why are we still sticking to centralized platform?Damn, the spread of decentralized tech is moving at a snail's pace compared to the number of new Web3 projects popping up left and right. But, you gotta keep in mind that it takes a hot minute for folks to get on board with new stuff and change their habits. One reason for this is that centralized platforms are so dang easy to use and we're all used to them. Even with all the perks of decentralization, it's a real struggle to convince people to jump ship, especially if it's gonna take a lot of effort on their part.However, there's hope on the horizon. DeFi projects like Uniswap and Aave are blowing up and people are itching for decentralized solutions. As the tech gets better, it's looking like more and more people will hop on board. Plus, educating people about why decentralization is the bee's knees will be crucial to getting everyone on the same page. By teaching folks about the importance of data privacy and control, we can get more people to see why Web3 platforms are where it's at.There's some promising growth and change on the horizon, if you catch my drift. So, let's keep our chins up and spread the word about how freaking amazing decentralized tech is. We'll get there, man. We'll get to that sweet, sweet decentralized future we've been dreaming about.",

The problem is that the most used parts of internet services are centralized and have already gotten the masses to their platforms. The challenge is creating just-as-good platforms that are decentralized and the even greater challenge is attracting the masses to these services.Until there is a major problem with centralized apps/platforms/services that shines creates a need for people to transition to decentralized services, it will be hard to overcome these challenges. A large-scale cyber attack is an example of the kind of event that could force everyone to make the transition.",

That makes sense actually, while we use social media platforms then we're losing our anonymity on them.While we advocate about decentralization, we're still and will always be a customer of these centralized platforms and it's because it's just so hard to support a project that even if they say they're fully decentralized, the users won't be expanding that much for being new.Anyway, with all of these trends, it also make sense that they're just a hype thing that contributes to the market and then eventually we see newer ones in the next year forgetting the past.",

Why are we still sticking to centralized platform?You are right on your analysis, and that is actually the answer to your final questions. People don't want to get more control of the internet, people don't want to stay anonymous. People want to be entertained and to be in direct contact with their pairs. You know that, because you are aware about the high popularity of Tik Tok (which is ruled by China), online dating apps, social medias in general and every other applications which enforce viewers accepting cookies and personal data sharing. Anonymity isn't a demand from the public in general. They don't bother being seen and watched, since they are rewarded (financially or emotionally).",

Why are we still sticking to centralized platform?As you said, BTC is just 14 years old which means out of the 8 billion population only around 5 billion are using the Internet and internet is like in the market for decades, and still, 3 billion of the population do not use it, And how can we expect BTC or decentralization to be adopted in mass. I know good things take time and you would also have an idea of it too, but the world right now mostly Western countries is facing severe economic conditions and due to the election campaigns, many of the citizens discouraged the use of DeFi (so-called use-case of Web3 by you) by asking authorities to legalize the AML policy so more scams and fraud could not take place.That's also not a good decision for them to ban the overall market instead of catching the ones who are involved n criminal activities. Overall, people have to spend years on centralized platforms and business has risen their empires on these centralized platforms, how could they let people shift towards decentralization so easily? So things will get in to streamline adoption speed when the right time will comes until then buckle up for more restrictions from these so-called centralized authorities (SEC etc.)",

It also depends on the regulatory policies of the country because in the end the regulation has provided certain limitations.
