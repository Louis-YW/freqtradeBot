  "content": "We can discuss RAW vs RAI if you want silver claw jewelry, but I'm more interested in the narrative behind it. How \"metallic\" are the metallic dragons, really? I think in terms of lore it would be very cool if silver dragons in particularly had special efficacy against werewolves and devils and the like. Silver dragons feel very paladin-like to me, anyway.And what sorts of other unique, obscure traits might the other metallic dragons have, so long as we're making stuff up?",
