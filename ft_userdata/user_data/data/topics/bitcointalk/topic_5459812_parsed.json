Later he said they prefer sending payment in XMR, and provide them with my Monero address but he said I should open an account on excoinway.com for fast payment and open the account got a payment notification.I try to withdraw the coin but it's not going through and there's a pop message that I have to deposit 100 USDT before I can withdraw the coin that's where I know it was all a plan work from the beginning because no genuine crypto exchange will request the user to make a certain deposit before the user can withdraw their fund when the exchange can easily remove the request fund from the initial balance.",

If, indeed, the scammer who stole the $48,000 has a MEXC account, The OP must create an account on this exchange platform, pass the identity verification, and then provide the following proof and documents to MEXC online support or via email:Quote**Supporting documents that are sufficient to prove that the reported address/account is associated with your crypto assets, including but not limited to: screenshots of your digital wallet/account transfer history, transaction ID, transfer address, and a detailed text description of the case + Proof of police acceptance of the case within 48 hours of submitting the supporting documents.**After MEXC receives the above information, then will freeze the stolen assets and the scammer's account temporarily if the documents and proof provided by the OP are sufficient.[1] Stolen Asset Handling Process: https://www.mexc.com/support/articles/15440563148953[2] Reporting Theft/Fraud on MEXC: https://support.mexc.com/hc/en-001/articles/15480196102809-Reporting-Theft-Fraud-on-MEXC",
