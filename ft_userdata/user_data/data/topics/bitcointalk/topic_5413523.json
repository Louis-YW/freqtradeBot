  "content": "Hello.  I have a problem with my Mycelium wallet.  I have two accounts: BTC and ETH.  Everything is fine with the BTC account, I have full access, it has the correct balance.  But the ETH account shows the 0ETH balance.  I can't see any private key information but can see transaction history.  The wallet address displays the correct balance in etherscan, so it doesn't look like someone has stolen the funds.  What can I do? Is this a known bug or my funds may have been lost? Reloading the account did not work. I am thinking of restoring a backup from a 12 word password.  Is it good idea? Could this be related to ETH merge? Wallet address: 0x03a664577d71ee88d5a451d10f696bc967cbf872",

      "body": "Just redownload the mycelium wallet and imoprt the seed phrase again on the wallet to see if you will be able to see your balance correctly. Or read further.This has been the usual complain for bitcoin users that are using mycelium wallet, importing the seed phrase on electrum would work. Doing so for ether would also work, I do not know the wallet I can recommend.",

      "body": "Mycelium is actually buggy I am using that wallet since before and sometimes the BTC wallet on mycelium didn't sync properly so I guess it's also happened to the ETH wallet on mycelium.Would you mind to try if you can check the receive or balance tab if the address of your ETH wallet is exactly the same as this 0x03a664577d71ee88d5a451d10f696bc967cbf872If yes, then I suggest you export the private key and then switch to Metamask and import it there.Only do this if you need your balance right away because exposing your private to an online device will lead to data leakage. So you need to transfer the balance right away to a new wallet.",

Because the latest is released 2 days ago.Quote from: DeKaWu on September 14, 2022, 09:36:32 AMI am thinking of restoring a backup from a 12 word password.  Is it good idea?It's not a bad idea but usually not the best option in some cases.Aside from SA accounts, your main BTC and ETH account are backed-up by the 12-word seed backup so it'll properly restore your accounts at least.For the balance, it still depends on the underlying issue.",

      "body": "My Mycelium was acting really odd just before the change to PoS. I don't use Mycelium for much anymore, but I still have a bit of ETH & BTC sitting in it. Keep  meaning to spend it and remove that app. But, from Tues (Wed?) I had the same issue not seeing my ETH, figured it was because of the PoS change and forgot about till I now.I just installed the Sept 13th update and everything looks good.Side note, if you look through the threads here you can see funds not showing until a refresh or update is not a new thing with them.It's a shame, they used to be a lot better.-Dave",

      "body": "This is old known issue and not sure where but on the forum itself I have read about this forum and the solution was very easy for this. The user had issue with the mycelium not working properly, the balances were not synched and more than that the mycelium stopped working somehow on the android wallet. Initially there were many solution for them, like check if the mycelium is updated or not, check if the latest version is installed and phone has been restart for that matter. Some also suggested to uninstall the mycelium completely (make sure phrases and keys are written down first) and then try the app. Nothing worked. The only issue was: The users \"smart phone\" was not updated with the latest android OS. This was really easy solution and no one ever thought this could create such problem/.I am not sure if your problem is already resolved or not but you can try updating your phones OS to latest version. [ Not sure how this could affect but you can try... ]",

The OP made a post and never came back to the forum again. It's very likely he will never see your response 10 months later, and it's also possible he got a solution to the problem around that time.",
