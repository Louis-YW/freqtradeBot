The time starts to count down once the order gets created, and the service waits for the deposit. Imagine you made a deposit to a mixer and cannot bump your transaction fees for some reason. At the same time, the mixer's deposit address won't be valid after 24 hours. This will be the worst situation for anyone.",

My answer is 1. Anybody using mixer should be well equipped with the knowledge of transaction fees and might be using wallets that allows bumping, this won’t be an issue. 2. Bitcoin address do not expire, so what that 24 hours means is that you can’t deposit on that address again for privacy sake just like why Hierarchy Deterministic wallet are for but when the deposit drops even after 24 hours you will be able to spend it, except maybe the mixer has it’s own different rules guiding that",

Maybe the person who made this TX fee is a mixing service who has to prove the transaction on time.But I think mixers can deal with such situations by signing an agreement at first where they might say you might have to wait for the transaction to get processed if you get stuck in a congestion network. If they do it, then we as consumers have no other option but to agree with it.And talking about more delay doesn't it add more security, but yeah a delay can cause trouble.",

Coin mixers usually have a time limit for when transactions need to be finished which can make them more attractive to customers. But with the current problem of too many transactions and delays in the Bitcoin network it may be harder for coin mixers to finish transactions on time. This is really a challenge for coin mixing when the network congested. Coin mixer show the time and try to settle the transaction in the meantime. Because they pay the high fee for a transaction to speed up the transaction. Therefore they always remain stand in too much transactions and in congested network.",

That's a good point you have noticed, actually the regular users of mixers must be facing this issue as the transaction on start must also take a lot of time, then the transaction from the mixer side will also take time and most of the mixer as you stated have 24 hours expiration link, that would raise another issue.But I think it can be solved easily, all they have to do is, increase the expiration time but this might change the behavior of there customers and there is no doubt that delay in our transaction adds more privacy to them but if our transactions will be considered as donation to these mixers due to the 24 hour expiration policy and due to the congestion of network, then privacy will sucks.",

I can say from my experience that companies keep their eyes on how much coins they earn from their business and also modify their budget when price significantly rises and falls. Btw since here we talk about bitcoin mixers, it's clear that if people want to mix coins, they may not mix coins right now because of high fees but these people will mix their coins later when fees go down. Imagine that averagely 10 people mix coins per day, now start counting:10 people want to mix bitcoins today, 10 more want to mix tomorrow but transaction fees are very high. We have 20 lost client at the moment but imagine fees are low the day after tomorrow. What happens? Our 20 clients and let's expect another 10 guys, 30 guys visit platform and mix today (the day after tomorrow I was talking about). Mixer didn't lose clients or profits, they received profit later because of delay and that delay was caused by high fees. I think this situation is temporary and when the balance sheet comes in the next month, if fees go down, they'll see that they didn't experience significant loss because of this delay.",
