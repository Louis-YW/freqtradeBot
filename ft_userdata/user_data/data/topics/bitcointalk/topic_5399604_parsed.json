  "content": "Hi!  We are looking for team members for new projectsIntroduction:We are now going to run an ecological project of Pi, and the team members are from forums, blockchain (study and work) for more than 5 years, or even more, with rich experience.  Initial start-up funds have been raised and more could be expected.Project Introduction:To put it simply, we are not a token with only trading functions in the exchange, we want to be a coin in your wallet for your convenience.  There are too many tokens in exchanges, but too few coins in life.We want to implement real applications as soon as possible, instead of just writing white papers and giving users an invisible future.In the third stage, the first application scenario of our project will land, allowing you to use it conveniently, which will make you very happy.Targeted market:Actually it is a global market.  Whether online shopping or offline payment, you can use it conveniently.  The age of cryptocurrencies has arrived.Chance:As mentioned earlier, there are too many tokens in exchanges.  We want to be the coin in your wallet.  Most projects start from technology, and it is impossible to know whether there will be real applications.We start from the application scenario, and the realization of each stage will make users have confidence in us and gain more support. When the time is matured , we will develop a public chain that will become a real coin.Route map:A portion of the roadmap will be made public, and the more detailed roadmap will only be shown to interested team members until it is made public.We need team members: you can contribute to become a team shareholder, or you can join the work and become a team member.We welcome those who have struggled hard for many years in the industry and pay for many years. Although they are currently living in distress, they still have dreams in their hearts, will not give up, and are willing to join us to continue to struggle !  !  !This will be where your greatest talents come into play.1) Program developer (2)2) Brand operation (1)3) Bounty and Marketing Campaign Operation(1)4) Graphic Designer (1)5) Legal Practitioner & Support (1)If you are interested, please contact us and look forward to joining!  !  !Contact: https://t.me/GeorgeWinsonAlexanderNote, for emphasis :This is entrepreneurship, for a common dream.The initial start-up capital is limited, and everyone is part-time.  The rewards that can be obtained are equity and the coins we develop.To Satoshi Nakamoto: If you don't believe me, or don't understand, I don't have time to convince you.  Sorry!",

      "body": "Quote from: Wapfika on May 21, 2022, 01:02:01 PMYou should apply for project incubation like Binance, Bluezilla and other blockchain projects that offer project incubation. The idea was good when I read it but it's very hard to pursue that without enough resources because you can't hire a dedicated here without offering them payment for working with you. How many people already working for you and at what stage are you on your project development? I saw many pioneering program on different project that you might consider applying if you are interested rather than start from scratch here.Thanks for your advice. Project incubation is in our plan.In the first phase of the work. At present,there are about 10 team members.Note, for emphasis :This is entrepreneurship, for a common dream.The initial start-up capital is limited, and everyone is part-time.  The rewards that can be obtained are equity and the coins we develop.Thanks.",
