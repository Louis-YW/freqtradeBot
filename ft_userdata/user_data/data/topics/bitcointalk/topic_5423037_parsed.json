  "content": "You all probably know current Black Friday deals for Trezor (up to 30%), Keystone (up to 40%), ledger, Satochip, Cypherock X1 (75%) hardware wallets posted in forum, but I am here to show you few more less known deals I noticed for hardware wallets.First one I saw is nice Black Friday discount for OneKey hardware wallet devices.I won't talk much about OneKey, but they are biggest hardware wallet manufacturer in China/Hong Kong (I confirmed this from several sources) and their wallets are based on Trezor code.OneKey Mini price is $58, OneKey Classic is $89, but on Black Friday deal you can buy both of them together in one package for $109.98.You can also combine hardware wallets with aircraft-grade titanium metal seed backups, that are available in three other packages you can find on their shopping page.This are some very good deals, but I am still waiting for Wallet Scrutiny to confirm they are actually open source like they say.https://shop.onekey.so/products/onekey-hardware-wallet-package-for-black-fridayBitBox hardware wallet is offering 10% off everything plus 21% discount on our special Black Friday bundle, that includes Steelwallet, Backup cards and Tamper-evident security bags.CoolWallet is offering big discounts (up to 100%) if you have enough collected diamonds in your CoinMarketCap account.Standard Black Friday discount for CoolWallet devices is 15% this year, so CoolWallet S is around $84 and CoolWallet Pro is around $126 USD.ColdCard Black Friday Sale is offeringf up to 25% off most products using promo CKBTC, ColdCard Mk4 is now $118.35.HyperMate is offering 30% discount for their hardware wallets models G and Pro.",

      "body": "There isn't a dedicated thread for the Black Friday deal offered by Foundation Devices for the Passport Batch 2, and since I don't want to hijack n0nce's review threads this one will do just fine. I have to say that Foundation has the worst deal among all the hardware wallet brands so far. They aren't offering any discounts on their Batch 2 device, which is priced at $259, but an automatic coupon is added to your shopping cart giving you a free t-shirt, which they call a limited edition. According to them, it's valued $39 and with a purchase of a Passport HW, you get it for free.   They could have certainly done better than an overpriced black t-shirt with an orange phone on the front.",

Bitbox02 is good too, but it also faces the problem of too few users. I wish all open-source altcoin hardware wallets, include trezor, bitbox, onekey, and keystone, can receive more attentions and have more users. Then I will have more choices.",

Are they deliberately stirring up excitement? It looks like marketers from Ledger have moved in with them.  I predict very big discounts on Model One. Trezor will try to get rid of this as an outdated model after the updated version (Safe 3) is released. By the way, everyone’s favorite closest competitor (Ledger) has not yet announced anything like this. They usually did discounts at the end of November too. How many of you are willing to buy their products on the cheap?  And with a very big discount?",
