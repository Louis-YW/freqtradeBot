Doge coin has been pumped due to the a reason. It's caused by people who pumped GME has been massively moving to the doge coin after doge coin supported by elon musk. If you are aware with the market and there are so many coins that ridiculously pumped as high as doge coin. The coin like solana has ever touched $234Â  as a highest rate that has ever been reached. The ico price of solana was around 20 cents. that proves that in crypto everything can be pumped as long as there would be hype.",

It used to be NEM, then Ripple. From the last ones, it was SHIBA, LUNA , Solana. I'm sure there will be many more such coins in the future. For example Aptos has even now gone from $3 to $13 without an altseason.",

Dogecoin and Shiba pumped hard in 2022 . We have seen huge pump in Solona meme coin bonk. Pi also pumped from 0.5$ to 300$+. These coins are very unpredictable because no one know these kind of coins. Those token which has high use case like Dot and Fantom are still very low price and meme coins are pumping.",

We don't have an idea of what's potentially going to be the next Doge pump and that's what many investors are looking to have. But the thing is, we're not assured of what the next bull run will be like and what those altcoins shall pump. Bitcoin will surely pump and that's no doubt that will be followed by altcoins like Ethereum and for the meme coins, we don't know if they'll also still going to pump next.",

We just don't know yet which crypto is going to be the highly pumped next time, although APT managed to double its price recently, on the weekly period, going from 7$ to 14$.100% profit to investors in one week!I just think coins and tokens which have already had their glory moments previously aren't going to be contemplated again, since this market is very volatile and is always creating new hypes involving new characters (cryptocurrencies).",

I am no sure which one it will be, it's very difficult to find that out, there were even other coins than doge which went up higher than doge during that period as well. And what happened?Most of them are gone right now, which is why it's quite important to remember that you will probably not end up with a coin that will be that high, it's going to be near impossible to find things that go up 100x and you will need to learn how to be happy with 10x, which is a lot but people seem to be not so happy about it if they have to wait 4-5 years for that 10x and yet if they do 10x every 5 years, that's a lot of money.",

That's why everyone is trying to get their ticket(altcoin) as their pick for the next bull run. And it's like about being lucky on who's going to pick the one that will be surprisingly be up.Other than that, no one really knows what will be accurately coming out so, we're all in a guessing period.",

Of course you can wait for the next bull run, but that doesn't guarantee you'll guess with coins that pump the same way as doge or Solana. After all, such coins have to be bought for pennies at the start. And when the bull market starts, you will already be late for that train.",

I don't know if the era of Shiba is gone or there is still hope for the coin. But I sure know that dodge will rise again",

You shall try to keep updated with the market. That will give you clues about which tokens that may be pumped so hard by the whales. I meant you must also try to see that about some legit coins too. Some coins with very low markcetcap can be crazily pumped by the whales like doge coin and shiba inu. If you were aware some protocol coins got increased as big as doge coin. That means if you shall try to search for the protocol coins that are still undervalued at this moment. This is your only chance to get huge money instantly from the market but remember about the risk.",

But dont expect popular altcoins to get such pumps. It will be extremely costly to pump them, plus no one will believe in top altcoins pump out of nowhere, and pump wont have an effect.
