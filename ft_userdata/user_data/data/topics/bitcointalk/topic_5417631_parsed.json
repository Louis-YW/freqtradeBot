  "content": "Hi there,I found a years-old Armory Wallet.Watch-Only file and Encrypted file.I still know the password.I tried to use the backup function to export the private keys, but no addresses shown.But I remember I had like 100s of Addresses in this wallet.How can I get Armory to show all of the addresses that were connected to this wallet, so I can export the private keys afterwards?Your help would be HIGHLY appreciated. If I get any money out of this, can pay you as well.Thanks!",

Excited So if anyone else have the same issue, thats how you do it. There might be a way to create more than 1 new receiving address at a time, but I am happy with that.",

Excited So if anyone else have the same issue, thats how you do it. There might be a way to create more than 1 new receiving address at a time, but I am happy with that.That's time-consuming.Your addresses are listed in \"Wallet Properties->Unused/Used Addresses\" and expand the correct script type.The catch is, you can only copy (Click->Ctrl+C) one address at a time.It's only 100 addresses by default for unused addresses but you can increase that by deriving more in:\"Wallet Properties->Address Used (click the number)->Compute this many more addresses\"; then click \"Compute\". Click \"Done\" after the loading screen is finished.After that, check the list again; if it didn't update, use \"Receive Bitcoins\" once.For the non-watching-only encrypted wallet:You already had it in the OP, you just have to tick \"Include Unused (Address Pool)\" and the list will be populated.You can also untick \"Private Key (Plain Base58)\" and \"Private Key (Plain HEX)\" so that it will only be a list of addresses.Do the \"compute\" before you export to increase the number of addresses in the result.",

      "body": "Quote from: ArmoryHelp on October 19, 2022, 09:02:29 AMBut the addresses are not unused, they were used.Armory detects address usage in 2 ways:- If it has been explicitly requested by the user- If the has history. To detect history, Armory needs access to the blockchain, which I suspect you didn't setup.With that in mind, you should simply grab the set of private keys from all addresses in the wallet, used and unused. This will cover your case and avoid you setup woes.",
