No one can say surely about future but that target price is only x2 from Bitcoin all time high in 2021 so it is realistic.Kiyosaki did not make a bullshit call like Balaji Srinivasan Explains $1M Bitcoin in 90 daysIf an investor has belief that Bitcoin will not die [1], I believe it will not too, holding bitcoin till 2028 or 2032 will be a very great choice.[1] “Bitcoin Is Dead” - The #1 Database of Notable Bitcoin Skeptics",

I can understand that we should not hold fiat, that is correct and accurate because fiat depreciate in value. Among all fiat, I still prefer USD the most which some people can prefer after a massive bull run for short term holders.Bitcoin is an appreciative asset and a store of value if you can hold it for long term. If anyone will tell me that bitcoin will reach all-time-high by 2024 to 2025, hit six digits and more uptrends, I will not doubt that because bitcoin has been an appreciative asset right from time.If you take a trip down memory lane, you will understand that there are bull run periods and bear market periods. 2024 and 2025 are another bull periods. Starting from next year, we should expect increase in the price of bitcoin. There are many whale celebrities and institutional investors that are now pointing towards these period of 2024 and 2025. It should be another opportunity which should not be missed.",

It's very important that we position ourselves for whatever turns of the event.We do not need to associate fiat to the reason bitcoin will grow like you meant in your statement. 2024 and 2025 are years that many crypto enthusiasts have been waiting for. If bitcoin increase in price, not because of BRICS alliance or whatever you called them. If something like that do not exits, bitcoin price will increase. If USD price do not fall, bitcoin will increase in price. Among the foreign reserve currencies, USD makes up 60% as of this year while Euro makes up of 20%. That is 80%. Among the country that you mentioned, Chinese Yuan makes up of 3% of foreign reserves, which is the highest among them. The money that Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa are spending are under the remaining foreign reserves which do not make up to 8% after excluding Pounds Sterling.I do not know the type of alliance they want to form, but know that I do not yet see it as any threat to weaken USD and EUR as the world's reserve currencies.",

I mean we see Bitcoin from 2$ to 1000$ which is a pretty giant leap so even a million dollars is possible at some point, the market is getting a lot of momentum at the moment it is available to stay around 30k$ for a long time it might drop a very low percentage in the coming weeks but to be honest I think any kind of good news or article of Bitcoin could already trigger the price to skyrocket up to 40k$ at any moment.",

Why are you ready to squeal with joy and believe the forecasts of such personalities as Kiyosaki? Their forecasts are no different from the weather forecast: it may or may not be sunny tomorrow. The same goes for \"the dollar will ruined.\" It may happen (for sure, not in the near future), or it may not happen. Such predictions should be treated with a great deal of skepticism, because these predictors know absolutely nothing about exactly how events will develop, especially in the financial sector (the dollar will collapse) and in the cryptocurrency market (about bitcoin).The price of $100k-120k for bitcoin is quite real during the new bullrun (if there are no unforeseen circumstances in the global economy) that should occur.
