  "content": "Well, I think this can be a tutorial for beginners. If you are using Atomic wallet and you've sent your BCH to BTC address, don't worry, you can easily recover it in another wallet (like Electron-Cash).First of all download and install the Electron-Cash wallet: https://electroncash.org/Now go to settings then go to the private key section and enter your password and find your BTC private key. Now, copy it.Now open the Electron-Cash wallet and choose Import BCH addresses or private keys and paste your BTC private key that you've just copied it.Click on the next option. Now you can see your BCH in your ElectronCash wallet.That's it",

      "body": "If you did this in reverse (sending BTC to BCH address) there are at least 3 steps that you should take before doing any of these things.Step 0:Seek another bitcoin wallet first since Atomic Wallet is considered a closed source wallet and that makes it significantly insecure compared to other open source and popular wallets such as Electrum.Step 00:Create a (bitcoin) new wallet and transfer all your funds from the key (or master key) you want to import in another wallet to this new wallet because those keys could be compromised if the altcoin wallet has any bugs which could be very likely considering their lack of popularity and review. If you followed step 0, you should move all your funds to the new Electrum wallet.Step 000: Learn how to run a sandbox in order to download and install ElectronCash in it to import your private keys into. Everything involving bcash should be treated with extreme care due to shadiness of the project and the scam behavior of those involved in it and projects related to this altcoin.",

That way you make sure the private key never touches the internet from a Fork wallet (but just in case: don't use it again anyway).My current setup (which I haven't needed since I created it, but that's not the point....) for dealing with untrusted Fork wallets is this:Quote from: LoyceV on May 09, 2022, 11:25:40 AMI've added this to my toolbox for my Fork Claiming Service: a space laptop with 2 Linux distributions installed in dual boot. The first is to work on, the second doesn't have internet and now has 5 partition images:1. A fresh installation with VPN2. A fresh installation with VPN and BCH full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BCH's Electrum Fork.3. A fresh installation with VPN and BTG full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BTG's Electrum Fork (using wine).4. A fresh installation with VPN and BCD full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BCD's Electrum Fork.5. A fresh installation with VPN and eCash full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And eCash'es Electrum Fork.The laptop doesn't have enough disk space to keep all full clients.This setup makes it much easier to handle Forkcoins: I restore the partition I need, boot into it, import the address/pubkey, and let it sync. When done, I take it offline, enter the private key, and create a raw transaction to transfer funds. After that, I boot into the second Linux distribution to overwrite the first partition. This makes offline signing relatively easy without ever risking the private key to untrusted software.",
