It's not stored in the transaction or in the blockchain. It's just a local note that only you and the one you share the payment request with can see.Due to the price volatility, this feature can be very useful for merchants who need to mark an order as failed if they don't receive the payment within a specified time.",

It's the request that expires and not the address.That is a nice answer. Address never expire in any day but the request, date and time expires. It is just like the OTP code from fiat bank to the bank address owner. The OTP expires but the bank address never expires. The expiring process is also used to secure the coin. But if you are using fiat bank in your country, you would have understand these things.",
