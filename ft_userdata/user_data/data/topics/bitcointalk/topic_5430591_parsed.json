There are old gaming platform here that still has poker, but they have a accusations before, like colluding that's why they lost their crowd.And there are also poker tournaments being held or sponsored here by members or the platform themselves.",

I was very active poker player years ago as I started my online gambling in fiat poker site and poker game was also the one that made me know about cryptocurrency for the 1st time. I played in few crypto poker sites but unfortunately, the traffic is not really good in crypto poker sites compared to fiat, this is why I do not really follow the trend of crypto poker. However, for now I think there is no other good choice except swc and betnomi, I cant find any other crypto poker sites with better traffic than these 2 sites although I do not think that swc and betnomi has decent traffic.",

I think I still have some tickets for those big tournaments we got from bitcointalk private series... with kids and family that game was too late for me anyway, but I tried to play it a few times and each time it was canceled, not enough registered players.I guess we can discuss \"several players at cash tables\", as you know there were some accusations about collusion and bots in their ANN thread. They didn't bother much to respond... I can't say that I had any issues with SWC, but somehow that place \"lost spirit\" (players) at one moment, and I just moved away.

It was quick I found it LOLThey used to have signature campaign and used to host regular poker tournaments for the bitcointalk forum members. It was going through for long months when the pandemic started back in Q1 2020.To response PawGo and OP, swcpoker are specialist in poker, if I ever play poker again then I will look for them before anyone else. I did not check recently but most probably blackjack.fun also have similar type of poker specialty but I could be very wrong about them.

Good list already especially with Fortune jack and Chistars (these are where my friends are playing at and I think these are good poker platforms). Well, actually there should be many platforms offering the same game simply because poker is one of the traditional gambling games being offered to both online and land based casinos. It will just be comparison on platforms' promotions and bonuses as well as odds of winning, to determine where a poker player should engage himself into. Personally, I am not into this kind of gambling game but for sure there are many great gambling sites in this industry to play this game at.Quote from: arallmuus on December 20, 2022, 08:59:12 PMQuote from: arcathomas on December 20, 2022, 04:52:09 PMHi everyone,It's been a while since I played poker with crypto, back then I used betcoin.ag but they closed their poker rooms.Does anyone know a trustworthy place to play poker with crypto ?ThanksIf you are looking for a dedicated poker sites with crypto then currently there isnt one.
