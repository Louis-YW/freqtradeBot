What does it mean exactly when in the lower half of the \"send\" tab, there's a green checkmark with \"sent\", but that transaction doesn't show up in the history?I wanted to do a transfer and filled out the (thankfully correct) address, amount, and then hit 'pay' - then a popup window opened and I wasn't sure what to select for the fees, moved the sliders around a bit, and wanted to look some stuff up, and then I must have closed that window somehow. Now I can't get it to open again but it just shows it as 'sent'. I can't remember if I had entered my password when that window was opened, and I can't remember what the slider position was at. In the worst case, did I successfully initiate that transaction with super low/slow fees, and it'll need a very long time to show up, so I can then raise the fees for it? Because I can't get it to show a transaction ID, and right clicking it won't allow me to raise fees or make any change to it.Can I simply make another identical transaction now with high fees, and would that basically supersede the old one - but what would then happen if the old one would get processed later?",

But the status on my Electrum version is not marked but displayed as 'unpaid'. Thanks a lot for taking the time. I should say this is on an old version of Electrum, which is one of the main reasons I'm trying to do this transaction so I can use a newer one. Right clicking on the line in the send tab does not show 'pay'. I did a smaller transaction earlier with a very low fee and it didn't show up on the history screen either for several hours so I have been a bit confused about whether I can just disregard this or not. What would happen if I redo the transaction with a higher fee and then later the original transaction goes through, but my wallet is empty? Does that lead to any bad consequences?",

I do not know if I am correct: I think in the older version of Electrum, if you click on save instead of pay, that is how the transaction will look like on the send tab, but which is not yet valid and you can make another transaction which is valid.

What does it mean exactly when in the lower half of the \"send\" tab, there's a green checkmark with \"sent\", but that transaction doesn't show up in the history?Could you provide a screenshot of the window? Just make sure to censor any private information such as addresses (both yours and the recipient's), transaction amounts, wallet balances, and anything else that should remain confidential.Quote from: RaveniaPX on June 06, 2023, 09:09:21 PMI wanted to do a transfer and filled out the (thankfully correct) address, amount, and then hit 'pay' - then a popup window opened and I wasn't sure what to select for the fees, moved the sliders around a bit, and wanted to look some stuff up, and then I must have closed that window somehow.

After you have filled in all the information and selected the fee for the transaction, there should always be a final window where you have the option to double check everything before you can click on the final \"pay\" and then \"broadcast\". (that's why I'd like to see a screenshot).Quote from: RaveniaPX on June 06, 2023, 09:09:21 PMCan I simply make another identical transaction now with high fees, and would that basically supersede the old one - but what would then happen if the old one would get processed later?If your Electrum wallet is functioning properly, your transaction should appear in the \"History\" tab, even if it was made with a minimal fee and hasn't been confirmed by the network yet. Have you verified if Electrum is connected to the network? Look for a green circle in the lower right corner of the window. If the transaction doesn't appear in the history list and your total balance still reflects the full amount you had previously, it's highly likely that you didn't broadcast the transaction. In such a case, feel free to create a new transaction without any issues.",

      "body": "Thank you again for taking the time. This is how the send tab looks like:https://i.imgur.com/PdAssCY.pngWhen I click on Details, it shows \"Onchain Invoice\". I think replace by fee was activated if I remember correctly. I can't update Electrum on the machine the wallet is on, which is one of the main reasons I'm trying to transfer in the first place.If this is a saved transaction, then I wonder why there is no option to finalize or send it (that doesn't show on the context menu).Thank you again, so I think I didn't click on \"broadcast\" or anything, I only clicked on 'pay' on the send window which brought up the fees window, but I didn't click on broadcast yet. What just surprises me is that the transaction still shows as 'paid' in the send tab, that's what's making me hesitate. It's been like this for about ten hours now, still doesn't show on the history tab. What would happen if this for some reason were a valid transaction and I now do the same transaction again on top of it with higher fees?",

It is best you check other source to determine the most suitable fee to pay at the time.- Jay -",

Phew!Yeah. That's exactly why newer versions have addressed and fixed those issues, and the labeling of transactions has improved. That's the whole purpose of software updates – to fix bugs and glitches. So, my suggestion is to update your Electrum software as soon as you can to ensure you're using the most stable and secure version.",
