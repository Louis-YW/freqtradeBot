So, you offer this book for free, without the author's permission although it is obvious that the book is not free, because it is still being sold on Amazon?Is it possible that you don't see any problem here?it's nice that you're inspired by her, but it's enough just to mention her as a reference, that way you will have more focus on your work.",

I don't think there's a single country on the planet that will allow this.So let's read further:Quote from: https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-sentenceA network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.Now it sounds like a a cult, where somehow I get the idea the founder will get very wealthy out of this.I've filled out your questionaire.",
