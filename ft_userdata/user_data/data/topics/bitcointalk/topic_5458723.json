  "content": "What is Bitcoin Faucet ?A Bitcoin Faucet in market language is like a water carrier giving out free Bitcoins. So, in essence, you can get Bitcoin without having to buy or pay. The method is easy, all you have to do is visit the Bitcoin faucet website or application, then you have to do a number of small tasks to get the Bitcoin.For example, you might be asked to do a captcha, your job is to just fill in or answer the code that appears on the screen so you can verify it. There are also faucets that give simple questions, for example about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. The answer is usually easy, you don't have to be a genius.After you finish doing the task, you will get a small amount of Bitcoin as a reward. But don't expect too much, usually the value is small. Bitcoin Faucets are more for just experimenting or for honing your experience with Bitcoin. So, if you want to try to have Bitcoin without having to spend a lot of money, faucets can be a good choice.Just remember, this Bitcoin faucet is only for getting a small amount of Bitcoin. So, if you want to earn lots of Bitcoins, you should probably try other methods, like trading or mining.Here are two legend sites that provide bitcoin faucets 1. FreeBitco.inFreeBitco.in is an interesting application because users will get free Bitcoins per hour, and you can't cheat by using multiple accounts, because it's limited to only one user on one IP. This site is legend, because it's existed a few years ago and this forum already make a discussion about it.2. FreeBitcoin.ioPlease note, at FreeBitcoin.io Bitcoin can only be withdrawn if your assets have reached 1 Bitcoin. The rewards will also be sent directly to your bitcoin e-wallet!I hope seniors who know more about legit bitcoin faucet sites, please tell us all so that we also have more experience as beginners, and also so that we have informative discussions here.Note : Just remember, this Bitcoin faucet is only for getting a small amount of Bitcoin. So, if you want to earn lots of Bitcoins, you should probably try other methods, like trading or mining.",

      "body": "Thanks OP for sharing details about Bitcoin Faucets. It should be known by all and I want to add some of words. Basically I will not suggest anyone to join any Bitcoin faucets because they aren't worthy at all. Faucets were much popular in past to get free Bitcoins and they paid a decent amount. But now I will suggest everyone to get their Bitcoins indirectly like People can join Airdrops and convert their payments to Bitcoin. I also adopted my first Bitcoin in this way. The most effective way for beginners to adopt Bitcoin is to join Airdrops and Bounties . I saw many bounty campaigns pay in USDT or their own token. People can easily sell them and convert to Bitcoin. Joining Airdrops and Bounties are far better than working in faucets. Though all Airdrops and Bounties don't pay and also some aren't worthy but we can join escrowed bounties or potential Bounties or Airdrops. I will not suggest to do trading or investing for beginners as it's more risky for them but they can start after being experts.There are some other ways to get Bitcoin for experts. Like they can start mining Bitcoin and join Bug Bounties and many more. We can generate much more Bitcoin by this way.",

And sometimes I wish I knew Bitcoin back then. Unfortunately, I don't know much about bitcoin when there are still many bitcoin faucets that provide large amounts of bitcoin for free. which indeed at that time maybe the price of bitcoin was still not as valuable as it is now.And I think very lucky those who knew bitcoin at the very beginning bitcoin was launched and received a lot of bitcoins through the faucet.And even now there may still be a lot of bitcoin faucets but only distributed in really small amounts. and requires a minimum threshold to be withdrawn.",

So, if you want to earn lots of Bitcoins, you should probably try other methods, like trading or mining.The reason why many people interested in Bitcoin faucet is they don't need to spent any money to earn. It's completely different with trading and mining, they need to spent their money especially mining where they need to buy mining rigs. If you meant we can mine by invest to someone mining project aka cloud mining, it's not good since most of cloud mining is scam.Faucet is a waste of time, you need to spend a lot time to meet the minimum requirement to withdraw. If the coin arrived directly in your wallet, it's not worth because many inputs, you need to pay higher fee to the miner.",

      "body": "In the earlier days there was  faucet by Gavin Anderson  that gives you 5 BTC because prices were very low in 2010 as it was in its initial state only so to give a boost he started this site.But if you are seriously looking to earn bitcoins now with the help of any faucet then it's wastage of time because you would spend hours there getting minimal amounts.The reason behind it is the price is at $30k so why would any platform giving away huge amounts to many without even doing anything special? There are many sites and games as well offering you the same sort of gifts and rewards in Bitcoin as well as other cryptos but also have withdrawal limits as mentioned by you and you would spend considerable time reaching that amount only.So find some other good ways to earn if you are interested in like :1) Accept payments if you are merchant and can implement LN channel also2) Offer services if you have any to clients demanding bitcoin payments3) Sell some stuff online and see if someone is giving bitcoin in exchange for itBut faucet is not a good idea according to me at this time.",

However, most faucets have stopped operating, and those that still do are paying a mere amount of satoshis that can be counted with the fingers of your one hand. It's not worth your time; it never was, but at least in the past, you could easily accumulate a relatively decent sum of Bitcoin.Captchas and microtasking such as PTC advertisements or faucets are a complete waste of time. There's also a decent chance that you'll never reach the minimum payout, and even if we suppose that you do, you'll lose most of your earnings to transaction fees.",

Every way to make a free profit without effort or specialized skills from an individual is either stealing your data, it is fraud, or its return is simple. Therefore, you will find most of these faucets, either they steal your data, they are fraud, or the revenue from them is not enough to buy you cups of coffee.Use some of them and give your personal experience after a week of experimentation, then the results from this topic will be more useful.I remember registering with FreeBitco.in but I don't know why?",
