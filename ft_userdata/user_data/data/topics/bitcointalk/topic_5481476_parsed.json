Unless you use a DEX to swap and exchange bitcoin for other coins like Monero and then use another wallet to buy and receive bitcoin, the wallet will still be linked to the address that you send it to. If you ever want to trace that transaction, let's not forget that it's a public blockchain and transactions can be tracked by anyone who has access to the address on the blockchain. There are means to clean up coins that you have already bought from the centralized exchange; either you can exchange them anonymously or you can send them back to the centralized exchange where you bought them and exchange them back to Fiat, where you can later use the fiat to buy from Dex P2P, where one will know what the funds were used for and only you will know what address and the amount of bitcoin that you hold.",

It is pertinent to note that all these unscrupulous shenanigans by government and its arms are just a way of getting at Bitcoiners and they are only enjoying their limited time as Bitcoin gradually gains adoption. Uoon massive adoption, people will prefer to use Bitcoin thereby activating its peer-to-peer feature which entirely eliminates the government from interfering or taxing transactions that doesn't involve their traditional finance systems.",

Do not forget that banks are vulnerable to liquidity. If people start pulling out their savings because BTC reaches a new ATH, banks get very nervous. Your savings are lent out to someone else and they hate to let them go. \"We must stop terrorists and money launderers, who always use bitcoin for their illicit activity\". In fact I have already heard this line multiple times from people like Elisabeth Warren and Gary Gensler. It's a BS argument of course. JP Morgan was buying up all BTC while Warren said this in congress. All they want is complete ownership of the BTC market.I strongly believe they will do it by creating maximum sell pressure. 1) By dumping the price and scare people into selling, 2) By launching enormous ownership taxes, 3) By making it illegal to buy it. They want control, and they will not allow us to own anything they don't know about",

Throughout 2024, this is what I will have to look into. I'm a medical student and the director of the school likes to brag about his finances. His lawyer has inside information about my country launching much higher taxes on most assets people own privately. Even though he is a multi millionaire, he owns nothing privately. Most assets are registered as part of business. He already mentioned that at some point he is looking to move abroad because what he does now is no longer sustainable. After marriage I will have dual citizenship (1 EU, 1 non EU), which I think is very valuable when the government tries to go after BTC with tax robbery. I do wonder if their ownership tax plan will cause a collapse of the markets. If you can't exchange BTC freely or use it as a means of payment, that has to crash the price.",

That's why it's the \"ideal country\" for HOLD.  It's the same in my country, but that may change soon.I'm planning to take profits after this bull run, but taxes in my country are huge. The centralized exchange will provide my government with my transaction history as soon as they are asked about it.Can I avoid this with DEX? I know a guy who has already collected multiple BTC. He took profits on regular occasions and he doesn't want to leave the profits on an exchange, of course. So he opened bank accounts in 2 other countries. He was already contacted by our government. They immediately know. Unless you are a millionaire based in Dubai or Switzerland, where the law does not force banks to share information with your homecountry.I always considered buying crypto a one way street. You can deposit from banks to exchanges, but as soon as you go from exchanges back to banks, it alerts the tax thieves and they will go after your transaction history. I considered options like stablecoins but these are risky as they are under attack.I've also heard that privacy coins like Monero are under government attack, being forced to be delisted. I wonder who will win the battle. But there is hope",

If my understanding on the system of taxing isn't wrong, using the regular bank as an instance, government only impose tax in institutions like banks and not the user of the banks. What we pay for using the bank is basically bank charges while the banks are held to pay tax.since bitcoin is a decentralized system that, who will be responsible for the payment of the tax?Is it Satoshi? Or thymos?I don't see this happening to b honest and if we are looking at tu possible strategies that the government can impose on bitcoin use to make it fall under government regulation then we should be talking about creating something like a bitcoin bank or stuff like that which has a physical presence",

The reason is that some people have already stored their Bitcoin in a cold wallet, and those holders are definitely keeping their hardware wallet safe in a place where only they can reach it.So, the government cannot actually determine everyone  owing Bitcoin unless they work in collaboration with centralized exchanges to identify users who have passed KYC on those exchanges, and the exchange can further help them get details on the amount of Bitcoin that the investor has purchased. That's a reminder to every Bitcoiner to note that KYC is actually a trap that the government might use any time they want to get to Bitcoin users. Not only the government, but scammers and hackers can also take advantage of a user's personal details obtained from KYCs.Also, if this kind of law is passed by the government, it definitely will not affect all countries in the world; people can move to a crypto-non-taxing country and carry out their crypto activities there.",
