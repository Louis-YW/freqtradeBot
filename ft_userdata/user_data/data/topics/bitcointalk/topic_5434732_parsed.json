I miss the days making 100x or more with random micro caps. But i guess my luck on finding those has ran out. When there are like 100 scams per day i do have more skepticism on what comes to investing on new small cap tokens or coins.",

Mine, none other than bitcoin. So, calculate how much the percentage on it and I only look at the price of it.So basically, from $16k up to $20,800.  That's a great gain for me so far within less than a month.",

That's good for you, you've risked your portfolio by choosing short-term coins which is I don't think the right decision IMO.Good luck everyone, let's not dump the market with this small recovery of Bitcoin.",

Gala has been spiking up a few hundreds percents from its bottom while MANA was also performing so well. That's very good to see that if bitcoin will able to break 40k in the future. I have been stacking up so many altcoins. Only stupid people will be mising the golden chance to make bunch of money like that. Im currently sitting with decent profit in my portfolios now.",

I only had like BTC, ETH, as my main portfolio, the rest were leftovers from when I tried them out (like AXS, which grew, but since I had peanuts on it well, it wasn't really that much). I have a bit of my portfolio for TRX and MATIC as well, but they didn't really grow as big as Bitcoin so far. I might actually just let them go right now while I'm in the profit, pretty afraid of shorting so I don't think I'd really get any bigger gains than what BTC or ETH has to offer (the only ones I'm holding for the long term).",

Basically these are the tokens in my wallet and I was really planning to hold them for a while but a sudden increase took place recently. However I sold them upon crossing the barriers simply because I'm in doubt of a continuous increase as early as the present. The year has just started and Spikes are more likely to occur than bullish trend in my opinion, especially from being bearish for a couple of months. Recovery won't be that easy because there is now a huge gap between current market prices and ATH market value among cryptocurrencies. Would probably be spotting more coins for the purpose of earning profit if spikes again occur.",

Some of them are for the long term and are taking a little advantage of solana's rising prices. Currently, altcoins are recovering because the price of Bitcoin has started to strengthen and has managed to penetrate the price of $20k. If it remains stable and tends to rise, the altcoins will have a party.",

I chose BNB because, even when the market crashes, it does not crash hard. That is most likely why it does not pump as hard as it should. I hope it becomes profitable soon.",

And good for you that you bought it when it was $16k-$17k while it's now up and green. My next good gainer is ETH.It's visible in how much it has gained and as the typical thing to the market whenever the father of them all has been rising, they're also going to increase in price and that's the trend that many altcoins do follow.Very noticeable that most of us have gained and bought when they were quite lower and hope that this trend continues up to the next years to come. I'm always expecting that there could be some dips and lows but they won't be that painful anymore.",

If you take a look at the list of top gainers for the last 7 days, most of the altcoins here are smart contract platforms like Solana/Optimism/Avalanche and together with NFT platforms like just Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Flow.",
