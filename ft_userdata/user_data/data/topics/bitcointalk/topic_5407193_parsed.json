We have access to highly reliable and sales-quality natural gas in the province and can accommodate crypto mining projects anywhere from 10MW up to 200MW at our various physical infrastructure sites. We are in the process of successfully completing a 9.9MW project and are keen to explore other opportunities should there be interest.Feel free to send me a PM or reply if you have any other questions or are interested in discussing further.Thank you! https://www.campusenergy.ca/Infrastructure",
