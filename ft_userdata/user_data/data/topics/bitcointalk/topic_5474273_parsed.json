      "body": "Yes, I agree with @lucifur, you must show some of the work that you have done in your thread so people who are interested in your service may want to hire you for their work. Without samples it would be difficult for others to see that how good is your service and that's why you won't get any clients.It's always better to show your previous work when you create a thread like this because clients always want to have the best service and they can't decide the best one without seeing the samples of the work the user has already done.",
