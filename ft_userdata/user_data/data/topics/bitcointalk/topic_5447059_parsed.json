Just because you don't see your balance on blockchain.com doesn't mean you haven't received the fund. Note that blockchain.com explorer has no control over the blockchain and they can't stop you from receiving fund. I don't have any information about solana blockchain and defi, but it seems that their wallet is showing the correct balance. In the image you shared above, it's displaying the total balance of 9.69999 SOL.",

      "body": "It will probably solve by itself over time but if you're in a hurry to get your funds out, try to ask in r/solana if there are compatible wallets you can import your blockchain.com sol wallet. From what I understand, defi wallets are non-custodial and backed up by your backup phrase, see: https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051018031-Technical-differences-between-the-DeFi-Wallet-and-Blockchain-com-Account (side note: please be careful of phishing/scam links, verify first!)Otherwise, you may also try starting in a fresh blockchain.com account using the same backup phrase, see: https://login.blockchain.com/en/#/recover. Suggesting this as I have seen account-only problems/errors before so perhaps starting on a new account will solve the withdrawal error?After importing, I suggest moving all your coins in a fresh wallet with a newly generated seed for better security. Hopefully, this wallet will not be blockchain.com again as I'm pretty sure there should be better options for you.",
