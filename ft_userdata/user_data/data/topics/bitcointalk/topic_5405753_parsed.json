  "content": "Quote“Today in this country we have a fuel crisis, a food shortage, we have the head of the World Food Program coming here and we have several matters to discuss with the IMF,” Wickremesinghe said. “Therefore, if this government leaves there should be another government.”Saturday the 9th of July the Sri Lankan palace finally became the final point where everything broke and was unavoidable. The crisis that befell this country is getting more and more unstoppable, plus the impact of the pandemic and the death of the tourism industry due to terrorist attacks in 2019. Protesters burst into the palace. Sri Lanka's president and prime minister inaugurated himself and fled by plane. Some of Sri Lanka problems which I summarize as follows:Debt swells to $51 billionCorruption has increased dramaticallyHigh imports to meet needs are not supported by exports to global marketsGasoline out of stockBreakthrough inflation reaches 60%Civil servants are not paidPower failureSchool closedHospitals as health facilities are also collapsingSilenced freedom of speech, andPeople experience experiences from all sectors, especially the economy in supporting their daily needs (food, drink, clothing, and housing).From this incident, a corrupt government that only cares about personal interests on the basis of ambition will lead to destruction. An unbalanced economic system and uncertainty about campaign promises are the main weapons.What do you think about the economic crisis in Sri Lanka?Source:https://apnews.com/article/asia-economy-sri-lanka-074d8194c64572dc80118f88a01df1c2?taid=62c9b9b4c95ca00001c0a1cb&utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitterhttps://www.adb.org/countries/sri-lanka/economyhttps://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1545689501758111744",

But the problem is that there is no leader for this revolution, and it is not organized but rather spontaneous, not led by an enlightened elite capable of finding a way out for the country from the bottleneck.And despite the escape of the president and his deputy, the changes returned to take a legal form, with the speaker of parliament governing the country until the next political change, and this is mainly due to the absence of an alternative among the masses.",

Perhaps they have been in worsening scenario already with the pandemic, but it then added when they can't buy fuel, they don't have enough foreign currency to pay. And worst, it was reported that they only have a week supply of fuel left.Not sure if a revolution is needed to change who is heading the government, but they are in dire problems, and in the verge of collapse.

Then I realized that there really isn't anything that they can do to revive their economy easily given that they only rely on tourism, an opportunity which was cut by the pandemic. They cannot take loans anymore due to the fact that there isn't anything they can pay with. All they need is a bail out and an economic reset, something that doesn't come for free. Kicking the corrupt officials out of the office is a start, and finding for a new government to restart everything is another.",

We can only hope that this is just the beginning for Sri Lanka to get better politicians, after all governments are supposed to fear the people. However, reading the briefing of the situation that country is goinf through I am afraid they will likelyhav to adquire even more debt to have a chance to climb put that economic hole they are trapped in, this may create a situation in which predatory lenders would take advantage of the moment of weakness of the nation in order to fill their pockets in the mid/long term.At this point, they need actual patriots to take the steering wheel of the politics and macro-economics, other-wise a dark future lies ahead for that people.",

Just to take Syria for example, we know there is a huge war there right? Been over a decade now. Who was the leader there? A guy who was a secular person who wanted to rule the nation without islamist rule, and for this, do bad things and killed people and deported many, and never gave free rights at all. Wel lwe have seen what the other side wanted and won, that is Afghanistan, a nation ruled by islamists right now. I don't see how any side wins, both side looks to be doing terrible stuff.I have very little information about Sri Lanka, and I am sure they must be doing badly, otherwise why would this happen, and we always like to see people takeover power, but if those people are the ones that really believe in giving it back to democracy. I don't know if that will be the case in Sri lanka. Al lI know is, give it a few years to see if this is a good thing or not, you can't for sure know if this is good or not, it could turn out to be the best thing that ever happend to Sri Lanka, or it could turn out to be horrible.",

The footage shows how the President had kitchen's full of food, grains and rice and living the good life. It's sad reality and those peeps had perfect approach. Next step is country falling into the hands of another country. When they gonna pay 51 billion dollars, thats not even their ten years GDP?",

Perhaps Sri Lanka would declare bankruptcy and start negotiating better terms with the creditors. The International Monetary Fund will have to step in and provide some kind of financial aid. I'm no fan of the IMF and I don't think that they can help the poor countries getting out of their debt problems and poverty, but I guess that Sri Lanka doesn't have many options in the current situation.",

Of course, a country that only hopes to profit from tourism will always be subject to various external influences taking place in the world. The coronavirus pandemic has knocked down almost all countries economically. Perhaps, problems that arose from the war that Russia unleashed by attacking Ukraine in the center of Europe were added here.I like that the people themselves can forcibly remove their corrupt government. We see that if this was possible in Russia, then such consequences from the current war, which will certainly be there in the near future, might not have happened.But in any case, Sri Lanka needs to develop its economy, and above all, production, so that profits to the treasury are sustainable. We need to reorient ourselves to the necessary production, this is the basis for everything. The current consumer attitude to life will never give a high level of this life, otherwise this country will always remain poor.",
