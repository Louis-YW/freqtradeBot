  "content": "According to Simple Wiki; Libertarianism is a kind of politics that says the government should have less control over people's lives. It depends on the idea of maximum liberty. Libertarians believe that it is usually better to give people more free choices. The top advocates of this kind of government are cryptoanarchist  since 1988 after the manifesto was released by Timothy C. May the idea of Bitcoin was born. The goals of Crypto anarchists include all; with the help of Bitcoin, we utilize today Two persons said Tim; may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. However, years have passed, today it's happening through the help of Bitcoin, what he said in the next lines of this Manifesto; \"These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation. \" became a threat to the Government and they are working strides ahead to stop Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin cannot get terminated without tampering with the laws of physics and mathematics, it's almost impossible to stop this Libertarian Government from taking over the political world. Why is a major part of the world population not on this train - are they not interested in this freedom?I asked myself this question and the answers to it are in the last paragraph of the manifesto regarding the use of the network to execute illicit businesses, crime, tax evasion, etc as tools the State will use to halt this movement. In my opinion, these things exist in the real world and may not help to stop people from jumping on this train. Another famous reason why; is the volatile nature of the currency, which, still, is not enough to stop users as citizens lose money daily with fiat. I'd say that a plethora of people are not familiar with tech and working on crypto networks, hence won't jump on what is not clear to them. However, the vision is here and clear. A long journey is ahead, as we'll have to build a world where everybody, not some, will be able to understand Bitcoin and its currency.Â  25 years ago, Adam Back mentioned The only available option left for the Government in his response to Cryptoanachy and Libertarian Government. He said that if the movement gets tough and the sitting Government feels threatened, they may switch Off the Internet. And demand a GAK (Government Access to Key) before switching it back on - it's a possible action that seems impossible and depends on the pressure this movement effect on the Government He added; that the Internet can be turned off - through the disconnection of key backbones and ISPs for a while. In a nutshell, we need to vote a libertarian Government candidate into power to achieve this goal completely - Adam back. With this idea, it'll be easier to convince people to hop into the crypto network, where they can trade freely without paying taxes. Share your thoughts.",

They quite well understand that if they accept cryptos, that will reduce the dependency on the state controlled fiat which will in turn reduce the power of the government. That's why they are resisting big time. Some democratic governments are surely appreciating cryptos but majority are still skeptical. Libertarianism is non existent at this moment. It is just a concept that no one follows to be honest.",

Much of my outlooks in life are probably associated with socialism, and obviously Wales has quite the history with socialist beliefs, with the National Health Service. However, I'm quite quick to accept that it doesn't work in every single situation, so much like Bitcoin it's not for everyone or every single situation you can think of. Decentralisation only works in certain areas. If you implemented it everywhere it just wouldn't make sense. Same as a Libertarian Government likely wouldn't work great on it's own. I think extracting key beliefs from each, and implementing them based on the situation is much more effective. For example, a decentralised currency such as Bitcoin makes sense. However, even Bitcoin is subject to more centralisation in certain areas. For example, mining.",

It may work for small groups of homogenous people, but I don't see it working for large groups of heterogenous people.In the case of money, I do think decentralization is a great way for the masses to regain some of their power against governments, but Bitcoin's value is still too unstable right now.Most people don't have a lot of money. Why would they put their hard-earned money in a currency that can lose 50% of its value within a week? Why would they wait months, if not years, for Bitcoin to regain its lost value?",

After 10,000 signatures, petitions get a response from the government. After 100,000 signatures, petitions are considered for debate in Parliament.\"so all this libertarian street protects for 1m people.. do nothing and have done nothing.im all for less laws less regulations and also efficient use of treasury money to go to help the citizens. not business/other country profits/invasionsbut americans version of \"libertarianism\" which is just to make people stay asleep, dream and follow dreams without waking up.. well no not gonna happen and people need to wake up",

Quite a lot of people as well only have a very minimal amount of funds, without any savings or extra money, these set of people wouldn't ever see Bitcoin as a currency or even an asset, they just want to do their small jobs, earn a small living and have meals to eat.Having said that, let the people who have lesser problems in life to enable them want freedom and control of their finances use the Bitcoin currency and hodl it for the long period, over time the numbers have been growing and it will continue to do so, we must understand that in as much as Bitcoin is a fascinating network, not everyone can 'afford' to use or care about it.",

A fiscal conservative would believe in pro-market capitalism, so if perhaps a competitive environment between all currencies instead of propelling government backed fiat. Would libertarians support regulating the crypto industry for under the guise of consumer protections? Does being pro-liberty mean being anti-corporation for the sake of consumer liberty? I'm not sure.Regardless, conservative parties all over the world already have reasonable footing in most countries. It's easier to get them to adopt a pro-crypto platform than it would be for liberals. Getting libertarians into power is a hassle and just fragment the vote ensuring the liberal majorities get power.
