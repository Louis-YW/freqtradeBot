I saw the roadmap stalled in May 2021.They may have stalled their roadmap from the ANN thread in May 2021 but when you take a look at their blog - https://blog.bitkeep.com/en/, they have active news and updates. But yes, where can we see the updated roadmap for this project? I didn't know that this wallet has been used extensively around the globe, it means, they are doing something right. If you have full control with your coins, then, that's very nice. But what will happen if the bitkeep server is down? Will it affect the wallet itself? Can you still access your wallet?",
