  "content": "I learned about bitcoin from my friend, he trades, I knew about it for a long time, but it did not attract my attention. Somehow we talked with him on this topic and he told me what bitcoin is, I was very interested in it, he also told me that there are many different altcoins. Before that, I had only heard about bitcoin and possibly ether, but I had no idea that there were so many different altcoins.He explained to me how to register on the exchange, how to buy and sell, everything was clear and I started trading a little, at first my friend helped me, then I started doing it myself. I always kept all my coins on the exchange.Once my uncle came to visit us, and I accidentally saw that he was looking at the charts on his smartphone, I asked him and it turned out that he was also involved in cryptocurrencies. We talked a bit about cryptocurrencies that evening, I was excited that my uncle also buys bitcoin, because before that I had doubts whether it was good to buy cryptocurrencies, because I know that my father does not take it seriously.It was from my uncle that I learned not to store coins on the exchange, and later my uncle gave me a ledger, it was the coolest present for my birthday. It was thanks to him that I learned that you need hold coins correctly, safety is above all, and that Bitcoin should be the main investment.A little later when I was looking for more information about bitcoin and accidentally found this forum, by the way my uncle and my friend heard about this forum but they are not registered here. And I liked how everything is arranged here, there is a lot of information here and there is a large cryptocurrency community here. There are also ranks, you can grow, it's like a game where you need to reach levels.Now I store my bitcoins only on a hardware wallet and after reading a lot of topics, I realized that this is one of the most reliable ways. So far, my investment is not as big as I would like it to be, but I am still young, I have a lot of time and I am inspired, because I see great opportunities in this, I can buy bitcoin in small parts, and this will be my investment in the future.I recently read a thread where investing in bitcoin is compared to a young tree that takes a few years to start fruiting, this is a very good comparison, I will project it on my investments and hope that everything works out.I hope this will be useful for those who still store bitcoins on the exchange, you should think about security and hold your coins on hardware wallets.",

Though few members of my family are into crypto as well, they started to believe during the peak of Axie unfortunately they easily get discourage by the bear market and that's why they are inactive right now. Its good to have friends in crypto, at least they can update you when you are busy and have a good signal as well.",

Either way you should try to learn more through the forum. There are many scams and you should learn a lot about them so that you don't lose your coins through something like that.But now to your question...From my family there are three other people who have also invested in bitcoin and who have not looked back. Also some of my friends. I taught all these people what bitcoin is and how important it is. None of them have ever regretted buying bitcoins. The only thing you regret is not investing more money in it when bitcoin was really cheap.",

All security methods have their pluses and minuses, as long as you know what you are doing. HW is not always recommended in some cases, especially in harsh environmental situations, or if you are bad at storing small goods.For example, your uncle recommends HW because he lives in his own house, but it's not very suitable if you live with friends and in a boarding house because it's impossible to have a secret private space.",

Many use it as an excuse that they only have a small investment that's why they don't have to buy a hardware wallet and keeping their Bitcoin in an exchange is enough. You're uncle is a great help.",

I think the get-rich-quick syndrome in our society is responsible for their low interest. Most people are attracted to investments that will them 100% interest in a few days. Poverty might be another reason why some of them are not picking interest. The harsh economic conditions have made people focus on surviving more than investing. But I am thankful that one of my friends is a bitcoin hodler and both of us keep information on bitcoin. The current increase in the price of bitcoin has made him happy and he now believes that the price can still get back to its former all time high price in the future.",

But I'm not like you, I don't want to teach others about bitcoin investing, even if they come to me independently. Because I believe they are not like me, willing to accept losses to learn lessons and experiences in the market, what they want is to make money like me, but they are not willing to take losses as I did. In investing, no one can win the first time, to succeed, you need to fail first. So I can only suggest they do their own research from youtube and social networks, I don't want to be blamed.",

So if you store your coins there, then definitely you are inviting lots of trouble to yourselves. The exchanges don’t give complete access to your coins. Whenever they want, they can block your coins without any prior information. So yes, only use the exchanges when you are making an instant trade or withdrawal. Moreover, now a days it doesn’t care how reputable an exchange is; I hope you guys didn’t forget about the FTX incident. Instead, hold your coins in cold storage or an offline wallet.",
