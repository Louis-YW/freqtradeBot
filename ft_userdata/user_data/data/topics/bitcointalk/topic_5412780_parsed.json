  "content": "Rejection, failure and disappointment bring great success if this doesn't stop you from pursing your dreams. Most people fail to accomplish their dreams because they were rejected in the early stage. Then they believe they have failed and later call themselves \"a failure\". Some have great ideas that could make them rich but loose this great ideas because they are fear of being a failure. They later blame themselves when they later see people making it from such ideas. Let's consider this 5 people who lived through failure before going on to become names known around the world:1. Milton HersheyMilton Hershey worked for a local candy factory but later decided to go out on his own. He failed miserably for sometimes. He later returned to the family farm and perfected the art of making delicious milk-chocolate candy, which we enjoy in the form of Hershey chocolate today.2. Theodor GieselTheodor Giesel struggled to write a novel that publishing companies would call something other than \"pure rubbish\" several times (27 to be exact). He never quit untill his dream was achieved. One fateful night, he ran into an old friend who had recently taken over as a children's literature editor. The friend agreed to publish Giesel's work. Better known today as Dr. Seuss, Giesel was never again called a failure after his first book struck it big.3. Michael JordanAs a kid, Jordan loved basketball and knew he wanted to make a career out of it. No coach would give him a chance because he was short. Through an inside connection, he got into a basketball camp from which players for college teams were chosen. He was noticed by a coach -- who still chose not to invite him to the team. Jordan returned home discouraged, but decided to prove the coach wrong. Now a member of the NBA Hall of Fame, just about everyone would agree he succeeded.Jordan famously said:“I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot, and I missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”4. Oprah WinfreyTo many, losing a child is worse than losing a business. Oprah lived through this hellish reality after giving birth at 14. She managed not only to overcome this, but also being repeatedly molested by her cousin, uncle and a family friend. Despite her tragic past, she has worked hard to become successful, amass a net worth of $2.9 billion and also made history in the world as the richest African-American of the 20th century as well as the greatest black philanthropist in U.S. history.5. Walt DisneyWalt Disney began his career by being fired by a newspaper for not being creative enough. Later, his Mickey Mouse cartoons were rejected because they were deemed to be \"too scary for women.\" If that wasn't enough, \"The Three Little Pigs\" was also turned down because it only had four characters. Thankfully, we have the Disney company today because he chose not to listen to any of his critics and press forward towards his dreams.Disney’s take on failure:“I think it’s important to have a good hard failure when you’re young… Because it makes you kind of aware of what can happen to you. Because of it I’ve never had any fear in my whole life when we’ve been near collapse and all of that. I’ve never been afraid.”Reference: https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/10-people-who-became-wildly-successful-after-facing/249961CONCLUSIONDon't ever be weigh down by rejection, failure and disappointment. This should be a fuel to power your dream. If you want to succeed, don’t be afraid to fail. The more times you fail, the closer you’re getting to success. Life is full of ups and downs, so must good things doesn't come easy. No matter how good we are, we may still fail at one point or another. The important thing is to learn how to overcome failure and to keep pushing forward towards our dreams.",

      "body": "I agree that stubbornness can be a more valuable survival trait than knowledge intelligence. Persistence can be more valuable in business. More vital to success than having a clever idea, innovation or invention.The universe grants wishes. If a person is determined to succeed at something, they usually will find a way to make it a reality. I think colonel sanders of kentucky fried chicken fame also suffered many rejections before he found success. There are many celebrities and businessmen who have these types of inspirational stories of overcoming significant obstacles and odds. Who were successful on them refusing to give up and admit defeat.While success, money and fame may not be for everyone. There is certainly a good landslide of evidence which suggests anyone from any walk of life can enjoy those things. If they're willing to pay a high enough price to acquire them.",

      "body": "Achievement is in its name, the survival of a worthy idea. An idea that had troubled one's mind for a long time and would not cease to rest, can cause one to feel the pressure of either seeking a solution to escape the restless thoughts or seeking action to follow through on the impulse. These stories of personalities who through rejection, failure and disappointment rose to achieve a long-standing ideal abound in their dozens and just like the persistence or obstinate rigor that is clinical to achieving excellence, they were stubborn. Having nothing else to lose at the moment in a situation or pursuit where one is thought to have failed woefully can be a decider or the only motivation one needs to attain feats of greatness. Never give up they say, never ever give up!",

      "body": "That's why we like Rocky or Karate Kid movies. Not because they win in the end, but because when they get knocked down they get up, and if they get knocked down again they get up again, until they win or die trying. In the case of the movies, obviously, since what sells is a happy ending, they end up winning.But they are good lessons to apply to one's own life. In these cases of rejections or failures, the people mentioned must have been emotionally affected. But they didn't let those emotions overcome them and what they did was to get up again to keep fighting (following the metaphor above).",

      "body": "Don't give up. Those are the words of someone who wants to achieve his dream, and keeps moving forward regardless of the harsh criticism from others. In my opinion, when pursuing a dream, there will always be failures in his life. But from that failure one can also succeed. Negative criticism from others, sometimes makes someone give up, and disappointed with his own work. It makes him want to stop his work, but if we ignore the harsh criticism from others, to keep going and never back down. Surely we will get satisfactory results. Other people's criticism, don't make it a negative influence, but make it something positive. Criticism of others, makes someone motivated to continue to reach their dreams. Without the criticism of others, we will not necessarily move forward. And we will always think, that we are the best, while there are people who are much better than us.",

We need to step back once in a while, see the bigger picture, be conscious of other options. Yes, failure is always a part of success. Yes, failure teaches us something. Failures make us strong. But it also reminds us. Failures sometimes awaken us from our stupor, from our wrong persistence on something. Sometimes, failure makes us realize things. It brings us back to reality. Stubborn persistence is also fatal. There must be a lot of people losing in trade and in shitcoins but it takes a series of painful failures for them to realize they just need to focus on Bitcoin.",

If stubbornness doesn't make a person suffer from hunger and poverty, he will keep on going. Some people who pursue being an artist like painter/musician failed a lot and if they are on thier own not have anything to eat in pursuing the career they are passionate about, they'd end up working in a fast food or in a construction site. Just the reality. Surviving is just more important.Soon the traders hoping a shitcoin will make it will realize also it's not working.",

Grit is a factor that brings about a lot of options or other factors needed to grab that success, but it also needs someone to be able to accurately judge opportunities to be taken. And, a lot of luck as well imo. No matter how much grit or hard work one does, luck would ultimately still be a huge help down the road. Failure also doesn't mean that you just did something wrong and need to try again, maybe you need to take it in a different perspective and take a different path which can still lead you ultimately to the same goal.",

      "body": "This will certainly inspire many people that fail to achieve our main goals and actually opens up space to create new goals that are much more achievable for us. One failure opens 2000 paths because as long as we can still do something, there is still a lot of potential out there in unexpected ways. Stubbornness and temperament can be a factor that brings us closer to the goal. Stubbornness is not always bad if we can control it. The characters above have not only failed, but have been at a saturation point, but they are able to motivate themselves. Whereas people who still claim to be failures do not really see the wide open road from a different angle.",
