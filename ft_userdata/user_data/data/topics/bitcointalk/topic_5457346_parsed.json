If there's something this forum is known for it is not making any changes to how it operates and relying on the status quo of operations. You would have no issues fitting into the forum again if you've remained active with Bitcoin discussions in general.",

Just kidding).Welcome back to this platform, and let me tell nostalgia will hit you like something has changed so that's what you are suffering right now you need a doctor, or maybe you can spend some time and get familiar with the boards, new moderators, new members, new hype, new adoption, new developments in BTC blockchain etc. etc. to break your nostalgia.",

I need to find my way here to fit in again.Why did you come back with new account, what happened to your old bitcointalk account? What do you want to learn now that you are here again, can we expect to see you active here for about 2 years or you'll vanish again as you did before? Not trying to sound rude but to know if truly you've come to learn more here. Secondly, what have learnt so far before you left, what do you want to learn now you here, what challenges you encounter in the ecocrypto, can you solve them now or you still get more to learn. It's better you know your stand and be straightforward to studying crypto and Blockchain technology at large.",

I've been on the forum  for almost a year now and I haven't  ry noticed any significant changes so far and it seems the forum doesn't really make any reasonable changes to its mode of operations and I'm sure the forum wouldn't be any difficult for you since you've been once very active on the forum.

The forum hasn't changed much except for the creation of a Nigeria local board and the addition of the notation OP to the starter of a thread.Can't say I wasn't disappointed when I saw on your profile that the account was created only today and your 2 days activity showed that, the account haven't been around very much or active too.I wonder,What happened go your active account? Why aren't you using those?",

If I may ask did you by any means had any issues in the past that discouraged you from continuing here as a member? Or you lost access to your account? If you truly lost access you could be able to retrieve it back or possibly a change of hands because I was wondering if you have been here for this long based on what you posted here you should know your real account to access it mate.Sorry for me being too inquisitive.

I need to find my way here to fit in again.Welcome back! The reason for abandoning your former account is important. This is to ensure that you are not breaking the rules of the forum. But I guess you are aware of these rules because you have already spent four years in the forum. It will be good if you go through the forum and get more knowledge about new developments in the forum. There is also a need to read about the Bitcoin space and some recent development. I am sure some of your former mates or friends in the forum are still around and you will also find some new friends. There are also some new rules like the forum don't accept the use of artificial Intelligence to write post. The use of bots for post writing is highly prohibited just like plagiarism. I guess you know other rules even more than me. Not to worry in a few days you will be familiar with the forum again.",

Because you last saw this forum at 2020 when merit system is already implemented.Many newbies have joined this forum and many newbies got higher ranks and that are the changes. And the another change is that you maybe lost your account access or been restricted so you are now starting from the beginning. If would be better if you make points about the changes and share with us.If you are talking about crypto industry then some changes happened like NFT launched, many new concept launch like MoveToEarn , Launched some new Blockchain etc.",

What's important is that you're back so be active again. But even if you've been inactive for a long time, did you manage to accumulate and sold some during the 2021 bull run? And if yes, that's good and we're approaching another bull run anytime soon but most likely after the halving next year.If not, then learn from your experience and don't let this pass and accumulate while you can still right now before these prices inflates before and after the halving.",
