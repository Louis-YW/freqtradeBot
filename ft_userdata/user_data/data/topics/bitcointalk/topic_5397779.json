  "content": "Some people say, NFT is a big hype but we should be looking really closely to what most NFT's really are: useless and prone to loss. NFT were launched as digital art to give up for sale and it got famous very fast because of hype. But as every hype, a justification needs to be searched and if NFT is really valuable to be bought for a high price. But in reality, NFT has a huge risk: Everyone needs to know about NFT: NFT's are completely illiquid. Each NFT needs a single buyer who decides to buy it and it will be really, really hard for you, to find someone willing to buy your single NFT.Someone needs to see your NFT on Open Sea and pay your price. A NFT is not like a coin or a token, where much liquidity is around because a coin or a token has many units to be requested by buyers. On exchanges, it is quite easily to sell your coins because liquidity is around. But no liquidity is around for a NFT. Your NFT needs a single buyer. So many people are willing to buy BTC or a different coin, but how about YOUR single NFT? Not so much! It is very unlikely to get a buyer for your single NFT because wise people will know how hard it will be to sell it again. So almost nobody wants to buy a NFT. Some NFT are already dyed out and a statistic recently has shown a 90% loss of price for a wide range of NFT. NFT is only interesting, when it's newly launched and it is hyped. But for re-selling, used NFT's are quite unpopular and likely to make a big loss. NFT is just illiquid and prone for a big loss.",

The main long term focal points of NFTs will be sentimental value, rarity and historical value. For NFTs to be next level investments requires a successful attempt to embue them with intrinsic value and real world utility. Similar to the intrinsic value gold, silver and precious metals enjoy.The NFT market currently carries a decent potential to become a bubble. Jack Dorsey and others \"selling\" NFTs for values near rivaling the pricetag of the Mona Lisa painting was far too ambitious an overreach IMO. They should have aimed lower to create a more sustainable and realistic NFT market.",

With NFTs, which are digital art, the same thing, most of them are very illiquid, and on the way to the bear market, as 99% of them are going to lose value or go to 0.Quote from: Jawhead999 on May 10, 2022, 02:40:24 AMI'd say in short NFT is scam.Why should someone need to pay ridiculous amount to obtain an art while you can actually download it for free lol.

There have been platforms to buy and sell images for decades already so it is a totally redundant idea to work in a Blockchain. We only have to see from the very first tweet being \"sold\" and losing 99.9% of its value after a recent sale fell through. The whole idea was absurb and just goes to show that some people have more money than sense.",

If a certain NFT project is being honest about their project without making false promises and such, how can it be a scam? There sure are a lot of delusional buyers, but let's not forget that a lot of them are totally aware that they're just purchasing a digital signature of a jpeg.utterly bad investment != scam",

The buyer itself will only buy your NFT when they have feel with your NFT unlike token that can be bought as store of value or investment. NFT is not even worth to be owned. In this case i talked about the NFT art. Nft game asset may be the same but it's quite different caused by it has use case to be used as something like play to earn. NFT art has no utility and so this is a big bet for that, I think that when you are owning the NFT art other thant he most popular NFT art in the open sea and this will always be useless art.",

Can't agree more! Whoever talks about the sentiment value, I want to ask them, how on earth a pic of a stupid ape sells for millions while real piece of arts are failing. Does that prove that the apes were our ancestors? I can show at least 10 great pieces of art that got no buyer while stupic images of apes are getting sold for millions. That makes no sense! NFT can only work when there is a celebrity endorsement. That creates an aspirational value. It's just a great way for celebrities to make more money, it's not meant for commoners like us! Pretty useless thing!",
