  "content": "I have a habit of browsing for stupid crypto-related stuff on the internet, and I happened to be on craigslist and did a search for bitcoin.  This is one of the results that came up, from a guy apparently buying large amounts of BTC at 12.5% above market price.  Oh, and:QuoteI have an ID verified LBC/paxful account and I’m a pro trader. Unfortunately, they are closed now.Lol.  But this was the image he used in his ad:This is not the Electrum wallet we're all discussing in this section of the forum, right?  Admittedly I haven't kept up with any new developments but I probably would have heard about it if a software wallet managed to crack the problem of trust and the need for an escrow agent when two people transact bitcoin.  And that link is obviously not to Electrum's website; there's no way I'm visiting it without knowing what it is.Anyone see something like this before?Edit: Not sure if it's appropriate to keep that phone number in there, but it was made public in the craigslist ad.  Don't want anyone to crank call this....guy.  Or spam him or enter that phone number on various websites that require phone numbers.  Know what I mean?",

This guy is not buying anything from anyone. Offering 12.5% above the market price already says everything is what it is. I did not visit the URL, but I am pretty sure this is a phishing or malware version of Electrum Wallet. The only thing he doing is asking the parties to download the software and put their seed phrases in it so they can use so-called escrow or whatever he says. This is an attempt to steal money from the parties. I feel like you can move it to the scam accusation board since it's an obvious scam.

I don't think a scammer will share his original phone number if he is not dumb enough. Judging from his well-organized attempt, he is too smart not to use the original phone number.",
