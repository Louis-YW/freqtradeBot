  "content": "I am as screwed as everyone else but as I come to terms with the bear market and my losses I am thinking of going back to day trading. I have been learning pine script and testing out stuffI have two strategies that show promise when backtesting but need to test them on live trades. One is pure scalping the other is longer trades I am trying to find a way to take my pine script and automate testing of the strategy with a paper trading account. I need to test both long and shorts and have multi take proffit pointsI have a trading view and binance futures account.I know trading view dont offer this but is there any 3rd party site that does. I found a couple of sites that might do it but dont know how trust worthy or good they are https://tradingbot-solutions.com/https://algoji.com/I dont want to go through KYC for any new company but dont mind paying for the serviceDoes anyone know of a way to do this at all ThanksKeith",

      "body": "OKLooking at this I found 3commas does do it with a paid account However I do not know how many features or how easy it is the attach a full pine script to the systemI say a tutorail online but it was just a long strategy involving a simple entry and exit alertI dont know how well that will work with more complex scripts like long and shorts in same scripttrailing or stepped stop losses or even leverage trading. Is it possible to use such a script with aÂ  bot in paper trading",

      "body": "I do not know exactly what is pine script but based on Google it is a programming language made by TradingView so the script only can be used on TradingView. Why not try other bots like Zenbot since you have two strategies that you want to try live I think Zenbot has backtesting. Check their Github here https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbotThen use the search button under that repo. To find the guide about backtesting.",
