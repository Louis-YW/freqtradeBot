  "content": "On the day El Salvador's government formally recognized Bitcoin as legal payment, I know some of you here have heard that McDonald's stores there started accepting BTC. Aside from El Savador, which takes Bitcoin as payment in McDonald's, McDonald's now accepts USDT and BTC on the Lightning network in Lugano, Switzerland.You can watch it here : https://youtu.be/tcpVKu8dEfIWhat are your thoughts on this?Source: https://hardbacon.ca/en/cryptocurrency/why-is-mcdonalds-accepting-bitcoin-a-financial-revolution/",

This already happened in February this year and hopefully it was a successful trial experience for McDonald's. I also read that the whole municipality of Lugano wants to move more into the crypto world and will try to accept Bitcoins in everydays transaction. Lugano is a very touristic city that attracts many visitors in the summer and in the winter. If you can start using bitcoins in every store on your vacation that would be an awesome experience. So far I didn't read about other McDonald restaurants to also accept Bitcoins in Switzerland. It would be great if you could play in every McDonald's restaurant with Bitcoins. And once they made the first step, BurgerKing and KFC can't be far behind and do the same thing.",

And since McDonald's is one of the popular fast food chains across the globe, this will be a good adoption when it comes btc payment. People will also appreciate it as LN has very very cheap fees. Educating people on how to transact with LN will be the bottleneck at first. But later on, once those staffs are knowledgeable enough, they can easily teach their customers how to utilize this payment to their advantage.",

Without any doubt,  the number of btc holders is much higher than those who spend it on items. People are more interested in keeping btc as asset for a higher price.This is a big challenge for the btc community, because even the btc pioneers also are guilty of this, they buy and hold for price to increase only. Acceptance will increase when their are more people spending btc than just being a holder.",

If one of the fast food companies has accepted bitcoin or usdt, of course it will be very easy for us to transact, without us having to carry a money wallet, just a crypto wallet on our smartphone is enough to make the payment.We've heard of many adoptions in the past so I hope this 2022 is really a materialization of all those news. In the past, it was Burger king that was also being announced. It's the buying using BTC however might not be that open to using BTC to buy. Mcdonald's needs to make its implementation on LN to encourage Bitcoiners.",

People said so much bad stuff about LN and here it is, getting accepted by a major fast food franchise. Accepting USDT however makes no sense really. I don't know what were they thinking with this. I'd rather use my credit card instead of using USDT.",

Fast food isn't the kind of product I'd buy with bitcoin (especially McDonalds that's really trash), as I can still order and pay with cash, but once that's gone, I'm sure I'll pay for a Big Mac with Coke via Tor.  Quote from: Lucius on October 04, 2022, 02:36:45 PMNow we need to see if someone will really be interested in paying with BTC, because otherwise it won't be the first time that something pompous is announced, and then disappears in silence as if it never existed.Very few will pay with BTC, no doubt. What's the benefit of accepting it other than the customer's attraction, though? It costs nothing to have an additional payment option.",

I don't really care about their intention for adopting bitcoin but I am delighted that bitcoin is receiving more publicity. What baffles me is that regardless of the challenges bitcoin is experiencing in recent times, more businesses are still adopting it as a medium of payment. If more businesses adopt it, some customers might start choosing the bitcoin option of payment because of its uniqueness and privacy.",

The fact that one of the largest fast food chain accepts BTC as a form of payment is big. I hope that this kind of implementation would spread across countries, subject to the confirmation of the countries' government.The more people discover about BTC, the more people that would use it, thereby making it more beneficial in the long-run.1 https://www.marketingweek.com/mcdonalds-bigger-than-jesus-christ/",
