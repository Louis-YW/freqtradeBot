It offers open source and secure and anonymous transactions using state-of-the-art ZKSnarks technology.Unlike some other mixers on the market, CleanMixer.app takes a proactive approach to ensure that it is operating within the legal framework by allowing law enforcers to ban certain wallets by paying a fee.

      "body": "Thank you for the feedback NFTmetria , I will try fix that bug by Feb 14th and only allow access to wallet once user clicks the button. I'll probably use wallet connect to allow user to connect any wallet they want.Also Goerli testnet is available so they can use that testnet to see if the mixer is working for free.Also try a small amount first on Polygon Network for little as $0.01 USD amount of Matic . We focus on small amounts so there will be no money laundry or illegal activities on the mixer. Our focus is LEGAL privacy only . And we fully cooperate with law-enforcement if there is a Warrant by a judge. First 1000 Wallets that deposit will receive Airdrops in the near future.

      "body": "We just fixed the BUG! Sorry for late updates, it is really hard to run a hobby project with a full time dev job in at a tech company.We fixed the bug for wallet automatically asking for metamask permission. Now we are only connecting wallet when clicking the \"connect wallet\" button and added a new feature to use wallet connect instead as well.Please check our twitter image below: https://twitter.com/cleanmixer_app/status/1629702147888779264/photo/1 Quote from: NFTmetria on February 01, 2023, 01:40:01 AMYour site immediately tries to get permission from the metamask when it loads.
