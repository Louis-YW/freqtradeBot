But you're looking forÂ  a coin that the price will increase like Bitcoin, well you can gamble in newly listed shitcoin and the chance you will get scammed is pretty high too.",

That is false, history teaches you what happened in the past, not what will happen in the future. And although you can show me countless inventions that were overthrown by a competitor, this does not guarantee that this will happen in the future with Bitcoin. At the moment what is happening is that Bitcoin is still number 1 not only in terms of market cap, but also in terms of intrinsic characteristics such as the security of its network, decentralization or the limit to its production. All this while shitcoins continue to emerge, we are already in the tens of thousands, with which most will lose the money they invest and which will disappear in a few years.

I dont think anybody has that knowledge, they would have to be a time-traveller for that to actually happen.There is a narrative in the crypto space that certain coin is a bitcoin killer and hence people should buy it. Point is that such things are only gimmick. Bitcoin can be called fiat-killer - but does that even make sense? No, because fiat is working fine anyway. So if someone tells you that this coin is the bitcoin killer, take that with a large amount of salt. You are most likely being duped.QuoteI want to ask the smart people here.

The other coins which we call altcoins are surviving only because of Bitcoin and they will survive only if Bitcoin continues its dominance. The whole crypto-market is dependent on Bitcoin but Bitcoin isn't dependent on any other coin. If you really want to have a better future that should be free from financial issues then I recommend you to learn about Bitcoin and Invest in it instead of finding another coin.There are even some hard-forks of Bitcoin which are exactly similar to Bitcoin and with additional features but none of those are any where close to Bitcoin. Some of the hard-forks of Bitcoin are Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin gold, the Bitcoin cash increased the block size from 1 MB to 32 MB in order to reduce fees and increase the number of transactions in a block while Bitcoin gold was more targeted to miners and it allowed miners to use GPU's for mining. There are so many other crypto-currencies in the market with way more features than Bitcoin but known of those is even comparable to Bitcoin. I must say again that the whole market is basically surviving due to Bitcoin and no-coin can take the crown from Bitcoin. I recommend you to learn about Bitcoin only and follow a DCA strategy to invest in it.",

Soon we can see some new mixed fiat-crypto digital networks, which will have benefits of both fiat money (ex: high adoption level) and cryptocoins (for ex: ecentralised data processing system), and their drawbacks will be minimized. So, there most probably won't be a new btc \"out of nowhere\".",

As far as I can, there currently exist no better alternative that has been develop without compromising on the high quality standards or ideals Bitcoin is built on. The standards are necessary framework or foundation for building a very secure and safe decentralized cryptocurrency. Any cryptocurrency that bypass the standards to become advanced is guranteed to crumble when the great storm arrives.",

      "body": "Satoshi did a great job and rounded up with a complete project that requires no centralized body. Then he moved ahead, to prove his work, he's nowhere close to managing bitcoin. Yet his project succeeds more than most top tech companies, with a CEO and board of trustees. Even, coins with a CEO suffer huge losses. They will be no bitcoin killer in form of a coin. Maybe a high tech can appear from the blues. Which surprise can't be a coin project. Because the cryptocurrency revolves around bitcoin. And bitcoin has suffered turf days. The government worked against bitcoin, hackers did too, added with rugpull projects stealing huge amount of bitcoin. To waste on flashy lifestyles. These things drew bitcoin backward and delayed the growth speed of bitcoin. Do you have a glimpse of how such a coin would work. Quantum computer posing as a threat to bitcoin, doesn't seem true or possible. Hence, before investing into such a coin, do your research and be sure not to fall for scam. As you'll be getting silly private messages proposing shitcoins. Their white paper would contain series of lies and deceits. Any other idea, other than Satoshi's will be lower in capability and corporations. The bitcoin network collaborates in a well organized form. I'd advise you to read a little more on bitcoin. There you'll understand what Satoshi did with bitcoin. Programmers from the days of Satoshi, understood how simple building bitcoin was, anybody with some c++ or c can cockle bitcoin. But, Satoshi joined different existing materials to his ideas, where bitcoin got birthed. And no programmer can do anything else better than bitcoin. Like Satoshi is an inventor of a simple idea no one would have thought of. And he delivered the job just right. The code is open for anyone to read and test for issues. Miners, core developers and investors follow one consensus rule that governs the network. The only possibility is creating similar to bitcoin coins, Like Vitalik's project; Ethereum. He moved to smart control and is nowhere to match proof of work. People thought ethereum 2.0 will boost the market and outperform bitcoin. Nothing happens. A high number of attackers and unjust miners have tried 51% attack to smack bitcoin. But to no good news. I can go on and on with a litany of the problems bitcoin is passing through.",
