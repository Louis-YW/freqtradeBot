Maybe in my country, I have been to many parts of my country, most women are not gambling.Among we men, people that are not gambling are less than the people that are gambling, although many men are gambling, but those that do not gamble are many too, or slightly difference. I do not know of other regions. Even if some under 18 years are gambling, most children are not gambling. I do not expect children under 12 years to be gambling. Children make up the most population in Africa, although life expectancy in developed continents like America and Europe is higher. Many people are not gambling, but I do not have any statistical evidence for it, I may be wrong. It is just about how I see it from people gambling around me which are many but not more than those that are not gambling.Even let us say men that are gambling to be 60% to 40% to those that are not gambling.Women that are not gambling are moreChildren are not gamblingPeople gambling in gambling restricted countries (like Muslim countries) are also less.",

Hence, the number is enormous as its existence can be traced back to 3000BCE according to the link OP provided. So, it's among the oldest business in the world, with the idealism that things grow as they progress; gambling is meant to be as famous as it is today. Given more years, additional amount of world population will join the online casino gambling. Because it reduces the stress of having to travel around or sleeping in hotels for the purpose of playing casino. Notwithstanding, the recreational benefits of gambling helps us to relax, yet a good amount of world population will never practice gambling, for reasons like; addiction, fraud, deceits and fixed results. These reasons contributed to gambling opposition by most religious leaders. Only a few, hardworking citizens, would love to risk their money in gambling, so, while sports thrives, gambling won't take up a large percentage of people who love watching sports.",

Gambling is as old as man which means it is part of man. Regardless of government restrictions or unfavorable religious beliefs people still devise diverse means of gambling. Poverty and unemployment has also led to the increase in gambling in my location. People now see gambling as a means of getting extra income, while other see it as full time job. I am sure the Middle East might have lesser gamblers compared to other part of the world because of their religious belief. While Western nation or those aligned to them will have more gamblers because of favourable policies. COVID-19 led to a massive increase of online gambling firms and this has made gambling more accessible. This has also contributed to the constant increase in the rate of gamblers. https://earthweb.com/gambling-statistics/",

However, saying that sports make people gamble is not entirely true because many sports lovers stick to the love of watching and not betting. So everyone has to go through a study with an even sample in each country so that we can say most people gamble",

A million people are still way less than 1 billion people at the end of the day. I was also curious to check if majority of world's population really gamble, and that is what I found:Quote18. Worldwide Gambling Statistics Show that 26% of The Entire World Gambles.  When you put that 26% into numbers, that’s 1.6 billion people. Furthermore, 4.2 billion people across the globe gamble at least once per year.GAMBLING STATISTICS 2023: HOW MANY PEOPLE GAMBLE?It means most people in the world have already gambled at least once in their lives. That is a clear signal it's impossible to avoid or forbid this activity, despite several governments' attempts, because it's already part of human's behavior and personality to predict future events and try the luck for material gains or just for recognization as a smart, intelligent person who is able to see ahead than everyone else around.Another interesting statistic is this one:Quote3. 0.7% of Those Surveyed Are Considered Problem Gamblers.  What are problem gamblers? They are people who have the highest potential for loss of control when gambling by continuing to play regardless of the consequences. This same group of online and offline gambling statistics shows that 1.1% of the respondents were categorized as moderate risk for losing control. The lowest risk group came in at 2.4%.Problem gamblers correspond to a very small percentage of the total number. It goes heavily against the most common excuse used by authorities to forbid gambling activity.",

Gaming has gachas in it as the most striking example (that some people refuse to acknowledge that it's gambling, which actually is). And sports is well, the easiest imo since the most basic form of gambling in it is a 50/50 case scenario where one team wins and the other loses. Heck, outside of those things people still often gamble with decision-making, especially in simple yes/no types of decisions. If it was solely based on gambling houses/ sports books, I can't really say that \"most\" would be a correct term, I reckon there's still a larger amount of people who don't actually gamble instead, or at least, don't gamble regularly.",

I agree since the probability of getting a rare item is low it can even reach to a 1%. The good side of having this kind of rare item is that the account can be worth a lot and valuable since it contains a limited item. From my experience, I got an item which is bundle in a store because I think that item would look cool. But it got removed in the store in a few weeks and then you can't even see it appear again on your shop and it already count as an exclusive item. So whenever I use them online people would like to borrow my item since they haven't see it for like months in their shop. However, due to needs of money I decided to sell my account since it have a rare item. People would really like to buy it with the price I want and willing to add more just to have the account that containing a rare item. The sad part is maybe in a next few years it can even value more but I got no choice.",
