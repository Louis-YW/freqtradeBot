The fees on Binance spot trading aren't much high and if someone can trade with a proper trading plan and well developed strategy the %age of earnings are much higher compare to that minimum fee. Spot trading offers many functionalities that the convert function doesn't allow. No good trader will give up on those features.Convert function is only useful if you have small amount of a coin that you want to convert into a stable coin other than that I haven't found any good use case for that function in trading. Even if it doesn't have fees directly, but your conversion will be executed on higher price than the current market price so the exchange can earn their share from the conversion.",

I think it will cost you more than with Sport trading.I only use the Convert feature if I have some leftover coins, tokens from trading and want to convert them all to BNB. With tiny amount of each coin, I don't mind about its conversion rate.",

I checked the price of sport trading now and it was $28044, sam on convert page.See spot trading (left) and convert (right) trading fee for BTCUSDT pair:   Like I said, the price is the same.

Another thing is you can't able to use stop limit options and no chart compared to spot trading.Better check them because if you are a trader you will need those charts and stop limit orders.",

If you try to review your transaction cost and history, you will be able to see it. The convert tool is very convenient when exchanging your small amount of coins for another coin and mainly Binance suggests and advertise that you would convert it to BNB without transaction cost. Spot trading is ideal when you do analysis and have a preconceive price. You can set and demand what price you want to buy and sell. In spot trading, the volatility and liquidity of assets you are going to trade are crucial.",

Look at the image below:That is the limit order for the convert. If you use limit, the order can stay up to 30 days before expiration, although if you use spot trading, no expiration. I think most of you are using the market order of the convert that makes the order to fill immediately.",

I haven't used Binance for a while, so I didn't know that there was a limit order and a time delay. The above explanation is according to OKX with have a simple convert order.I searched for the working mechanism, and quoted the following:https://www.binance.com/en/blog/otc/all-you-need-to-know-about-binance-convert-421499824684904009It seems that it was set up to provide liquidity for those who want to execute a large order, as when you place an order in Spot Trading, the order may not be executed 100% because it may not find sufficient liquidity.Binance Converter is an order to provide liquidity for those who want to execute large orders.The only difference is the ease of executing the order, but in Spot Trading there are more options such as One Cancels the Other Order (OCO).thanks for correcting meQuoteLarge order sizeImagine that someone is placing a large order in the order book, such as 100 BTC to be converted to ETH. Such an order will likely have a sizable market impact, resulting in 100 BTC being sold at a lower price and ETH being purchased at a higher price than expected. With Binance Convert, a fixed execution price is guaranteed, making the execution process more manageable and cost-efficient. Trading large amounts through Binance Convert can also help users achieve VIP-level upgrades.",

If you are a trader then you must know the volatilities of Cryptocurrencies and that's why you will see different prices from time to time. For that many we don't have to that much time to saw our destination price so it will very difficult to get it on convert options on the others hand if we saw the spot trading then we will fund some option to set our sell price to achieve the profit.",

I am using the exchange too and I check their convert page which let me know more about the reason the exchanges provide convert service for their customers. You can check this which is what I found on the convert page of OKX:If you check 'no slippage' and simple conversion.I noticed that it can be a good option for people that do not know much about spot trading but just having little knowledge or almost no knowledge about sport trading which requires more knowledge. With convert, anyone can easily convert from one coin to another. The market price is good and the same as spot trading market price too, but with the benefit of zero trading fee. This is a good option for traders that are trading coins like bitcoin, ether and others that have high trading volume on the exchange.Because I see the simplicity of how to use the convert. I check Binance lite and OKX lite. See what I found:Binance lite at the left while OKX lite at the right side      I press on convert which is the only way to trade on the lite version. The spot trading is only available on the pro version. I think convert is just for people that do not want to learn much or go deeper into how to trade. Even a novice can easily use the convert to exchange from one coin to another. About the convert on OKX, only market order option is available, unlike Binance convert that has both market and limit order option.",

As a result, I understand why individuals prefer to utilize \"Spot\" instead of a zero fee \"Convert\" tool.1. Because Binance doesn't have a feature like \"Spot\" that can be seen immediately. Or they didn't explore in Binance of what's the new features and how to use them.2. Because traders can't afford the current price in the market, and they don't have time to wait for the price to reach their desired price.",

Simply, when traders are converting, they are either switching their coin to another coin and that goes with no charge like I know from binance. You can convert btc to Usdt or any other or the other way and you hodl the new converted coin in there but if you are transferring it out, you get charged fees depending on the charge. Spot trading is different from converting your coin.",
