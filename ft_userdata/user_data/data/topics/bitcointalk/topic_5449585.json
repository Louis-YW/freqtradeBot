Indeed, P2P platform Paxful has returned to activity again, one month after it announced the cessation of its activities in April :Quote from: https://paxful.com/sign-up-transitionWeâ€™re back.After a month away, weâ€™re happy to announce that the Paxful marketplace is back online.As a reminder, the platform was suddenly closed due to a battle for control by the two co-founders. It seems that the problems between them have been resolved, but what happened in terms of stopping operations is not very reassuring, especially with the assumption that this could happen again.In my opinion, the Agoradesk platform is the best alternative to all of these platforms, and it has proven its integrity through honest activity for years, in addition to its presence here on the forum through an official representative who takes care of the official announcement of the platform, in addition to launching a signature campaign that has been operating for months and includes the best trusted members on forum.",
