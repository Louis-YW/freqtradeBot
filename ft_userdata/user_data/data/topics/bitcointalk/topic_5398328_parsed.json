I suggest being more cautious and doing your own research before using or depositing/investing in anything",

What kind of serious business or exchange would use numbers as part of their domain name?Â  Scammers, obviously because such domains are super cheap to buy.It's not their responsibility to tax you, but rather your Government.",

      "body": "Seriously! Where did you find this website and what may make you think it's legit? I just hope you didn't send them your money because it's definitely a scam.Firstly, their domain name doesn't make any sense. Just ask yourself , which serious business would choose such domain name that doesn't have any thing to do with their brand name. Secondly, didn't you notice that there is something strange with the website design (broken layout, images doesn't load...). Also which legit business would use a yahoo email!And most importantly, didn't you see the links to their social media pages! the exchange name is topcexc but the social media links are for another exchange Omgfin (not sure if this one is legit or not though).They cloned Omgfin but they didn't do it properly.",
