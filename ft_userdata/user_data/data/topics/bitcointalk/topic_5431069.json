  "content": "With Copper membership, Newbies can now pay a small fee to enable imagesIt is useful but can admins create another membership, that allows buyers to wear avatars?Avatar is a part of a company brand-kit so if a company has a representative here, I think they have demand to buy Avatar membership to wear it. They don't need to be Full members to wear it. They probably don't need to be able to wear signature for Full member rank.Only avatar is good to represent a company brand. They have bitcoins so why they are not allowed to use their bitcoins ?Quote from: theymos on November 10, 2017, 09:23:30 PMI am aware that for most people the benefits of this membership are pretty lame. This membership is only intended to fill a specific niche; if you don't need it, don't buy it. It is not intended to be the lower-cost Donator/VIP alternative which I've talked about before as a possibility.There is a smaller niche to buy avatar.freebitco.in PR. 1120 activity, can not wear an avatar.tower.bet. 532 activityfutuur. 202 activity.BK8.Official. 149 activity.windice. 365 activity.absolutely-positioned. 173 activity.BC.GAME. 212 activity.",

Representative accounts of Roobet, Rollbit can not wear avatar.They run long campaigns and paid a lot. Why BestChange can wear avatar but Roobet, Rollbit can not? Are they worse or have less contribution than BestChange to forum members?My proposal is not to credit avatar for them free, but with a paid membership if they want.Or they have to wait for generosity and kindness from their employees to award merit and wear avatar.My idea is not to increase scam or spam but for benefit of companies that have contribution for forum, community and they even bring jobs to forum members.Signature campaign: 2013 -2022If no security concern, why not?",
