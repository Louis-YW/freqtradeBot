I have my best formule to Understood this and if you have same mindset you get power and you can be more Independent.The banks the goverments and sovrign currencies and systems are like corporations you can never think of those as something permanent never put your full trust and faith on goverments or any sovering systems the goverments countries can be invaded the leaders changed and Banks can collapse specially difficult times and when a lot of chaos happening there is nobody to give you protection really but only you and If you have your own circle and network of people that's how you protect yourself a lot.So best way to Understood what are the soverign systems eg, countries,regimes, political powers, currencies,banks and other type of sovering structures,they are just the corporations just business enteties. - as business so the banks goverments and other sovering structures can go Under water they can be bankcrupted and yes they can disapere allmost fast as overnight your country is not nation but business corporation formed by small group of people.Your country and goverment not permanent.As we move more to international ways.... Clearly any local powers will be undermined and local banks will be likely taken over by neobanks as we moving towards globalisationBut assets what's not influenced any of soverign powers are bitcoin and gold.",
