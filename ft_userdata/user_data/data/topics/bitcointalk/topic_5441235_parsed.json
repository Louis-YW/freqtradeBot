  "content": "What happened in Lagos Nigeria is very disgusting. Â I left my job and voyaged to Bayelsa Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ to vote for a labor detachment luckily for me, I waited for about 8 hours and I did not vote because there was no ballot box in the Polly unit where I was inferred to vote. I came across a video on social media, today be the day of the election a man stole a ballot box, and this happened in Kogi state https://www.facebook.com/payoGFanpage/videos/476761367854194/?app=fblMy question is where is the security that was sent to protect this ballot box? This shows that the government of my country Nigeria is not doing anything about the insecurity in Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Also in Lagos state, the so-called party A.P.C divulged that nobody should vote for any other PARTY except this APC, why? Because the candidate of this APC was once a Lagos state governor. https://www.facebook.com/payoGFanpage/videos/709981630614702/?app=fblBut all these things that are happening in this country called Nigeria are not good. On the day of the election, everybody with his or her voter's card is supposed to go out and vote, but here in Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ it does the other way around.",

INEC should be scrapped totally because of its involvement in rigging the election, not providing election materials on time, not providing enough security for voters, not making use of the Â BVAS to announce the presidential result, and lastly announcing the presidential winner, should I say a presidential selection of winner at midnight when everyone is at sleep. This coming Saturday will be an election for the Governor of a state and State Assembly. I wonder the kind of irregularities INEC will display again in the election cos they are bound to manipulate results for the highest bidder, not using the BVAS to upload results.",
