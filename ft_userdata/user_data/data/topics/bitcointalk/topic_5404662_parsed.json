Some organizations legitimately use Multi-level marketing to sell a product, it is also different from pyramid scheme because in pyramidal scheme, no real product is sold. In gambling, you can use what you can afford to lose to gamble, mind yourself not to get addicted also.",

I know loads of people who are trying to work in a MLM Company and still making some decent amount. https://www.thebalancesmb.com/the-likelihood-of-mlm-success-1794500 Their revenues are very good as well for some companies and it all depends on which company you want to invest in and how you go about the investments. Some of them are passive as well and who knows ? They are totally different worlds. You need to read a bit about them. One in entertainment and the other one is a weird scheme profiting the rich and the shareholders of the huge companies.",

Cheating new members for their own benefit and so on.I do not quite understand the kind of dirty games in multi-level marketing, can you explain about that. In multi-level marketing, it is not like ponzi or pyramidal scheme which I mentioned above, those hyip, ponzi, pyramidal and other promising high yield return on investment schemes are not the same as multi-level marketing. If comparing multi-level marketing, that means you only just want to compare legit business, normally all business are risky. But if talking about dirty games, that means it should be a ponzi, pyramidal scheme or other hyip, do not get it confused.Quote from: Beparanf on July 01, 2022, 06:03:08 AMBoth will indeed lead to losses, but losses in MLM will not be controlled.
