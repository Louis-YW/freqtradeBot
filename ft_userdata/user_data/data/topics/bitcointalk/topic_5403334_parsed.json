It’s now at around 20,800 USD and it’s still increasing.It’s not yet late to buy the Bitcoins, those have panicked and sold their Bitcoins, now it’s time again to buy it.Don’t know whether it’s the end of the bear market or not, but still the price have given us the Bitcoin traders a great hope.Hope soon Bitcoin recovers it’s price, and we all will end up with great profits.What are your thoughts on this?",

As of the moment, I'm still not convince that the bear market is already over, if it does recover, I believe it will not hold for long. Anyway, let's just enjoy the price volatilty, day trading is the key if we are done accumulating to HODL.",

I haven't seen any confirmation on the analysis chart or on the news circulating, friend.  can you show me the news that I can hold for entry? even though it's only 25% of fiat crypto that I use, I'll try instead of Lumpsum to save takers or makers.you are all right that the price of crypto will not be stuck and slipped on the abyss of bearish. We know that every period there is an increase even though it is very thin.slowly investors will come back down to capture bitcoin with their respective styles.I'm optimistic that bitcoin will come back again, let alone the momentum of the first halving.The bulls will well return to the Ath positions, and beyond a few months ago, to the golds.bitcoin is the world economy. privacy, free, transparent and special.",

After a big decline, the market will usually have a few sessions of modest gains again and investors will believe that the bear market is over and they will start buying again. Then, things didn't work out as they expected and bitcoin fell again after the rallies. However, I believe price is just a price trap, this bull run will not last long and bitcoin will soon fall dramatically.",

It dropped early last week to around $17k and gained some weight towards the weekend probably some investment during the weekend happened to push the price a little high because we are still not off the bear. Currently though still looking bullish and selling at $20,480, maybe it could flatten down to $20,000 or higher than what it is now.",

I really doubt this, most people doesn't really understand what the difference between Bitcoin and shitcoins, all they do is trust random CEO words claiming they're better than Bitcoin with non sense explanation. Moreover they're promise the price will increase x multiples and the APY will reach x price etc, that's make them convinced to invest on shitcoins especially the coins worth less than a dollar. This will make them earn more since if the price reach $1, they could become a millionaire.",

If bitcoin will recover and start to pump, they will surely regret selling their bitcoin at a very cheap price, the thing is, they don't follow the right timing of buying and selling their bitcoin, when the market dump, they should buy instead of selling, that's why some people lose their money because they do the opposite of this simple technique.
