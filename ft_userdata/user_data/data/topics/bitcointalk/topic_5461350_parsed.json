  "content": "I see incredible nonsense in the cryptocurrency market today. For example, according to a news I read today, the total number of cryptocurrencies in the market has exceeded 10000 (1). We know that many of these are shit coins. If Satoshi was among us today or if an AI account was created with his forum posts, what would he tell us about current issues? Sometimes when I read current news, I ask myself what Satoshi would say if he were among us.(1) https://altindex.com/news/new-crypto-coins-on-the-market-in-five-months",
