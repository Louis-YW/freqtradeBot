But yahoo62278 didn't beg! The donations flowed to him voluntarily and that is the big difference. We can trust him and he has often proven that here in the forum. That's why his whole sad story is really believable and nobody has any doubts that it couldn't be true. Because of that nobody asked for proof and yahoo62278 doesn't have to prove anything either. Therefore, he will not have answered you either, as there is no reason for it. His experiences over the past few weeks are bad enough and needn't be made worse by a thread like this.",
