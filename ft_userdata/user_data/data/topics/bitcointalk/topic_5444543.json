  "content": "Hello crypto bros. I made a post couple of days ago talking about the best time to invest in bitcoin and I mention that inflation still looks bad and we shouldn't expect the economy AND bitcoin price to get better anytime soon.Today I want to make an update on the inflation and job reports.The economy added 311k jobs which are way higher than expected. And it's bad for inflation cos we don't see softening in the labor market.This is very important because it's another indicator that inflation is still pretty high and the next time when FED will be considering how high they should rise rates, they will be analyzing this report. It means that probably FED made a mistake and started FED pivot pretty early.What does it mean for bitcoin?I still stand by my words that until inflation won't get better -> FED will keep rising rates -> which will damage the economy and stock market -> bitcoin will suffer too.So I still think that bitcoin will stay below 22k for a pretty long time and the signal that it will change will be much lower inflation and lowering of the interest rates.Just wanted to give you this quick update, stay safe bros.",

If Silicon Valley Bank triggers a Lehman Brothers moment and everything starts to go to shit, they will eventually have no choice but to change monetary policy. There are many interrelated pieces on the board.On bitcoin, it is curious that many of us thought that in principle moments like this would make it go up, but in the end, the price of bitcoin is measured in fiat today, mainly in dollars, and if there are fewer dollars available to invest because of tightening, in the end less goes into bitcoin.",

      "body": "The US economy is no doubt important to gauge what would happen in the financial market as the USD is the dominant currency. However, you should note that the mere 311K gain in the labour force is only with the Non-farm sector and even lower than the previous 504K, but only slightly higher than the expected value by the economists.Despite this, it doesn't have weighable implications on inflation. What to consider more are the values of the Average hourly earnings and the overall unemployment rate that came negative to the US economy, which is a woe to the USD and advantages to the risk-on markets of which Bitcoin is part.And if you want to know the news that is direct inflation gauge, you might want to watch out for the following:1. CPI2. PPI3. PCE4. PMI5. Retail sales",

      "body": "Bitcoin price fluctuates because there is no clear underlying reasons for the price to go up or down. For instance, if a new product is released and people rush to purchase it, the price will go up because more demand for that product exists than supply. If demand for bitcoin falls, it might result in a rise in price as people sell their products at a reduced cost.",

I made a post couple of days ago talking about the best time to invest in bitcoin and I mention that inflation still looks bad and we shouldn't expect the economy AND bitcoin price to get better anytime soon.So why didn't you continue the discussion in that thread? In fact, you are paraphrasing yourself and you haven't written anything new that you haven't already written. Inflation is something that we all feel on our skin, so why keep repeating the same story as if it will make inflation disappear?Quote from: crypticj on March 12, 2023, 05:58:12 AMSo I still think that bitcoin will stay below 22k for a pretty long time and the signal that it will change will be much lower inflation and lowering of the interest rates.Two days ago you were convinced that the price of BTC would even go below $15k, now you claim that it will be below $22k for a long time, and if in a few days the price is higher than $22k, then you will open a new thread and write something like \"I think the price will stay below $24k for a long time...\"Quote from: crypticj on March 10, 2023, 07:34:10 AMI was saying this before and I will say it again: bitcoin will go down and it MIGHT even go lower than 15k.",

The price went up by more than 50% when bitcoin recovered from 15k to 25k. That said, inflation hasn't gone anywhere. So I think a rate hike will not have as much of an impact as it did before. Other than that there is a lot of negativity around crypto, the most recent being the USDC issues.",

I highlight the reason why bitcoin won't go up until the economy will get rid of the existing problems and inflation is one of them (and the big one).How do you explain that you were (so far) completely wrong with your speculations? You claimed yesterday \"I still think that bitcoin will stay below 22k for a pretty long time and the signal that it will change will be much lower inflation and lowering of the interest rates.!\" and three days ago \"I was saying this before and I will say it again: bitcoin will go down and it MIGHT even go lower than 15k.\"Maybe in the future you should be a little more careful about what you write, because even though most people won't understand it as financial advice, you can cause financial loss to some.",

Banks will do what they can to keep deposits in the bank. And they also will be picky who they loan money out too. So it will make growth suffer. Too early too tell.
