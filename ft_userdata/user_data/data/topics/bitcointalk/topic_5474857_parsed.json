Bitcoin isn't an overachiever, in my opinion it's more like it's not meeting people's expectations when it comes to price that it should be right now, some wants it higher while others don't want it to be that way but here we are, bitcoin being branded as an overachiever is a sign of perfection and bitcoin isn't a perfect thing.",

I think what the OP is trying to say is Bitcoin has succeeded faster that was expected.Quote“I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.” Satoshi Nakamoto 2010.It's growth was within expectation. It was something like either it performs exceptionally or catastrophicly.The overachiever I can see it as, is evolving to meet various needs of the community; growing beyond been just a currency or means of payment.Quotebitcoin being branded as an overachiever is a sign of perfection and bitcoin isn't a perfect thing. overachiever doesn't necessarily mean perfection. It means beating expectations. Yes it has its flaws, passed through challenges but its persistence and survival is worth commending. It existing means People still want it and find it useful.",

The irony is that the high value of Bitcoin appeared from the first years and did not wait 20 or 50 years as some companies needed.",

As a Bitcoin investor, always make sure you invest money you can afford to lose and also make sure that the money is not for something else that you must do in few month later, the best money fitted for Bitcoin are money you don't need for a long period of time, and you will still be able to live your life comfortable. A complete man must have savings aside, emergency fund aside and also investment fund aside, use the rest to take responsibility on yourself and your family, and pray that you don't see big problems that is too much for you and your family.",

It's essential to strike a balance between investing and meeting immediate financial needs.Bitcoin is truly a game changer in the world's financial system and it's a valuable asset for investment. So if it's all these why invest only what we can afford to loose? I think that this phrase relegates bitcoin to \" shitcoin\", because something valuable should not be invested with leftovers that we can afford to loose. Instead we should invest certain percentages of our income, just as we budget for our other needs. Except the individual that barely earns enough to meet his basic needs. Because we trust that bitcoin will outlive us, and it'll continue to increase in value to guarantee future profitability. We can invest something tangible.",

This is because fiat currency is depreciating and a time will come that people holding bitcoin will be happy that they kept their funds in bitcoin. The investment side is also something great because as long as you don't use the money for your monthly expenses to buy bitcoin, but only with the money that wouldn't affect your income, you will be able to hodli for up to 10yrs or more and increase your bitcoin portfolio bit by bit.
