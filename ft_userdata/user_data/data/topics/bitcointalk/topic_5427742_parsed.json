However, not only a single transaction will make your transactions becomes anonymous which is my choice IMO in Monero converting.Just sell your Bitcoin to Monero multiple times using different amounts or split your Bitcoin into different transactions with different (x) amounts and buy Monero and when you have Monero, just sell it for Bitcoin.  It might that would be solved the anonymity case, IMO.",

If all those inputs can be traced back to the same entity in the last 5 or 10 parent transactions, then you've achieved absolutely nothing except wasting money on fees.By following that logic, someone can conclude that all LN channels on Taproot addresses are always owned by a single person. Because if you combine deniability and Taproot, then you don't know, how many parties there are. Also note that the same trick can be used on legacy addresses to some extent, because of homomorphic encryption: https://duo.com/labs/tech-notes/2p-ecdsa-explainedSo, how do you know that Tx1 is not a channel opening transaction, Tx2 is not a channel closing transaction, and Tx3 is not owned by someone else, who received coins after swap? Also, for some LN wallets, this is the default, for example when you open a channel in the Phoenix wallet, then after going on-chain, your channel will stay opened, and you will receive completely different coins from a swap.More examples: https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/#c-example",

I can spend an entire UTXO A to create UTXO B, and by the same reasoning nobody can tell if I sent money to a merchant or to myself. Of course nobody can tell that for sure, but privacy isn't about being sure where the money is. It's to be as close to the truth as possible. In my example, you might not know where I've sent the money, but you know that I have either happened to pay someone with the exact amount of the output (which is very rare), or sent them back to myself. You can safely make this assertion, it'll be true. But the moment the money start moving later on, the analysis moves forward with the given input data. Whatever happen to that money later can bring us closer to the answer.",

If I need to do this whole 3-transactions-deal, and do it quickly, it will be more obvious that it's fake.Just as opening and closing a channel immediately, is very unlikely.To OP: I believe all the 3 options have been summarized well already; but I do think that using Lightning is a pretty good fourth alternative to consider. Especially for smaller purchases, if you run a Lightning node, you can basically just spend some sats without worrying about labeling change, mixing it, consolidating it and all this annoying stuff.You can also use Lightning as a mixer; by swapping on-chain funds into a Lightning wallet and from there, send the funds to a fresh address (or preferably, multiple addresses, in smaller chunks).",

Far better to use a proper DEX such as Bisq for this step, just as you do at the end. And you should be running your own node for both Bitcoin and Monero rather than using light wallets depending on someone else's node.A simpler solution all round would be to return your KYCed bitcoin to whichever centralized exchange you bought them from with a KYCed account, sell them, withdraw your fiat, close your account, and then take that fiat over to Bisq and buy completely unrelated non-KYC bitcoin.",
