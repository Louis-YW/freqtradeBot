Not generalizing it, but typically you could determine if a project is a scam based on their presentation ans moreover on your deep research about it. From ground roots like website, team profiles, and etc.You could also see some scams being busted herr if you go to this particular thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0",

I suspect you told him of the “benefits” of the forum, anyone would skeptical of a platform where you get paid to make posts. The forum isn’t scam-proof but the community makes it extremely difficult for scammers to thrive here. Make sure to check the trust ratings of members you’re dealing with on the forum, scammers are very easy to identify their script is always too good to be true. @cryptoaddictchie already gave the link to Scam Accusations I believe you will learn a lot from the threads there.",

It's a forum for discussing majorly about Bitcoin and crypto in general. If your friend wants to avoid scammers of being scammed then they probability shouldn't go anywhere near the altcoin section. They should stick to the Bitcoin discussion section and learn whatever it is that they want to learn.But if he decides that he wants to explore further then he should take note of projects that are offering rewards that are too good to be true and also he or she should try to learn how to research extensively about a project that way they can reduce the risk of them getting involved in a scam project. And they should never trust anyone online no matter what they may say.",

All you need to do is be cautious and avoid being greedy, and study enough so that no one can con you out of something you're supposed to have to know.",

Of course, it can be tough to tell if someone is trying to scam you, especially if you're new to something. But there are some things you can look out for. You can, for example, start by asking yourself some questions: Do you know this person or company well enough to trust them? Do they have a good reputation? Are they asking for information or money that seems unusual or unnecessary? Are they being pushy or trying to pressure you into doing something quickly without giving you time to think? Remember, it's okay to say no if something doesn't feel right. Scammers often rely on people being too naive, afraid or polite to question them, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself!",

The easiest way to spot that a user is a scammer is when they PM you first without your consent or permission. You can rely on the trust rating score here to know whether a user is reputable or not. Always look for a green trust member and read their feedback so that you will have a less chance of being scam. Always use an escrow when dealing with someone.Remember that you will not be scammed if you will not send first your money without having an assurance to secure the item that you are dealing.Trusted Escrow is a must.List of Trusted Escrow: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2439910.0",

Bear in mind that opinions alone are not facts, and some areas are probably thin in objective and versed opinions (i.e. altcoin sections).",

So you raise another question to this forum. It's not wrong for beginners to ask here, but you also need to immediately believe your friend before you prove it yourself to your friend. In this sophisticated era, it is actually very difficult to get to know scammers, because they are also smart enough to hide behind the new products they offer to everyone. But if you are interested in identifying scammers, I think you need to look in the reputation section of this forum.",

Try and find out why he has that mindset about this forum. It can be because of the way you told him the type of money he will make as a member of this forum. And since it is hard to find any other site that allows you make money on it, it is very hard to believe such exists. I do not blame your friend.",
