It's a fairly old tweet, but still pretty useful.In general, @BoldBitcoin is a pretty good activist Bitcoiner, and you should follow their account even if you're not a fan of the service they're offering (which is incase you don't know a line of credit for your Bitcoin - that may give some of you BlockFi vibes but this is not the topic for discussing that).Enjoy!

I always kinda disliked him, he looks insane and always talks about Bitcoin like he talks about God.he hoards bitcoin. but he wants everyone to stop using bitcoin and instead deposit their bitcoin into his custodianed \"factories\" of another network to get \"inbound balance\" of a different unit of measure to be locked into playing with on this other network.. (i would mention the other network by name*(triggering their bots) but the usual 'other network' lemmings usually crawl into the discussion and spout their broken promises of why people should ignore me and instead use their network.if saylor cared about bitcoin he would be sponsoring devs to fix bitcoin exploits. not sponsor the creation of exploits just to annoy bitcoiners in the hopes they shift over to his prefered other network he pretends is bitcoin*it begin with L and is the flashy zap of electric in the sky that causes thunder sounds",
