  "content": "My avatar, Signature Space, and Personal Text Space is available for rentI'm a Hero Rank Member of the forum and I spend almost 3-4 hours on forum on daily basis and sometimes I spend more than 4 hours a day. I actively post in Bitcoin discussion, gambling boards, Meta board, Trading board, and a few posts in other boards. I'm ready to promote all those services that are allowed to be promoted on this forum and I'm also ready to go for long term deals. I have been in L0tt0.com signature campaign for almost 25 weeks but the campaign is currently on pause and that's why I'm looking for good deals.I have been into various signature campaigns and avatar campaigns during this year but for last 25 weeks I was in L0tt0's campaign. I'm a regular poster of this forum and I give proper time to write my posts. I accept Bitcoin, Monero, Lite Coin, and other Stable coins. I have around 2230 posts and I make around 30-80 posts per week. I assure you that your project will get good exposure on my profile because most of my posts are in 1-3 pages of a thread and I try my best to post in first page of the threads when possible. I believe in best quality posts and that's why I give proper time to create my posts and reread most of my posts to fix minor issues if I find some of those.Feel free to send me a private message so we can discuss more.",
