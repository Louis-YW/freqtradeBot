I don't know if you'll like the prices, but don't hesitate to participate! I think I can post the contest on Monday, with or without a signature. Since it's the first one I'm organizing, I'm trying to think about the rules carefully. Have a nice weekend",

      "body": "As someone who recently organized his first event/contest, I congratulate on your initiative as well Becassine (and once again, congrats on 3rd spot in the pie baking contest). As for the graphs and such, let me know if you need any help. You are free to use any of the code listed on my threads[1][2][3], such as the table one or even the one used to display every contest entry. They are, in essence, very basic but they ended up fitting the purpose (I also took inspiration from codes previously made by the community).As for graphics, like I previously shared with you, I sent a PM to jayce who ended up making the contest incredible signature. All other graphics (banners and voting results) were basically made by me and this explains the basic feeling of them I guess . Still, do not let your lack of knowledge block you from making the contest! I am glad that I ended up doing it since I learned a lot and thinking back on it, I would do it again even facing the uncertainty that I had at the time.To make the banners and images I basically used PowerPoint (  ) and for the graphs I used the ones provided by CryptoPad[4]. Let me know if you need any guidance in using either of them![1]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439781.msg61759814#msg61759814[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444932.msg61914564#msg61914564[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446955.msg62006716#msg62006716[4]https://cryptpad.fr/",

Maybe one of them is useful for you?Quote from: Becassine on April 07, 2023, 03:20:55 PMIn one word, I will need help I guess to choose the winners (unless there are not many participants  )For choosing winners there are multiple ways. But each one depends on what kind of contest you intend to run (I need more details here).For example, if you want to run a contest where winners are picked simply by luck, you can use the suggestions made by NeuroticFish and examplens. That site is not necessary though, as you can pick winners by choosing a future Bitcoin block and determine the winner based on last two digits of the block (example: a user chooses number 02 as winner; if in the Bitcoin block chosen before last two numeric digits are \"0\" and \"2\" then the respective user won). The website created by bitmover can be used as well, for the same purpose.If you want to run a contest where winners are chosen by nominations, you have to specify nominating rules (as Rick did with the occasion of pie baking contest). This implies stating which members can make nominations (based on rank, activity etc.); how many nominations can be made by which user; if nominations can be edited; duration of voting etc. You have to think thoroughly about all these rules prior writing them inside the topic of your contest, as editing rules while the contest is running is totally not recommended.So, as you see, choosing winners is made based on the contest type you'll organize. If you need more help, let us know.",

      "body": "Hello,Don't hesitate to give me your opinion, I put the text also in French in case there would be a translation error. QuoteAfter so many years on this forum trying to understand sometimes complicated threads, but explained with so much kindness, I'm super happy to be able to propose a contest : I'm lucky to have a quality sponsor with the swiss company Shiftcrypto which offers two prizes : a bitbox02 (1st prize) and a Steelwallet (2nd prize). Since I'm shamelessly copying some of the rules of the pie contest, I'll add satoshis according to (almost) the same rules. There will be 3 spots for the winners. In addition to the great prizes reserved for the top two thanks to our sponsor, a prize pool of satoshis will reward the top 3. The way the prizes will be distributed is pretty simple - first place will win 50% of the available prize pool, second place will win 30% and third place will win 20%. If I am the only one contributing, the satoshis will go to 3rd place.Everyone is free to contribute to the pot, and if you choose to do so, I kindly ask you to post the amount here in the thread and I will update the table below. At the end of the contest, I'll do the math (with help because I suck at math) and indicate how much should be sent to whom and by which user. Once again, Jayce volunteered to help create the signatures and even refused to let me replace the 3rd prize with a contribution for his work... Our Sponsor and the prizes in details (excluding shipping costs):1st prize: a bitbox of your choice (2 models available). Value 139 euros.2nd prize: a steelwallet. Value : 65 euros.You can check the website of our sponsor here and articles in different languages. Shiftcrypto will take care of the shipping costs for the winners.Who can participate and vote?Full Members (or more) who have acquired a minimum of 10 merits in the last 3 months for their brilliant participation in the forum. Signature of the contest:So this is jayce who so kindly volunteered to make a signature. Feel free to share the contest in the locals. Rules:Shiftcrypto gave me carte blanche to come up with the rules for the contest, which are as follows: the goal of the game is to give the bitcoin rate in Swiss francs on Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22. The bitcoin rate on that day will be the one from Coinmarketcap: since there is a low and a high rate, the participant who gets closest to the high rate will be the winner and the highest decimal place will win. In the event of a tie, the first participant to post its estimate will win.You have until April 30th to vote, until then you can edit your posts, after that it will not be possible anymore.QuoteConcours bitcointalkAprès tant d'années sur ce forum à essayer de comprendre des threads parfois compliqués, mais expliqués avec tant de bienveillance, je suis super contente de pouvoir proposer à mon tour un concours : j'ai la chance d'avoir un sponsor de qualité avec la société suisse Shiftcrypto qui propose deux prix : une bitbox02 (1er prix) et un Steelwallet (2e prix). Comme je copie effrontément une partie des règles du concours de tarte, je vais ajouter des satoshis selon (presque) les mêmes règles. Il y aura 3 places pour les gagnants. En plus des superbes prix réservés aux deux premiers grâce à notre sponsor, une cagnotte de satoshis récompensera les 3 premiers. La façon dont les prix seront distribués est assez simple - la première place gagnera 50% de la cagnotte disponible, la deuxième place gagnera 30% et la troisième place gagnera 20%. Si je suis la seule à contribuer, les satoshis iront à la 3è place.Tout le monde est libre de contribuer au pot, et si vous choisissez de le faire, je vous demande gentiment de poster le montant ici dans le fil de discussion et je mettrai à jour le tableau ci-dessous. À la fin du concours, je ferai les calculs (avec de l'aide parce que je suis nulle en maths) et j'indiquerai combien doit être envoyé à qui et par quel utilisateur. Une fois encore, Jayce a contribué bénévolement à la création des signatures et a même refusé que je remplace le 3e prix par une contribution pour son travail... Notre Sponsor et les prix en détails (hors frais de port):1er prix : une bitbox au choix (2 modèles dispo). Valeur 139 euros.2e prix : un steelwallet. Valeur : 65 euros.Vous pouvez consulter le site de notre sponsor ici et des articles en différentes langues. Shiftcrypto prendra en charge les frais de port pour les gagnants.Qui peut participer et voter ?Les Full Member qui ont acquis un minimum de 10 merits au cours des 3 derniers mois pour leur brillante participation au forum. Et au-delà !Signature du concours :C'est donc jayce qui a si gentiment contribué bénévolement à faire une signature. N'hésitez pas à partager le concours dans les sections locales. Règles :Shiftcrypto m'a donné carte blanche pour imaginer les règles du concours que voici : le but du jeu est de donner le cours du bitcoin en francs suisses le jour du Bitcoin Pizza Day le 22 mai. Le cours du bitcoin retenu ce jour-là sera celui de Coinmarketcap : comme il y a le cours le plus bas et le cours le plus haut, le participant qui se rapprochera du plus haut sera le gagnant et ce sera la décimale la plus haute qui remportera. En cas d'ex-aequo, le premier participant à avoir posté son estimation l'emportera.Vous avez jusqu'au 30 avril pour voter, jusque là vous avez le droit d'éditer vos posts, après ce ne sera plus possible.",
