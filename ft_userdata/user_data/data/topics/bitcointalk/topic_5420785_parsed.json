I told him the example of the present bear market. \"Now if you invest in the price rate of $16k and the bear decline again to $10k or below which was predicted. And you want to use your cash at that time, then you become a loser in the investment. But if the price goes up to $20+ price then you make profit from the investment. Then I told him to go for a long term investment and he accepted the explanation and used $20 to start the investment. He is still  under my coach.",

Don't force him to invest though it's the advice I can pass to you.Long term investment is king in the Bitcoin Space. Self Control of his/ her Bitcoin is also championed in the Space.Good OP",

This is good because you can teach him everything about bitcoin and can also learn about bitcoin together. Yes, maybe it would be better if you teach him about investing in bitcoin because in my opinion, it is much safer than trading because it requires more advanced learning. And don't forget to emphasize to him not to panic if the bitcoin price drops again because it is a very good opportunity to buy more. Hope you both can get great profit in the future.",

This is sad. I really want the crypto world to become free of custodial services.Anyway, teaching your pastor friend about the price doing up and down is simply investment advice. I wouldn't recommend giving investment advise to random strangers. In some countries giving investment advise is illegal. Does your friend have any access to a computer and internet? If the answer is yes, then he could find plenty of information about Bitcoin/crypto.",

Instead, the pastors will tell their stories about what they've done. Certainly, the way he tells his story will attract more people to get into bitcoin; even though the majority of those who attend his sermon will be in their 30s and up, it can overcome their fear of technology. I am hoping that he will continue to invest in it even though it is a bear market and that he will be able to overcome his losses when they occur.",

A person in order to understand about Bitcoins or cryptos, must have to understand the risk factors involved in it. You could have also asked him about previous examples of Bitcoins when Bitcoins went from 10k usd to 40k usd. Nevertheless it’s great that you are educating more people the knowledge and giving them the way to control their money independently. Let’s add more people to this amazing ecosystem.",

Perhpas he has heard about it from someone or from you and just decided to go and invest today. And the timing is just about right, we are in a low $16k'ish. So that is very cheap. And don't get me wrong, I've heard some church personalities have a lot of money from donations and if they are wise enough, then maybe investing in bitcoin is the way to do. Good luck to you and your pastor friend, it's really a win-win situation for us right now. And as you have said, it's better to go long term or at least wait till the next bull run if he plans to sell.",

Giving advice to someone, actually it also has 2 sides, not as simple as many people think. In OP's case, I don't know what he taught his pastor friend but if it was me, I will not rush to advise my friend to invest, I need him to fully understand bitcoin especially the risks he faces.

The fall of the crypto market, which is now taking place, only scares and repels new investors. Therefore, could you ask your friend and let us know what prompted him to take action. For me, this case looks atypical, but in terms of investment, the current moment is one of the best (discount season).I noticed that your friend made the first purchase ($20) with care, which is actually commendable when dealing with a new asset. Most importantly, she took the first step in this direction. Good luck to him.",
