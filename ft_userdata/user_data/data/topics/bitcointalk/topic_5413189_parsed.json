For altcoins, I will advice you to go for open source hard wallet, or if you are able to get a completely open source wallet that is recommended. I noticed people using altcoins may not have option than going for a close source wallet like Trustwallet which support such coins. But not worth going for close source wallet because the wallet source code is not publicly available.",

      "body": "Yes, binance can do whatever they want with your crypto since it's in their custody.I don't want to scare you, as this is unlikely to happen especially for small amounts, but even if you move your USDTs to a non-custodial wallet, there is still a risk that they get frozen since it's a centralized coin (issued by a centralized company, Tether). They did it before and they can do it again if needed.Personally, I only trust bitcoin for long term storage.",

He sends money every month, binance would probably think this is a reoccurring fee from a friend so it would really be unwise for binance to consider the demand to take it back. But they are between you and your friend.Some will reason you they store stablecoin on exchanges because they are waiting for BTC or altcoin prices to dip so they stash some of it. But keeping coins inside a wallet is not recommended.",

About Trust wallet maybe you can trust it a bit because it's open-source you can build it on your own and it's owned by Binance.If I were you if you are planning to hold a big amount of BUSD and USDT I suggest buy a hardware wallet like ledger nano S which has better security than using app like trust wallet.",

Not everyone can properly secure (and backup) their private keys, and you should evaluate if you are able to properly do this or not. If this applies to you, in order for it to make sense for you to keep your coin on binance (or any other exchange), you will need to be compensated in some way for doing so, in an amount that outweighs the risks. Potential compensation may include interest payments, or the ability to quickly trade (when you plan on frequently doing so). It is up to you to decide how much compensation you need in order for this to make sense. It is unclear to me which specific product you are using. It is possible that you are using the [ur=https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-use-binance-chain-wallet]\"Binance Chain wallet\"[/url], and if this is the case, it appears that Binance may have access to your private keys, at least based on the above guide. This is despite the fact that you are given a seed that can be used to recover your private keys. If this is the case, you should consider my above advice.",
