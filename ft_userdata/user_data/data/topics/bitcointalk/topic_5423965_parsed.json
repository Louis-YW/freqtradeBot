  "content": "I searched about PYYPL services all over Bitcointalk but i didn’t find any topic or someone talking about it   Even that it’s been online for quite awhile now. I’m not advertising their services or recommending it to anyone all i want is to talk about what they offer and my personal experience.Their website is : https://www.pyypl.comIn order to register you need to have an android or ios device they also ask for KYC but some countries like us we don’t have any other choice but to take it. I have been using their virtual card and toping it up with my binance account or Trustwallet and have been shopping and paying for many subscriptions online without any problemI never leave any money inside it though, i top up the virtual card and buy with it directly. I don’t want to risk losing my money in case they tried to scam and run awayThere’s no much information about this company but they are focusing on countries with messed up and poor banking systems. For now they doing great job and offering good services for cheap fees IMO since it’s the only accepted Virtual Card in my region for crypto",

Because Paywithmoon does not work with any Amazon service.",

Because Paywithmoon does not work with any Amazon service.Im not promoting because i have no interest or benifits of doing, i even warned people  who want to try their services to not let any money inside the card. I was only trying to help our arabic community since we don't have much cards allowed in our region (plastic or virtual cards) I tried once buying a book on Amazon books and went well, while it got declined on Apple store when i tried to attach it or buy with it. It's been a while now and didn't try again after they updated many things. And i also didn't try to buy with a big amount or expensive transactions i just find it a bit risky with the lack of informations about their bank associated with Mastercard",

      "body": "Nothing suspicious if someone introduce a company hereLook like this one is legit and somehow 'popular' in countries within africa and middle east. They even raised recently a few millions during a few series@GxSTxVThey surely work with several banks since it has multiple countries allowed to join, and each has its own currency.Go to Add money >>> select bank transfer. And see what are the number/reference.Google the number and you will see what is the bank used.As for the card, fintech companies usually use service like Trezoor or Lemon. A kind of white label for BaaS (banking as a service)",
