There is no nation in the world today that can't attest to a certain degree of fraudulent activity although Nigerians have been painted vividly in the world on this part but there are also Nigerians in almost all the world doing exceedingly well and these good part is covered because of the scam nation title they have already tagged us.",

This thing dey for fiat too just because they want fast and quick money.Secondly you mentioned because of the scam rate in crypto(bitcoin) government has urge people to stop investing in bitcoin, the naija government wey I know? Them no dey see you sef them no dey reason person matter. Any decision our government make about bitcoin is for their own benefit not ours. They don't want to loose control and they don't want their currency to loss value because if government make bitcoin there legal tender I give this country just two month people go adopt bitcoin",

In the introduction of bitcoin in the country scammers has started using it to deceive people though at first they could not used it to scammed anyone until people became to kno the real important of the coin and from there the people that were inquisitee to buy and invest in it were scammed. At that time they used it as ponzi scheme and many with the hope of getting big amount of money started to invest and lost their money. And that is why it is not every investment platform you see in the internet is trustworthy to invest in. Well as for me I dont know how people dey see the inflation with bitcoin. Me, I never see bitcoin dey reduce or control over inflation.",

Yeah actually scammers really shake things a lot then, and one of the reason why so many people falls victim was because of the interest they have on crypto but however nobody to mentor them on the ways to go about it, so they just rushed into it thinking it was a legit business and later on run they realize it was a scam. I was actually a victim ones on telegram, I saw a pump signal trend were they give signal to buy a certain coin and make huge profits, so I joined the group and check there past signal and I saw that it was accurate so I decided to buy there next signal so after I bought when I tried selling back it wasn't working, that was when I new it was a scam and till now the coin is on my wallet.",

      "body": "Why I frown against any form of fraudulent activities by the Nigerian youths and their modes of operations. This has totally given the country a bad reputation in the international community. Although this not only peculiar to the Nigerian community. There is no country in the world that does not do fraud. But I don't think Nigerian government is fighting crypto because of the fraud associated with it by few individuals. Generally Nigerian government doesn't like an avenue where the youth of the country are meeting their financial needs. To me their are against crypto because they think it will affect their other forms of investment and the youth wont be depending on them any more. You know say our politicians dem dey like make youth dey continue to be their errands boys and whistle blowers on who is not supporting them. Normally them know say the more them keep the youth in poverty the easier e go be for them to win election. Na poverty dey make boys they go carry ballot boxes during election. Secondly the youths were not saving their money in the banks any more and the government saw this as a treat to them. You know say na youth plenty pass for this country. So I don't think it's fraud that is making the Nigerian government fight crypto in Nigeria. There is fraud in every aspect in the country.",
