      "body": "I think the best alternatives to Ethereum aren't mentioned:NEAR- Horizontal sharding for infinite TPS, EVM compatibility with Aurora, trustless cross-chain bridges, easiest blockchain to use.CNDL- 0 transaction fees, 2 second transaction times, POS, built to host metaverses.UTNP- Each wallet is a DAG with 50k TPS, smart contract files used for DeFi, NFTs, and ID, CBDCs, smart cities. Think of it as a cross between Stellar and IOTA.",

Avalanche blockchain is so stable compared with another blockchain. I do like ADA but this is not so useful like avalanche. Avalanche is still undervalued at this moment too. The best first layer alternative blockchain for ethereum.",

      "body": "What about something that can operate as a standalone layer 1 blockchain, or a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum? That's what Chromia ($CHR) offers and that's one of the reasons I'm a big believer in their project. I just think their biggest issue is that they focus solely on creating a blockchain for gaming which is probably why they aren't as big as the other projects you have listed. But, of the ones listed in your poll I would have to say either ADA or AVAX. I still think Cardano is going to continue gaining popularity and usage as blockchains become more and more \"mainstream.\" Both AVAX and ADA are smart contract based while DOT is not and SOL doesn't use them in traditional ways. It's all up to what you personally believe, but I personally think as blockchains becomes more mainstream and you start getting more businesses utilizing them it's all going to be all about the smart contracts...",

Also, I prefer Layer 2 projects as I don't think Ethereum has any rivals.Same. But I dont think its overpriced compared to top l1 projects. Plus its supply is capped with 720m only unlike eth with infinite supply. Also they are burning all fees incurred during transactions no exclusions.Also Ive been more confident when I am dealing with nft for thr avax ec as it not as much as fee compared to others and the transactions are smooth enough to convey my deals. Anyway looking forward to bag more.",

People are using all of alternative blockchains. it doesn't even matter about whether that was first or second layer blockchain as long as people can send the transaction or use dapps with small fees and they will be using it. Quote from: Maliceprime on May 25, 2022, 06:19:37 AMSome are saying their time has already passed and they won't do well in the coming bull market, maybe it's time we should start looking into second layer blockchain projects?..No, First and second layers blockchain will not have a lot of differences. If people are only looking for the cheap transaction fees and first layer blockchain can also provide it. As far as i know that if the first layer has bigger ecosystem than second layer solution.",

They have the superb technology and probably bested already Ethereum in all aspects beside the price. ADA, SOL and other bullshit overrated blockchain are just on top because they have a huge funds from VC that backing them but there technology sucks.Â  You can use this website https://blockchain-comparison.com/blockchain-protocols/ to check all the layer 1 blockchain project as well as there information and ratings for there performance and not from hype.",
