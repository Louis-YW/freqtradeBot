      "body": "If there are more developments to come on the apecoin project.. Then it will definitely go up again. Because people will be curious to buy and hold more of it incase it becomes a very strong coin like Bitcoin. You can check the Roadmap of the Apecoin project. That should give u enough clue about what's going to happen to the price.",

But, of course, a rise will come soon once the situation is getting better and when Bitcoin bounces high again. We couldn't tell when it comes but yes, it is expected in the next 3-4 years from now, that probably when the next halving comes, that was 2025 if not mistaken. So for now, you have been given the option to buy more but never I urge you to do that. It should be on your decision.",

      "body": "There’s no good point entry, it should be based on your own analysis.There’s a good hype with APE but I guess those hype are gone because of bear market and you can’t pump that much during this trend so better to wait for the real bottom price or start to analyze so you can know if APE can still pump this year. Also, if there’s no big development especially on its utility APEcoin might find a hard time to pump.",
