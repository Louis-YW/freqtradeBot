Whales grab 15 million MATIC on 70% price surgeWhaleStats has reported that over the past 24 hours, whale known as \"BlueWhale0072\" has made two transactions, acquiring 10,000,000 and 4,723,190 MATIC tokens.

It's not only matic but some defi tokens were also being hyped and i see that whales are also accumulating more and more shiba inu as well. Could this become a signal if the recovery will be happening very soon? I have bought matic during the dump and the whales were giving me huge profit and i personally think that if this will be growing even more from day to the another day.",

This means if the altcoins can recover slowly even during the bearish trend. Polygon was doing it so well and it was recovering from the dump as fast as possible compared with another token that exist in the market as well. Waiting for the massive whales will be coming back again to the crypto.",
