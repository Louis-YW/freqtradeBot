We normally pay the rent manually from our bank account to theirs.Back to bitcoin again, this could be achieved using locktimes. You basically want a mechanism where the tenant locks some coins up in a smart contract that can only be \"unlocked\" by the landlord after a certain time. You may also add an extra option for the tenant to be able to spend those coins themselves if they wanted to without the time restriction. So the smart contract could look something like this:Code:OP_IF  <time> OP_CheckLocktimeVerify OP_DROP <landlord_pubkey> OP_CheckSigOP_ELSE  <tenant_pubkey> OP_CheckSigOP_ENDIFFor example the tenant funds this address on 29th but the landlord can only spend it on 1st of next month. If the landlord loses their key the tenant can still spend these coins (it doesn't have the limitations of 2 of 2 multisig).The limitations of this is that for each month a new address has to be created by only changing the locktime (which changes the hash hence the different address).You also can't set how much the landlord can withdraw since bitcoin scripts can not fetch the amount field of the outputs in the transaction so the tenant has to fund this address with the exact rent value so that the landlord can withdraw all of it.",

You may want to test all of this on testnet first.",
