  "content": "Following the astronomical hike in the price of fuel (PMS) due to the complete removal of fuel subsidy by the present administration of President Tinubu  Federal Government the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has issued a seven day ultimatum strike which threaten to shutdown every sector of the nation's economy.QuoteNLC has advised citizens to stock their homes with food items, medicines and other essential things ahead of the commencement of its seven-day strike to protest the removal of fuel subsidies and the escalating cost of living in the country.Source: https://punchng.com/nationwide-strike-stock-homes-with-food-medicines-others-labour-tells-nigerians/According to NLC that the manner at which the FG removed the fuel subsidy wasn't in line with previous agreements between the NLC and FG. The action which has led to an untold hardship on the citizens with prices of foodstuffs, products and services skyrocketedThe NLC has therefore asked Nigerians to be prepared for the strike by stocking their homes with food items, medicals necessities and other essential items ahead of the seven-day nationwide strike.The strike is said to commence on the 2nd of August, 2023 as Labour has vowed to cripple fuel supply, power grid, shut markets, schools, hospitals, banks and more others.Although the Federer Government has scheduled a meeting with the NLC currently ongoing today 31st July, 2023 for a dialogue on matters arising. It should suffice you to know that same FG scheduled a meeting of this kind with the NLC on the 28th July, 2023 buy didn't showed up at the meeting which spark NLC to declare the 7-day ultimatum warning strike backed by other labour unions.Only the outcome of today's meeting will determine if the strike will hold as announced by NLC or not.What are your thoughts on this issue as this is not the first time NLC is calling for a nationwide strike but end up calling it off amidst the expectations of Nigerians for a commence strike?And if this strike actually hold are you and family prepared for the seven-day?",

NLC should come up with a comprehensive plan on how to tackle Government policies that are affecting the people, there are lots of things NLC is not fighting for, they've remained docile as State Governor's are dealing with civil servants, as regards promotions, payment of gratuities of pensioners, implementation of minimum wages and whole lot more of things. This incessant strike almost everytime is not helping the matter, they went on strike not too long ago, what did they achieve, nothing. Now they coming up with another strike again, whenever NLC is aready to fight for the common Man, we will know, but for now, they are just playing to the Gallery.",

NLC chairman is only after his pocket and he is using the masses to enrich himself because he knows that,when he comes up with strike strategy, the government will get panic and give him his own quarter. For this country everybody dey fight for only themselves and them go lie say na for the benefit of all. All since I was very young in secondary school till now,all the NLC saga hasn't changed anything in the Labour section but rather has worsen it.",

      "body": "To my best observations towards each and every organizational bodies in this country, they are at it selves personal interests instead of standing a voice for the masses.Whatever system of governments and organizational bodies has always been a professionality for having the masses welfares are it's workshops to feed its pockets.Dear Op, just as you said that  this is not the first time NLC is calling for a nationwide strike but end up calling it off amidst the expectations of Nigerians happens because there entered some tokens to their bank accounts as mails to hold onto termed to be bribery.These whole organizational bodies have the masses staked and gambles with their welfares, peace, lives, properties and of course with their increases of growth consciencelessly without an atom of remorse because they persist doing this s*** consistently.The strike called by NLC is an empty threat. They have looked insight and has put to calculation of the present government of the Bola Amed Tinubu that they have acquired much luxurious incomes as extortions through inflations but needed to be recognized by a percentage but the government is acting adamant on them then they came in to create a public call for an unfair alarm together with the masses so they could have a proficient point of contact while indirectly asking for their own quoter from the government using us the masses as an influential tool against the government. How would the so NLC ask the masses to stock in foods and meds as a sanction against the strike when they knew the current situation on ground about the hardship within the nation? Where would the money to do all that come from? They said the removal of the fuel subsidy was not as agreed and was improper as it already caused inflations in the economical system yet they don't think the percussions the strike of such as threatened could linger worsen by the common citizens.The so called NLC is also an institute of itself concerns just as other related organizations as the government.If there could be means to stock enough foods, meds and other essential needs for a whole weeks, then it is assumed there is a welfare of the economy since everyone can afford a long period essential stocks as that.I can tell you hell no, I, my family and lot of persons to by best of notice are not capable of stocking food, meds and other essential needs as directed by the so NLC.NLC is also part of the problems  that has escalated the mess of today in our societies of economies. All are rebellions nodding to public feeding funds into its personal pockets.",

I don't pray for that to happen oo if not others will suffer, especially hospital patients. Who is going to look after them?When Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) still had reputation to protect, government do listen to them that's why you will see that Nigerian government held meeting with them many times not to embark on the strike. When nigeria workers embark on strike, it affects the government, no workers means people will not be available in their place of work, most nigeria public offices will be closed down and that will affect victims that need the service like the transportation union, the market union, the union of teachers in secondary and tertiary institutions and lastly, the electricity board will all be shut down, there are many more and this is what NLC can do and the government fear a country that will be idle without generating taxes.However, over the years, it seems the NLC chairman is not a transparent person with reputation, they say today and change mind tomorrow. It could be a force or been threatened but what is the point of going for strike when nothing changes after few days of absence from work, the government don't listen to them anymore because they see that the strike isn't effective as it use to be, even the unions are bored of staying at home anytime they announced strike, people don't take them serious again.",

They even ridicule the grievances of the less fortunate. The security forces stand by the political leaders who oppress us, wearing worn-out uniforms, and yet retire to homes among the very people they have been used to oppress. People now believe they can commit any wrongdoing without consequences. The concept of opposition parties has faded away, as individuals have abandoned their principles for financial gain. Even respected figures like university professors, religious leaders, and the elderly seem to care more about their impending mortality than the affairs of society. Protests have become prohibited, and the labor unions, once a voice for the workers, are now primarily concerned with lining their own pockets.",
