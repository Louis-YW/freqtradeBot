  "content": "Salute, Today I found a topic by user aceptamosbitcoin, i never seen him before in Russian local board so I decided to check his story to roughly understand who he is and discovered an interesting moment.His first activity made in forum August 25, 2013 Topic:Comercios Fisicos que Acepten BitcoinLast activity of first owner November 26, 2015 PostHere we see that almost 99% of all messages from his account are made in the Español (Spanish) Local board.Awakening of the second personality on the accountJanuary 08, 2017 postLast activity of second ownerAugust 22, 2020 Topic: Searching writers [EU/USA]During this period of time, the account was actively used in English and without activity in the Español (Spanish) Local board.The last phase of awakening December 13, 2023 Topic: Buying domains or crypto media sitesLast activity December 13, 2023 Topic: Ищeм SEO cпeциaлиcтa c oпытoм paбoты c AhrefsThe appearance in the Russian local board is generally some kind of surprise for me, but it does not prove anything, so we will put this aside.Obviously, the account was clearly sold once, but is it enough to paint him? He staked BTC adress on July 26, 2019 which clearly does not prove that he belongs to this account.I have nothing against this man, and in my opinion he did not do anything bad here, but at the same time it contradicts the established rules, what are your conclusions? Or, all this cannot prove that the account was resold or the owner changed.",

      "body": "Eh, November 26, 2015 to January 08, 2017 isn't too far fetched. Only a year.People can learn different languages, and it was only a year and 1 month. I would just call it a coincidence, especially seeing that it has been over 5 years since this happened and as far as to my knowledge no suspicious things have happened during the time of the activity.As for the last awakening being a 3 year difference, that can be of some suspicion and understandable, especially seeing that Russian post, but since you said the Russian post didn't prove anything (as well as that he also speaks English in 2023) we'll just do what you said and set that specific part aside.He did stake his account in 2019, that is a good find and im removing the rest since its 4 am and i had to reread this post a couple of times",

It’s just that most members believe that accounts that were bought can be used for unethical purposes like someone could buy an account that was active in the collectible section and has completed several threads with other users and because of that they have managed to earn some reputation for themselves if such an account was to be sold, it would be easy for the new owner to use the account to scam the community since a lot of people already trust the account. And just like the post above mine stated, this very account is not active they don’t even have an interest in joining a signature campaign but I’ll still advice that you keep a close watch and if you suspect anything then you can come back and warn the community about it.",

In fact he staked the address just after the posting gap indicating a change of hands and when he started speaking in English (and never wrote in Spanish again). Another thing I see is that in the first period he did not apply for any bounty but after a short time after he switched to English he applied, which usually happens when accounts change hands.
