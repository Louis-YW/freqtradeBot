  "content": "QuoteApple today rolled out new ad placements in the App Store on the iPhone, allowing developers to advertise their apps in more places, including the main Today tab and in the \"You Might Also Like\" section at the bottom of individual app listings.\"Now my app's product page shows gambling ads, which I'm really not OK with,\" tweeted Arment. \"Apple shouldn't be OK with it, either.\"As noted by Arment, Apple provides advertisers with the choice to have their ad shown in app categories different than their own app's category, allowing ads for gambling ads to appear in listings for unrelated apps like the podcast app Overcast.The presence of gambling ads in the App Store as a whole has prompted some criticism, with some accusing Apple of being greedy and moving away from policies that the company upheld under former CEO Steve Jobs. Apple earns revenue from both the ad placements and its 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchases in gambling apps.Beyond upsetting some developers, Apple allowing apps to run ads in other apps' listings has already led to the company facing accusations of anticompetitive behavior. In a tweet last week, legal expert Florian Mueller argued the ads are \"another means of increasing the effective app tax rate, forcing developers to buy ads on their own app pages in order to avoid that others steer customers away from there.\"In August, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple wanted to nearly triple its current advertising revenue to at least $10 billion per year in the future. Gurman said keyword-based search result ads are coming to the Apple Maps app starting next year.We've reached out to Apple for comment and asked if the company will consider tightening its rules surrounding the ads. We'll update this story if we hear back.https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/app-store-gambling-ads-complaints/....It appears apple developers are not fans of gambling?If apple based platforms ban gambling advertisements.Could apple gain a reputation for having an anti gambling stance in the future. Which might lead to a backlash where casinos boycott apple based products?I don't remember statistics or revenue numbers being published in response to facebook and other platforms banning cryptocurrency advertisements. Or if there was an actual backlash in those cases where social media platforms lost a significant chunk of revenue as a result of bans.The gambling industry is different from cryptocurrency advertisements. Gambling is a trillion dollar industry worldwide. It might be large enough for ad bans and lost revenue to affect apples bottom line. Perhaps I'm exaggerating the influence of the gambling industry.",

      "body": "Apple can afford to ban the gambling ads because they have enough sources to meet the requirements like profits in lot of other ways where people don't complain at all so it may even give good name in the social media as well. Probably apple users are not happy with that cause apple promoted their ecosystem is highly secure and save people money from online scams even though it is not entirely true still most people think in that way so apple wants to keep that or gradually can bring the changes over the years not all of a sudden.",

Also casinos are not in sync in related to decisions, they might do it or not but probably not. And i think the ban of gambling ads in their platform is caused by the rapidly growing of gambling industry where its has both pros and cons. You see, obvious list of cons are lots of these gambler become addictive, problematic gambler, and its like human nature to become like that, and also gambling games becomes more common like underage can access it which is really bad.While its pros are obviously the rise of gambling companies, probably might also rise the use case of cryptocurrency including bitcoin.",

I wouldn't play either but they're probably the groups with the highest budget for ads.Will banning gambling ads and apps hurt gambling companies? If people are sent into brick and mortar casinos or online casinos, they might end up betting more anyway. Gambling is particularly bad for addicts and young people (I'm not going to say it's good for anyone but if you find it entertaining and don't do it much, you probably don't need an ad to get you to do it still).",

By imposing an urban ban on gambling advertisements, it will lose a large part of its resources, since the advertising market represents an important source of income for major companies working in the field of social applications. Which means that this will give the opportunity for its competitors to take a step at its expense.Users generally hate that advertisements of any kind appear to them, but they do not care about those advertisements as long as they are not necessarily gambling players and that these advertisements do not contain pornographic materials that contradict public modesty. If Apple will work to satisfy its developers, most likely this will not be at the expense of its advertising revenue.",

In fact, the fact that the user has a wide choice is the most competitive behavior.Perhaps there was a few apps/developers where their searches were most popular that ads were bought there enough to push their apps down far enough that the user would have to scroll. I don't actually think this is something that'd be done because selling one or two ad spaces for a keyword would be more efficient and more expensive than selling many more in my opinion but maybe apple felt differently about them. It'd be very anticompetitive if there were 8 ads above one app that someone was searching for but then I think that'd cause usability problems too, Apple would be better off auctioning popular ad spots like those to one app or have them on rotation so they got views but weren't destroying the appstore's basic functions. I doubt anyone plays just one game though and doesn't branch out at some point (I could understand playing one game for a while but not for a long time.without getting bored of it and playing something else).",

There are many countries and apps out there which have absolutely zero connection with gambling, so quite rightly would be annoyed if this type of advert was shown within their app. It could even be damaging to have such associations taking place with their brand and they're unlikely to see a substantial uplift or direct benefit from hosting such ads, but you can bet Apple is charging premium rates to the people buying them. In many industries such connections are actually banned, so the owners might feel they could indirectly get in trouble with authorities or even running such ads that are exposing vulnerable audiences who might otherwise never seek such content out.",
