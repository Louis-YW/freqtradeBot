  "content": "It is my personal believe that most of us know this above guy on X(click the image above to visit his profile on X).His name is Glauber Contessoto, popularly known as the Dogecoin millionaire; he is a 33 year old guy from Los Angeles, according to his story, he used his life savings, and also borrowed money to invest about $250,000 in Dogecoin in February of 2021; just before Elon musk started making rounds of tweets about Dogecoin and also before the 2021 bull run reached its peak..In just 69 days after investing in Dogecoin, Glauber's $250,000 dollar investment had turned to about $3,000,000 dollars(three million dollars), But Glauber did not sell, neither did he take profit, he held onto his dogecoin strongly believing that dogecoin will hit $1 per coin before the 2021 bull run ends, bull eventually came to an end and prices started going down, but Glauber never sold or bothered to take profit..As of between August and September of 2023, the screenshot below, taken from his official X account, tells the current state of that $250,000 dollars investment, which was once worth $3 million dollars..The big lesson here is to never marry a coin, no matter how good you think the project is, be it Bitcoin Ethereum BNB or any other, always take profit.",

But he did really give himself the space for greed and thought himself that he's cool by just holding it for too long. Remember that this market is totally brutal for most of the altcoins. It's totally fine if it's with bitcoin because it's for sure going to recover but uncertain with Dogecoin. We knew it that it had become a trend because Elon gave it space to his own platform and kept on tweeting about it. But we're seeing that without him shilling it, Dogecoin remains to be the funniest meme coin that it has ever been but investing wise, it's not.",

I made a similar warning too.Don't buy altcoins because they are top altcoinsImages are dead by imgur and you can check it directly on Coinmarketcap's Cryptocurrency Historical Data Snapshot",

Well, he can't possibly sell at the moment since doing so will result in a huge loss, so you are right about him not in loss yet until he sells, the only luck which I think he has was and is that dogecoin have turned out to become of the major coins In the crypto currency market and ecosystem today, if this was one of those shitcoins that fall to never rise again, I did say that he has lost an opportunity to make really big amount of money .But yeah, if he's still holding, dogecoin does have the potential to reach $1 and even more in the next bull run, most especially now that most people are speculating that X(formerly Twitter), is planning to accept accepting payments in dogecoin for subscriptions and purchase of the blue tick verification badge .",

I have read some stories like that and that will keep happening when we are greedy and estimating the range we want price to get to before getting out but we are blinded by greed from seeing that the price have been overwhelmed, over stretchd or oversold of which the next step is retracement that you never can tell the support area.

Don't stick in one coin if it's not Bitcoin.He definitely isn’t at a loss currently because the calculations by @Oshosondy is right and current he is even at a minimal profit of few dollars. But that aside he actually gambled it there. Just like the title of the thread goes it was a bad move move for him to actually believe in Alticoins for long time. To be on a save side never ever invest in alticoins for a long term only bitcoin fits that criteria even the top 4 ranking Altcoins can’t be rely on. As for the investor there he should in my opinion even if he believes a lot in the coin take all profits and pay off his debt once the it does even a 2x. One thing is after every bull run some Alticoin would never go pass there ATH again some will even die off totally, so to be on a saver side I would just take everything and probably come back later again to buy at another low if I see a little potential after the fall.",

What matters is that I was profitable overall during that time.Investing is indeed a gamble, and since we cannot predict the future, it can lead to either failure or success. What's important is that we can accept what happens and continue learning from our mistakes.
