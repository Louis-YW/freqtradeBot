  "content": "Hello everyone! I have been experimenting with laser engraved coins lately messing around with some designs for fun here are two of them. Up for auction are two lots I only made 10 of each coin so I figured I would auction a few here. Each lot is 1 coin only. The coins are laser engraved brass 40mm coins each funded with 0.001 BTC The coins addys are engraved on the reverse. I will do different metal types and designs in the near future, but brass helps the shadows pop more on the designs. On a side note I am not sure if grading these is a good idea since the laser really burns into the coins it is not like the coin minting process, but to each their own]LOT 1LOT 2STARTING BID PER LOT: 0.001 BTCMINIMUM BID INCREMENT PER LOT: 0.0002 BTCEND TIME: AUGUST 14th, 2023, 13:00:00 PDT**PAYMENT DUE 24 HOURS AFTER AUCTION ENDS**PAYMENT ADDRESS: 3Q6xqVmawb3B176vvzkZUdUgxDyst9Z1yZSNIPE: Any bid made in last 5 minutes PER LOT will extend the auction 5 minutes beyond the ending time PER LOT.If within those 5 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 5 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid PER LOT.SHIPPING: $10 USD IF YOUR IN THE USA!

The designs are original a friend of mine did the art. As far as the characters go one is Gandalf the other is just viking warriors, but after MJ mentioned Gimli I can see the resemblance. Out of the 10 coins each most are already reserved by friends weeks ago before I even posted on here. If any are left I will auction them at a later date. I have more stuff in the works so I will try to make more coins available next time.",

But I mean a 10% loss shouldn't be too bad (not sure about breathing the air, though). Still would love to see some silver.Oh, just after finishing typing I see Krogoth just pretty much wrote down what I am thinking. : )Anyway, great work and please continue.",
