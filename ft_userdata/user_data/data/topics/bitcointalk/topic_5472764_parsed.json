Say you have like a 12 word seed phrase and you are looking for just 4 with 8 known, then it wouldn’t take much of a time to get that through btcrecover tool but one of the addresses attached to that seed phrase must me known. But for 24 seed phrase which has a higher entropy it will take a million years to achieve that with the current computers available. So yes there is a possibility with a super computer in the future but we don’t have that now. And should we get there which is not something that will happen soon bitcoin addresses would have been moved to a more secure cryptography then",

If you really worry about your security, you shouldn't use trustwallet at all. Trustwallet is close source and there is no way to know how the keys are generated and whether they have access to the keys or not. There are many wallets that are better than trustwallet. A good option is electrum. It's available on Linux, Windows, Android and MacOS. The desktop version of electrum allow you to generate a 24 word seed phrase through command line in its console. Just note that electrum's seed phrase is not BIP39 and it can be imported only in itself and bluewallet. If you are on dekstop, you can also use Sparrow. Sparrow allow you to generate a 24 word BIP39 seed phrase easily. If you are on mobile, you can also use bluewallet and Samourai. Of course, none of these wallets generate 24 word seed phrase.",

Once I get there  60 minutes later I did zero tries and the super computers did 60 billion seeds.. Yeah there are a lot of bags of sand at Lowes but I then need to walk to the next location .  I would end up needing to live a really long time to check all that sand due to travel time to reach it and tons of grains of sand. If you factor in the need to walk all over the earth to get to all the sand it is closer than you said. And if you look at my post I did factor in me walking to get to the sand .  That has to slow me down a lot",

That is 75 followed by 17 zeros.Lol. I wrote a great analogy to visualizing this earlier and used the same piece of information:Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on November 04, 2023, 02:48:41 PMLet me put it in this perspective. There are estimated to be 7.5 quintillion grains of sand in the Earth; that's 7.5 x 10^18. Now ignore the shape of our solar system, and make the hypothesis that there are a trillion clones of Earth, spinning around the Sun. That'd make the total grains of sand in our Solar system about 7.5 x 10^30. Stupidly large number there. Imagine if I told you to guess my chosen grain of sand, across this uncountable set of grains, and that I picked one at random, maybe at some corner of an ocean from Earth #623,546,123,002, or at a replica of Egypt from Earth #881,239,303,566.OP, read it. You'll get your answer. The difference between \"being impossible\" and being \"being improbable\" approaches zero.

Each locker is 1mm by 1mm, and the entire wall of lockers is a square 2 light years on each side. When you choose a private key, you pick one of these lockers at random. When someone sends you bitcoins, there's some magical inbox which puts the bitcoins into your locker without telling the sender anything about the location of your locker.The lockers don't have locks. If someone knew the location of your locker (ie. your private key), then they could just go take what's in it. Similarly, it's possible to choose a locker at random and find that someone has used it already at some point in the past. But there are just so many lockers that in reality it's never going to happen, even if humanity devotes all of its efforts to searching through all of the lockers.",
