      "body": "The only thing missing is for Bitcoin to be a security and Eth a commodity, the world upside down. Without knowing about technical issues such as the Howey test, it is clear to me that securities are issued by certain corporations at will, they can issue more or less, as many as they want, while commodities are the ones that exist, at most they can be produced, but not issued at will. For example, wheat has to be produced, and gold not exactly produced but extracted, which we could consider a form of production.It seems to me that uncle Gary is clear about this, although he supports it with more technical arguments. I don't think we should worry too much.",

If the spot ETF is accepted it will the Howey Test levels it.I never expected Gary Gensler who once wanted to work with Binance before he was rejected could say such a thing about BTC. I guess he's just playing politics and will say something positive about BTC when he leaves the office just like Ex-Trump Chief Strategist Bannon",

And after the Ethereum price pump, the spot Bitcoin ETF will be launched.",

But the most important part of the ruling is the tokens by themselves are not illegal securities. If the next projects to be created take the judge's ruling as a predecent, they should avoid token sales as shares directly to investors and make direct to public market sales with them. This will need some creativity, however, it is not impossible similar to how we are witnessing airdrops and memecoins start their markets.",
