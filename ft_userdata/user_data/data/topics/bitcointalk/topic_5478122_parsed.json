      "body": "Yes I have heard and noticed this coin. But after your presentation here I researched to know better and found that Retic Finance raised $1 million in 9 days. Looking at the way people invest, it is assumed that if this coin is listed in a good exchange, it will be listed with a good price. This coin can currently be bought for $0.04 if you want to buy it from pre sale price. I will not tell anyone to invest in this coin, just search better if you want to know.Pic screenshot by CryptoNewsLand website",

Been advertised heviltyProbably not advertised here in the forum that much but i see this in social media.I see the hype and the usual trend for a new project, I’ll take cautious here since we all know the hype is there at first but the moment you invest that much that’s the time for the project to dump. Do your own research from time to time and make sure that you look at the opinions of others before investing.",

      "body": "There has been a huge hype about this coin in social media and I have seen some adverts about the same, I know it's too early to speculate anything but there has been wide speculation that this would grow like Pepe coin. However, it's better we do our own research as it's at the second stage of presale. I would personally be doing more research on it and If satisfied then would go for it with a minimal amount like $50 or so as we are approaching bull run so we may see some coins turning out to be heavily profitable. This time I would try either this coins or some other coin at the presale level.",

My opinion is that everyone should stay away from such a project, as there is too much chance of losing their money.",

He's able to make us look at the project because we never heard it and that's why I guess he's able to succeed in making us curious about the project but still, I won't invest on it no matter what.",

This is what the forum is for, no?True, that's what this forum exists for so we can share information and discuss, but before you make your current statement, you really don't have any points in the topic.IDK about this Retik Finance project, the only thing I know is that they recently reached $1M in funding, that's all. Maybe you can find a better answer from other users responses, I can only give advice if you need to be really careful in choosing a project, $1M isn't a big value for developing a crypto project.",

I guess it some temporary error, why is the fee so high on just that website, one thing is sure they seems to be very eager to sell their tokens.  The more and more I read about this Retik I just get a bad feeling, seems desperate to sell their tokens, and the Retik DeFi Debit Card without any KYC.And they don't share much information the bl.a bl.a on the website.",

Now its a new scam out there with the exact same website and how they tweet on X called Rexas.Quote from: BabyBandit on November 06, 2024, 01:42:18 AMRexas X link: https://x.com/rexasfinance?t=Suz_OvEd30tpAV_f_KgS9Q&s=09 - Website: https://rexas.com/Retik X link: https://x.com/retikfinance?t=V3WN-cHNN6CqvUUszT_Zyg&s=09 - Website: https://retik.com/ Also on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/sv/coins/retik-financeRetik was one of the biggest crypto scams in 2024 with $32M raised but then they left the project and didn't put any money in the token or the project.So it was a huge scam sadly for the investors, my self was stupid enough too do an investment but nothing that wont hurt my economy so that's fine.And yes it was probably bigger scams but please lets try to stick to the topic.And now a couple of months later its a new project that is exactly the same like Retik with the name Rexas. I am 99% sure it's the same people behind this project and and i am 100% sure this also will end up being a scam.Make your own research and look for yourself and make your own decision! I am only here to warn everyone to not invest in this Rexas because I assure you it will end up in you losing your money and I can guarantee you that!However I think they did dig their own grave now with starting another project, but we all know greed is a very strong and powerful thing right?Probably the money is all gone already (From RETIK) drugs and hookers isn't cheap and now they are desperate and trying this cheap and obvious last pull. I see that more people that me has noticed this also already on X and I hope this will get reported so they can get tracked down once for all.If you have any information about this you can PM me or post down here.I will follow this closely and do what I can do to stop this scam![FYI: The thread will probably be updated quite often, if you have a problem that don't make a post]",
