But I quickly realized that sending sMerit to myself was clearly not going to work. because in the end the sMerit award is sent to us because the sender really feels our post is useful and deserves to be given Merit. And those who generally provide judgment about our posts (writers) are other people (readers). And of course this Merit system, in addition to increasing Rank, also has the goal of increasing our motivation to further improve the quality of posts so that they are more useful for every reader. So that the Merit system is also like a determinant of our eligibility to rise to a higher rank.",

If you are the one that is going to judge your post quality that's not going to be fair.When receiving merits you also receive half of it that you can send to other members, so that could be a big problem as well if it's allowed since most of the members can easily abuse that not to mention sending merit can be abuse as well, since some members might have multiple accounts here in the forum.",

You already understand this.If you feel that some posts are good and worthy of a merit, you can report them in any of the available threads and so far I've seen some of those threads being very helpful to users who make disinvited entries.If it is possible to send merits to the user's profile itself, then what will happen is that most of the time users who have sMerit will do it every day.I understand what you're thinking because I and other friends have had that thought.Keep your spirits up because soon you will reach the destination of FM to Sr. Member. That seems to be what you are trying to do.Every once in a while, think about how someone strives to reach a desired stage such as from Hero to Legendary which requires 500 merit.",

However, users cannot give sMerit to themselves, but must be given by other users as a form of appreciation for the contribution they have made, because I think it will be funny later if I give sMerit to myself.In this case, Merit also helps to increase the reputation and ranking of the account in the forum, so that it becomes more known and respected in the forum. In this way, the Merit system not only motivates users to create more useful posts, but also helps create more productive and positive discussions in the forums.",
