  "content": "Many of you have probably heard, and some have even experienced address poisoning scams. It's a relatively new type of fraudulent scheme, which has become popular in the last 30-40 days. It appears on blockchains with cheap transaction fees, allowing scammers to send many low-cost transactions. I have not read about cases where this affected the Bitcoin network, but it’s still worth knowing about just in case you experience it in your BTC wallet in the future. Hardware wallet manufacturers, like Ledger have reported that scammers are targeting their users as well. So, stay alert.    What is Address Poisoning, and How Does it Work?This scam works by sending potential victims small (near-zero) crypto transactions. You will see a new entry in your transaction history when that happens. The address that sends the coins/tokens will look similar to yours. The first and last two to four characters will be identical.The scammer wants to make you think that this is your own address. So, you copy it from your transaction history when sending coins to yourself or give it to a different party to pay you. In that case, the funds will be transferred to the fraudster and not to you.  On which Blockchains is Address Poisoning Common?  Users of the following blockchain networks have already experienced address poisoning in one way or the other:1.   Tron2.   Binance Smart Chain3.   Polygon4.   Ethereum5.   Maybe othersSafety Measures and What to do NextIf you were a victim of address poisoning, there are no reasons to panic. No one is targeting you personally. Fraudsters prey on those who make frequent transactions and move significant sums of money. Your coins aren't at risk. Your private keys/seed hasn't leaked, and no one has gained control of your addresses, no matter the transaction history. There is no protection against address poisoning, per se, because you can't restrict someone from sending you crypto. It's safe to use those coins as well.  There are a few things you should always do to stay safe when sending and receiving crypto:•   Never copy addresses from your wallet's transaction history.•   Never copy addresses from a blockchain explorer.•   Always generate or copy addresses from your wallet's receive or addresses tab.•   When sending coins elsewhere, copy the address from the source/destination.•   If you are transferring crypto to a different person, ask the other party for the correct address.•   Verify the full address, not just the first and last couple of characters. •   If you use a hardware wallet, ensure the address in your software matches the one shown on your device's screen.   •   Be prepared to double and triple-check if needed because cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. So, once your money is gone, it's lost forever. As can be seen, it's better to spend an extra minute checking what you are doing than regretting you didn't.

Even if I want to send to myself, I copy address from the address list on my wallet, not from previous transaction or transaction history.

The first time I heard about this scam method was in connection with Tron and Tron-based tokens.It might have started there and then expanded to other networks. Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 07, 2023, 08:48:39 AMERC20 transactions may not have cheap fee, even bitcoin transaction that people think it has high fee can be of cheap fee, bitcoin mempool is always not congested most of the time since many months ago, more than a year or 2 now. But this has not been experienced on bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum's gas recommendations were several hundred gwei at times in the past while Ethereum was still on POW. They don't reach those numbers anymore and go as low as 5-15 gwei more recently. So, it's much cheaper to spam the Ethereum network now compared to that it was like before.Don't forget that the scammers attempting these schemes have to pay transaction fees just like anyone else transacting over those blockchains. It's not going to be successful unless the fake address matches that of the victim for the first and last couple of characters. Bitcoin has been spared so far probably because more computational power is required to generate look-alike addresses compared to other blockchains. But who knows what the future might bring.",

With account-based networks like Tron or Ethereum you always reuse the same receiving address, unless, of course, you want to use multiple accounts. But using multiple accounts also requires that they are all funded with the native tokens - TRX on Tron accounts or ETH on Ethereum accounts. Luckily, Bitcoin doesn't have those problems because pay your fees in the same asset you are transacting with.",

The scammer wants you to copy his address that will pop up at the top of your transaction history in your wallet or do the same thing using a blockchain explorer.

I am sure the addresses are monitored by a bot or smart contract maybe. The fake transaction sometimes gets broadcasted 15-20 seconds after a legitimate one. The scammers want their entry to be the first you see in your wallet. Quote from: stompix on January 19, 2023, 07:25:22 PMLosing faith the whole be your own bank thing would work in this world! Yeah, that's not going to work yet. I should probably not say this, but it doesn't matter. Water under the bridge already. Back when smartphones started becoming a thing, I helped a close family member to get acquainted with her phone. An older lady, let's keep it at that. I realized she would need some time to figure it all out, but I never imagined what would happen. A few weeks later, she calls me to ask if I can help her get rid of something on her phone. When I get there, I see her phone has been bombarded with SMS messages from someone/something. She kept receiving new offers to contact a \"girl\" because the girl has heard that she can keep it up and go for hours. I am not making this up. It was both funny and sad at the same time. She couldn't even remember what she clicked on that got her into that situation, or she was ashamed to say.",

I don't think they can duplicate 20. But the problem is, if you check only the first 3-4 and the last 3-4, how are you going to know if the rest matches or not? I can't remember the thread where this was discussed but it was probably in the technical Bitcoin boards. Someone created a discussion showing that scammers can match more than the usual couple of starting and ending characters in a bitcoin address from a huge pool of already generated addresses. I don't think it was used in a scheme to scam someone, but to show the current capabilities. Doublechecking only a few characters in the beginning and end is getting less and less safe.

May be the scammer can get 8 characters same i.e. the first 4 and last 4 characters.Many people just check the first few and last few characters but tend to avoid the middle ones.2. Just one different character is enough to send the amount to a different address.May be we made a mistake in copy pasting or something but even if one character is wrongly entered then there are possibilities that the amount will be lost.As for checking every character manually part it's quite easy. I have a strong short term memory and can remember 5-6 characters at once immediately.So I verify the address 5 characters at a time and the whole address is verified by every character in not more than 30 seconds.Would you risk your BTC for 30 seconds or lets say 1 minute ?",

Take a BTC address, paste it into your wallet software and change one of its characters, and the software will tell you that the address is invalid or non-existing. And you can't send to such an address, maybe not even with the worst type of wallet. More than only one character would have to change for the checksum to be OK:",
