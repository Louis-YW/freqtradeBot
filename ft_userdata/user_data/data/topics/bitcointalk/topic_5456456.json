However the United States carry out an election within a four years interval and every citizens vote for their preferred candidate. With the fourth coming election in (2024) several persons from various parties have declared their interest to run as aspirants for the president of United States, recently a crypto friendly and mayor of miami has joined the race and declared his intentions for the forth coming election, that's a good news for the crypto ecosystem.  Since we're in the Crypto era and he's bitcoin friendly do you think he'll gain audience from the masses?  Or will Joe Biden be relected as president of United States, what's your opinion? My topic was created based on research, sources.....https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Presidential-Election-Results-1788863https://twitter.com/BTCTN/status/1669150111530622976?s=08https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/15/mayor-miami-francis-suarez-enters-2024-republican-presidential-race",

You are correct, it is unlikely that the fate of candidates in an election will be determined solely by Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. In order for candidates to consider adopting or promoting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as part of their campaign strategies as part of their electoral efforts, it is important to take into account the broader factors that influence election outcomes.During a campaign, candidates who support cryptocurrencies are not necessarily implying that if elected, they will implement or support cryptocurrency policies that would benefit the cryptocurrency market. Once a candidate has been elected, their priorities may change, and a variety of factors influence their decision, such as public sentiment, legislative requirements, and the economic situation in the country.",

Politicians are very crafty. They can use any means to attract sympathy and support so that they can get notes. We had seen a few US presidential hopefuls show support for Bitcoin examples are Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Robert F Kennedy. The US has a high number of bitcoin users that will be willing to support any candidate that will be lenient with the currency. It might also be that these politicians have a genuine interest in the Bitcoin sector, so we have to wait till they get elected. But there are key factors that affect the outcome of the  US election which include race, religion, gun control, foreign policies, etc. According to Coinbase 20% of Americans–which would constitute over 50 million people own crypto. The influence of bitcoin on the elections might not be overlooked but it will not be a major influence.",

I'd encourage you to look at Presidential debates over the years. Usually the questions the moderators ask gauge what the central issues are for the time period. You can go back to the 1960's debate of Kennedy and Nixon to find focus on infrastructure modernization and stopping communism spread through China and the Soviet Union. Debates pre-2001 hardly ever had questions related to terrorism, and of course every debate post 9/11 include foreign policy questions related to middle east operations and terror groups. Don't expect any crypto talk this election cycle.When CBDC's to be introduced within the next 5-10 years contemporaneous to crypto regulations that strip people of their right to engage in crypto commerce independent of stringent regulation and taxes, then people might start paying attention. But that assumes more crypto adoption than we have now.",

      "body": "The topic of Bitcoin and crypto assets will indeed be present in the incoming presidential election in the USA, but not in the way you believe it will. To the aversge person in USA, Bitcoin is still a niche and and very unknown part of the economy, so it is likely that it would only be mentioned when the candidates touch the topic on financial freedom or small government vs big government. The rest of the debates will be about more mundane things which all the population can relate to: homelessness, inflation, job opportunities, social security and healthcare. Another possibility, it could be that some candidate started to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin, however that may be used by foreign adversaries to tarnish the imagine of the candidate, if it is convenient to their own interest. Imagine what would happen if Trump accepted Bitcoin and some address known to be of Russian origin donated a lot of money. It would certainly appear on the left media.",

But how can a free decentralized system work with the rising rate of terror. Other groups besides Bitcoin users has their say too and it might be so much for one person to try to play on the intelligence of its citizenry because of their interest in Bitcoin.  Some investors are yet to forget about the FTX collapse, now we have the Binance lawsuit and that crypto lending firm which is currently being under fire by the Texas regulators. Bitcoin will sure come up, but I wonder if it will hold much sway in the right of way.",

That's really not the subject majority is interested about, no matter the stance on it. No media is even pushing candinates to have a stance on that as viewers and readers wouldn't be interested on that. So they focus on the hot button issues for majority, those will determinate the winner. I understand that crypto people are interested on that but the fact is that it doesn't matter to most of the people and while it might be a major factor to some of us, it isn't major factor to even all crypto holders that can vote in US.",
