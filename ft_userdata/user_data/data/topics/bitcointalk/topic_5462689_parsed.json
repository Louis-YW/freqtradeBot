You'd be astonished to learn that the majority of people who invest massively in bitcoin are risk takers with a prepared mindset. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency with a guaranteed rate of return. To me, they are not gambling with their money, but rather taking a risk that will benefit them significantly in the future.QuoteSome people have not known that so many people who are investing in bitcoin doesn't fully depend on bitcoin as most generating income, they are using bitcoin as their side hustle, let us reduce the mentality of people and sense of humour by not seen bitcoin as the shortest way to make money, And if they should continue with such believe they may commit suicide when they put all their money and problems in bitcoin and lose by the end of the investment.That is why the phrase \"invest only what you can afford to lose\" is commonly used. The market is volatile, and nothing will ever go as planned if you want to make a long-term lucrative investment. A prepared mindset will not have any issues with this and will be prepared to confront whatever market consequences result from investment. If you are concerned about your ability to resist market volatility, you can simply buy and hold instead of trading. Return on investment is guaranteed regardless of how long it takes, so there's no need to fear because you already invested what you could afford at the time without having to touch it for personal expenses.",

And even if these things aren't here you could easily make money in bitcoin through holding, as what most people did in 2017 onwards. As of now it's no longer a measly speculative asset since there's a massive and consistent uptrend in value since 2009, and if you're going to trust that graph you best believe that soon enough as long as you play your cards right you'd be able to rake in money as well. So investing in bitcoin is a no-brainer especially if you're looking to invest for long anyway.",

Many people you see today don’t even see it the way you see it. Yes it generates ROI but people store their funds in it to avoid devaluation that is caused by fiat, same as gold. The listed investment you pointed out are business investments where are daily income or profit is almost guaranteed. In bitcoin if you want such then you trade which is a bit closer in terms of risk to other businesses too. And yes virtually everyone will tell you to diversify but going to some of the listed investments by you requires more capital, more knowledge and most at times middlemen and also requires your daily attention. But with bitcoin every little amount is ok to start depending on your profit target and year to reap. With bitcoin you don’t need an extensive knowledge aside how to secure your funds except maybe it is trading your venturing into. So you see why bitcoin is the easiest investment hub people dwell into.

The risk involved in it so that you will not blame anyone for your downfall. I beg to differ but Ethereum shouldn’t be worth calling an investment coin because of some factors. Example is it purely follows bitcoin price trend although its investors will deny but should anything happen to bitcoin then it will also follow suit. Also many things like not totally decentralized, no amount of specific limited number of supply which is a great tool to measure the value of a product, and many more. So the only cryptocurrency for investment is bitcoin and every diversification based on my knowledge should be outside bitcoin and not into other cryptocurrencies",

For example, in my country, the share market averages around 10 years+ and real estate is 20 years+. According to current experience (though this might be different in the future), Bitcoin can be a 4-year investment with a high enough return that works globally. This is much better than most options, but yes, it is not the highest-return strategy. Well, usually, a higher return means higher risk. If you are expecting a very short-term and super high return, that is speculation. So, in short, if you want to save your money and not move it for an average of 4 years, Bitcoin is a sound investment.",

People started seeing the worth and was quick to trade with it to see how it goes and it happened that they traded some good fortune from it and they saw the need for holding which in the sense means they have seen the potentials of bitcoin growing in value in years to come which made them took advantage of it and from there bitcoin was seen as an investment option and I also see the reasons for it too because as time goes on, there is always a room for improvement and I believe the idea of bitcoin investment was the improvement to serve human better.OP bitcoin being an investment option still looks like other investment out there which one engages to make profit. As we all know, there is always ups and downs with investments and bitcoin is not exempted. In as much as it is a volatile asset, one needs to understand that volatility is the nature of such assets and nobody can predict the next swing as it is adversely affected by many factor which it is dependent on and vice versa. One thing I think you should know about investment is that there is no business or investment that is risk free. All investment have their trying times and good times as well but your ability to take advantage of every market situations puts you on the right track.",
