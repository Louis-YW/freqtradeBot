Github is a free \"tool\" for version control and collaboration, but if i put the sourcecode of my application on my own site (without version control) it can also be open source.@OP: basically, if the developer is sharing his sourcecode, it's an open source wallet. Open source doesn't mean free, free doesn't mean open source... The problem is that some wallets look like they're open source, but when the community looks at the sourcecode they're sharing, it's obvious that compiling said sourcecode doesn't result in the wallet distributed by the vendor... I can't remember which wallet exactly, but there's a big mobile wallet for which this is the case.EDIT: one last thing... open source =/= automatically safe.I can code a wallet using a lot of very confusing classes, ending up with a huuuuuge code base and open source it... But as long as there aren't a lot of senior developers that actually go trough my codebase and verify i'm not doing anything stupid/evil, an open source wallet can be as dangerous as a closed source one... And if you download binaries that are pre-compiled (and signed), you're basically trusting the signer that he/she didn't meddle with the sourcecode before compiling (unless you reproduce the compilation, but then there was no need to download the pre-compiled binary to begin with)",

Being open source means that the source code is available for anyone to view and potentially modify. This is typically hosted on a platform like GitHub. If a developer chooses not to make the source code publicly available, then the software is considered to be closed source. An example of an open source Bitcoin wallet is Electrum. You can easily find and view its source code on GitHub https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumI recommend checking out these threads:Do beginners know what closed & open source wallets are?[General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?It has longer explanations and examples, as well as some discussions from other forum members.",

Even if you don't know much about it, you can still figure it out by understanding the basics of open source and closed source software. For example, there are ways like checking the documentation or software license (A license file is almost always present with open source software). A company can also use GitHub, or any other public repository, to make the code available for anyone to see and use. However, just because the code is open to the public, it doesn't necessarily mean that the software is trustworthy or safe, or that it's free of any potential issues.",

If yes please share me a way, Finding out if a software is open source or not is not always easy. One way to do it is by checking the provider's website or documentation. The developers usually mention if it's open source or not in the license. If you can't find the info there, you can try looking for discussions or questions about the source code on online forums or related communities.  Just keep in mind that even if the source code isn't on GitHub (although most open source software is) it can still be open source, or if the software has its own GitHub repo, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's open source. So, it's not always a straightforward answer.Quote from: KiaKia on January 27, 2023, 06:26:18 AMI am tired of people saying a wallet is open source and some other are arguing that it's closed source, I need to get things done myself. It's perfectly fine to learn how to do things by yourself, but it's equally okay to listen to the opinions of others. People with diverse expertise may know better than us in many areas. For instance, if your car breaks down, would you attempt to repair it yourself or consult a licensed mechanic? It's crucial to acknowledge when we require assistance and seek it from those who have the requisite abilities and knowledge.",

      "body": "3 easy ways that anyone without any technical knowledge could use to quickly tell if a project is closed source are:1. Having an actual source codeIf a project claims to be open source it has to have a source hosted somewhere. That means you have to be able to see actual code. Usually there is either no source code to be found or something else the scammers do is to share binaries (eg .exe) on Github pretending to be open source.2. How active the repository isYou can reject a lot of fake claims using this. For example a project claims to be open source and has real source code on Github too. This project released a new version (eg. on google playstore) today but the code on Github was updated a year ago. That is a clear indication that the project is not open source.3. DependenciesAlthough this is a bit technical I don't think it is that hard. Sometimes what scammers do to pretend their project is open source is to release part of the code (usually UI related code) and use a closed source backend that does everything else.Usually the name of the repository, the explanations in the readme file or the dependencies in the dependency section of the project show you what part of the code you are looking at.These are easy ways to figure out \"closed\" source software, but in order to be able to tell if a project that doesn't fit into the 3 above categories is open source (eg. Electrum) you have to be able to review the whole code which requires programming knowledge and time.You'd have to also look into the external libraries the project is using and whether those libraries are open source and if the project is using the same binaries (built from that code not something else with the name).It's a bit of a late response but I hope this answers your question since I didn't see anybody cover these.",
