Bitwemix is not listed on Coinmarketcap, also not listed on Coingecko. The exchange was created this year, some months ago. I can never go for such exchange. Pay before withdraw? Definitely that is a scam. Anything like invite more friends and claim more reward, also your friends as they invite friends, but have to deposited before you can be able to claim the reward, before you can be able to withdraw. Definitely it is a scam. Stay away from scam exchanges.",

Even though it is a better sign if exchange is on CMC/Coingecko, they also have their share of scammy exchanges listed so I woulnd't solely rely on them when chosing a legit and reliable exchange.@Bitsign85 What I don't understand it whether you already have bitcoin on that shady exchange, or you are thinking about depositing? If it is former, it should be like on any other exchange and as others pointed out, if they ask you to deposit more money in order to withdraw your bitcoin, just forget about ever seeing your money again, its a scam. And if its latter, there are far more reputable exchanges around where you can do your business instead of using this totally unknown one.",

If you want to use an exchange, you can just first check it there. Like the exchange he mentioned, it is not there, that could have helped if he tried to check. If he see it there, he can then proceed with more research about the exchange, like asking us on this forum and checking reviews about the exchange.",

      "body": "Quote from: Bitsign85 on September 12, 2022, 05:17:14 AMHow can I withdraw to another account or exchange Bitcoin and withdraw in usdScamAvoid there are so many complaints about it.Check out this archived reddit post, the original one was deletedQuoteSo many scams on Upwork...This is a warning to my fellow freelance webdevs.Here is my story. I recently entered into the web dev game, I am trying to find my first freelance job (with no success so far).Yesterday, I saw a post about someone needing a website and I applied. The client messaged me on Upwork, we talked a bit then wanted to move the convo to Telegram (first red flag). I was desperate so I said okay.We talk, he wants me to create a website for a local restaurant (a real place). I said to myself, okay good this seems to be legit.I say that I want to be paid through Upwork, I'll even lower the price if they want to avoid paying Upwork's cut, so they'd essentially be paying the same amount although I'd be getting less. Reviews are more important than money I said to myself.He says he wants to pay with crypto (second red flag). I asked how would he guarantee that I'd be paid, and he said he'd be paying me up front once he sees that I actually work on his project. So I write the html, do some minor styling and send him a screenshot as proof. He says it looks great (wtf it is just html?) and that he'll be sending me my BTC. I give him my wallet address but no, he wants me sign up to a particular platform because there is a limit on sending btc to outside the platform on this particular exchange and he had already reached it this month (third red flag).FINE. I sign up to the website and send him my email so that he can wire me the BTC. He sends me fucking 0.15 BTC (3500 dollars) for a one page static website. Being the good, honest boy my mom raised me I say that that is too much and I'll do it for 500 (even that is high I know, I got a little greedy). He won't respond to my texts at this point. Anyways, I try to withdraw BTC from the exchange (just 500 dollars) to confirm that this is not a scam. And this is the point where I realized it was, indeed, a scam.Whenever I try to withdraw, the exchange displays a pop up says that withdraw failed because blah blah blah. I try a couple more times to be sure, and it won't work. So I dig in to the source code of the webpage. And there it is:Code:    success: function(response) {   var user_balance = parseFloat(response);   if(address == \"\" || address.length < 10) {    noti(\"Please enter a valid wallet address\", \"error\"); } else if(amount == \"\") {    noti(\"Please enter the amount to withdraw\", \"error\"); } else if(amount > user_balance) {noti(\"You don't have enough balance to withdraw\", \"error\"); } else {$.ajax({url: \"../ajax/ajax\", type: \"POST\", data: {action: \"WITHDRAW\", amount: amount, crypto: crypto, address: addresssuccess: function(response) {var json = JSON.parse(response); $(\"#withdraw_error\").css(\"display\", \"flex\"); $(\"#withdraw_error_text\").html(json['withdraw_error']);This goddamn exchange has a set function that displays an error whenever you try to withdraw from it. I have been texting this 'client' for the last hour, no response (obviously).I asked him to walk me through the scam but he won't reply. What was even the point of doing this? Is he a web dev that got a job from this local business and is he trying to get the work done by someone else for free?Anyways ladies and gentlemen, this is how I lost hours of my time to an Upwork scam. Still haven't gotten my first freelance job.Be careful out there.Cheers",

The site you mentioned is unknown so if your withdrawal is stuck without any reason and their support them didn't respond then most provably you are already been a victim of scam. So next time better go with trusted like binance or other mentioned by other forum users here.",
