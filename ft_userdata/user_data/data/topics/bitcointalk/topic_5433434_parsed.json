I think as times goes on, the world will fully accept any race, without any form of racism attached. Because If I'm an expert on a particular field, I don't think a company will hire me because of my race, I think I will be hired based on my qualifications and expertise.",

The human world has never been equal and fair, there are always evils that quietly creep into our lives, just because we can't see or hear about them doesn't mean they don't exist. But we should also accept because the cases of racism, rich and poor, don't become too big, so we don't need to worry too much.",

There is hope in the sense that it get better by the year. How the blacks were treated in years past isn't the same today things get better each day the sun rise. But Africans leaving in Africa need to find a way to add more value to the society to attain a racially equal society. Americans will be left with no option but to treat the blacks with equality when the blacks in Africa start adding more value to the society",

But we all know that this is not only the case in the USA but in the whole world as well because this kind of mindset has been imprinted by our ancestors to let us think some people are superior to others because of their past bloodlines and any other reasons. That's why to start changing these kinds of domino effects to the next generations, we need to strive to teach our children about the bad things about racism and it should not be in our mindset to think that we are superior to others due to our colors.",

There can be massive campaigns and programs aimed at raising awareness for people to easily accept every race as equal, but the only time it will be possible is when the mindset and perspectives of people that have been shaped by society is changed in a way that everyone on their own begin to see that we all the same regardless of our skin colors and race.",

Racism is controlled by some communities by indiscriminate punishment of the guilty; citizens have an easy time understanding the Government's views on racism and can exploit them. Black race seem to be most recipient of racism, it even comes from the Northern Africans. Education, strong ethics, and hard work should be the cornerstones of black culture to improve their future perceptions.",

Black people I would also say have effect on how they’re been treated around the world. Some being treated like a piece of trash because of their disloyalty to one another but gave all their respect to the white man. Black people population has evolved over the year even though they can’t beat the population of the white. One thing for sure is that they’ll also be supremacy by people around the world whether white or black, but the best of those are the ones that see each other and treat one another as sane humans.
