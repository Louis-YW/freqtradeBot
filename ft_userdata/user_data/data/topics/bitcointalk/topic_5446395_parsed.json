  "content": "As the topic says, i found this interesting poll online on Micheal Saylor page and I'm curious to know what type of Bitcoiners we have on the Bitcointalk forum. this is going to be interesting, firstly i will explain in short terms what those options means.Maximalist Bitcoiners  These believer sees bitcoin as global freedom and economical empowerment.Technocrate Bitcoiners  These leagues believes that Bitcoin is the dominant digital monetary network.Investors theses individuals sees Bitcoin as digital goods.Skeptic  This set of group believes that bitcoin is too good to be true.Others  Belong to any of these groupsPersonally, I consider myself a maximalist because it fulfills more of the purposes for which bitcoin was designed for, as well as an investor who has never been skeptical of bitcoin or a technocrat.",

They will have to learn their lessons and lose money with altcoins before a day they realize that Bitcoin is the best.No one denies or argues that bitcoin is not the best. Bitcoin is the best because bitcoin is the safest to use and invest in. And not all altcoins are bad, and not all people who invest in altcoins lose without profit. We have to admit that bitcoin is getting bigger and safer every day, but that has made bitcoin less profitable than altcoins. If you invest in ETH or BNB during the 2021 bull season, you will find that their returns are better than bitcoin. Not all altcoins are bad, many still perform very well in the long term, ETH being an example. I also invest in bitcoin, but I'm not a bitcoin maximalist, I can't pass up the many bigger opportunities out there just because of my bitcoin fanaticism.",

This type of behavior is exactly what bitcoin was built to replace and if just 50% of those devs put their efforts towards building on bitcoin such behavior would not occur so frequently *see last two years of 'crypto news'*.

And if they do, they'll regret that they've been like that everytime the market turns into a bull run. That is one thing for sure, they can be skeptics for a long time but they can't ignore the development and the good things that's happening and about to happen for bitcoin.",

Example of a maximalist is Micheal Saylor, Nayib Bukele and people that strongly believe in the existence of bitcoin and highly having hope that the future would be better as bitcoin valuation continues and price increase. Maximalist have strong view about bitcoin and they hold bitcoin and they are most likely not selling during bear market.Technocrat are the developers, surely many bitcoin developers are investors too, some may not even sell all their holdings when they have even forseen bear market coming. Developers should also be considered as investors because they become developers because they have hope in something they are developing and they will hold some coins.",

Also, they represent probably way less than they sued to be in the crypto world, people having only BTC in their wallets could probably be counted with the fingers of a hand in most cases, this forum and other purposely built socials media like Reddit subs are the only areas where you can find them en masse.And yeah, I'm one of them.",

There are TONS of alt coin chains with tons of issues that Bitcoin doesn't have because it does not attempt to be the whole show at layer 1. I would say its totally fine to experiment and especially earn some free cheddar from airdrops from these (very ponzi like) EVM chains with extremely questionable decentralization and monetary policy.Simply take the free money they are offering to you and buy Bitcoin with it, it's fun. Just don't get trapped claiming some easily inflatable and likely highly insecure protocol is better than Bitcoin because it is likely that you are mathematically incorrect.",

But probably will just dump the altcoins before the bull run stops. You still can consider them investors in some altcoins as long as they are early as possible that they could buy altcoins at $0.001. Not very different from the short sellers at penny stocks.",

The decentralized system inherent in Bitcoin makes shipping costs very cheap, fast and not hindered by distance/time. The purpose of Bitcoin was designed due to public distrust with a centralized financial system method, third parties can control everything. In addition, there is no transparency in every transaction that allows data manipulation.Bitcoin is more directional and has an extraordinary blockchain system and anyone can view transactions through the Bitcoin explorer because it is very transparent.",
