If we reduce the child bearing to the amount we can take care , it will reduce the heat we are feeling from the bad economy experience.Based on the current economic challenges it would be better to give birth to the number of children your income can cater for. But for people like us that had children when the economy was stable, we have to look for alternative sources of income. Getting new jobs now seems very difficult but one needs to diversify his skills so as to be able to get employment in other striving sectors of the economy. It is also important to cut cost in areas that might not be very important to the family. Instead of buying expensive imported consumables, local substitute might be cheaper. Moving from an expensive apartment to a more affordable one or homeschooling your children if you or your wife has the experience and time might even help cut expenses.Although reducing a country's birthrate might be a good economic strategy, but it has a very costly consequences. It could lead to labor shortage which results to nations depending on immigrants to fill diverse employment gaps. Most nations that promoted the reduction of childbirth has since dropped the policy and citizens are now encouraged to have more children. But it is now very difficult to encourage the citizens to have more children because the society have already been automated to have few children. That is why it is important for the government to support families in this trying times because reduction in birthrate might be beneficial now, but the effect would not be good in future.",

You just have to focus on building instead of complaining.I will remember my home economic teacher saying this is particular of poor home, that the man who has no job and staying at home find his job with his wife and the result is addition of children. Such men can be illiterate to use protection or refusing to use it.",

The father mostly caters for every member of his family in this age. Long where the time where more children means more wealth mostly by farmers who has large portion of farms to farm on. Some of these children turn to there own farming at 18+ and helps the father cater for the family. Not now that at 18 some are just getting into obtaining degree and the father caters for everything.So I will say the act of reducing birth rate now isn't just laziness but cutting cost down and yeah it's a good strategy.

Sadly there isn't much we can do to change thatif you have 1 spoiled child who always got whatever they dreamed of you will end up with 30 yo parasite that continues to live with you and cannot cope with life on his own.If you have 6 children you have little more work. The older ones take care of the younger ones, help around the house and go to work from the age of 18 to raise their and their family's standard of living because he knows that every penny is worth the effort. You don't help your mum when you see, she is watching netflix 2h daily. You don't go to work for minimal wage when you just get iphone worth 2 months of your work, for free, from parents.If it was possible to have 5 kids in 1800 its possible to have it now. People just forget what they really need, and what they need only because its widely advertised and hyped.",

There's no other better source of doing so than to find another income-generating business or a part-time job. That's the reality and we have to deal with inflation because the entire world is experiencing it but, it's much worse these days. And for your friend to complain, the kid didn't choose to be born and made by his parents. So, if they're complaining about how expensive baby products are now. They do something about it or do alternatives like using clothes as a substitute for diapers.",

It takes no effort to pump out as many children as you can when half of them die before the age of 5 and live in absolute poverty.There's a cultural reason for it that preexists the economic hardships which have originated over the last couple of years, but I can imagine the problem's going to get a lot worse now that the global economy is entering a downturn. Has nothing to do with laziness.There's an issue with labor shortages and not enough young workers subsidizing old retired workers. If there's a birth rate collapse, then you're going to have a lot of old folks that are going to be impoverished.",

The \"two-child\" policy has it's advantages and disadvantages. Here is a description of the two child policy ==> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-child_policy\" The problem with low fertility is that it reduces population size not at all ages but only among the young. Low fertility produces an age structure that creates a momentum for future population decline, a situation that must be stopped at some point if the population is to be demographically sustainable. \" - https://www.prb.org/resources/low-fertility-not-politically-sustainable/Lower birth rates = Less consumers = falling working-age populations which mean that there are fewer consumers.",

Based on what I have read, the aim of the program is to further stabilize family welfare and affordable economic balance. Although this rule is not mandatory, you have the right to have more than 2 children if you can afford it. The risk of economic benefits is clear here, the government is trying to control population growth and reduce poverty. Based on the articles I readQuoteWith the family planning program, the community has indirectly planned their family's cash flow because with 2 children parents with a mediocre income can provide proper clothing, shelter, food, and education. This will be inversely proportional to parents who have more than two children, with a mediocre income they will not be able to provide proper clothing, shelter, food, and education for their children.So maybe this program also applies to you and your friends. But there's a saying: by having children, your financial wealth will increase in unexpected ways. Because children are a gift from God, God did not make them in the world, but certainly with their fortune.",

If we reduce the child bearing to the amount we can take care , it will reduce the heat we are feeling from the bad economy experience.Family planing is what really matters, if the economy of your country is getting worst,you should have to adjust your expenses and avoid everything that will make you spend more than your income.The number of children you want to have should be put into consideration based on your income and the present economy situation. If you have two children, and your monthly income can take care of four people including the parents this is family fine. Even though,inflation comes in the family of four can still adjust their cost of living to balance up with the new change. Imagine that this family of four during inflation, adjusted and can still cope with inflation,but if a new child is comes into this family with still the same income,what do you think ? The standard of living will become poor because they are now five in number to manage the same resources that four people were managing.Therefore, if you want to give birth check your income if it will be enough to take care of an additional child,give birth but if it will not,then there is no need of giving birth because if you give birth to a child and can't take good care of that child,it is a sin before God and that child might end up hating you because you didn't give him the life he should have",

The first is the commitment from your friend and his wife in keeping their children healthy and also having enough needs by working in a field they already understand. So this is not only because you have to reduce the number of children born, but also because of more obvious dedications such as work and money even though it has to be accompanied by other small things in a household.",
