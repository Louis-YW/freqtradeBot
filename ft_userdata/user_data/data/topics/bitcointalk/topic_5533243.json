If youre talking about btc ecosytem that runs in the altcoin industry then half of them do but not all can be of help sincr some purely made that out to make some money.  Guess the best answer is bitcoin helping poor country by learning about it and take advantage of it when they do know that now.

Just saying bitcoin is decentralized and has low cost doesn't explain your title at all.This subject is not new. But so far people who like bitcoin think of it as a magic solution to solve every problem. It may be able to do that for individuals but not on a bigger scale for a country. The countries that are poor and with little to no infrastructure are like that for a reason. Bitcoin cannot fix that. The people of that country should find that reason and solve their problems that way.Like el Salvador. Most people think that tiny and poor country's economy improved because they adopted bitcoin. But that was not the reason at all. They found their issues (eg. the gangs and crime rate plus the lack of foreign investors) and started fixing them. THEN their situation started to improve. Bitcoin's contribution to that whole thing is probably less than 10%.",

How if I may ask? Bitcoin is not the solution to countries that are corrupt and can't build their infrastructure from budget allocation that goes into the private accounts of the few or individual who pad budgets to their own benefit.If Bitcoin creates liquidity for individual through long time hodling, will it all create good roads for business and transactional movement, buying and selling that will increase GDP?If Bitcoin creates the investment through P2P arbitrage trading and the country doesn't have electricity which is the engine for manufacturing, don't you think diversification will be a mirage?So the priority of poor countries whose majority of the populace might even be illiterate to Bitcoin or Blockchain technology, is not Bitcoin but good governance that will reengineer the people into developmental milestones.",

Please be informed that Bitcoin fee is dependent on the network congestion.  Since Bitcoin confirmation queue is not first come first serve basis, but rather a competition of who will pay more, I am somehow hesitant to say that Bitcoin transaction or remitance is low cost especially when it will go through a centralized services since on top of the Bitcoin transaction fee, there is also this service fee.  With that in mind, I do not think that Bitcoin remittances will be a low cost one.Aside from that, Bitcoin transaction is instant but confirmation takes 10 minutes in average, so centralized services is much faster when sending a transaction within the same application, and local bank transfers is also almost instant.  The only thing where Bitcoin shine is the international transaction but I believe there are also some services that offers instant transactions in global transfers.QuoteBitcoin can be accessible and use through mobile devices in countries with inadequate infrastructures, for payment if been ligalise. Same goes with financing applications.  The best thing with Bitcoin is that we can transfer our funds without asking the third party approval if we do a blockchain transfer.Quote from: Joy- maker on February 24, 2025, 09:33:44 PMCould you also believe that  bitcoin related projects can make poor countries develop their internet infrastructures, improving connectivity and access to informations, if been ligalise. I have not seen such a thing in my country, because Bitcoin-related projects often falls under financial services, while internet connections falls under technology and communication.There is no doubt that Bitcoin technology offers a variety of opportunities to everyone, the main concern would be the leaders of the government since they are the one who gives a go signal on which regulations and projects to implement.",

This is not about legalizing bitcoin as an acceptable means of making payments or a legal tender by any country as the major challenge, but how they are going to maneuver their opportunity from taking this step to develop their country for good, am going to site in two examples for you to take a look at, Bitcoin has been made a legal tender in El-Salvador and Central Africa Republic, but is it obvious that El-Salvador had plans already in place for its decision and that is why they never for once regret taking this decision on bitcoin use, whereas things have almost remained the same in Central Africa Republic after it's own adoption, all because the necessary plan before the strike in action take effects were not in place, Bitcoin can help improve on any challenging economy of a country, only if the leaders and the people will all work towards a common goal to acheive what bitcoin has to offer, but most of our leaders may not allow for this.",

Poor countries have their issues nationwide that need to be resolved first. Like if they have problems with infrastructures for the Internet, they have to fix it, and Bitcoin can not help Internet infrastructures there. The same with other social, economic, political things in those nations, that are not Bitcoin responsibility and Bitcoin can not help.After they fix national problems, they can join Bitcoin party as Bitcoin miners like Bhutan or purely investors like El Salvador. They have to change themselves and their nations first, then Bitcoin is accessible for them to boost changes and can be one of contributors to their national economic growth and other improvements.",

What role will Bitcoin play in a country's economy to impact their economy? Like El-Salvador, they have accepted bitcoin as legal tender and what problem has bitcoin solved for their economy when their problem is crime, lack of jobs...? Does Bitcoin create jobs or help them crack down on crime? If bitcoin can save the El-Salvador economy, why should they accept the deal with the IMF and borrow money from them?Many individuals, organizations...have been able to improve their economic situation through bitcoin but when it comes to a country's economy, this is a different and much bigger issue. And to improve the country's economy, we need to find out the causes and appropriate solutions.

At one point, we might think that Bitcoin will help poor countries but I think it wasn't much of a help for El Salvador. Sure, it did a good job but it wasn't something spectacular. Btw on the other hand, to my mind, blockchain technologies have a good chance to help poor countries. For example, in my country we started early adoption and development of blockchain technologies, successfully implemented them in different sectors, and one of the most important adoption was done in land title registry.The development and adoption of blockchain technologies brought some investors to our country and created an opportunity for local people, to become blockchain developers and get a high-paying jobs.",
