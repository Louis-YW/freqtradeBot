      "body": "Welcome onboard. It is nice having you here. From your post,it seems like you are a trader and if you do trading of goods and services, I expect you to have a an office where you work from clearly stated here. Tell us your mode of Operations here let us know and how you carry out your trading. State things or goods you trade on so we have knowledge of what you do and approached you for a deal would be ok since we have seen what you deal on otherwise we see you as a random hustler that does everything which is not alright. Be specific in your areas of dealing and also be transparent. Put your means of payment and payment range based on dealings as well your service charges too.For the Idea of escrow that's nice but I would suggest it be a reputable member of this platform otherwise I do not think members would deal of the escrow is not known figure here.",
