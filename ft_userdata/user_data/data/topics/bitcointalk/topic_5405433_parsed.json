Most have been ruled as suicides or murder-suicides, but the deaths have prompted some suspicion. QuoteIn February, police found Gazprom executive Alexander Tyulyakov hanged in his St. Petersburg garage, Novaya Gazeta reported. Police questioned the authenticity of a suicide note found near his body, per the outlet.QuoteA few months later in April, Russian oligarchs Sergey Protosenya and Vladislav Avayev were found dead alongside the bodies of their wives and children in separate incidents discovered one day apart.It seems that the current dictator of the RF has not heard about firing people from their jobs, so he rather fires them in the most strict sense of the word. I hope they get a good life insurance... well... sometimes their wife and children are also killed, so maybe not. This simply shows how the RF is currently ruled: gang style and offers that \"you cannot reject\".",

Yuri Voronvov, founder of Astra shipping, a logistics company in charge of Gazprom contracts was found dead in his upscale home in Peski with a pistol lying by his side. It was gathered that two of these execs know a thing about the company's financial flow. Avayev before his demise was the  Former vice president of Gazprom bank. The question is who did this and why?",

      "body": "Isn't it interesting how Russians mysteriously die with the traditional, unsuspicious, two shots to the back of the head suicide death with at typed suicide note? Coincidence, surely. Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning was really the epitome of Russian brazenness. Having no respect for borders and pushing their assassins to carry out the dirty work of the Kremlin in foreign lands means they wouldn't hesitate to kill a few energy execs if it mean preserving their precious oil enterprise. Not much of a conspiracy anymore.",
