Satoshi Nakamoto welcomed everyone to the new BitcoinTalk forum on November 22, 2009 (06:04:28PM). Almost 13 years have passed today on November 22, 2024.Even today we remember the great man who created this forum and Bitcoin. Maybe as long as Bitcoin and this forum exist, the people of this world will remember him with reverence. He is a true legend.",

What's interesting is that today bitcoin has also reached its highest price in history, which is $ 99,419, this can be interpreted as an extraordinary celebration for this forum too.Because with this forum bitcoin can also be like it is now, growing, growing and continuing to grow until later many countries adopt bitcoin.Thank you very much, my friend, for remembering it, because this is also new information for me personally.",

Tbh it's a great achievement for me that I've managed to stay here despite having dips in the market. My efforts during the merits days is really worth it.Crypto dont focus on money, itâ€™s about being part of a community that goes against traditional systems, and tbh, Iâ€™m proud to be part of that.Itâ€™s made me think differently (see things on the other side of the world, not corpo things), learn how to adapt when things donâ€™t go as planned, and spot opportunities where most people just see risks. I quitted my job because I gained big on crypto, and my skills are also mistreated in the corpo world. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m happy freelancing alongside crypto was normalized, it really worked out in our favor. Especially during the pandemic, crypto was a lifesaver for me. Watching how this space grew from being misunderstood to something thatâ€™s now recognized globally feels like being part of history. Let's go 100k!!!!",
