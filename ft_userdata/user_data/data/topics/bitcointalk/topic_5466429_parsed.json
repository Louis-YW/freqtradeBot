The bots are only introduced to grab money from the pockets of the naive traders because they don't know trading themselves and they want a solution that could make them money automatically. Those investors often lose a lot of money by putting their money in the hands of the ones who can control the bot and who can run away with their money. I think it's useless to even try a bot if you really want to earn some good profits because bots aren't profitable at all and anyone who puts his/her money in the hands of a non human bot is just throwing that money into fire.",

You've never heard of it before because it's a new project that they just launched. OP is just promoting his/her product like what most of the newbies out here are doing. Creating a thread, asking a question, and then in the end, they'll make a pitch regarding their project that they're shilling with the newbies out there. No difference at all. Intend to introduce a futures trading bot on \"DISCORD, and TELEGRAM\"? 2 of the platforms where scamming are happening the most especially in Telegram. This is a red flag for me already although I'm quite curious in the fact that they can enable long and short on various on-chain assets.I guess I'll just hope that OP will market this project successfully, and it will not be a scam project in the future. As to your question, it still depends because after all, these bots are being programmed, and they don't know what can still happen in the future. Will they know if the market will go down really hard in the next few weeks? No. Are trading bots worth using? I guess so because I didn't tried it yet TBH. The real question is \"Are trading bots dependable when it comes to crypto trading?\" and the answer to that is a big NO. I'm not saying though that trading bots aren't useful, and profitable still, but instead of using bots, why not just trade for yourself, and don't use them.",

It's still your money in the end.Bots are still helpful, but like every developer's pet peeve out there, it is just a tool in the end and people shouldn't rely on it too much. We're already being replaced by AI anyway. /s Plus another worth taking note is that bot is still programmed by someone and it can only do what it was programmed to do unless it is an AI.
