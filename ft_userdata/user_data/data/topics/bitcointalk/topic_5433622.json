Doesn't matter how much money someone holds, there's no way to know it unless the owner decides to publicize it. The anonymity is one of the best features of bitcoin. But I think it is a pool address and a really large pool with lots of industrial miners. It is almost impossible for a single human being controlling such a huge amount of bitcoins.",

These types of miners are often able to solve blocks faster and more frequently than smaller operations, which allows them to earn a larger number of block rewards.It's also possible that the miner is part of a mining pool, which is a group of miners who combine their computing resources to increase their chances of finding a block. When a block is found, the rewards are distributed among the members of the pool according to the amount of computing power they contributed.",

Most mining pools tag blocks that they have mined by including their own name or a similar identifier in this data. For some reason, blockchain.com is not accurately extracting the Foundry tag from these blocks and displaying it on their website.However, there will also be other miners that blockchain.com will be failing to properly identify, and there will be blocks which are not tagged by any miner at all, which will also be shown as \"unknown\".The best thing to do would be to look up the block on a good explorer such as mempool.space (https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000003362b9ce3fca0becc7657ed1221bc058f179fa6a94b99), and read the decoded data under the heading \"Coinbase (Newly Generated Coins)\" in the first transaction.",
