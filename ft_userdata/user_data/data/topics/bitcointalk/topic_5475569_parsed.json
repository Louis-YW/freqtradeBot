  "content": "I'm going through libsecp256k1 and noticed a new change which is strange.secp256k1_fe_set_b32_mod method name and comment suggest that it reduces the value mod p and the result is supposed to be r ≡ a (mod p)https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/c1b4966410a81162bf9404ec84e69a85e1e23469/src/field.h#L192But looking at the implementations they don't actually perform any reduction. It's just a simple conversion from byte[] to uint[] in radix 26 or 52.For example:https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/c1b4966410a81162bf9404ec84e69a85e1e23469/src/field_10x26_impl.h#L293How the method is called(?):https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/c1b4966410a81162bf9404ec84e69a85e1e23469/src/field_impl.h#L258After this commit the library seems to still use the old method (secp256k1_fe_set_b32_limit method so I don't think anything is changed there) except herehttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/5b32602295ff7ad9e1973f96b8ee8344b82f4af0#diff-6f71b0372be086d45b4f2740508c03a21835d87008840032fbb767f419fd988aAnd this \"assumption\" that the secp256k1_fe_set_b32_mod reduces the result is new.Am I missing something or is this a mistake?Edit: fixed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/77af1da9f631fa622fb5b5895fd27be431432368",
