You should post as many references as possible to get a good project from your client on the forum. Without proper no one will trust you that you have the real experience.",

      "body": "Sometimes I wonder if people really do know what they are doing. This post got me  thinking if the OP really got the years of experience he or she claimed from the post as I have read.  Scanty introduction with no tangible thing to hold unto. No  portfolio to back up claims, OP is not ready for business because I see no sign of seriousness from this post. OP forgot this is a public platform and first approach matters because that is what project you to the masses and here you are making a very big error of not putting up your past works for easy viewing so that your prospective clients would derive satisfaction from what they have seen and possibly pushing further with you to having a deal. I suggest you edit this post with your past experience to back it up.",
