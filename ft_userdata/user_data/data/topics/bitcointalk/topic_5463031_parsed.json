  "content": "Quote from:  A curated list of non-kyc cryptocurrency services:  [Clearnet] & [Tor Mirror]  https://i.ibb.co/wC6rzhV/banner.webpKYCNOT.ME is an open-source list of alternatives for buying, exchanging, trading, and using cryptocurrencies without having to disclose your identity, helping to preserve the essence of cryptocurrencies, which is decentralized, self-governed and private.About page | Tor onion | Blog | Mastodon | Source code  Why?Bitcoin was made to revolutionize the way we pay for goods and services, aiming to get rid of the trust on centralized entities such as banks and governments that control our economy.Exchanges that enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) rules operate similarly to traditional banks. Users are required to provide identification, such as a photo of their ID, to use these exchanges. Moreover, most of these exchanges are centralized, taking custody of user's funds. These requirements contradict the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.UsageJust visit KYCNOT.ME and browse the services. You can use the search bar to find particular types of services; for example, is I wanted to find VPN services, I can type \"vpn\" and it will show me all the services that offer a VPN service. Other filters are available, such as accepted payment methods filter, or type filter.Each service has a page. The page shows a description, links to the service and a series of information about that service:Point list - This is a list of the features (and anti-features) of the service. You can click on any point to see the point page, there you will find a description about it and all the related services to it. It's also possible to request new points to be added.ToS scrapper - An automated tool scrapes all the service's ToS every day, trying to find any fragments of the ToS that are related to KYC. You will find this in the last section of the service page.> Request a serviceRequesting services is done through the request form available at the request page. Just fill the form and submit, I will receive a ping and a new issue will be automatically created on GitLab. The service will then appear in the pending services list. After a review of the listing, it may get listed or discussed in the said issue.The approval process is manual, so it may be a bit slow for me to check everything, test and take a decision. This means a service can be a somewhat long time on the \"pending\" page.> Discuss a serviceIf you find any discrepancies, outdated information, or suspect fraudulent activities related to a service, you can share this information publicly via the service's GitLab issue. You can access each service's issue page on kycnot.me by clicking the \"Discuss this service\" button on the respective service's page. I will then review it and engage in a discussion about it, so we can jointly decide on the appropriate course of action. It is crucial that these discussions occur in the public domain to ensure transparency and maintain a public record of the decision-making process, for this, GitLab issues were chosen.> Follow a serviceIf you are a service owner or just interested in a particular service, you can subscribe to the particular GitLab issue for that service. Anytime someone posts a comment on the issue, you will receive a notification.",

Note that I think Kucoin exchange started to ask for mandatory KYC verification and I think you should consider removing it from your website.",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think these were visible in the old site.If it were possible to further filter the \"Services\" part by type of service, such as vpn, hosting, phone whatever, that would be even better.

I will add a `/delisted` list or something, so this is visible with all the information about the delisting. You can currently visit https://kycnot.me/audit to see database changes, but it will only show when the status of an exchange changes (i.e. status changes from \"1\" (listed) to \"-1\" (delisted)).",
