  "content": "Imagine a technology which is able to detect fakes, imitators, duplicates, copycats, etc. through something as simple as scanning with your phone. The scanning app is free for your phone and I made a video playing around with the app and the accuracy of the duplicate detection.Will the algorithm detect a duplicate with a slight alteration?Will the algorithm detect something very different?Check it out in this YouTube video I made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TlDE69Tmms.I discovered the 3DPass project in the ANN thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382009.0.Since then I believed so much in the project that I became the community rep for Europe and I am doing my part in believing, creating and providing!I encourage you to just play around with the free app, what do you have to lose?No financial advice but if this tech takes off it will be huge, think how much money is lost in the global economy to counterfeits.There are many more use cases and currently the only limit is your creativity!",
