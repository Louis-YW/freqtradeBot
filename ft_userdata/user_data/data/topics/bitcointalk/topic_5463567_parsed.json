  "content": "Hey there! I'm Prethesh, a developer with some experience in crypto projects. I've gotten my hands dirty with Evm, Eosio/antelope, and even developed smart contracts on these chains.Right now, my buddy and I We're building a fully functional blockchain, and we're doing it with Nodejs and Go lang.What sets us apart? We're working on something called PoUw, or proof of useful work. It's a fresh take on the old Nakamoto consensus. But here's the twist: instead of crunching meaningless hash/puzzles, we're channeling 90% of our hashing power into something genuinely helpful ( approach to solving real-world problems). Think AI data training or helping machine learning neural networks learn.It's still early days, and we're fitting this project around our regular jobs (gotta pay the bills, after all). But we're passionate and committed.Want to know more? Drop into our Telegram channel, and stay tuned for updates. We'd love to have you on board!https://t.me/pouwcoin",
