It is not an oversight, and to be sincere, I think the feature is a good one when you consider some situations which leads users into leaving trust and distrust feedbacks, some of this situations are not permanent and so the trusts or distrust earned based on that situation shouldn't be permanent too, a user who left a distrust rating on a situation that later got resolved either needs to edit or delete his distrust rating, and if the user who left the distrust rating is banned, it becomes a problem for the user who's account was distrusted by the banned user.....So indeed the ability for banned user to still edit or delete their trust rating even while their account is in banned state, is really useful.",

I agree with you that it's a good thing to give even banned members a chance to delete posted trust feedback. But I seriously doubt that people that get banned would care about things like that. I am leaning more towards thinking that a banned user would do their best to get a pardon. And if that doesn't work, they wouldn't care less what happens to the forum, including things like trust. Do we have any stats how many banned members did such trust changes? A percentage maybe? It's probably a difficult thing to find but I know we have many stats enthusiasts here. LoyceV?",

The issue is: should it be allowed?Keeping the ban aside, his suspected alt-accounts have also played their part in open or subtle ways too. He is not the only one there are too many members that have manipulated the trust system for a long time.A couple of years ago there was a massive push from members of a particular language board (that I will not name) trying to become merit source as well as on DT. A lot of manipulation and nonsense was going on that time then after several months it subsided.This user was trying to use his account to climb up the ladder as soon as possible in order to jump on signature campaigns and was willing to become pals with any and all for it.
