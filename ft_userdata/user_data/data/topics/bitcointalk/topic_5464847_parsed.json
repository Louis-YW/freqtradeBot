I keep getting them mixed up whenever I try to have a grasp of them.Open source wallets are wallets that there source code which they are built from are open to the public and also open to modify by developers, this way you know exactly everything about the wallet and also any future modifications. Closed source are those that hidden from the public and should any modifications are done you wouldn’t know, so that is why open source wallets like Electrum are mostly adviced to use and closed source like Trustwallet are adviced against Hardware are physical wallets that are used to store bitcoin seeds and keys, they look just like your USB drive example is trezo wallet  while the software wallets just like the software name it’s self are wallets that are installed on computer and mobile devices, they also have there own private keys example is the electrum, BlueWallet and also trustwallet. Online wallet are wallets that are connected to internet or on device that are connected to internet a clear example is the software wallet above. Offline wallet are wallets that off the internet and are on device that are not connected to it, they only come online just to sign or send a transaction. The best wallet to use is an hardware wallet that is open source or an online wallet like electrum but airgapped",

Antonopoulos' YouTube channe[1]l, as it is free and contains technical information in a simplified manner.The difference between these wallets is simple. The wallet[2] is a software that manages the private key. If the code of this software is open to all and can be reviewed, then it is open source, otherwise it is closed source. If the private key is generated in a separate environment and with secure elements, then it is a hardware wallet. If the private keys are located on a device connected to the Internet,  it is an online wallet[1] https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet",

Open source wallets are some wallets which is the most secured online wallets than close source wallets because in open source Wallets everyone can see the source codes and modify it. But for close source wallets source codes aren't visible to all and you have to trust the developers blindly. So obviously you will prefer open source Wallets that close source wallets. Some open source Wallets are Electrum ,Mycelium, Blue Wallet etc. Electrum is my choice and it's the most popular too.Another question is Online wallets and offline wallets which are similar to software wallets and Hardware wallets. When you are using your internet connection to use it and another one is offline wallet which means hardware wallet where you have no need of internet. Obviously Hardware wallets are the safest crypto wallet and they are pretty expensive too. If someone is holding a huge amount of Bitcoin he must use Hardware Wallets which will ensure the best security of his funds.",

After all this, I am still yet to understand the concept of open/closed wallet, software/hardware wallet, online/offline wallet. I keep getting them mixed up whenever I try to have a grasp of them.Open Wallet:The wallet that is open source means the code of the wallet is open to the public. This wallet is known as an open source wallet. Any developer or person could observe the code and analyse it for any backdoors or observations. Open wallets are the most preferred wallets to use, such as the Electrum wallet.Close Wallet:The fact that the wallet is not open to observe and analyze the code means we do not have any access to the underlying code of the wallet, so we do not know if they are keeping track of our assets, keys, data, etc. These wallets are not preferred, as they could have accessed our wallet without our knowledge. An example is Trust Wallet.Software and hardware wallets:Software are the ones like Trust Wallet and Electrum Wallet, which act as software and could be used as programmes on your mobile or PC. Hardware wallets are most preferred for holding purposes or if the amount is huge.Online and offline wallets (cold or hot wallets):These terms are almost the same and could be used interchangeably. Let's say you are using a software wallet; thus, that wallet is also known as an online wallet and a hot wallet too. But if you are using a wallet like a hardware wallet, then you could call that wallet a cold wallet or offline wallet because it will not be running all the time, whereas Trust wallet will run as long as your phone or any other device is online. I hope you understand the meaning of all of them.",

Being online or offline has nothing to do with how much you run your wallet. A wallet is offline if your keys are generated and kept offline. Even if your hardware wallet is always connected to your computer and it's always running, your wallet is still offline. In the case you use electrum to generate a wallet on an online device, it can't be considered as a cold wallet even if you delete your wallet immediately and never use it again.",

After all this, I am still yet to understand the concept of open/closed wallet, software/hardware wallet, online/offline wallet. I keep getting them mixed up whenever I try to have a grasp of them.You could easily find the definitions of these wallets, but if you are looking for a more easy way to understand them, then I would suggest you search for them and use them, which you could do for free. For example, to understand the concepts of open source and closed source wallets, you must know that open source means that it is open to everyone. It does not mean that everyone could use it; instead, everyone could see the code used to make it. While the opposite is true in close source, no one will suggest you use a close source wallet as it might contain flaws or codes that might be faulty.Software and hardware Wallets are so easy to understand, which means that just like the simple difference between hardware and software, the same difference goes for wallets. There are many wallets, which are physical devices specially made to store assets. And the best way to store assets is with hardware wallets, which are open source.Online are the ones that are active all the time on the internet, while offline are the opposite of online. There are more to wallets than you might expect. Which are custodial and non-custodial wallets and hot and cold wallets. So learn about them too. Learning such things will help you understand why people used to say \"\"Not your key, not your coin.",

Investing in Bitcoin is so simple that you don't need someone's to walk you through everything, all you need is where to get the Bitcoin, where to store them and  if you didn't use the right wallet in the beginning, you can always adjust to a more secured wallets as you gained knowledge on wallets. Nobody actually knew everything about bitcoin before they made their first investment.

Seeing the posts above me have done justice to your questions I won't bother going into much details but just give you the simplest advice. No wallet is safe from hackers as it all depends on how secure you're because using a hardware wallets and still been careless with your private information can put your coins in the wallet at risk and the same goes for every other wallets. As you're a newbie I'll recommend you start with using Electrum Bitcoin Wallet, it ticks every box of been a perfect Bitcoin wallet except the fact that it isn't a hardware wallet but that's find.",
