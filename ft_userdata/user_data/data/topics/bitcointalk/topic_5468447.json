  "content": "What happened:: Hey BTC talk, first time poster here.I've been lurking for a while and signed up to a few crypto casinos thanks to the lovely help from people on here. One such site recommended was the domain sportbet.one.They had a welcome bonus to which i deposited 0.3 eth (around $500) and received 125% on top. I had to wager this X amount of times which I completed last night. It was almost exclusively done on the sports book, at their odds.Today i woke up to find my bonus had been cancelled (after I'd wagered the required amount). I went on live chat and they said management had cited the following terms:1. No minimal risk betting2. No more than 1 account per person/Ip etc3. No more than 1 bonus per person/Ip etcI asked them what I'd actually done, and they just kept repeating the above. Apparently I've broken all of these terms!Firsty, I don't even know what on earth minimal risk betting is. I was placing 1 bet on a match/game, then another on another game etc, so that is just outright false.Secondly, I've never had an account with these guys as I was only made aware of them about a week ago.Thirdly, it's convenient they waited for me to spin up my balance before cancelling the bonus fraudlently!My ending balance was around $5,500, so they've stoled $5k USD from me for absolutely no reason. It's outright fraud.Does anybody know what I can do in this situation? I know they are unregulated, but are there any means I can sue the owners? As I can't find any information on them anywhere but I'm willing to take this right until the end if so. This is actually a criminal offence.Please, any help would be appreciated guys and gals!https://gyazo.com/36c2425f093657035a4be44bf22a1905https://gyazo.com/c6f894fa09f5c140247162ec2c32ddb6Scammers Profile Link: http://www.sportbet.oneReference Link: https://gyazo.com/36c2425f093657035a4be44bf22a1905https://gyazo.com/c6f894fa09f5c140247162ec2c32ddb6Amount Scammed: $5,000 USDPayment Method: ETHProof of Payment: https://gyazo.com/0212dc1c77355b4762c45d9c079d2c9bPM/Chat Logs: Conveniently chat has been disabled on my account and I cannot contact them nowAdditional Notes:",

Seems to be Mwali though, so not sure how much bearing complaining to them will have but still worth a try.What I'd really like to do is to find out information about the owners and pursue them legally. I will get in touch with my local law firm on Monday and keep you guys posted.",

They actually do offer a decentralized option. As for how OP's fund being confiscated despite their claim of being decentralized, thus the funds should be directly from their wallet, not deposited into the platform, I believe it's because OP use the traditional option, as proven by the bonus being provided [it's offered to the traditional method, not the decentralized one] and becoming the root of his problem",

      "body": "Hi guys. To clarify the situation, the topic starter violated several bonus rules https://sportbet.one/rules/bonus:1. All customer offers are limited to one per person, family, household address, email address, telephone number, IP, or shared computer, e.g. public library or workplace.- Our anti-fraud team detected that it wasn't his 1st try of bonus hunting.2. Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one account with sportbet.one in order to claim any bonuses is deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated funds.- Our anti-fraud team detected that this player had several accounts on our sportsbook previously.3. Minimal risk bets on any games (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same round to create \"action\" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing the wagering requirement. Examples of minimal risk bets include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette and betting player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat.- The player made several bets on opposite outcomes.So the bonus was canceled.As I can see, several members asked about the decentralized nature of sportbet.one. The answer is yes, we are a decentralized platform on EOS blockchain. You can bet directly from EOS crypto wallets without registration and deposits. Considering the low adoption of web3 and EOS blockchain we have added the standard registration as well.",

They offer a \"lucrative bonus\" with insane rules to get these bonus available to withdraw. And even if you manage to complete the requested wager and whatever they might come and talk about some problems or violations.If he is a bonus abuser he could have been flagged when he registered or latest when he claimed the bonus. But now, they wait if he loses the money and in case he wins they then start what we see now.Basically they offer him a lose - lose situation, lose the deposit/bonus, get 0. Play through and get some profit, get 0. Freerolling the customer is the oldest page in the book for sites like this one.",
