  "content": "Firstly, I am here to share an idea on how to detect a scammer. I believe that this thread will be of good help to almost some of us, mostly the crypto newbies in this forum that are seeking crypto advice from other sources on the internet. Please, it would be a very good idea to refer this idea to some of our members, friends and even some of our relatives that are into crypto.Foremost, you go to grabify.link click on create URL  and paste any link of your choice inside the space  and then click on  agree and continue, then the site will automatically generate a link for you just like this , all you have to do is just to copy the link and send it to the so-called scammer that is pretending to be a legit source.After some minute i.e. up to 10 to 20 minutes later, you can go back to the recent page on the site and refresh it  you will see the scammer IP provider, just click on it for a proper view, like this  with this you can be able to see the scammer IP address, location, browser and even the device the scammer is using to scam people.I believe that this will be of good help to many of us. For proper understanding about this idea, please visit the source",

I mean, how are you sure if it's showing you the real IP address, location, device ID, etc.? Have you actually tested it on your phone or computer? I suggest you test it first, if not. If you have, then surely it will be of great help to locate a scammer. I have seen a similar tool in a telegram bot. You have to host an image, give the hosting link to the bot. And it will use some kind of tool inject the code and give you a new link. When you send that link to a person if he clicks on that, you'll get all his information.",

The IP address will provide you with basic information such as the country, geolocation, and at best a map of the user’s movements, and without cooperating with the service provider or with law enforcement agencies in your country, the IP address is not sufficient to access information such as home address, name, phone number, or any personal information.This is whether scammer is in your country but what will happen if he is in another country. Here you need security cooperation between the two countries or an attempt to arrest him using INTERPOL, which are things that will not happen if someone defrauds you of $100.I do not want to be pessimistic, but even if you know personal information such as his real name, passport and home address, you may not easily be able to recover the money.If you want to avoid scam, be prepared to ask many questions before sending.

By this, you also reduce questions you might have to ask yourself or your trade partner.Using Escrow service is a good advice and even with Escrow, only release your bitcoin if you already received payment from a trade partner. Without payment, no release. Under any kind of pressure from your trade partner, don't release. Because creating pressure is art of scammers.",

It is rare to find someone who has high trust, is online most of the time, and has a good exchange rate. Mostly, those with low trust are the ones who offer better exchange rates or services to attract customers. Sometimes the risk saves you a few dollars and  maybe makes it easier for you to be scammed.It is true that it is almost impossible to avoid scam but at least do not let them scam you more than once.",
