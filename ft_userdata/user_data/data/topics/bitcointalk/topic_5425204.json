It means it will surely be worth your time as it might possibly help you too in your chosen career in the future, not just for trading activity and related work. Learning to code is a bit tough and the ability to learn and understand all programming languages is not for everybody. That's the reason why work related to it was associated with a high salary, in most cases.But if we talk about trading strategies, there's a chance that what you or your program can generate, might not be effective as the market is speculative. The said program though can give those possible scenarios that will happen and that's the time we can create a set of strategies for each of those given scenarios.I think a usual trading bot is not designed to generate trading strategies but rather to execute an action in real time once a certain condition is met that is set by its users. Therefore, the trading strategy still came from the user and the bot just followed a command.If you will able to make such a program that can automate some trading strategies and execute the best strategies based on its AI analysis, that is something a game-changer although since the market is speculative, a chance of losing is still possible.",

Support and resistance programming might be the best sort of thing to program this way, as well as simple things like price alerts.You'd probably find it useful familiarising yourself with markup languages too for how requests might be returned (such as HTML, XML and json but only a small one).",

Nothing really complicated.Keep in mind one thing. It’s easier and seems profitable when you are back testing but if you run it’s in real time your results might be different due to slippage and liquidity issues. You might not get the desired fills you want when in a backtest you would. Not perfect results.",

There are already some trading bots available out there, some of them are even open source that you can use.In any case, any modern programming language would work. Python that you mentioned is an easy language to learn. I personally went for C# since I had some background and the language specifics made more sense (strongly typed object oriented design). I wrote some stuff that helped me in some trading strategies (like arbitrage) a couple of years ago when I used to spend more time in the market.",

My best decision ever. My first program ever made in python start to earn after 12 hours of coding. Build from 0 my own market making strategy. It was full of bugs and requires constant care but it give me a nice kink to continue to upgrade it because it was already earing. I was never as motivated to work as that days because every upgrade made my bot earn faster and made the algorithm need less attention. After few weeks it was running 24/7. 15 min daily was all i had to do to calibrate it to current market situation. The feeling that you wake up in the morning and see that your bot has made 20 profitable trades is amazing.All you need is:https://www.w3schools.com/python/Exchange api documentation f.e biannce api:https://www.binance.com/en/binance-apiIf you dont know how to do something there are a lot of tutorials. just type \"how to sort in python\" \"how to xx in python\" and you will have dozens of tutorials.You can also start with youtube python video. Something like:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh",

If your trading system is very good and you have less time for trading, then automated trading is for you. Yet, you could contract this out to people that are in that field for a stipend unless you have other reasons to learn to code.

Having a good knowledge in programming will be a bonus mark to your trading Carter because you will easily understand how must of all these indicators we are using to predict the market works. This will already give you a broad shoulder to understand how to fix your strategies to work and aline which the way you are trading to give you a perfect and suitable result. As a coder and a trader, you have better opportunity to work with companies that needed a coder and also create your own indicator which you can sell to the market.",

I don't think as well that it's only Python that can be used to do the bots but most and plenty of these trading bots are build using python. Better to take the chance.",

The op has a reason or purpose on why he will learn coding and not just he will learn it out of curiosity. After he is done about his main intention, he can also apply for a coding job so that he can earn even better aside from trading.It is still possible to automate trading or apply the strategies you have in the trading software without even learning how to code because they are user/newbie friendly but some of them might cause money but it's okay because at least, we can avoid a lot of hassle.",

I am a trader since 10 years more or less and I have only recently started learning Python. But my reasoning for Python is not creating trading bots or automated trading bots but rather to create an AI trading bot. I have been told Python is the best for starting out in AI but I myself am a novice so I cannot really give you any certain guarantees on how useful Python will be and whether there is a better alternative for AI beginners.",

This might not be easy though because you need to be more professional here when it comes to the codes but if you are so eager to learn about this thing better to look for a course that can fit your expectation and can feed you good information. For me this is worth it, and very few traders show their interest about the codes so this can be a good market for you.",

Can you create an algorithm that describes your strategy with pseudocode or does your strategy depends too much on your gut feeling? If it is the former then there is a good chance that given enough time you can create a bot that trades exactly like you, and about the specific programming language, as long as you can communicate with the API of the exchange then any language is fine, however Python is known for its clarity and simplicity so it is a good choice if you ask me.",
