Yes we can check but it is limited to our own transaction and wallet history but if we want to check the details if block, sender wallet address or checking of current fee then we have to go for explorer.

You can import a Bitcoin public address and check its balance as well as transaction history. It's undeniable that block explorers make it more easier to randomly check any address without any more step or storage on your device like with Watch-only wallets.[Tutorial]How to monitor multiple addresses without Insert seed and keyQuotehmm, I never used Tor for using Bitcoin explore, Indeed i don't care much about our privacy but thanks for suggestions.

Each person, unique need so there is a list of Bitcoin block explorers for everyone to choose.I discussed about mempool.space there about its color theme. There is a solution for it as guided by NotATether with his post.Additionally, it seems the owner of jochen-hoenicke.de website decided to create a mirror of it at another domain name. I guess the mempool prefix can help the site more easily to appear on top of searching results.https://mempool.jhoenicke.de/#BTC,24h,weightQuote from: tranthidung on August 29, 2023, 11:30:53 AMI prefer to use Jochen-hoenicke.de website when I need to check mempools too.Two reasons why I dislike mempool.space website.It is very bad designed, bad organized in fee rate bands' colors. Their color bands are mixing from hot to cold colors that is annoying already. Moreover, they use hot colors at bottom and cold at top. We know, most expensive fee rates are considered as 'dead' ones. They should use hot colors like red flags. I don't get ideas why mempool.space team designed like that or perhaps they see low fee rates as red flags.In the past, their chart is static, not dynamic. Static means when I hover a mouse on their chart, fee rates won't be updated. It is not dynamic like Jochen-hoenicke.de website. Recent months (around 2021 or 2022), they updated their chart to be a dynamic one but I still dislike it because of color bands.Static chart: https://web.archive.org/web/20210811200553/https://mempool.space/graphs#24hDynamic chart: https://web.archive.org/web/20220823122230/https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool",

Are you surprised?  I am sure not surprised learning for the second time that the first bitcoin block Explorer was built by theymos, I've read about this outside this forum one time, and that was even how I discovered this forum.And from the look of the first bitcoin block Explorer as shown in the shot you posted, I do not think a lot changed so far, aside from background and text designs, fonts, more css properties, more functionalities through programming languages used.Alot of the changes will probably be in the back end, for the front end, it's possibly still the same arrangement with little or minor readjustments here and there.All the same, kudos to how far technology have brought us.",

The owner of Liraz site is Lira Siri (Twitter/ X). His account on Bitcointalk is liraz.Lira Siri runs the Bitcoin block explorer for a while until May or June 2020 before made some change and later turned it to Joseon ExplorerSource of the information[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20120308072440/http://blockexplorer.com/Some screenshots for above information.Blockchain.info possibly a second Bitcoin block explorer in history.It was run by piuk.
