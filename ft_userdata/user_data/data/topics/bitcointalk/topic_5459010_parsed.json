  "content": "Disclaimer: this topic serves as a reference for my neutral feedback on Timelord2067, since trust ratings have limited spaceRecently, Timelord2067 has started to spread lies about me in Meta, where he spammed his off-topic lies in my topic about self-moderation. I'm creating this topic here now because littering existing topics with off-topic spam is what trolls do. Timelord2067 claimed: Quote from: Timelord2067 on July 06, 2023, 11:27:38 PMSo you admit your PM to me was just a Troll post?Your responses so far are proof positive why we need moderated threads to prevent trolls like you from detailing threads.I'll place you on ignore so you don't send me more of your paranoid PM'sHis claims are 100% wrong, because he was the one sending me unsolicited PM's. He did that repeatedly, in two acts, just few days apart: First act: June 06, 2023, 06:10:35 AM was when Timelord2067 started to write me an unsolicited PM, where he asked me a question about a DT flag. So, he started to spam me with unsolicited PM's.   Because I'm a honest person, I've answered his reply 3 hours later: June 06, 2023, 09:10:12 PMBut he sent me a PM back, again an unsolicited PM on June 06, 2023, 10:00:09 PM. Discussion was settled for me, so no reply needed. Second act: Timelord2067 sent me again an unsolicited PM on June 09, 2023, 02:40:11 AM, where he asked me another question of his deranged trust issues.  Because I'm a honest person, I've replied to him on June 09, 2023, 09:00:31 PM answering his question. Because his left trust on the established accounts in question (he only wanted to shit on these accounts), I've been pretty clear, when I've expressed my opposition to his fraudulent left trust telling him that his left trust on these accounts is \"inappropriate, wrong and / or completely misleading\". After his massive misbehaviour I included a sentence, where I've condemned his perv activities. Obviously, he felt offended as he spammed me with another 4-5 PM's after that. That included even more unsolicited PM spam, where he asked me to review his 3100+ left trust feedbacks, in a PM from June 09, 2023, 10:21:28 PM, where he asked me about it. I've told him in my reply from June 09, 2023, 10:27:42 PM to open a topic in Reputation if he cares about other people's opinions regarding his left feedbacks.  But he continued to spam me with unsolicited PM's: Maybe I should have reported these right away as he is a disgusting troll and a waste of time. While I've always tried to stay friendly, he bombarded me back with unsolicited PM spam, asking even more questions (First act and second act). My PM's always have been only a reaction to his unsolicited PM spam. Now, he accuses me of exactly what he did there.  In addition, Timelord2067 is a perv, multiple liar and rightfully distrusted idiot. tl;dr Timelord2067 has been the one sending me unsolicited PM's twice (First act and second act)...   But considering the fact, that Timelord2067 is deranged, just here to troll + steal everyone's time, he might now even notice his shady abuses. Timelord2067 is an untrustworthy and a disgusting scumbag, a malicious liar and he's deliberately spreading wrong accusations. Conclusion: Add Code:⁓Timelord2067 to your trust list to distrust Timelord2067 and remove him from DT.",

This troll must be taken out from DT1 completely. At the moment he has 15 exclusion yet there are still 9 DT1 users including him in their Trust lists. However, I believe that, in time, more and more will see the miserable character of this imbecile and other will exclude him as well, no matter of they are part of DT or not.This should have happened already a long time ago but still, it's okay if it happened now and not back then.For years now, all the baboon does is spreading lies, derailing threads, making false accusations, attacking users with low ranks and so on and so forth. He looks like a village idiot trying to bully all people which are smaller than him. Sadly, for a while, he managed to do it. But his days are over. He may continue to live as a baboon inside the mental institution where he's kept for most of the time, or wherever else he wants to, but not here!",

Timelord's behavior is usually of two types.1. Cowardly little girlWhen one forum member left me negative feedback because of a personal vendetta, Timelord agreed that this was a clear abuse of feedback. At the same time, he simply replied to me that he did not plan to use the tilde against him because of his feelings about his status (I think it was about the fact that the user would probably make a mutual exclusion and his DT position would become even worse).2. Infantile behaviorOnce upon a time, Timelord left negative feedback to Webtricks (I don’t remember exactly, but it was some kind of absurd reason). This confused me a little... since I knew Webtricks. For this reason, I left him a neutral and positive counter-feedback that accurately underlined the level of reliability of this person.And what do you think?A few hours later, Timelord blacklisted me (DM), used a tilde against me, and wrote me a couple more not-so-pleasant phrases. And this despite the fact that at that time we communicated more or less well with him. The irony is that he left the feedback, he soon deleted, but did not deign to admit his mistake.Quote",

Honest?  Probably.  I don't know if his objectivity is the problem so much as his judgement, which has often been way off-base.  I've always seen him as a kind of Rain Man-type of personality when it comes to linking alt accounts but also a personality with not a small amount of pareidolia present--and that's what's made him become almost a buffoon over the years in the eyes of many members.I've never known him to be a pervert, and I'm not clicking on any twitter link.  Where did all that \"prude police\" stuff come from in the thread that you linked to, OP?  I looked through and didn't see where he was coming from with that.  Anyway, I've always found him to be fairly harmless, kind of autistic, but often wrong when slinging accusations.  Since those accusations don't carry a lot of weight anyway, I'd just let them slide off you, OP.  You're letting him get under your skin, I think.",

It's really surpsrising to see that Timelord2067's reaction to that incident has many similarities to the issue mentioned in my OP. First, we didn't had any issues with Timelord2067. Then, Timelord2067 does some questionable things (leaving unjustified feedback on webtricks account) / (PMing me with unsolicited PMs), then, our reaction to Timelord2067's action (your (rightful) opposition to Timelord2067's trust on webtricks) / (my PMs back to Timelord2067) where he obviously can't deal with, gets aggressive and doubles down on it.  And in the end, Timelord2067 doesn't even admit any mistakes when getting exposed.  It's so similar. I'm really sorry that he bothered you as well but after all we have learnt our lesson that Timelord2067's judgement is very flawed. Many thanks again for sharing your insights here. And yes, from an objective point of view, you did absolutely the right thing by opposing Timelord2067's negative trust left on webtricks account.  Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on July 09, 2023, 02:48:39 AMI've never known him to be a pervert, and I'm not clicking on any twitter link.  Where did all that \"prude police\" stuff come from in the thread that you linked to, OP? At this point, I don't know where he made it up first. It might be in one of those PM's where he asked me about his trust issues and if there's a \"perv police\" on Bitcointalk. But it might be already earlier as Timelord2067 was called out by GazetaBitcoin for this. Obviously, he got butthurt, when he got exposed for his perv activities on Twitter, where he over-reacted as well. He's also involved in a useles shitcoin, called Sexcoin and maybe he didn't want to comment on the fact, that this coin is a useless shitcoin and he's promoting such shady stuff. I call this sort of coins \"special purpose coins\". These \"special purpose shitcoins\" serve no purpose other than being used (or not being used because it's really somehow useless) for a special (more like trivial) purpose). Like there are coins for travelling, the music industry, the farming industry, the car industry, the lifestyle industry and other \"special purpose\" coins (which is just a stupid excuse to launch an own coin, where devs are in control of the coin and often have a big chunk of pre-mined coins.  ). These are useless shit coins have no additional usefulness compared to existing coins and Sexcoin is not even listed on Coinmarketcap...  It's so ridiculous. In the end, the only ones making money from such shady shitcoins are the devs and everyone will be left with worthless bags of shit coins...",

I tried to PM him, telling him that without trying to change his opinion (which I was not), I only kindly ask him to explain his decision. Why? Of course, he didn't answer, as he was embarrassed (most likely) to admit that his judgement",

He had his ego deflated, now he has to decide whether he wants to reconsider his ways and change or if he wants to continue and face more exclusions.

Or leaving his PM's completely unanswered. In general, I'm always trying to be nice to everyone, who's sending me PM's as long as it's not an outright troll. I've even answered numerous shitposters, who sent me PM's and asked me to remove my negative trust that they've received due to signature campaign related abuses. And I'm trying to stay friendly for most of the time. So, I just want to be a nice person and address all legitimate PM's even sometimes these PM's are just unnecessary. Being friendly is always recommended. Well, now I know better. I won't reply to any PM from him next time and report it as unsolicited PM spam right away.  Quote from: yahoo62278 on July 10, 2023, 09:49:17 PMIMO he already had enough people ~ him and remove him from DT, there is really no reason for the whole forum to ~ him. Maybe he starts realizing that his current approach to DT isn't appreciated by the community. Most likely, it's my personal wishful thinking but even trolls can improve.  I'm sure that if he's apologizing for what he did, maybe some DT members will remove him from his distrust list.  But that's not up to me to decide. After what he has done recently, he truly deserves to get a ton of more distrusts and if he continues, he might get even more.
