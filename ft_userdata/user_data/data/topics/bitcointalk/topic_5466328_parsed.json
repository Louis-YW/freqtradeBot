      "body": "I might be wrong, but this is not a new idea whatsoever. There have been already some discussions on using Blockchain technology and assymetric cryptography in order to enhance free and fair elections. Though, I myself have some doubts on whether the average citizen would be ready to use their private keys responsibly and not lose them permanently.Also, since this project of yours is also about an utility token/coin, I believe it would fit better on the Alternative Coin section instead of here. People interested in new/promising project generally participate there. So don't be surprised if some moderator decides to take the initiative and move this thread to said section. Good luck and have a good day.",

      "body": "The problem is is any government backing this project,¬† because for such project to succeed it must have the collaboration of a state,¬† and I think if this project want to achieve any success it then need to approach countries that already legalize cryptocurrencies and are on the verge of developing the various level of blockchain-based projects that could allow for the accumulation of such electoral processes. Some countries have been approached with similar offers before but funny enough is that,they rebranded it and called it electronic voting,¬† and that is what is currently being considered in my country,¬† to conduct free and fair elections.",

Looks like we have a long way to go before we even see such a thing happening and we are still at the point where we are clearing some bushes to make them realize that owning some bitcoins is one of the best things in the world because you finally own some assets that you have total control of it and you can secure it to the point no one needs to know that you have it with you all the time.",
