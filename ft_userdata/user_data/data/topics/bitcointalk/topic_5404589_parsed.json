I am shaking my head because everyone who was going to capitulate appears to have capitulated already. There might not be more marginal sellers left in this market hehe. In any case, the article mentioned that the strong giants are FTX, Binance, Kraken and Coinbase. For our safety, let us speculate which exchanges should be avoided by the community. It is very clear that Poloniex and Bittrex should be avoided. What are the others? Bybit, Deribit, Kucoin?Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, liquidator of the cryptospaceAfter throwing lifelines to troubled digital currency platforms BlockFi and Voyager Digital, Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old billionaire founder of FTX, warns that some crypto exchanges will soon fail.“There are companies that are basically too far gone and it's not practical to backstop them for reasons like a substantial hole in the balance sheet, regulatory issues, or that there is not much of a business left to be saved,” says Bankman-Fried, who declined to name any specific crypto exchanges.“There are some third-tier exchanges that are already secretly insolvent,” says Bankman-Fried.Fried’s FTX, along with Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, are giants among digital asset exchanges.Read in full https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/06/28/bankman-fried-some-crypto-exchanges-already-secretly-insolvent/?sh=4a2fe21a47f7",

Talking about the fees, it doesn't have so much different. Usually it's just a matter of top exchanges didn't list all shitcoins, AFAIK Hotbit and MEXC are full of shitcoins that the reason why many people to use this exchanges. But for other middle-top tier exchanges, I don't see any reason why other still use it.I think in the end, the popular and big exchanges we've seen right now would bankrupt in the future, similar like Mt.Gox.Quote from: Husires on June 11, 2022, 08:46:34 PM|.

We've had small exchanges nobody heard of go under and we also had big exchanges that controlled 85% of the trading volume go under. Saying this is going to happen again is like saying the sun is going to come back up again.Quote from: Despairo on June 30, 2022, 04:51:57 AMit doesn't have so much different. Usually it's just a matter of top exchanges didn't list all shitcoins, AFAIK Hotbit and MEXC are full of shitcoins that the reason why many people to use this exchanges.Exchanges don't see things in terms of shitcoin/goodcoin, they only see it in terms of trading volume and if a coin gets a decent amount of volume or it can attract customers, they will add it. This has been the case with BSV, when it had high volume all these shitty exchanges (including the top ones) added it but when its volume dropped they all suddenly realized it is a shitcoin and started removing it while making a big show of it.",

I think he still wants to save some exchanges, even if its by delaying their deaths by a few months.At any rate, it's not too difficult to see which exchanges are becoming insolvent, without getting withdrawals blocked. You'd see that crypto is being traded on those exchanges many standard deviations away from the mean price across all the exchanges. Almost like it's being bought and sold for a premium.",

Coinbase holds far more coins for themselves than that, if I would be one that defaults it would be Micro, not Coinbase, plus Coinbase makes money out of every trade, they could make a profit even in a bear market, others can't do it. It was just overextending thinking the whole hype with metaverse, nft, etc will go on forever, it didn't so they are just cutting all those extra.",

Nothing negative happens in bitcoin because in general either bitcoins ownership changes from one person to the other and the count remains same.
