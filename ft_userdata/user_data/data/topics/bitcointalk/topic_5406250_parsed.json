All you are going to need is 2 more activity points, since you already meet the Merit requirement (Jr. Member: >= 30 Activity & >= 1 Merit). Sometimes you can have pending Activity to catch-up on by simply posting, but if the Activity value remains the same, you’d have to wait until the next activity update which will take place on the 27/07/2022 (see this google sheet).Edit: So you did have some pending Activity which you managed to pick-up by posting today, thus reaching the Jr. Member rank that is required to post images.",
