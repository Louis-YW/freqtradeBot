The Portuguese coach revealed that since the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, the Saudi Pro League has received unprecedented exposure.Currently, SPL is broadcast in 137 countries around the world. This means, many lesser-known players are now being watched by the global football audience. Then, Filipe emphasized that the presence of foreign players can have an impact on the mentality and duties of other players.\"Foreign players make a difference in terms of mentality, task.\"\"That's why it's so important to find a player with the profile of Ronaldo, hard work and maximum demands, who can set an example for the Saudis.\"Many admit that since the arrival of CR7 to Saudi Arabia, the world's spotlight has been getting higher and now Messi is rumored to be moving to one of the big Saudi clubs, namely Al Hilal, I don't know how big the positive impact will SPL getthere are quite a lot of fights that will occur today and hopefully a lot of stakes will be involved in itdamac vs abhaal feiha vs al raedettifaq vs al fatehetc",
