Me personally, I go like make we get wetin oda local board members dey get for here too, so dat e go make our local community here stronger and better togeda. Oda boards even get moderators and other sub-boards which our own board neva get too. But me I feel say, na dat merit source dey more important dan anything now for our local board, oda tins fit follow later afta we don get dis merit source for our local board. Our board dey very active for among d local boards for d forum, but we get too many unmerited good posts because of lack of merit source here. I pray say Theymos go consider our applicants for merit source wen him wan select new people.",

For moderator, I do not think we need moderator on this board, the posts that I am reported are often responded to by moderators, likely global moderator. If we should have a moderator and if we should vote, I am voting for Igebotz which has shown himself not to be biased about the language that we should use. But having a moderator is not likely possible. Why:If you go through the local boards again, you will notice that there have been existing local boards that has no moderator. Hrvatski (Croatian), Eλληνικά (Greek), עברית (Hebrew), India, 日本語 (Japanese), Nederlands (Dutch), 한국어 (Korean) and Skandinavisk do not have any moderator. This also reduce our chance of having a moderator.Do not mind my off-topic post, but I think it is worth it. This thread is solely about merit source, I hope that one day, we would be given merit sources.",

I think this alarm you raise so will make this message to reach theymos and he will grant those two users that applied for Nigeria local board merits source and it will make others that are feeling not to be active based on one issues or another to come back to join the users to move the local board forward.

They are English board moderators that have a local board and they become the local board moderator.
