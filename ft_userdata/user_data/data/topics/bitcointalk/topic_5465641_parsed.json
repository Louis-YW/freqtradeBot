So bitcoin price should keep going up against them even if it stops rising in value. This means there is no all time high, we keep setting a new record every couple of years.In any case, for the time being we are going to have both price rise (fiats dumping) and value rise (increasing adoption) so expecting more rises in the long run is only logical.",

The ath value of bitcoin can't be predicted, countries that were against bitcoin have begun to regulate the usage as big number of people have started to invest into bitcoin considering the economic crisis all around the world. Limited supply is a major reason why we can expect big ath in the long run. At some point we can expect bitcoin serving as the alternate to the traditional fiat used around the world. In such situation the usage will be at its peak leading to massive rise in the price of bitcoin, but when it happens is completely unknown.",

To judge the Bitcoin time ATH we need to somehow change the nature of HIGER HIGHS, because if a valuation keeps shooting and never lags how can we judge the ATH? So we can BTC = ?USD in long run.But on the particular timeline, we can predict the ATH as most people think for the $1M valuation in the near future and some people support the flag of $120k as per this bull run ATH. By considering the nature of the Bitcoin and Demand and Supply mechanism in the market we can say whatever the valuation is gonna be we just need to accumulate because for sure the future id with BTC. So before its too take the entry now as its September never underetimate accumulation in this month.",

Today it steadies around 20k, what price do you expect bitcoin to hit if it picks up from 20k to bullish run.

What if you reverse it, instead of looking for the all time highs in the history and while waiting for it. Look at the all time lows, there's more encouragement if you're going to look at that part. Because people that have been disappointed with the ATHs don't think that there's another one that might come in the future. But as usual, Bitcoin is always surprising new gains and ATH and that's a cycle that's hard to break if we're going to look at its history.And if about the question the ATH of all ATH, maybe more than $1M? We will never know because we've seen that it's like sky is the limit and the scarcer that it gets, the demand gets higher so the price will be. Or could $10M? I don't know, I want to witness those times if bitcoin reaches the gazillion price.",

It has limited supply so the more new users come to the crypto space the more bitcoin is getting out of circulation which initiates supply and demand principals. Also, fiat is inflationary in nature due to its unlimited supply. So from both sides, it's getting benefits and we are seeing a price increase from its launch. Practically the price of bitcoin will keep rising as long as it's getting those two or either one of those benefits.However, the increase of the bitcoin market cap will decrease its ROI as well in terms of fiat value. That means late investors will not get the level of ROI that the early investors got.",

I were one with those people who never imagined that its market price will be as high as its ATH and is still creating possibility for a higher market value on the next halving. I'd say there'll be no limit with its potential market price 'coz it is dependent with a powerful factor such as demand. As long as demand increases then same thing will happen to its market price. Also  there are many sub-factors which could affect or trigger an increase to demand itself. Problem is  there's no assurance that this blockchain would be able to maintain the increse in demand and increase with its value. It is still a long way but it is better to start things earlier than the expected due.",

That's not an easy thing to guess but there wil be hell lot of factors in that. I mean other then halving events which are going to last till 2140. I think till then 28 or 29 halving will be done for BTC and in each halving there comes Bear and Bullish cycle. And we all know in every bull cycle after every halving BTC try to make a new ATH.Till now BTC has the higest ATH of around $69k and this ATH will be break in the upcoming bull run and according to reports and Analysis, a lot of people are saying BTC has the potential to touch $100k easily and if some more adoption of good news will keep coming then it also has the potential of touching $150k. Which seems difficult but in crypto we should not expect less and more instead be open to all type of situations.And overall if we try to calculate the market then in each halving price is making 2x means. That indicates it could have millions of worth at some point.",

This is also why I keep telling some people to forget about the past value of Bitcoin and they should focus on its future value, Bitcoin was once 100$ per coin and they thought they'd missed the biggest opportunity, I doubt this big time.

Bitcoin keeps increasing its price because the demand of Bitcoin is increasing. Specifically, when Bitcoin is experiencing its halving, there is a significant increase of the demand while the supply will be lower than the usual. So, it is not only about the hype or the trend, it is real that there is a significant increase of the demand, too. In this situation, Bitcoin has a big opportunity to reach its new ATH. However, there is no way to know what the highest ATH will be. It is impossible because we can't predict something like the demand. Who can measure the demand in the future?",

The bearish season and the bull run season are the two distinct phases of that four-year cycle. In the bearish season, the price of bitcoin tends to drop so that investors may buy bitcoin at a discount price, while in the bull run season, the price of bitcoin soars so that investors can sell their bitcoin assets for a profit. The season of halving is what led to the peak price of bitcoin. Each time bitcoin halves, it reaches a new all-time high. The bitcoin trend you mentioned will begin in 2024 and continue until 2025 when bitcoin will reach a new all-time high higher than the $69k it reached during the previous bull run season.",
