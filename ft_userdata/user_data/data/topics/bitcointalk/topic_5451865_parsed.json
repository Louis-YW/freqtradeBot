      "body": "Have you considered putting together a portfolio to show off your skills in graphic and UI design and content writing? That could help you get noticed by potential employers. Another option is to offer some of your skills for free to build a reputation and gain valuable experience. For example, you could offer to do a small project or task for members of this forum in exchange for a testimonial or referral. This not only helps you build your portfolio and gain experience, but also allows you to make connections and potentially lead to paid work down the line.",

OP has diverse Skills and would be good to try it out for the exchange as you have mentioned. Since OP is a newbie here with no experience neither does he have reputation to get along but with you opinion OP can be able to achieve that.Secondly, OP, you can as well build up your account through meaningful contributions and good engagements in activities here so you could grow up in ranks which would qualify you for signature campaign where you could wear signature and avatar while promoting a project here and you will be rewarded in bitcoin for your  tasks or job well done.Do not forget that you could also be doing your signature campaign and as well be doing your graphics designing jobs as you have stated which would be an extra plus for you.",

      "body": "In addition, graphics and content writing are needed in this forum, especially the first mention. If you have some time to do design free, I'd suggest, redesigning signature avatars and sharing them in your thread. This will help show managers how great a designer you are, and yield more exposure to your arts and designs. Aside the forum, go to social media and reach out to new businesses about a logo on their websites or social media pages. Build a resume, directing back to the designs you've made in the forum and share with different prospects on social media. Take this as an everyday exercise and you'll see turn ups and responses, get busy first and the business will come.",

I would suggest you create a proper portfolio ( a portfolio website will be better) and try your luck on fivver and other flatforms.Quote from: Cean on May 12, 2023, 02:43:33 AMBy the way, I guess ChatGPT is beyond popular among bitcointalk users as most of the replies in this topic seem to be written using ChatGPT lol.

One thing that you might have to do to kickstart a career in graphics doing cheaper fees on your first few jobs. Fiverr or some other job sites with your portfolio link in your profile. You only need to be in the right place. I think users on webmaster forums are constantly looking for skills you have for their logos and banners.",
