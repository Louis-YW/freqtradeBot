  "content": "Fox is Totally unprofessional bounty manager.  Everyone should refrain from Fox's campaign.  If you can't check the spreadsheet properly, leave bitcointalk.  There is no end to the story when staking. Brainboss, julerz12, Hhumpuz, Bounty Detective Come see how they give stakes, then claim Manager.  The task has been completed for a long time, but the spreadsheet has not yet completed the calculations.  He gave the stake as he wanted.  pankuku, neki, rice, entice, reefer, polkasation have not paid anyone in all bounties.The payment did not update on time even stakes.  Fox can do anything for money, he has done nothing for those who work for him.  Even no one got any result in any of his bounty.  so",
