Robert Kiyosaki believes it is a buying opportunity for Bitcoin as the US dollar surges. Bitcoin price sustains above the key psychological level of $19,000 despite looming risk of decline. Bitcoin price surpassed the key psychological barrier at $19,000 and sustained above this level. American businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki believes that it is a buying opportunity for BTC. Analysts warn traders of a decline in the asset’s price in the short-term. Robert Kiyosaki urges traders to buy BTCRobert Kiyosaki, American entrepreneur and author, told his 2.1 million followers that prices of assets considered as “safe haven” like Gold, Silver and Bitcoin will continue declining as the U.S. dollar strengthens, proving its worth once the “FED pivots” and drops interest rates.Kiyosaki believes this pivot could come as soon as January 2023 and the US dollar could “crash” in the same way as the recently collapsed English Pound Sterling. Kiyosaki argues,Will the US dollar follow English Pound Sterling? I believe it will. I believe the US dollar will crash by January 2023 after the Fed pivots.Source of Link: https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-price-watchout-for-30-decline-in-bitcoin-price-according-to-this-indicator-202210031232?_gl=1*17slvxp*_ga*YW1wLTNPSVVQRFVxZ2ZjWkR0N01qVEJuYlJZd1Y3ZHhISFpia1BHblFHWUJUNFVZN2J2UUZPSG9rc0hDVHJkTHlnT0o.",

Not saying that Kiyosaki has to be right and Cowen wrong, just that any idiot can make a bearish prediction in a bear market and it's especially easy when you're a youtuber who gets money regardless of whether he's right or not.",

Wouldn't it have been better if he told people to buy in January when the price dropped a lot according to him? what would be the point of buying it now and the price going down much later? i hope no one listens to this guy, he doesn't seem to have a firm and decisive stance on price predictions, it seems he just wants to gain popularity with his nonsense commentQuote from: STT on October 03, 2022, 11:20:51 PMWe failed in the recovery from the June low but fell back to some level of support seen at Sept start and recently about 18.4k, there is a slight trend up but its not nearly as regular and structured as the initial trend up out of June lows.   So BTC is weak but I wouldnt assume we must go downwards, plenty of times previous sideways has been enough as after all many major 'rich' FIAT currencies are registering inflation into double digits per year.  A nominal price for BTC that stays flat then is actually already adjusting down steadily, a hidden but steady decline is a boring prediction to make.the problem with this article is that the guy Robert Kiyosaki encourages people to buy now, and then says that the price will drop a lot until January, this is nonsense advice, it looks like the guy was drunk when he said these things",

Euro or pound collapse is because their economy is in a bad crisis, once the crisis is over, everything will gradually recover. It can be said that the fiat system has too many shortcomings, but the collapse is unlikely to happen.The USD is being seen as a measure of all assets and other currencies and it is really hard to think of the possibility of the USD collapsing when the US is still the leading power in the world. Whoever the Fed is, they also serve the US, they are part of the US, how can they harm the USD like shooting themselves in the foot.",

There’s a lot of downtrend analysis and it seems to be right because the market behavior is still negative and the price can’t still break above the resistance. Worst dump price is $10k, I don’t know if whales will catch on that price level or they will continue to make pressure with Bitcoin and sold their holdings further. Have time now to make a plan and make strategy, worst price is yet to be seen.",

I'm mentioning it because to me it's a proof of experience. When I see someone who's been there and who managed to predict the market in 2014 and 2018, I'm all ears. When I see a youtuber screaming we should be bullish when Bitcoin went up 300%, or the other way round when they see a 70% decline and say we have to go to 80 because the charts are telling him, I'm skeptical.I also think that TA isn't everything.  You can be a great analyst from traditional finances, come to bitcoin and suck at it. I know a number of such people who thought they were good, but they weren't. Want a name? How about J.P. Morgan chief strategist Tom Lee?",
