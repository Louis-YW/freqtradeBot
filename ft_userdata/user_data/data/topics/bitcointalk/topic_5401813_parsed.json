What will be different from the many others out there?Most prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platforms use automated market makers (AMM) to facilitate trades, but larger AMM trades can lead to high slippage, which is when the price of a token changes while a swap is in progress.The globalswap trading platform will use a request-for-quote (RFQ) model, where professional market makers set token prices.You're basically requesting a quote from someone who has done price discovery off-chain, so as a result, you're able to essentially get better prices.",
