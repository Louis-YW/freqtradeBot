For someone who doesn't have that much, actually $1k is already a lot. But if you're sure of what's going to happen, you're going to invest on that without any hesitation because you know that you'll be making that much afterwards. Maybe this guy is also one of the devs, who knows? Because it's common to see such people making that much in the firsthand knowing that they're part of the team.",

I will believe if it would be shiba but since it's unknown shitty token and i don't trust it. There have been so many insider trading. It's probably the developer itself. Don't trust it man.

A bet you won't. $1000 is a huge amount of money to risk on an unknown project. I think the buyer had some inside information prior to listing that's why he was able use $1k to buy $BALD.",

I won't be surprised if that person is a part of the admin group of that coin. Millionaire by luck is a very rare incident. But it looks more time an informed trading decision. So I will say it's a classic case of insider trading which is considered as cheating in real world. No glory in cheating and making money out of it. Usually such kind of things are done by some members of the admin panel of that coin.",

So, this one it's not smart just because he got insider-information and make him (insider-trading).it makes more sense,As smart as we are in analyzing a new project, it will not guarantee great success. Unless there is information like that provided by @ryzaadit. It will make more sense. This means that this happens regularly only among people in the company because of course, this information is very limited.Indeed, sometimes, on the other hand, there are cases where there are investors specifically chasing new tokens, especially hype tokens. Where they buy during the pre-sale, especially, so they can buy at a lower price plus get discounts and bonuses. However, this is also very high risk because not all new projects that are analyzed and taken will actually be listed on an exchange and earn profits. Only certain projects are really hype and listed on an exchange. And it's at the start of the listing that they have to be absolutely right and not late to exit. because once exit, they will fail and miss the moment. But then again, I'm not sure if this is going to happen very often. It is possible that even though they are experienced people in this matter, it could be that out of the 10 projects they participated in, only 2 projects might be successful while the rest were zonk.",

The data was cited by several blockchain sleuths on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and later validated by CoinDesk.Wintermute’s head of research, Igor Igamberdiev, tied another wallet address 0xccFa05 to Alameda, stating its owner showed strong technical capabilities and proved to be a savvy DeFi user: Trading on the first version of dYdX and Oasis, as well as voting on the first proposals from SushiSwap.Source https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/01/bald-token-rugpull-may-have-links-to-sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-data-shows/Rugpulled by Sam on FTX, rugpulled again on Bald token hehehehehee.",

When a person has earned a lot of money, he is more naive about investments and makes rash investments. Unfortunately, this has been my own experience. After good earnings, there is usually a losing streak, and the main thing here is not to lose a lot of money and work with good risk management. No need to buy scam tokens and trade with leverage.",
