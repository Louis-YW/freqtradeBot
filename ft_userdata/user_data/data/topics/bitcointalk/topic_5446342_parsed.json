One of fear that robots and automation will replace human worker but others argue that machines will enhance human capabilities and create new jobs opportunities.  we often overlook an important factor of its not human vs. machine, but its human vs human. I thing It is mechanical era.This need super human with high intellect to survive.mechanics applies in digital area.I related it with machine.Impact of AIThe reality is that Artificial intelligence are already changing the way of work but their impact is not uniform across all professions. For example AI and ML are transforming the health care industry by enabling faster and more accurate diagnsis while in the financial sector, they are used to detect fraud and manage risk. SourceWell said, little elaboration : Humans (that use AI) vs Humans (that don't use AI).Bu the success of these technologies is not only dependent on their technical capabilities. it is determined by how humans interact with them. For instanc if healthcare professionals are resistant to using AI powered find tools because they fear it will undermine their expertise that is why full potential of the technology will not be realized.Conclusion:Machine Uses only specific things and there is a limit when machine Recycle everything made by machine that why Machines are limited",

Especially the daily or weekly routine maintenance part, because if an error occurs in that machine it will have very fatal consequences, especially if it is placed in the industry.",

We cannot deny that in this era many jobs have been replaced by robots and AI. Therefore we are required to be more creative and able to develop abilities that are not possessed by artificial intelligence. As humans, we have emotions and the things that create innovation. We just need to control this skill while maintaining existence. It cannot be underestimated, even in my remote place, some people have been able to take advantage of what robots and AI offer to complete tasks. This means that little by little the shift is real and we can see it clearly.See the machine industry, textile-producing factories and many more have taken advantage of the sophistication of the machine. So the point is, no matter how much we think about this shift, this fact will make our eyes wide open about the era that has shifted to an automated system.",

No chance that people will be needless on different work industries simply because human mind is still dofferent from AI. Indeed AI would be at the advantage for technicalities and information but think of how many different industries are there which requires skills human could only provide. Perhaps with school setting; AI learning tools would indeed help but the guidance and drive of the teacher to impart knowledge would make learning deeper. Let us accept advancements has benefits but two should only coexist and not to remove the other just because one appears to be more 'useful'; each one will have their own role. So I do think that such thing is impossible even in the modern years of our lives.",

Even though this is a very good technology if used in various fields globally. There are many jobs that will be assisted by the presence of this AI technology, for example, such as data analysis which will become faster and more accurate or disease diagnosis will become more accurate. That will all be achieved using AI technology.I think that instead of worrying about AI technology, it's better for us to study how this technology works and make it better, you don't need to think too far that this technology will control us or even destroy us, because humans will still have control over this technology with knowledge that we have, and that's how we've lived since ancient times.",

The human mind is creative and innovative which will always result in better ways of accomplishing tasks. Artificial Intelligence will not make man unemployed rather it will expose man to better techniques for doing their jobs. It will also lead to unemployment and the victims will be those that refuse to embrace new technologies. I was speaking to some of my friends that were worried about the discoveries of AI and I told them that if they don't want to lose their jobs they should go and learn how to apply AIs to their fields. If a mechanic wants to be relevant in his field in the nearest future, he needs to learn how to use AIs to diagnose faults and fix them. This is because regardless of how sophisticated an AI might be, it will always be controlled and supervised by humans.",

But it is undeniable that part of the AI will replace the jobs of people. It is beneficial for managers of private enterprises to replace people with automated robots in production. They are always less of a problem. Therefore, this trend will continue.I also do not fully support the assertion that the introduction of AI continues only the competition of man against man. AI already sometimes shows the results of its work much higher than a person. Moreover, even in mental abilities, abilities in analyzing and assessing the situation and choosing the right solution. The assertion that AI will only work with the information that is put into it by a person is not confirmed. Already, AI is able to improve and create new information based on analysis. In the future, this ability will be greatly enhanced.",

That didn't happen.Are you sure that didn't happen? If you look at this article[1], the study greatly emphasize the effect of implementation of a machine in certain field.  It was stated that in every robot added in every 1000 workers in the US, wages decline by 0.4% and the employment to population ratio goes down to 0.2% which means 400,000 may loss their job and has more impact on the areas where robots are implemented[1].Quote“It’s obviously a very important issue given all of the anxiety and excitement about robots,” Acemoglu said. “Our evidence shows that robots increase productivity. They are very important for continued growth and for firms, but at the same time they destroy jobs and they reduce labor demand. Those effects of robots also need to be taken into account.Indeed robots and machines may increase productivity but it destroy jobs and labor demand.  Just like in the factory where my father was working. He told me story about how the number of workers get laid off when the company implements automatic machines.  Once they need 50 people for the processing of candies but when the machine were implemented, these 50 turned to just 5 due to the need of machine operators.Quote from: davis196 on March 26, 2023, 12:05:38 PMNowadays, we are witnessing that same fears about AI.

Imagine, if AI is implemented with automation and robots, who needs a human to operate the machine?  They just need a single person to turn on and off those machines since they don't need to be supervised due to AI system.  It is also possible that the machine themselves can turn on and off so there is actually no need for a single person to be involved on the operation except for maintenance.[1] https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-new-study-measures-actual-impact-robots-jobs-its-significant",

As an artist myself, I get a sense of heightened confidence when I hear people tell me that my art style inspired them, or that they loved my artstyle they are trying to copy it, but in the case of AI, there's no gratitude, there's no one thanking or no one to get thanked.
