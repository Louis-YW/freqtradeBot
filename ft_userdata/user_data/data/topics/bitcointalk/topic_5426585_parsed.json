  "content": "I believe we have some Trust Wallet users on the forum (since they have huge numbers of download and patronage) so best I shared this message here so other don't fall victim. I haven't verified if other wallets are been targeted as well but I guess similar practice are ongoing so you all noobs have to be extra cautious. I received a message from an off forum users requesting my assistance to help identify what's happening to the USDT he intended sending to an exchange to trade to his Native currency, he reached out after the transaction has delayed and refuses to reflect on his address with the exchange. Upon looking at his transaction ID and the wallet address he intended sending the USDT to, there were some difference even though the two address looks similar especially as the last four digits of the both address were the same. After further questioning, he admitted to copying the address from his previous transaction on his app and did some quick review before sending the token to the address but unknowingly to him, he has mistakenly copied a wrong address. Here's were things get interesting, for sometime now each USDT transaction he execute on his Truth wallet app, he usually gets some sort of reward (less than cents) either in TRX or USDT. But unknowing to him that was a spam attack and not reward from trust wallet as he thought.Hackers has been patiently spamming this address with a similar address when depositing the supposed reward in anticipation of the user mistaking their address for his and it did work as the user lost $100 worth of USDT.I'm just bring this up since alarms has been sounded numerously here of always cross checking copied address to make you you're sending to the right address and be watchful of unfamiliar activities on your wallet. Be careful out there, don't fall victim to this particular scam or others out there.",

      "body": "Just in case everyone is not aware yet, this is not exclusive to Trust wallet, for example:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5425022.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5425735.0Looks like the attacker has been doing this for a few days now, but the victims just recently post more on social media. Personally, I got these spam transactions months ago, not exactly identical but share some similarities. I wonder if the attacker is the same person/group or not. He definitely targets wallets that allow users to copy and paste addresses from the transaction history easily. A feature like that allows him to hide some characters to trick the user, but unfortunately, even those who use other apps or HW also fall for this trick. Looks like we need to check the whole address just to be sure we don't get tricked next time. Using the bookmark/contact feature on your wallet might be a good idea so you don't have to copy-paste every time you make new transactions.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on December 07, 2022, 06:18:52 PMHere's were things get interesting, for sometime now each USDT transaction he execute on his Truth wallet app, he usually gets some sort of reward (less than cents) either in TRX or USDT. But unknowing to him that was a spam attack and not reward from trust wallet as he thought.Sounds very similar to what happened in one of those threads I linked above. Is there any reason why he assume it was a reward though? I don't recall Trust Wallet having any promotion like that.",

      "body": "so the method used is like a trap that is used to wait for the user to make an error in making a transaction.it looks like the method shown by joniboini is good enough to implement. moreover, some addresses usually can be given a name label. so transactions are carried out with the very minimal risk of being wrong when entering an address.but I prefer to scan the QR code every time I want to send it from my wallet to exchange. so I always double-check the destination address for delivery.",

And it is not because of a shit token, in fact, the particular token where it involves the scam is a popular stablecoin. It happened due to a flawed smart contract implementation where as a zero amount of transaction can be made without user authorisation/private key.Take a look deeper here: Address Poisoning Attack, A continuing Threat",
