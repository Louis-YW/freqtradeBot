  "content": "I have seen at least two major content creators that speak about the war in Ukraine, with bias to Ukraine to be honest, complaining about their content being considered \"copyrighted\", \"unsuitable\" and either banned, de-monetised or both.One of the guys tried simply reading a nursery rhyme - this is a video of someone simply reading a popular poem for 5 minutes - and got it de-monetised / banned. Another guy got a \"copyright infringement\" for a video in which he shows his webpage and speaks about the content he creates. No music in the background, no videos not images other than generic pictures of stuff.If anyone in youtube is reading this, please know that your system is being used to stop freedom of speech and stealing money.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FOGXumeXd8This seems to be the way you can actually help (other than paying the guy or subscribe, etc...)https://youtu.be/2FOGXumeXd8?t=264",

      "body": "Hm, well. This is something I would have not expected to happen on Youtube, considering how pro-Ukraine North American companies usually are and also because of the way some intelligence agencies watch over them.Though, many can agree Youtube as a plaftform is quite a mess if we talk about security. Remember when account hijacking was used by scammer to promote their own \"doubling crypto\" streams ?Â  There is a chance someone indirectly working for the Kremlin managed to get moderator access and it is doing this to silence political speech in favor of Ukraine.",

      "body": "I'm not really how exactly they're doing it, but Russia is still actively spreading propaganda and somehow they manage to bypass censorship. Youtube maybe banned official their accounts like RT, but there is full of unofficial channels or various vloggers who are spreading Russian narrative, including all fakes. Fact that Yotube isn't banned in Russia, unlike Facebook or Instagram shows thatthis network plays important role in spread of propagandaSo, I'm not surprised that they're fighting against channels which are positive about Ukraine. I'm very familiar with similar things on Facebook. You can report Russian trolls with obviously fake accounts as much as you want, it's pointless. But once you call Russian as kacaps or Putin khuylo, your account will be banned or restricted from commenting for month.",
