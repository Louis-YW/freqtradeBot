  "content": "Despite the BlockFi bankruptcy news and an acute bearish trend, Bitcoin has remained resilient to bearish pressure. Some indicators and crypto prediction experts like coinpedia still point to a possible bearish trend reversal. The BTC price nearly jumped between $16,800 to $15,800 this week.Bitcoin is having trouble coping with the bearish influences. QuoteThe asset could soon experience a major bearish reversal or upswing, until the price rises above $17,000 to reach the critical level of $17,500.BTC is currently trading just above $16,500, which is the critical resistance. It is trying hard to validate the current upswing. Therefore, a slight pullback close to the previous resistance could be prominent before the price moves up.",

So this is also a good opportunity to get profit in the short term, Just based on my opinion.",

News are a part of fundamental analysis already and we need it as well to predict properly other than the technical analysis.It's clear that btc is affected because the last price of btc was at $19k if I am not mistaken but after the FTX crash, btc then plunges to $15k but it is now recovering and getting stable at $16k. We are right now above $17k and I am sure that it will be reaching $18k in the next day or two. This is nice but I don't think we will stay on this level for months. I expect something better on the month of December.",

      "body": "Indeed, other cryptocurrencies' market value are also in green marks which is a good makret indicator. Probably due to the hype of this last month of the year. But I doubt it would be continuous before this year end but if it will, then that would be good to have a strong start next year. If the market price would be in green marks for a somewhat consistent period (like 2weeks or three), there's a possibility that its market price will be back again at $20k and if it won't then it might stay on $16-$17k price range. Eitherway, holding for now is the best option until there is a clear sign of bullish pattern. Investing would also do so, if you can endure lack of assurance with uprise movement of cryptos' market prices.",

Nobody really focuses on the bright side of things and only love to focus on the FUD, whenever the price drops everyone talks about how terrible that is and they talk about how something needs to be done and how they should run and all kinds of stuff.But, when there is a big increase like this nobody focuses on the greatness of things and that is horrible and we should be focusing on something much better. I personally would love to see multiple days of something like this.",

The news about FTX has not simmered down completely. The domino effect is still very much active. You mentioned Blockfi's bankruptcy filing. This is still all part of the fall of FTX. So this $17,000 rise is probably short term. It could go back to $16,000 anytime from now. Once the dust of failed companies settles down, that's probably the time for the price to stabilize a bit and prepare for the bull run.",

The OP can open a thread if he wants, it's not against the rules, and besides there are many people who don't post in the WO because the signature is not visible.I don't mind speculative threads about price. After all this is the speculation section. It is normal to talk about price rises and falls here.Regarding what you say OP, I think we will have kind of sideways for a while. Until I see the price go above 30,000 I will not believe we are over the bear market.",

We shouldn't get too excited as bitcoin is only up slightly and hasn't been able to break through $18k and $20k is an important level for the end of the year.",

Are you sure when they do go public it will not also affect the market?From your prediction, we are going to see bitcoin fall further to below the $17.1k level.
