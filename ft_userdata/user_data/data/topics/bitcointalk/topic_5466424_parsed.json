  "content": "Disappearing MoneyBefore we get to how money disappears, it is important to understand that regardless of whether the market is rising (a bull market) or falling (a bear market), supply and demand drive the price of stocks. And it's the fluctuations in stock prices (and the points at which you buy and sell shares) that determine whether you make money or lose it.Buy and Sell TradesIf you purchase a stock for $10 and sell it for only $5, you will lose $5 per share. You may believe that that money goes to someone else, but that isn't exactly true. It doesn't go to the person who buys the stock from you.For example, let's say you were thinking of buying a stock at $15, and before you do so, the stock price falls to $10 per share. You decide to purchase at $10, but you didn't gain the $5 depreciation in the stock price. Instead, you got the stock at the current market value of $10 per share.In your mind, you may think that you saved $5, but you didn't actually earn a $5 profit. However, if the stock then rises from $10 back to $15, you will have a $5 (unrealized) gain.https://stockstrategy.net/ Stock StrategyStock trading Strategy The same is true if you're holding stock and its price drops, leading you to sell it for a loss. The person buying it at that lower price—the price you sold it for—doesn't necessarily profit from your loss. That's because their entry point is the lower price and they must wait for the stock to rise above that level before making an unrealized (or realized) profit.No one, including the company that issued the stock, pockets the money from your declining stock price. The money reflected by changes in stock prices isn't tallied and given to some investor. The changes in price are simply an independent by-product of supply and demand and corresponding investor transactions.Short SellingThere are investors who place trades with a broker to sell a stock at a perceived high price with the expectation that it will decline. This is called short-selling.If the stock price falls, the short seller profits by buying the stock at the lower price and closing out the trade. The net difference between the sale and buy prices is settled with the broker.Although short-sellers profit from a declining price, they're not taking money from you in particular when you lose on a stock sale. Rather, they're conducting independent transactions and have just as much of a chance to lose or be wrong on their trade as investors who are long (own) the stock.In other words, short-sellers profit on price declines, but it's a separate transaction from bullish investors who bought the stock and are losing money because the price is declining.So the question remains: Where did the money go?Implicit and Explicit ValueThe most straightforward answer to this question is that it actually disappeared into thin air, due to the decrease in demand for the stock, or, more specifically, the decrease in enough investors' favorable perceptions of it to move the price down by selling.But this capacity of money to dissolve into the unknown demonstrates the complex and somewhat contradictory nature of money. Yes, money is a teaser—at once intangible, flirting with our dreams and fantasies, and concrete, the thing with which we obtain our daily bread.More precisely, this duplicity of money represents the two parts that make up a stock's market value: the implicit and explicit value.https://stockstrategy.net/ Stock StrategyStock trading Strategy Implicit ValueOn the one hand, value can be created or dissolved with the change in a stock's implicit value, which is determined by the personal perceptions and research of investors and analysts.For example, a pharmaceutical company with the rights to the patent for the cure for cancer may have a much higher implicit value than that of a corner store.Depending on investors' perceptions and expectations for the stock, implicit value is based on revenues and earnings forecasts.If the implicit value undergoes a change—which, really, is generated by abstract things like faith and emotion—the stock price follows. A decrease in implicit value, for instance, leaves the owners of the stock with a loss in value because their asset is now worth less than its original price. Again, no one else necessarily receives the money; it simply vanishes due to investors' perceptions.Explicit ValueNow that we've covered the above somewhat unreal characteristic of money, we cannot ignore how money also represents explicit value, which is the concrete value of a company.Referred to as the accounting value (or book value), the explicit value is calculated by adding up all assets and subtracting liabilities. So, this represents the amount of money that would be left over if a company were to sell all of its assets at fair market value and then pay off all of the liabilities, such as bills and debts.Without explicit value, the implicit value of the company would not exist. Investors' interpretation of the financial health and performance of a company is based on its explicit value. Explicit value is t",

I thought he might have made some direct or indirect relation with BTC so the discussion would remain on-topic but AFAIK he did not even mention BTC or compare the stock market with BTC in his post.",

      "body": "money doesnt disapearthe OP tries to protray this scenariowhen you buy a share at $10. the money sits in a reserve. if the market price changes to $5 and the person sales he gets $5. and the other $5 disapears..however the reality isat the first purchase, another holder had the share and wanted to sell the share for $10. and the buyer gave him $10there is no reserve holding money. the seller got the whole $10the seller leaves and spends it on his lifestylenow the current holder that paid $10. realises later he cant sell his share to break even and the market of buyers are only demanding $5,so reluctantly sells at a loss. and the new buyer got a share for $5. money doesnt disappear. its always swapped between buyers and sellers. is just sometimes there are winners sometimes there are loses. but the money does tally between buyer-seller..stocks/shares/crypto markets are not just \"supply\"\"demand\"there are deeper levels involvedlets take 2 cryptos..imagine that they are used by the same merchants, accepted on same exchanges, they have the same blocktimes and average tx per block, and even coin rewards per blockwhere the only difference is the block ID hash methodA. PoW with 500exahash network B. PoW with 5exahash network calculating the current generation asics rate, power and hardware costwhere world wide electric ranges from $0.04-$0.50A. has a world wide mining cost per coin range of $25k-$140kB. has a world wide mining cost per coin range of $250-$1.4keveryone on the planet can mine for less than (A. $140k) (B. $1.4k) so no one planet will want to market buy coin above that amount if they can happily mine for lessno one on the planet can mine for less than (A. $25k) (B. $250) so no one planet will want to market sell coin below that amount if they can happily mine for lessnow you should see the economics of why the two PoW have different speculative market window lengths people trade within..now .. within each markets speculative window.. (A. min $25k .. B. min $250)  (A. max $140k .. B. max $250)different people in different locations have different costsEG pacific islands(japan hawaii) have electric at the $0.50(max) rate and slavic countries at the $0.04(min) ratejapan and hawaii are not going to mine. its too expensive but will happily buy while the market is below (AB max)slavic countries are going to mine. its too expensive to buy and will happily mine and sell the market is above (AB min)and all of this is yet to even incorporate the \"supply/demand\" of high school dumb economics",
