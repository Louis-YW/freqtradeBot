Your post is as good as not saying anything, because I don’t see why you’d make a warning thread without actually stating what users should be skeptical of or what they should look into more. There are tons of exchanges out there and since you didn’t mention any name you could come back let’s say in few years time (if anything like ftx fiasco should happen) and claim that it was what you warned users about. QuoteI was wondering and it's funny the website have similar code as FTX for me[…]Are you basing your suspicion based on how the site is built? Or do you have any other strong evidence as to why your claim should be put into consideration?",

At least say which exchange you are suspicious and let us check with our own opinion if thats gonna indeed happened like on ftx case. There are dozens of exchange with same UI and designs its simply almost all the same so thats not a good description to say they will run away.Why not spill it out so we can check?",

Im still surprised how the robbery will be happening in the middle of the day like it was with FTX. You're making people afraid to use exchanges, but it's no longer bothering me. It's not surprising to me that an exchange like ftx would exist. To be honest, you should take care of your money and be accountable for it, especially if you put it in exchanges. All exchanges, including the most reputable, Binance, are vulnerable to becoming an ftx 2.0 since it is an centralized exchange that may be shut down at any time. It is preferable to store your funds in your personal wallet, where you can keep your key. Put only a portion of your funds you intend to trade in exchange.",
