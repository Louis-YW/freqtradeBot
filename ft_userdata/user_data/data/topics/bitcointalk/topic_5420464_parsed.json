  "content": "Not sure if there's already discussions on things like this but I constantly find I'm left with unanswered questions when reading crypto related media, often news articles (and some of my questions never get answered).I've been thinking this about the ftx hack fund issues and have been wondering if there's a good place a lot of people use to get accurate and quick information about breaking news and information that comes quickly? Are places like Twitter good for this? I've seen it be used and is quite useful for cyber vulnerabilities where people post threads with 15+ tweets that are concise enough to cover most things.Before my issues with not finding the full answers on what happened with ftx, I had a similar problem with taproot where I had to look up how it functioned multiple times before it finally clicked (and that was a case of it making sense how it worked by the sites I found but then they didn't have any examples of it and left it being explained in an abstract way - has anyone found a solution to this or do we just have to wait on it or become the solution)?",

Of course you can't know with 100% certainty until the dusk settles, but news and rumours mostly break out on Twitter first, and that there are reputable people there where you can put a lot of trust(not like 100% trust, but with low likeliness of false information) on the information they provide.",

      "body": "Since you read cryptocurrency news sites, always look up their writers on twitter and follow them. Especially the bitcoin magazine, Forbes, and coindesk writers. They have a strong control of cryptocurrency news even before it appear on blogs. Sometimes they tweet to get responses before writing about the topic. On the other hand, a lot of cryptocurrency projects are active on twitter, so announcements appear on twitter first and the writers can retweet the announcement for awareness. They can tweet about the trend if need arises before writing about it. Therefore, twitter is like a place to get the raw information from the horse's mouth.",

Of the many media, Twitter has indeed become the first social media to provide information about any rumors and this is discussed by many people who are already trusted. However, the loophole regarding manipulative news will indeed remain, but it will still be inferior to the real news that occurs.I don't even really believe in the news that is broadcast by the big media because they tend to be manipulative and controlled by someone who has big interests.

Because from social media we are often get the fastest information to report than media. For example, CZ announced selling FTT from his Twitter, his followers would follow his lead and there was a dump on FTT then highlighted by the media and reported as news. So it's not wrong to find the fastest information from social media as long as the account is a credible informant. Because if they are wrong, it is very possible for him to get the wrong information too.",

Are places like Twitter good for this?Genuine information can be gotten from any platform and likewise we have sone platforms as well that were known for posting irrelevant updates that are often regarded as fake news, but twitter is one of the best platform where you can get a reliable information from, now the main concern is about who do you follow on twitter? Who is your information source, you must follow people or pages that have an international reputation and standard that all information given through them were always accurate and upto date and not to follow the media influencers that were after fake broadcast.",
