  "content": "With halving less than a year from now, the majority of us are speculating a major increase in price and possibly the start of another bull market after 4 years. Some are expecting to surpass the previous ATH of almost $70,000 and possibly reach $100,000. Although this scenario sounds great and all, I'm not quite confident that it'll happen in the upcoming year or so. The current economic condition in the world isn't too promising and, in my opinion, will set back investments in general, including bonds and the stock market. I hope I'm proven wrong, though.However, I tend to have a more pessimistic and down-to-earth approach to this matter. Bitcoin's current price is ranging from $27,000 to $28,000 as we speak, while we will also occasionally see it as low as $25,000. With that being said, in my opinion, sometime after the halving, the scenario of Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 doesn't sound too impossible to me. Thus, if we suppose that someone purchases Bitcoin now, approximately within a year, he or she may be capable of doubling their initial investment.I know that these are all pure assumptions, but instead of speculating massive ATH and 3x or 4x returns, which are way too common in the forum, why not expect something that is more probable to happen in the near future? And to be honest, doubling your investment is a great yield that cannot easily be found in other forms of investment.",

Too many expectations, but no certainty of what might happened. I would love to see the halving process come soon, so as to reduce the tension among those with too much expectations, and I hope the expectation of the majority doesn't turn to disappointment.",

      "body": "With the next Bitcoin halving less than a year away, everyone's speculating about what will happen to the price. Some people are expecting a massive surge, while others are more pessimistic. I'm not sure if Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high of $100,000 in the next year, but I think it's definitely possible that it could surpass $50,000.That would mean doubling your investment if you buy now.Of course, there's always the chance that the price could go down instead of up. But even if that happens, I think Bitcoin is still a good long-term investment.It's a scarce asset with a limited supply, and it's becoming increasingly popular as a store of value and a medium of exchange.So, if you're looking for an investment that could potentially double your money in the next year, Bitcoin is worth considering.DYOR----Quote from: Mia Chloe on October 15, 2023, 12:49:36 PMExactly @Ultegra134 hodling returns over the years under Bitcoin have proven to be very profitable.However one should not input too much trust into Bitcoin rise in the next halving.The idea of Bitcoin reaching $100k or more is a thing of enthusiasm  or hope I would say which still has a chance of happening Bitcoin has been a very profitable investment over the years, but it's important to remember that it's also a very volatile asset. There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to rise in price, even after the next halving.Some people are predicting that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 or more in the next year. Others are more pessimistic.I'm not sure what will happen, but I think it's important to be realistic. There are a lot of factors that could affect the price of Bitcoin in the coming months and years, including the global economic climate, regulatory changes, and overall adoption.If you're thinking about investing in Bitcoin, it's important to do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is a risky investment, but it could also be very rewarding. If you're comfortable with the risks involved, it's worth considering. But don't expect to get rich quick.",

And I think maybe some people too, that when the market is bearish and prices are still close to the lowest price range or lower low, this is very good for accumulating or buying. Often prices will stabilize at this time for quite a long period of time and provide an opportunity to make a purchase. And we are all sure and perhaps have experienced it during the previous halving period, that the price of BTC will start to rise and turn into a bull market after the BTC halving occurs.Dyor.",

It's not good to try to target the bottom too so it's better to DCA, there is nothing in the digital world that's more reliable than Bitcoin, do not say this statement that one should not put trust in Bitcoin, do you know what could make someone to have more money in Bitcoin than in their bank accounts? It's complete trust on decentralization over the government. Since the beginning of this bear season Bitcoin have been very profitable than 99% of other assets in crypto space, only a few altcoins have done better than Bitcoin since the start of this bear market, but my point isn't really about the profits but how reliable Bitcoin is, sorry pal there is nothing I trust more than Bitcoin.",

That's what I've also read. From my point of view, both speculations you've quoted seem way too unrealistic, at least with the data we have today. We can't predict 2025, let alone 2030. I tend to have a more sustained view of Bitcoin's price and prefer to think about what's more likely to happen rather than imagine 3x or 4x. If that doesn't happen, then my expectations would fall short, and I wouldn't be satisfied if I yielded anything less.Quote from: Asiska02 on October 15, 2023, 01:40:44 PMYou don’t need to be proven wrong, the economic condition can be seen as comparison to your statement on how bitcoin will farewell in the upcoming bull run.

My approach is to set low expectations and not be let down in case things don't turn our way. I also believe that Bitcoin is capable of reaching a new ATH; however, I'm claiming that $50,000, for instance, is a very probable price for the upcoming months or a year. Thus, doubling my investment isn't as complicated as it may sound. Personally, I'm not in a hurry to sell, even if we surpass $60,000 or even more in the upcoming two or three years. The truth is, I don't know how I'll react seeing that I've almost tripled my money, something of which I'm afraid because I'd be honestly tempted to sell.",

Most person would say history always repeats itself where the price of Bitcoin will go so high during the bull season but I call it a tradition. It has always been the nature of Bitcoin since its existence beaten the ATH.We are approaching the holiday season when Christians celebrate Christmas, and families often plan trips and vacations. During this time, there are many unnecessary expenses, such as buying jewelry, drinks, and taking trips to places like Paris. While these activities are enjoyable, if i had such money to do them, I would prefer to use it for Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) every week throughout before the next bull run, thereby doubling my investment. Currently, these activities won't provide any good financial benefits; they are expenses only for fun.Threads like this are the reason I come here. They inspire me.",

Therefore, the more likely scenario when we see a price of $100.000 will occur within 1.5-2 years. This is a rough estimate. This is taking into account that there will be no sudden negative events on the cryptomarket, such as the failure of some large exchange or prohibitive laws related to bitcoin. And of course, unless a global economic event happens, to which it is unknown how bitcoin will react. Perhaps even such an event will be able to spur demand for btc as a way to preserve people's rapidly depreciating wealth.Quote from: Ultegra134 on October 15, 2023, 12:25:03 PMHowever, I tend to have a more pessimistic and down-to-earth approach to this matter.
