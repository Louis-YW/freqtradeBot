You can ask the most reputable people in the forum to review your platform but of course there should be some appreciation coming from you upon doing that.If you know what I mean, nothing is free these days but there could be some of them that would love to do it for free if they like to do it.But as an initiative, it won't be that much expensive to have them ask to use their time in reviewing your platform and give you an honest feedback.",

Avoiding typical answers like Slack, discord and facebook which it's full of fake profiles.The platform does not matter. All you are doing is naming different social media platforms, as if though they are the ones who provide you with your audience. Thats not true at all. If you want honest feedback from people who are interested in visiting your website then you must first procure an audience of such people. And it does not matter if its on Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Discord etc...Do some marketing research, come up with a decent marketing strategy and gather an audience. The rest will come on its own.The quick and easy way to get feedback is to pay/reward people for it. You can do that anywhere. Even on this forum. Just offer a few dollars in Bitcoin to users on Bitcointalk and they will give you an analysis. Although I am pretty sure that many of us are willing to do so for free. Just create a topic asking for feedback.",

      "body": "Are you building your own portfolio website? That's the impression I get from your post history. Or are you looking for reviews of a specific service that you want to use? Any platform that allows newbies to post reviews is definitely going to be inaccurate. This forum indirectly helps you filter the reviewers since you can see which members have some reputation and which ones are new.I've participated in some reviews on this forum. A paid review definitely attracts more interest from reputable users, especially if you're looking for in-depth reviews/technical details of your service. I don't think the cost is that much compared to the feedback the project receives. If you're looking for reviews on somebody else's project though, I don't think you need to run a paid review at all. Threads like \"Is A company good for trading?\" and so on pop up here and there on Service Discussion so you can just do that.",

Avoiding typical answers like Slack, discord and facebook which it's full of fake profiles.It likely depends on the size of your website and the reach of your customer base. If your customers are friends and family, Facebook is probably the best bet. If it’s a niche website and you’re frequently available, something like slack or discord would be good. If you’re global and have a lot of customers though, nothing beats Twitter.",

Avoiding typical answers like Slack, discord and facebook which it's full of fake profiles.@noorman0 is right, you can use this platform to properly and properly review what you want to announce here so that you know what you should and shouldn't do with what you want to show us here.       As others have said, what is this website that you would like us to review feedback on? What is this about? Is it by doing a project here in cryptocurrency, or what? because I can assure you that the communities here are good at giving reviews, especially those who have been here for a long time on this forum platform, just post and we'll wait, Good day.",

Avoiding typical answers like Slack, discord and facebook which it's full of fake profiles.Personal search and viewing of several different platforms is probably the best answer here. If there is a specific thing in someone's business, it will permeate everywhere, regardless of whether it is something positive or negative.Experience is crucial and is gained over time, and then it is much easier to recognize fake feedback. Even if you can't find anything about a service, it's a form of feedback. Nobody uses them. If you have any doubts, you can always ask here for advice or someone's personal experience, If you have any doubts, you can always ask here for advice or someone's personal experience.",

Another platform that I personally use is Scamadviser[1], which offers comprehensive reviews of any website you wish to check  [1] https://www.scamadviser.com/But before doing that it would be better to make your own research first by checking the website itself and review their FAQ section. If there isn't much information available on the site it's advisable to seek help from forums members or just use those platforms that review websites.",

Because I also see in other communities here in our forum they also use this Trustpilot as one of the tools to tell if a website platform is legit or not.        Through this we can also see if a website has established a large community in our crypto business industry today. And it is also seen if there are those who have been cheated or not.",
