Someone is impersonating Rollbit Razer, the scammer by the username RazerR, signed up on bitcointalk today, and immediately after signing up, started THIS THREAD claiming Rollbit is airdropping their token(RLB) to users..To claim the airdrop, you have to visit a website I don't want to mention here..And connect your wallet....The scammer after posting this thread immediately locked the thread so no one would be able to comment,PLEASE STAY AWAY, THIS IS SCAM, DO NOT CONNECT YOUR WALLET.. And also tag the scammer so that he will be banned, scammer btt profile linked to his username I mentioned above...",

Right now, his thread has been deleted, as Oshosondy has mentioned.",

These scams are still brought to the market by scammers because they know that the crypto market is flooded with newbies every day and it is easy to trap them. Newbies should join this forum as soon as they get involved in the crypto market, because this forum is such a source of knowledge about crypto currency that one who spends some time on this forum will not fall prey to scammers easily. So if newbies are smart and clever, scammers' plans also tend to fail.",

Despite the fact that these strategies have become popular, you find that there are beginners who still do not know them. Every day, thousands enter the crypto market, especially those who register in the forum. It is possible that they lack knowledge and experience; perhaps if they encounter a simple phishing site like this, they will not know the distinction between it and the official domain of the Rollbit platform, and they will be confused and end up losing their wallets and getting a bad impression, so publishing these warnings and their top ranking in search engines, and reporting scam topics and these phishing sites will be a good thing for them.

      "body": "Usually I got surprised seeing that Rollbit is running an airdrop without it being announced by them or is there anything special, like due to how I was being conscious to click some link I never pay attention to open the site and view what's inside and how claim airdrop. From some of the information I often got from here made me to understand that some of the airdrops are basically to lure participants into swipe their wallet and it's very rare to have a legitimate airdrops that would rewards their participants handsomely.",

Is there anyone who got their wallet drained?I did some digging and I can't find anyone who actually got their wallet drained first hand. To me it just seems like people are spreading misinformation due to the nature of the airdrop. Yes, it is sketchy but nothing about the coin or website seems malicious.Usually, whatever the official rollbitcom team does, they always inform in advance on social media such as: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and so on.But I didn't find anything about the official RLB airdrop on their Twitter: https://twitter.com/rollbitcomMy advice, anyone interested in Airdrop is more careful, don't rush to access their web on behalf of tokens belonging to other companies, look for as much information as possible about their authenticity whether they are official or fraudulent.I hope this serves as a stark warning to those seeking an airdrop of any type of token.",
