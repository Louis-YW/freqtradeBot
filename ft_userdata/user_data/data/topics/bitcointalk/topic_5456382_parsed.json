  "content": "Lot of my friend works in fiverr full time or part time and earn some decent income. Some guys are get 10-20k monthly. So I started fiverr couple of months ago. Created account and pass their exam and posted 2 gigs. My gigs are about web developing. Created strong videoalso that showing my some of work. But it's been a month now and no any orders yet. I've done skills tests that recommended to web developingÂ  and got marks around top 10-20% also. Some of my friends didn't do any of these and they don't even have real profile pic or video in their gig but getting lot of orders in same category. What may be the problem? Can anyone share me advice or tips to success in fiverr?",

      "body": "Well that is very shocking to make 10k-20k per month on fiverr. I do not think it is a lot of people who make this much profit every month from doing their tasks from fiverr.Maybe your problem is your prices. I do know that there is tasks that costs more then 5 dollars. Are your prices more expensive then others. You will get better feedbacks here if you posted your profile for us to see and help.",
