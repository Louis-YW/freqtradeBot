It's also advise to start small then you can grow your portfolio gradually.Investing in one coin is very ok especially Bitcoin if you have low Capital to afford more than one but if you do then make sure not to investing wisely, experimenting on lower coins just because they are cheap can be a high way to loses, try investing in coins with good history and has more potentials even if that means getting little of it because of the prize but you can be sure you are at a lesser risk than any random lower prize coin. The market is volatile and any coin can hit the ground running as a result of hype or whatever that's hard to predict but try making your priority about investment security than a test of faith.",

Once they aren't quick enough to ride the market then a quick downfall/dump will eat every investment they put on that project.There are quite few trusted coins that I want to invest I want to spread my investment and those coins are having a long history just like Ethereum.",

But unfortunately, finding the coins requires further research and not everyone who manages to get it.Finding the right coin is a very difficult task for all investors and that's why it's much preferable to not invest only in one coin as we are not certain which coin could be the profitable coin we're looking for. But that doesn't mean we just invest into every coin that comes out way that's why a crucial research is necessary and can't be overemphasized. Someone said sometime about investing on bitcoin as a single investment, yes bitcoin is a good coin to invest in but that doesn't mean it's not also profitable to diversify into other coins, doing your research before investing.",

It's a good strategy but you don't have to diversify a lot. I've seen people that have been following this strategy but then, when you get to see that strategy followed by them. You might be disappointed because they do follow a lot of communities and altcoins and it's not the type of diversification that you may want to see on them but on me, I don't do that.",

I rather advise stay away from investing in random altcoins, but instead, choosing Bitcoin alone.Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience over time and has gained widespread recognition as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation.  It has shown strong performance historically especially every time when there is ATH will come.  However, it's still important to keep in mind that no investment is entirely risk-free not unless Bitcoin sell when your profit was there but there's no specific time.",
