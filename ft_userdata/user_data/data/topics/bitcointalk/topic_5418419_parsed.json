Because, based on my observations, bitcointalk crypto community is talking far more about FED, interest rates, inflation, war in threads related to price prediction rather than bitcoin fundamentals, lighting network adoption, future forks, stable coins on bitcoin blockchain, halving, bitcoin side chains or even chart itself.",

Economy recessions, housing bubbles, Ukraine-Russian war and inflation rate increase are the thing that's make Bitcoin price can't increase and we're only stick around $20K for the past few months. Macro factors will affect anything, but the different is high or low the effect is.",

Dont think always technical will lead to find the bottom of btc or up.Isn't it we already hit the floor or at least bitcoin market have suffered enough already because of the factors that you have mentioned, specially the war that is currently going in the background. So -70% and it could be more till next year.So there is not something new that we didn't know already, we are in a bear market, just the beginning. And we could seen worst till next year 2023. But we all have been waiting for the catalyst of the bull run and this is the block halving. So this is going to be very interesting as how everything will turn out in 2024-2025.",

      "body": "Even though this looks more of an economics discussion but since it an economy that deals with the bitcoin and the macro factors i don't think the macro has more to affect the bitcoin price since the network is not determined the the centralized economy to set a pace for it price, the macro factors that have been ever increasing is having negative effects to the spontaneous rise and increase of inflation which we all know that factors like war, covid and disaster are part of the constituents to this while bitcoin main it own decentralized network but can be said to be a coincidence that the bear goes along with these happenings but there will always be a time for the bull run as well, macro factors aren't determining the bitcoin price at the long run.",

While it's hard to say for sure, the sky is certainly not the limit for this emerging technology.Even with all the events that have happened around the world and have impacted the Global economy negatively, Bitcoin has performed better than the fall from the 2017 ATH when compared to this last one. From the ATH of 2017, BTCitcoin dropped about -84% while it has dropped about -74% thus far.I believe as it is now, the market has seen the worst that could happen, and whatever dip that might still happen wouldn't be that bad, fingers crossed",

      "body": "When the pandemic started, it was clear in a matter of a couple of months that it will take a year or more. It was also clear that it would have a significant negative impact on the global economy because of all the spending on medical research and vaccines, along with lockdowns and huge supply line disruptions it caused. So a recession is, I would say, even overdue by now. We're entering it, and it's unlikely that the world will recover fast from it, probably also something that'll take a couple of years. As for the war, it also isn't going to end in a matter of months, it will take perhaps another year from now if not more.What makes things difficult is that Bitcoin doesn't directly follow the global economy and traditional markets. It fell by a lot at the beginning of the pandemic, but recovered fairly quickly and even rose to new heights. In the early months of the war, Bitcoin was doing well, while many markets felt disturbances. So even though we're entering a recession, we can't be sure Bitcoin won't have a bull market in the middle of it, for example.",

      "body": "What do you then refer to as the micro factors? Because I was expecting you to list the micro factors that you think people are more concerned about than the macro factors. All of the macro factors are really what people are concerned about and talking about now, like inflation, war, pandemics, and recessions.This year's inflation rate is higher than in previous years, and it could get worse or better in the future. No one wants war or another great pandemic, so I believe all these are macro factors that are being looked at rather than the micro. As I have heard, the bear market will continue up until next year, so generally, there will be fluctuations in the crypto market before 2025, as you stated.",

Dont think always technical will lead to find the bottom of btc or up.Actually, Technicals always discount the macro indicators when forming various patterns, for example, if you remember the initial fear around Corona Virus made the market so skeptical and vulnerable that the market fell to below 4k but then came back up forming a very long wick down with a small body candle which indicated a very bullish momentum and then despite covid hitting the world badly the whole market became so bullish in the upcoming days. So you don't really need to worry if you only see technicals as rest of things automatically get discounted into that.",
