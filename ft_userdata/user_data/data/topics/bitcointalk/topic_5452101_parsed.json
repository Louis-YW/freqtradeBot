With all this you should know that they should be a faviourism  and you know who could that be..But the prayers and cry of the poor mases in this country and the blood of innocent people who have lost their lives in one way or the other because of the bad government will not relent it will continue to fight for justice until they will confess their sins...",

Remember that the fate of this country lies in themLet them do their work to the best of their ability and be just in their actions and verdicts. The fate of the country does not lies in the hands of five judges but lies in every citizen’s hands and God. Those that supported their respective candidates in the election have a vital role to still play even though their candidate wins the election and will be inaugurated. They’re just a leader to represent us but we are the government and the role will play in the government is what makes us a better people and nation.Quote from: Mate2237 on May 09, 2023, 02:14:14 PMAll those judges there that you have listed have been bribed and they are all corrupt.

If you’re interested or not interested in the government, the happenings there will still affect you as far as you still live in the same nation. I know we’re all tired of the challenges we’re facing in the country, but as a patriotic citizen, we should always hope for a good change and a better country and not to be aggrieved and hate the nation we’re birthed into.",

The best way to end Nigeria's problems is through constructive engagement with the political process, advocating for positive change and holding our leaders accountable. We can work towards a better future for Nigeria together.Quote from: Silver005 on May 09, 2023, 06:48:27 PM But the prayers and cry of the poor mases in this country and the blood of innocent people who have lost their lives in one way or the other because of the bad government will not relent it will continue to fight for justice until they will confess their sins...While it's understandable to feel frustrated, hurt and angry about the injustices in Nigeria, it's also important to remember that change requires action and not just prayers. We must work towards positive change through peaceful and constructive means which does not involve bloodshed, engaging with the political process, advocating for reforms, and most importantly, changing our mindset away from negativity.Quote from: Marykeller on May 09, 2023, 01:54:27 PMAs we Nigerians d wait for Nigeria Court Tribunal to give us their final verdict of whom wins the just concluded election between Tinubu, Atiku, and Obi COA(Court of Appeal) has set aside five judges that will do justice to the case that Peter Obi and Atiku petitioned against Tinubu over INEC declaring him as the president of the Federal Republic of NigeriaThe five judges that will do the ruling at the Presidential election Tribunal are: 1.

Remember that the fate of this country lies in themIt is true that corruption and bribery unfortunately exist in our country, but it is important to have some faith in the legal system and the individuals involved in this case to uphold the rule of law and deliver a just outcome for all Nigerians. For a peaceful coexistence, it is important for both parties to accept the ruling of the tribunal no matter what the outcome may be and work together towards making Nigeria better.",

Them no dey trustworthy, you go see corrupt politicians go steal money, evidence go dey say true true them commit the crime, them go carry them go court, at the end of the day nothing go happen, the case go just die like that. Na im de make we ordinary Nigerians de reason say politicians de bribe judges. So for this election tribunal matter wey de for ground now, based on say we no trust the judiciary, especially for matters wey concern big politicians, we de reason say them go dey biased, to favor who bribe pass.
