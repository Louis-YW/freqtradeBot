However they are still yet to withdraw 2k USD and are telling me that they are still processing my request and will have an update.  This has been going on for 3 months now with still no update. The total deposit amount was $1600 USD and withdrawal was about $2100USD. There is 288k wagered on that account for mines and dice.  I don't know what to do to get the money out, as Duelbits are obviously not planning on withdrawing and are refusing to explain why. I've reached out on both casino guru and trustpilot, to which duelbits have just responded that they are processing the complaint, but to no result.",

So sorry you are going through this and I must tell it is not a good experience one would have to undergo just for their own funds to be given back to them. The casino in question is a well known casino here and have registered their presence long ago and as a matter of fact, they are very much active and also have a running signature campaign ongoing. Maybe just as they have said, they might be actually on your case although based on your claims to have waited fora long time, you will still have to be patient with them as I believe they would definitely  see to your case being settled.If you can, Here is the profile of their representative DuelbitsAnnouncement board  Announcement boardI think this would help you facilitate your communication in resolving your issues with duelbits.",

Now we do get it that whenever someone's having this type of check and investigation with their accounts, we're having the idea that there's really a thorough check that's happening and the potential abuse coming from the accuser. But then, it's all good and you guys did responded on it and considered despite there's the detection of potential abuse. Did you guys do nothing about OP's account like banning him or he's still allowed to gamble with your platform? I remember some case with other casino that after releasing fund and the checking of situation of the account, they removed and banned the person.",
