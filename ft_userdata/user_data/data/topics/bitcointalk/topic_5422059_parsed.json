Remember that Elon Musk is a businessman...he will not get into anything if the possible return on investment is not going to be high. He bought Twitter because he can see its potential to add more financial clout on his part and I can feel that he is also looking at it like a toy that can boost his popularity and reach of audience. He will not gain those if he is the owner of this forum. Besides, this forum is not for sale, anyway.",

In fact, Elon Musk is a businessman looking for investments that make his capital multiply quickly and looking for innovation and wants his voice and proposals to reach his fans around the world, so he bought Twitter because it is a global social platform that includes businessmen and communities in all industries and not only in cryptocurrency, I do not see any real reason why Elon would buy a Bitcointalk forum, although this forum is a unique and old forum and has a large community of investors and traders of cryptocurrencies and projects, and it is the source of Bitcoin that was created by the founder Satoshi, but for Elon, I think that buying a forum is not from his real goals.",

As they say in democracies: if you control public opinion, you control the public. And public opinion is formed (and brainwashed) through the social media on top of mainstream media. Having control over one of the biggest social media outlets gives Musk a lot of power.Bitcointalk on the other hand is a forum for discussion not for forming the public opinion. It is not giving Musk any benefits even if he had control over it. Not to mention that bitcoiners already have a negative opinion of him because of his FUDs and altcoin scams.",
