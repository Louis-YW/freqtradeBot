Maybe, it's an altcoin private key. Quote from: TheMeisterL on November 11, 2022, 05:23:55 PMAs far as I know, bitcoin private keys only starts with 5, K or L and is 51 and 52 characters long. A private key starting with 5, K and L and including 51 or 52 characters is a WIF private key. That's the most common format of a bitcoin private key. A private key can have other formats as well. For example, a private key can be in hexadecimal format and includes 64 characters (0-9 and A-F) or it can be a mini private key and includes only 22 or 30 characters.",
