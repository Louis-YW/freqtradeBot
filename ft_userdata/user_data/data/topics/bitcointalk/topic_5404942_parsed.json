  "content": "We have a send RPC call for sending transactions inside a wallet, but what about an RPC call for broadcasting signed transactions that are not part of the wallet?It would eliminate the need to use blockcypher and other 3rd parties as a transaction broadcasting service. Then we could just use our own nodes.",

Just pass a signed raw transaction in hex to the RPC.OK, when I was scouring the RPC help of the list of methods, I did not consider sendrawtransaction because I was looking for RPCs that took a txid (quite literally \"txid\" as that is how the parameters are labelled in the short description).But what if I'm using an air-gapped wallet that doesn't provide a raw transaction, but just a txhash?  Perhaps the hexstr argument of sendrawtransaction can be amended to take the txhash as an alternative? This is the only way I think this funcionallity an be inserted if another RPC call cannot be created.I know its already returned as the result, but it's not possible to obtain the raw transaction bytes in all wallets.",

Txhash doesn't provide sufficient information for you to broadcast anything. You need the raw transaction, not just the txhash to broadcast the transaction. If you can somehow rebroadcast using the Txid, then chances are your transaction is already propagated.",
