  "content": "Hello,I sent a payment request in my electrum wallet some months ago and am still not showing receipt of funds. Initially thought that i had perhaps copied my receiving address wrong, but then blockchain.com's transaction checker was brought to my attention. The transaction appears there, and I checked my receiving address with the one listed in the sender's history and, on their end, they showed the same information and a completed transaction. The only discrepancy I have noticed is that one of the line items on blockchain.com's transaction shows that the transfer is \"unspent\". Is there anyway to identify and/or correct what went wrong so that the funds successfully transfer to my account? My receiving address is: 1318u9x3ufQLAgULP1r9S6o5S9ig4Xw81YThank you, and apologies for any incorrect terminology, I am new to Electrum Wallet.",

      "body": "Be careful of popup or notifications on an old version of Electrum if you use the link from the popup notification on the old Electrum you will redirect to the fake Electrum website with the latest version of the fake Electrum wallet. If you did it recently then I suggest you disconnect your PC/laptop to the internet right away before the fake wallet sends your BTC to the unknown wallet. And then download the Electrum directly on the original website which is electrum.org with another PC/laptop and transfer it through a USB flash drive to make sure your PC/Laptop with the fake wallet is not connected to the internet. Also verify the downloaded Electrum if it's the original Electrum wallet or not you can follow the guide from here https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/",

      "body": "Note (for future viewers of this thread) that the solution for updating your electrum wallet will only work if you are updating from one of the very old 3.x versions or something older than that, because it was around that time when Electrum disabled connections from those clients.In particular, it will not work if you update from a 4.something version to a newer version (unless a second vulnerability is found), and it could simply mean that Electrum servers are blocked by your ISP or maybe you lost internet conenctivity.",
