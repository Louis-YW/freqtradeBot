I have not actually gotten myself involved with copy trading before, and I have not seen any reason to do that either, because I always derive pleasure from holding a few coins while the price goes up and down, and most times I just have to buy a few coins myself based on my own personal analysis, and I find those coins worthy of my investment.But one thing I actually don't like about copy trading is that I see the next trader to whom I'm to copy his or her trade as a God who can never make a mistake, and as such, I am putting my hope and trusting my own funds in his decision, and if the market goes against his prediction, I will now be blaming the trader instead of taking the blame upon myself. This is something I actually don't want to do.Â .Quote*:My ref link to help me go up in the waiting list :-)It's actually not healthy to share a referral link here",

I don't know why, but I'm just not interested in platforms like that. Because I think, if I only rely on trading signal platforms in my trading in crypto, I think my trading skills will not develop properly. Because from the start I decided to trade in the crypto field, I have determined, I want to become an expert in that field. So I started trading in crypto starting from the bottom, from I couldn't analyze the market, then I learned from many media websites that explained the science of trading in crypto, which I wanted to learn, then I also learned a lot from the mistakes I experienced when doing crypto trading, and after that, gradually my skills in crypto trading got better. So until now, I'm not interested in the platform as you describe. Because I also believe in my personal abilities more than having to depend on other people. But such a platform will definitely help, for people who are too busy with work outside of crypto trading, because for sure, the time to do market analysis will be hampered. So this trading signal platform will definitely help more people who are too busy to do market analysis.",

I fully agree, that it's better to have a minimal understanding of trading. I think this product can be viewed as an accelerator in the learning process. I have tried myself various option, including copy trading but I prefer to do the trades myself as I was able to witness that traders that appears to be performant can also make huge mistake. Full copy-trading makes you feel too passive.You trust the trader.s while they perform well, then you bet a bit more and that's where they loose and you as well.But to go in your direction, other products will be delivered the same year. one of them will be related to learning contents if I am not mistaking.",
