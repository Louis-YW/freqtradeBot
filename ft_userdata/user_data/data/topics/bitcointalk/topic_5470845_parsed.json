Keep in mind did I write who did this in my thread ? No. You seem so aggressive and defensive about this topic and calling it propoganda. Have some humanity. There is civilian deaths here, have some morals behind that keyboard.Secondly, do you even know what 'Sahra Hospital' means? You don't, because you are in your comfy bed watching tv in your European Country where I and many others live in the Middle East; you don't even know how Middle East is right now. This hospital refuged people who ran away from war to be secure; it opened it's gardens to children and women to play and sleep. This is a usual procedure you Westerners don't know that is happening in every bombed Middle Eastern Nation. Children and women sleep on the floor of hospitals to avoid missiles. There is even a video of children playing in the very same day of the night the attack occurred.You bluntly trying to even prove this attack didn't happen in this first place is inhumane and really disturbing.Lastly; I didn't even said Israel or Hamas did this; you are attacking to me and defensing Israel is out of topic.So, you claim this photos are from Los Angeles California, in a film stage; staged against Israel? I'm not joking; your logic is a lot ironic than this sentence.EuroNews:Edit:This is what 'Field Hospital' looks like; you can see the dead bodies inside that in my previous photo; please don't attack on people with false propoganda yourself before claiming I am doing one.",

Yes, I'm not a professional in terror and I don't need to be one because it's well visible that the hospital is NOT destroyed. How could 500 people die in the hospital, if the hospital is still intact? You can see, 500 people dead is a lie and propaganda by Hamas (because such bullshit propaganda works for Hamas as you can see how many believe this Hamas lie). It's now debunked but people still parrot the lie. The evidence is all there, hospital still intact. KUDOS to our decentralized OSINT community for calling out Hamas for lying. Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 11:02:11 PMKeep in mind did I write who did this in my thread ? Simply, this isn't true what you wrote: Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 09:45:06 PMPress conferance of a doctor in Gaza after hospital bombing. The hospital is not damaged at all as you can see in the picures. Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 11:02:11 PMSecondly, do you even know what 'Sahra Hospital' means?

Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 11:02:11 PMYou bluntly trying to even prove this attack didn't happen in this first place is inhumane and really disturbing.You should really watch your words dude because all of your bullshit is a lie! Hamas is the one who's trying to abuse these dead people for their propaganda by falsely accusing israel WITHOUT ANY PROOF. Now, that israel has provided proof that it's not an israeli rocket hit, you still don't admit this but you spread accusations against me. Hamas claimed 500 people dead from israeli rocket bombing in hospital and from what we can see in the picure it's not true at all, it's propaganda. That's exactly how these dipshit Hamas terrorist are trying to fabricate propaganda. They are using their own civilians as a human shield, which is such a disgusting thing but you are defending them. Big shame! Yes, it's sad what happened there and any civilian killed there is a big pity and that's why I'm against lying about that what happened there. We need to tell the truth. Why is Hamas even firing missiles so closely near their own hospital? Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 11:02:11 PMLastly; I didn't even said Israel or Hamas did this; you are attacking to me and defensing Israel is out of topic.I'm just criticizing wrong claims. If you believe, my post is off-topic, report it.  Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 18, 2023, 11:02:11 PMSo, you claim this photos are from Los Angeles California, in a film stage; staged against Israel? I'm not joking; your logic is a lot ironic than this sentence.I've claimed that nowhere.  Like you, I'm against civilian casualties but I'm also against propaganda because propaganda is inciting hate and makes it difficult to find a peaceful solution for this conflict. And when there's a lie pushed so massively, of course I will point to the truth, backed by proof. Have a nice day and hopefully, this conflict will be settled peacefully.",

      "body": "First of all I see that you have a slight 'Islamophobia' in the thread you have linked. Don't blame the religion, blame the worshippers. Not every Muslim is a terrorist and not one of those civilian babies kids women and men are terrorists; they deserve to live in the land they are born. They deserve to have a social life, education, marry and create a family themselves and get old. They are all dead. I don't value Israeli life more than any other life unlike you. However I am sad that on this age of social media, you still believe the western media crap that is brainwashing you everyday. I am not surprised on Germany's or Germans' side in this; you owe Jews huge apology that will last for centuries, I don't even believe you can be against them if they killed Germans in Israel. Anyways off topic;I see you didn't even search what a field hospital is, that is everywhere in Gaza because of people fearing their and their families' lives; they refuge in field hospitals to get treatment for babies, food for kids, health for their elderlies. These are usually formed around hospital buildings to get aid quickly and according to international war laws; hospitals are off-limits. Well, was since yesterday. I condemn everyone who has a part in this, including the people who play the three monkey against all this babies dying and calling it propoganda. Shame on you! You are in delusion about this hospital and the accident; go open a tv, watch news; have some moral!My Los Angeles example was to show how your comments are seen by other people in this forum who have a slight bit of a moral and straight mind. I also thank you for your wishes of the conflict to be settled peacefully, I am a Turkish person, however I can feel the pain of other countries' kids dying murderously. It seems like you don't since you still say Islamic Jihadists or bs. This post was created by me to show people the realness and reality of the war going on. Not pick sides. You turned this topic to shame Hamas; I don't approve Hamas' attack on Israel; and I also am sad about the lost civilian lives in Israel; unlike you. You have zero proof and even satirical claims that have no back up; and calling real proof with images, a propoganda.Get a grip of reality. The blood of those kids are in the hands of people who stay silent to this Genocide.Have a nice day as well sir'",

This is what I get from your response, if you clarify more I would be more acknowledged about your opinion, instead of trying to prove 500people are not dead in the hospital. Secondly you can read what I wrote again and see I am very sorry about the civilians killed in Israel since the first day; and am against any civil casualities.

Israel is illegally taking land and killing palestanians for years. The media has shut up and is taking Israel side ( what a suprise ) against people trying to defend their homeland. Remember Israelis were new commers 60 years ago, where palestanians accepted them. The land is and will be of Palestanians, not terrorist invaders. The war will have only a winner; and that will be Palestanians. Edit: Just like that commander , there are many terrorists in a \"army\" called IDF.Publishing these is not propoganda, but to remind the word to not be silent.There has been a war crime that was made. Just imagine these were your kids; and how there will be peace in the future? Just ask yourself. Before you say fake, this is taken from a video.[moderator's note: multiple posts have been merged]",

Maybe you should first familiarize yourself with the regions you want to give opinion about then start speculating about what might have happened. Or maybe you are just repeating some random stuff you read on the internet!Maybe Hamas just hates the internet because we can look up the information ourselves like the massacre Hamas did one week ago. It's a shame, that this barbaric Hamas terrorist act gets denied by Hamas pawns like you.  Quote from: pooya87 on October 19, 2023, 02:14:19 PMThe Palestinians didn't kill any \"innocent civilians\".Not Palestinians, but the Hamas killed lots of innocent civilians - no need to deny this barbaric act. Let's just take the Re'im music festival massacre, where Hamas killed at least 250 innocent civilians:         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumvHVGaetMThese people were there to celebrate and out of nowhere these Hamas parachute terrorists were starting to shoot down everyone they could get. What a disgusting massacre and defending that is as disgusting as it gets. And this is just one location of Hamas terror, Hamas killed much more innocent civilians like children and women that day, the festival were \"just\" 250 people of the 1400+ killed that day. No doubt, Hamas is a disgusting terrorist organisation. They are a shame for the human species. Downplaying that means to be indirectly complicit in this Hamas murder against innocent civilians. Yes, people celebrating at a rave festival are innocent civilians. Downplaying that means being a horrific shame. And if someone is justifying the Hamas massacre, it's always a big support boost in favor Israel. I don't know if Hamas is realizing that.",

Well, what happened a week ago, when Hamas fighters went to Israeli cities? They killed innocent civilians and caused the whole recent upheaval. Did they (Hamas) really start this war? I'd say the war has been going on for the last 80 years, ever since Rothschild started buying land there for his people to settle.Once they did, they begun to wage wars with everyone around them. Egypt, Syria, Palestine...I'd like to remind you that in 1939 Palestinians were already fighting against Zionists Were these photos staged? Aren't the dead children real?If they are real. it means the hospital was most likely damaged. The question is if it was an Israeli missile, or one fired by Hamas that failed. They often use homemade missiles that can malfunction, so I wouldn't be surprised.",

Well, what happened a week ago, when Hamas fighters went to Israeli cities? They killed innocent civilians and caused the whole recent upheaval. Did they (Hamas) really start this war?  I've referred to the recent attack, where around 1500 Hamas fighters entered Israel on October 7, 2023. That started the recent upheaval and I hope very much, that it doesn't escalate into a big war in that region. Unfortunately, the situation is completely messed up there and both sides hate each other. Getting into a peace deal seems to be close to impossible. It's really sad news.",

Someone can post or share pictures of the victims of the Hamas attack or share pictures of the innocent civilians getting caught in the crossfire between both factions and yet, before judging what it is in front on my eyes, I need to consider the possibility of it being completely fabricated information and images.It was way easier in the old times, wasn't it? One just needed to turn on the Television and watch the News. Not anymore, now everyone sharing information both on internet and on TV is biased...",

All because you read some propaganda on the internet and believed it!Take all the pictures you posted. All of them are either the aftermath (showing abandoned vehicles on the side of the road) or some people just running for reasons that are not shown in the videos and yet you call it \"Hamas killing civilians\". Why don't you post a single frame of the actual shootout? It is simple, that's because it would negate the propaganda!Here is an example. The black arrow shows a Palestinian fighter and the red arrow shows an Israeli woman who is taking shelter beside him from the Israeli terrorists bullets that are flying in her direction. The source is clear on the top right side of the picture and you can find loads more there and all over the internet:Of course the Israeli terrorist sympathizer have spread so many lies that it is hard to keep up. Trying to debunk every bullshit is not only exhausting but also pointless because the terrorists keep murdering children in Gaza while everyone is busy debunking their lies that is being spread by the brainwashed masses. By the time you debunk one, they've already spread two dozen more and by the time you debunk those they've drowned you in lies.Here's another in case you haven't heard or decided to forget:At the end of the day \"keyboard warriors\" aren't changing anything, so I'll probably stop trying to debunk obvious lies as the information is already out there for anybody who bothers looking. As I said elsewhere, bullets is the only language terrorists and their supporters understand. For example the two cruise missiles that USS Carney received last night in the middle of Red Sea was a better message than all the propaganda debunking on the internet combined... That's the only remaining way the Genocide can stop.",
