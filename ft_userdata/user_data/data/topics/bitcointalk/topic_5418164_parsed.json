  "content": "I remember while growing up I thought of it that it only take printing of money to be rich and wonder why country just don't go ahead and print all the money it can by making order to the minting company to print money and just jumb into the number 1 richest country lol. I don't know how many of us think that way while growing up but I think some will say nah, I didn't think that way. They will say I know better even from my mother's womb and claiming to be smarter than the elderly at those times but surely I admit the forum is giving me much challenge to research more to add up to my knowledge. Now the reality is coming clearer with my elementary school economics sharpened up, thanks to the forum because I now read comments here taking me to study and research more to be better.The main comparison is here. Like a rich person don't take up just one type of job, he/she is involve in different resourceful jobs or more than one job to be rich, doing just one job you may be comfortable although but is better to do more jobs. So the country that want to be rich will have to produce more products and not to rely only on one limited product or few source of revenue. A country need to produce variety of goods to increase GDP and standard of living and have excess to export and have good external reserve. With the countries of the world now, we know the richest countries are those having more resourceful means of income and they have use it to build their economy. The list is endless from those rich in technological export, oil export, health, agricultural products etc with good management of the resources.If a country rely on just printing of money that will lead to inflation and hyperinflation which Zimbabwe is one country as example of such inflation. Printing of money will increase money circulation and price will increase at the mention of printing of it (money). Being rich is to increase your source of income and countries can increase what they produce or services provided and that is how to be rich.Not to say printing of money is totally bad but if not controlled properly it can lead to hyperinflation.Circumstances that money can be necessary to be printed is when the country is in short of money because they need money to build industries, give loan to manufacturals and small businesses.Countries starting up like new independent countries can print money to start the economy properly.",

And the same applies to having 1 million dollars in gold or bitcoin private keys on that island.On the other hand, if you have 10,000 USD (100 times less) in a city that has a lot of goods and services for sale, you are much richer than the one on the desert island with 1 million.The total goods and services produced in a country in a year is the GDP and is a measure of wealth, although this is rather like household income, net worth would be the accumulation of capital in its various forms.",

Being rich is to increase your source of income and countries can increase what they produce or services provided and that is how to be rich.Post industrialization worker productivity rose significantly. The lavish lifestyle billionaires enjoy today, was only made possible through technologically sourced increases in average worker productivity. Millionaires and one percenters in pre industrial times did not enjoy nearly as much excess or high standard of living. We've seen an explosion in the number of newly minted millionaires and billionaires with silicon valley and dot com tech bubbles.In theory, there is a point where productivity rises to a point where standard of living rises dramatically. Another interesting facet to the dialogue is increases in production also fueling a massive explosion of human population growth. In the 1950s the human population was 2.5 billion. Today its near to 8 billion. In close to 70 years we have seen the population on the planet triple. Japan could have the right idea for pursuing a sustainable and healthy standard of living through low birth rates and negative population growth. Rising productivity gives us a larger margin for error in terms of economic policy, as it invokes greater wealth and larger margins. It may also be correlated with longer average life expectancy and other benefits. The main export of countries in africa is cheap labor. While the main export of silicon valley is software. I might contend the wealthiest nations export the most valuable assets and commodities. With low(er) birth rates contributing towards productivity and wealth not being diluted.",

Man power exportation while the countries that having strong economy have diversify into more technology and software not reliable only on naturally resources but have move away from there. But the difference to the exchanges done is the man power from less developed countries are regarded as unskilled but those from developed countries regarded as skilled and expatriate.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on October 24, 2022, 03:57:01 PMAnd for a country to be financially sound, it must be producing different commodities for export to earn foreign currency to boost the countries GDP overall.   I learnt this also in elementary school and higher your foreign debt the more depreciating of the home currency",

Instead of being free, uncontrolled printing of money actually makes the national debt increase and the price of goods rises everywhere.not all countries are able to withstand hyperinflation if they print a lot of money, especially for countries whose currencies are not in demand and have few foreign investors. but the dollar is different, it is an invulnerable currency and has many international transactions so that makes it strong even though it is printed a lot, cmiiw.",

On the one hand, if their exports get more expensive then people try to source goods from different countries instead, however if they print too much money then investors might conclude that they have bad fiscal policy and stop purchasing debt which props up their ability to keep printing money. It's only really America, with it's fairly stable market economy and the country which controls the primary reserve currency of the world - the Dollar, that has much more ability to get away with it. Other countries have bought so many dollars in the past that they are actually stuck if they try to sell it off in large amounts and also see it naturally devalued over time as more is printed.",

When you start to grow older, which may have gone through the level of diploma education, the answers to your questions above are very easy to answer yourself.To print the amount of money in a country, there are legal regulations that regulate the amount that can be printed, these regulations are binding and cannot be violated, to better understand these regulations, maybe you can search on Google, although different countries have different regulations.QuoteIf a country rely on just printing of money that will lead to inflation and hyperinflation which Zimbabwe is one country as example of such inflation. Printing of money will increase money circulation and price will increase at the mention of printing of it (money).  Inflation is not affected by the printing of money, but rather because the money supply is not in accordance with the usual, there is no correlation between printing money and inflation.Because indeed the printed money has gone through the approval of the required amount.QuoteBeing rich is to increase your source of income and countries can increase what they produce or services provided and that is how to be rich. In this paragraph I think you are wrong, being a billionaire or a rich person needs many things to pay attention to, what steps to take, business, investment or other forms.You can successfully increase your source of income, if you have the ability, skills and are consistent with what you want to achieve. While the State cannot provide any guarantees, the services provided will not be able to reach all levels of people, but simplify services, train resources more appropriately and enable them.",

      "body": "This is precisely the reason why there are economists and financial planners. If economics is such a simple thing, countries would simply print more money and everything's good. But that's certainly not the case. Countries are responsible to increase their economic output without which their abundant money supply wouldn't mean a thing. The value of money is founded on its economy. If a country prints more money than its economic performance, prices would only increase and the printing of money would be useless. To illustrate it simply, if a kilo of rice is $2 and the government prints a lot of money without improving the agricultural sector and consequently rice production, a kilo would, say, rise to $10. If it continues printing without doing anything, a kilo rises to $100. Printing goes on, a kilo goes to $1,000. More printing, a kilo hits $10,000. This will go on and on until a kilo is worth a million. This is what happened to a few countries like Zimbabwe. Too much money printing without any economic improvement has brought them hyperinflation reaching to as high as 500,000,000,000%. Neither the government nor its people didn't grow rich. What happened was that an employee with a trillion in salary per month cannot even buy his basic needs. In contrast, if economic output is improved and there is money printing, the value of money is maintained even if the circulating supply increases. Prices may grow but only moderately and yet people are earning more. This is what economic development looks like.",

Cases like this is supposed to occur when there is deflation, a very limited number of a certain currency in circulation or when the currency notes are bad beyond use. However, for new currencies to be printed, those who manage the economic affairs of the country sit and deliberate carefully as to how the process should go. Devalueing of the currency is one way to check  or counter such printing, if it is in excess.",
