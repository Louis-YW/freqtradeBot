  "content": "\"Excited to be live on the Bitcoin Lightning network - let's get every transaction under 1 second and 1 cent to bring in the next wave of adoption,\" Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong posted on X after the announcement.https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/04/30/coinbase-now-offers-cheaper-and-faster-bitcoin-via-lightning-network/?sh=2ef4b1e43790Now I know this story is at least a month old since someone mentioned it in the Lightning Network Observer thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5348270.760but that thread has a much of LN topics all mixed into it and this seems kind of like a noteworthy story. But I am kind of skeptical. Does this mean for example that if I have BTC on Coinbase I can send it to any bitcoin address for under 1 cent now? Or what exactly do I have to do. The downside to this whole thing is that you have to be willing to give up the decentralized aspect of bitcoin to be able to use LN now. And subjugate yourself to Coinbase who in my opinion has awful customer service.   Or at least they did the last time I tested it.",

It's a nice touch that Coinbase is supporting Lightning Network now, that's a good thing what they're doing for the network and also for the community as a whole, I really want to see more people getting to use Lightning Network in a much more convenient way, the benefits of stronger privacy, faster and cheaper transactions, and the scalability that comes with it is just too darn tempting to ignore.",

Your worry might not be that concerning at all, I feel like it can easily be solved if we just learn the basics of setting up our own Lightning Network node, there's thousands of tutorials about it out there and there's already some here in the forum, not sure what's the excuse there.",

(previously and preferably to the bitcoin network so you can actually own your bitcoin)yeah exactly i want to withdraw my coinbase bitcoin to an actual wallet that i control. a bitcoin address. and i should be able to do that now for less than 1 cent. because that's what Brian Armstrong said, \"let's get every transaction under 1 second and 1 cent\" i assumed he was talking about normal bitcoin transactions. I'm sure LN transactions are ALREADY under 1 cent and 1 second so that wouldn't be any new development...Quotehowevernow with LN attached to coinbase, they assume that their BALANCE then moves to another network where THEY HAVE THE KEYS* and give you another form of unsettled IOU amount which again is NOT bitcoin settled to your key.. by staying in LN using their channel renting and balance giving. they hold onto the coin and your playing with IOU credit. which they hope and know due to the liquidity issues people only play with small amounts and know the bitcoin fee to confirm funds out to your bitcoin address is higher, means you are less likely to ever want to actually settle to the bitcoin network thus they keep the actual bitcoin and just wait for you to spend your balance to zero so they can then close out the channel when you get to zero so they never have to pay outwell thanks for clarifying all of this but it's not really what i wanted to hear... Quote from: dkbit98 on May 04, 2024, 09:25:52 AMBut you can't use this LN in New York and other states that have restrictions...i don't know why that would be the case. i know they did some type of settlement with new york but people in new york can still sign up with coinbase they just can't stake. but why they wouldn't be able to use LN that doesn't really make any sense. if you can buy bitcoin using CB you can probably use LN too.QuoteThis is good example of fake decentralization and I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase loses case against SEC, and if they ban all Lightning Network in US soon, just because they can   that's not going to happen. coinbase is a publicly traded company now and they have become legitimized in the eyes of the public. through just being on the stock exchange.",

But the adoption for lightning is so low, I don’t see it being used heavily, at least for the time being.Many people like me have moved on to ETH L2 networks such as ARB or Polygon. It’s cheap and fast and you can do large token swaps with little slippage and fees. This should of been done 5 years ago or so and maybe the adoption would be higher than it is today.",

I'm not sure if they have any limits now. But maybe they used to.QuoteLN is very confusing and technical. What is even the point of using it when it is even more technical and difficult to use than the base layer of bitcoin?after all of the bugs i have accidentally become aware of like the ones above, i wouldn't be so keen on using it myself. unless there was a way I could just send bitcoin from LN to any bitcoin address and just pay the standard LN transaction fee which apparently is a penny. i thought that's what CB was going to allow but maybe not.QuoteTime is valuable and if it takes too much time to learn something or to use it than the lower fees are not worth it. if you're a business, imagine trying to convince your customers to learn how to use LN just so they can pay you for whatever product you're selling. but for small purchases that's  kind of the only way you could do it with the high transaction costs...i don't know how businesses take bitcoin nowadays for small stuff like a cup of coffee unless their customers know more about bitcoin than they do about coffee beans",

It's because cost of making large transactions on LN is higher than on chain because with LN, after you send a transaction you either need to a) find somebody to pay you by LN or b) open a new channel or do submarine swap with onchain BTC in case you don't have enough for next time.When you're not running some kind of store that pays you on your LN node to auto replenish your balance then you have to make two or three  onchain transactions to pay someone on LN vs one, when done directly.",
