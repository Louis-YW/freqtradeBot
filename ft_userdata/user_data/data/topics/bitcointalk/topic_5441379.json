      "body": "From what I have seen, I think there are 2 processes as to how casinos accept crypto on their platform.The first method involves providing users/clients with their own unique crypto address, which they can use to deposit funds using their preferred wallet to play the available games.Alternatively, the second method involves integrating a payment processor like BTCPay[1] into the platform. By doing so, the payment processor takes care of all the necessary steps concerning deposits and withdrawals.This is just a guess based on observations and there could be some inaccuracies when it comes to process.[1] https://btcpayserver.org/",

Using a wallet provider (third parties service).Nomber 2 like Maus0728 advice is always the recommendation, while you're using third parties service for the wallet transaction. Because you're not actually building from the scratch like nomber 1.The different, you have fully control not only the fund.",

Any advice? I think your best shot at incorporating crypto payments and prizes in your infrastructure is through formally hiring a blockchain developer that could work with multiple chains. That way you can encompass a large array of tokens and cater towards a larger crypto audience. Game design is also important as I think the best way to introduce a new feature or addition in a gambling site is through incorporating it in a pre-existing or a new game.  With the latter I lean more towards. In any case, if you're looking for a good developer this site has a vast group of competent developer that will help you with your goals.",

The pay would be that much but it's all going to be worth it if you ever want to have ease with this process. We've got talented developers from the forum; all you need is to look for them by posting in the Services section.IIRC, I've seen posts like a bunch of them and you just need to negotiate and be in detail with what's required in order to be done aside from that you've mentioned setting up everything for you to accept crypto.",

Any advice?First of all, thanks for having you on this forum, it is a pleasure having a casino company from Malaysia. And I will likely say the best way to start accepting Bitcoin is to look for a crypto software developer who will be able to integrate the plugins of a Bitcoin network on your casino so that whenever, a user deposit Bitcoin, it enables it works automatically without your personal manual approval which could equally take a long period of time.",
