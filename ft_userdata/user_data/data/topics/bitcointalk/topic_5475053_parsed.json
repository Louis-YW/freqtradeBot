Your thoughts?I totally get where you're coming from tho. tbh It's a common issue for many in the web3 space. But you know, there's actually something pretty close to your idea already out there. It's called Task2Get, which is a new platform launched by Bitget Wallet.So, the cool part about Task2Get is its aim to showcase popular and potential mainnets/projects. This way, users get to participate more in airdrop interactions and potentially earn future rewards.Why I think Task2Get is interesting? because it focuses on showing off both popular and upcoming mainnet projects. This means users like us get a better shot at jumping into airdrop interactions. So currently, they've partnered up with ZetaChain for their first activity, featuring tasks across six DApps with a massive 700k ZETA reward pool. So you can now interact with those DApps and complete tasks in your own wallet app to receive rewards and it's that simple.",

And if anyone is thinking about developing such a platform, count me in as an early adopter!I have a different opinion about such idea. Airdrops are generally just opportunities provided out of the goodness of the heart of project founders — it's not guaranteed and as such, should be sourced by users themselves. Crypto from the onset has always been a research based game. If you're not putting the hours into research, you'll most likely end up coping all the available opportunities.If you still like the idea, you should check out the airdrops page on DefiLlma here: https://defillama.com/airdrops",

However, this is part of the job in this market, and still depends on individual research.",

Your thoughts?Reasons why airdrops are valuable is that they are hard to get, not easy to see beforehand, or if they are, they are wither controlled by whales or just won't end up being valuable.Reason i got expensive airdrops in the past wasn't because i was hunting them. I didn't even see them coming. I was just excited about the right project before majority of people even knew about it.Uniswap users didn't know they were going to be rewarded, most nft traders didn't either. If there would have been more people getting rewarded, it would have just made rewards smaller, or bots doing all the work.",

Your thoughts?Promise of distributing free token becomes a marketing strategy for many new project. Some of these projects are earning lots of gas fees because of the airdrop farmers. I have seen in a Chinese group that a group of people are farming airdrops in a room and some of these people manage more than thousands of accounts to farm the airdrop. Just think about how much that will be if they really get the airdrop but if there isn't any airdrop or the value is not significant enough just think about the losses they will take.",
