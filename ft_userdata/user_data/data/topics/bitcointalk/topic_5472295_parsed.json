  "content": "It is commonly said that experience is the best teacher, but someone also said that a wise person does not wait to learn from his or her own experiences, but would watch and learn from what happens to other people.Sometime last two weeks, someone down my street slept, and unfortunately, did not wake, he's a young guy living alone, he's a known gambler, and not just a normal gambler but a high roller.Some friends who are really close to him said he has accounts on several online casinos, and that he is very much into sports betting, one guy said he saw the account balance on one of his accounts one time and it was close to $60,000 ($58k+ to be precise).This guy passed away all of a sudden, he was not sick, nothing nothing, he just slept and did not wake.And in all his family, friends, no body knew the password to unlock his phone or computer, not even his girl friend.They have tried all the password ideas they had but non was correct, at the end, they had to reset the phones back to their factory settings , right now as I am typing this post, the family have no idea how they can access the casinos where the guy left tens of thousands of dollars, and neither do they have any idea how to access the money.The guy is also an investor in crypto currencies, and I personally believe he also have investments in crypto coins which the family may also never be able to access.In my own personal assessment and assumption, this guy should have nothing less than $120,000 to $150,000 in total, kept online both in cryptocurrencies and gambling accounts.This incident indeed have thought me some lesson, try and have someone in your family atleast, whom you can trust enough to share your gambling and other financial secret with, for no body knows when death will come knocking, we all pray to live a very long life and die at a prime old age, but to be honest, we still have to plan well so that, if for whatever reason, our live is cut short of our expectations, what we have labored for all through the years we lived, will not end up in the hands of another person or people we don't even know, and have never meet.This is my advice to online gamblers who cannot do without leaving money in their gambling accounts, and also to crypto traders and investors at large.",

If the password is short they can be lucky, but they may not be have luck.I have little amount of money that I can afford to lose on gambling sites, but this would be helpful for those that are gambling with high amount of money. This is a good lesson for bitcoin and other crypto holders and traders and we have discussed things like this several times on bitcoin discussion in the past, but about bitcoin holding.",

I have not told my family but not because I don't believe in them,I fully trust them 100%,the reason is I don't have that much for the moment,when I will do if I ever will that is a sound advice to tell your family so they can access the goods in case something bad happens to me.Tomorrow is promised to no one and that is my statement in life by which I live life trying to live at the fullest the day that is given to me which is the present day and I don't care much what can happen tomorrow as tomorrow may never come.",

Because I always use money that I can afford to lose and when I win any amount I immediately withdraw it, and if I want to play again I will top up again with a small amount and if I lose there is no money left, and it continues like that.

But then I realized these systems might only work if the person has a pulse or body temperature. This story can be a lesson for many. It's important to have someone in your family who knows a bit about your financial situation. They don't need to know everything, just a hint about it. I'm not married and live alone. I don't feel comfortable trusting someone I'm not married to with such private details, so I understand why even his girlfriend didn't know the password to his phone. I'd rather share those secrets with my siblings, because we have a much closer connection.Quote from: sunsilk on October 31, 2023, 10:06:56 AM I agree to neilost about trying to contact the casino.

It may sound weird or funny, but writing a will does not necessarily that you are preparing for your death, as no one knows when we're going to leave this world, but it would be of a great help when that time comes especially to your family. At least have a plan about this matter, especially if that is an immense amount of money. And we are talking about crypto money, which is kind of hard to access and in the worst case, your family couldn't have any access at all and cannot get that money because we all know how money works in crypto. But yes, at least have someone whom you really trust, it can be your wife or a trusted friend. So, when the time comes, your hard work will not be wasted because someone will benefit from it.",

She knows what to do too as I have taught her about cryptocurrencies and I even let her do the withdrawals sometimes so that she can learn easily. It's true.

Well how true this is may yet be proven but there is element of logical reason on that because some men don't disclose there accounts, properties home and abroad to their spouce nor brothers and no one close actually. I have known some cases where some men die and the wife is not able to trace belongings of the man both financial and material.So this topic is another clarion call for the living to try and disclose certain securities of our business to trusted and loved ones. Regards to cryptocurrency, passwords to exchanges or casino, we can start by at least writing them down in different exercise books despite that we fear fire outbreak but perhaps something can be safed. We can't live in isolation just like that because we want to keep everything away from third party. If that guy wrote those password down in an exercise book in his house or alerted someone where he stores his security codes, surely they would have been able to unlock them. It is unfortunate.Like it is said, a wise man learns from someone else mistake.",

I anticipate that in the near future, nearly everyone will possess their private cryptocurrency wallet.- Hence, efficiently managing and safeguarding your private keys is of paramount importance. It involves not only figuring out how and where to store them but also establishing a backup plan in case you're unable to access them and need assistance from trusted family members.- In my case, I keep one set of private keys and their corresponding passwords encrypted in a bank's asset custody service. My wife is the one I've entrusted with the knowledge of how to access them if the need arises. It's an extra layer of security and peace of mind, knowing that the keys to our digital assets are safeguarded and accessible in emergencies.",
