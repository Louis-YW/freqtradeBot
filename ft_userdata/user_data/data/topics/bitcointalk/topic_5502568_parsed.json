Definitely should be on the reading list of anybody wanting to know more about the business and current events shaping the legal landscape.The writer can probably be described as \"crypto skeptical\", but this is very good, fact-based reporting.And I thought this story in particular might spark some discussion here about the role of the SEC in regulating the crypto trade, and whether Bitcoin should be considered a \"security\" or not.",
