It's crazy to think that someone really did suggest to make sex as a sport and launch a tournament for it. In terms of betting I would personally not. If you bet this early on new  \"sports\" like this, you will be forced to do blind bets since there a very limited information about the contestant also given the fact that it is sex that we are talking. They won't be a searchable information about the contestant unless if they are a public figures. I'm guessing that the contestant isn't well known.",

Looking at the 16 disciplines, I can make an idea of what these championships will be about I don't know whether this news disgusts me or makes me feel fun. It's too new an idea for me, I suppose that I'll need to see it to make a proper place composition. As a European citizen I find the news shocking but not insulting, but I have doubts about how other citizens of different cultures and religions will take it.",

With the way things are being handled in the society today where things that were once considered as an abomination in the last are now being overlooked and viewed as a normal thing, this news of Sweden organizing a sex competition does not surprise me a bit I once thought of this because we have seen different types of bettings what about if someone just wake up one and make an announcement that they would be a sex game where you can net and win. Although the issue is mind troubling but yet that won't stop them from doing the competition, the only issue I'd have is when casinos decides that they want to implement it into their system.Like we all know majority of gambler's religions die not support gambling yet they still participate based on their believe of not harming anyone but if this pornography bet is introduced alot of the casino's will lose so many of their customers.And for me,.I don't watch pornography so I would never tune in to any media that will be broadcasting this event. It's a no go zone for me.",

Maybe those who organize it think that there's nothing else that can be used as a sport until they finally use sex as a sport and do it openly. I don't know if the casinos will be interested in taking this as a sport and putting it into betting on their sites but we'll see how many of the casinos we know will react. But if it ends up being included in the list of sports in casinos, I won't bet on sex.",

Nevertheless, sex is not a sports rather for pleasure and making babies but people sees as a sports to exercise one's power or long periods of being on a race in a lady.",
