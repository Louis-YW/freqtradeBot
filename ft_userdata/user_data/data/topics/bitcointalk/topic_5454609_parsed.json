So far no update came from their TG group. Kicking people could be a red flag.  My question is what makes you trust them? I meant you bought their ico. In my opinion since they were only cooperating with shit scam exchange site like la token and it's not even worthy to be bought. Any tokens that cooperated with la token can be considered as a scam project. So many people were still asking the same question regarding the status from their purchase in the ico site.",

There's no guarantee profit there and it's been long gone since the profitable ones has existed.For more awareness, you can post this on Scam Accusations  following the format below;Quote from: escrow.ms on July 21, 2013, 05:28:05 PMScam Report FormatCode:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]That will gather more attention if you post it there and if someone who also invested on that project and got no more communication on them or has been blocked as well, can also see it from there.",
