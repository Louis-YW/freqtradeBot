  "content": "In our National Anthem we speaks about peace and unityWe all have said it before but have we ever meant what we said in the National Anthem and its pledged, Some of us would have but most of us don't really care about anything except our pockets and same with the government.During crisis we mainly resolve to violence and protest destroying private and public property's and killing ourselves.Most people sees protest as a means to steal because of the public unrest it brings and so they always try to escalate anything.In every Crisis people see it as a chance to make money, Like during Lock down (palliative, Face mask, Sanitizers and others).Now during fuel scarcity, the price of fuel was hike, Some states sold #600 per litre or more than at one time and the Low supply of cash, The  pos agents see it has a means of earnings and the bank is not really helping much aside from the fact that there are low supply of cash some banks are not really helping with them always giving their customers headaches during transfer especially those using USSD.Protesting is never a bad idea but there is something called peaceful protest which is hardly practise in Nigeria, in every Crisis they always want to destroy things and later complain about the growth of the country when you are destroying the little you have and no body really think about fixing them and also it discourages those who really want to see the country grow.Like during the time Nigeria didn't qualified for the world Cup, people started destroying the Stadium, what did they think someone who was planning something good do after seeing that.This is the reason why most Nigerians are still being use by the government and other top people of the country because they can be controlled with Money. As long is gonna bring money people don't really care what they do and it really disappointing how we are disunited  because of Money.                         God Help Nigeria",

      "body": "Violence leads to loss of lives and property, this makes it unethical to use violence to approach any given situation at hand. The election results have been announced, Tinubu was declared the winner of the election. Let us accept it will faith and not think of doing something funny to breach the peaceful state of the country. Those people that supports violence is based on their selfish interest, as they see it as a medium for them to steal from the public during this unlawful act. The problem that Nigeria has is unity, we are not united in Nigeria, Igbo man doesn't see Hausa man as his brother,neither do the Yoruba man sees the Ijaw man as his brother. All these are the major problem in this country, if tribalism can be tackled,I think we have solved half of Nigeria challenge to unity.",

It was a great honor that the election results did not disrupt the peace and unity of Nigeria, despite people no d real truth of the election results which is a sign Nigeria still stand for peace and unity. Some of d tins we are seeing now that is wrong in our land will be a tin of the past because d time is very close for all those tins to start happening.",

      "body": "The peace and unity in the Nigeria anthem is just like rythem we sing for satisfaction because it doesn't have any impact in the country,If there's peace and unity, then we won't have ethnic and religious crisis, during the time for protest that's if there's a need for protest, the government won't ask the military to shoot at innocent protesters, if there's peace and unity then an hausa man(northerner)won't see himself as his the only one that should be liable to rule the country as president and see the Southerners as just followers,I don't wanna say much though but In Nigeria there's no peace and unity....",

So despite all this why do we always prioritize our negative side more than the positive? Because the truth of the fact is that Nigeria as a country has it's own flaws just like many others, and as good citizens, it is our duty to either fix it or stop painting our image black amongst many other nations, because Nigeria remains the best country so far, but what we lack is a good leader to take us to the promised land.",

      "body": "The value for peace and unity cannot be underrated in our society. If properly upheld, we will curb some unnecessary public unrest we have in our society today. Our forebears wrote and adopted \"PEACE AND UNITY\" as the last line of our anthem because somehow they wanted it to be some sort of guiding principle by which we live daily. These expectation of our ancestors has been trampled upon severely by both the custodians of these code (the politicians) and the common folks.Furthermore, you would agree with me that the neglect of peace and unity promotes social divide. One of our major problem as a nation is ETHNICITY. At our level of civilization over 80% of our citizens are blinded by origin. Some people would always throw back an unrelated quote of, \"charity begins at home\" whenever their behavior is questioned.More so, RELIGION is another major ANTI peace and unity in this country but i am sure we are not ready for that topic.I will conclude with this point;THE DAY WE FULLY UNDERSTAND OUR ROLE, COMMITMENT AND DUTIES TO OUR  NATION, THAT IS THE DAY WE WILL ENJOY PEACE AND UNITY.",

I have learned to focused and remained useful to myself because whatever thing you says, it will go no where and yet we keeps bothering ourselves while those who truly owns this country enjoys all the benefits forge ahead.",
