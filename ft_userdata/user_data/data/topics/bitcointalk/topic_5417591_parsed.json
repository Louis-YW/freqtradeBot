  "content": "Was thinking about the way something was done 35+ years ago on a BBS I was on.You could be banned BUT there were 2 types of bans; the forever ban as it was called which is the same as the perma ban here and the X day ban where you could come back BUT who you were was gone. You came back as a new user. It did work to keep things a bit calmer because, there was no rank or merit or trust post count was king. Would something like that work here? It would allow mods / staff to ban people a lot more quickly but not worry about people coming back.Certain things, like plagiarism and threats could still be perma bans. But, other offenses just get you a 30 or 60 or 90 day vacation and welcome back to being a newbie.No idea why it tripped across my brain today but does anyone think it would help here?-Dave",

The temp ban without posting or pm i guess is enough. Considering the time that will be consumed again just to get merits and ranking. It also sounds like you were just given a permanent ban but just evaded it since you will turn back to newbie or sounds like you were nuked.",

I would have to come back as DaveF2 The point was that there are a lot of people evading bans now. Those that got banned for just spamming / being disruptive / whatever could come back BUT it's a new user. So they have posting limits and no images and all the other restrictions. I would think it would accomplish 2 things.1) As I said, it would allow the banning of more people quickly because it's not a 1 and done. Think of it as a time-out. You could come back but are starting at zero.2) If you DID do something and did get banned you could come back as yourself and not worry about getting kicked.Say I did something that was over the line but perhaps not worthy of a permaban. I could get the boot and loose all the perks of a legendary. BUT, I could come back and still be a beneficial member of the forum. It's harsher then just a temp ban, not as brutal as a perma....As I said it was from a BBS back in the late 80s that I was on. Before the internet and everything else, so things were a lot different. I don't know if it can translate to the modern discussion board as a viable thing.-Dave",

      "body": "We already have something as you describe. I have occasionally seen the mods allow someone to create a new account after being banned so they can continue participating in the community. It is pretty rare for the admins/mods to explicitly allow this, however, there are also many instances in which this is implicitly allowed as many who have been banned come back as new users, and most of these people do not get banned for ban evasion. I don't think ban appeals should be eliminated. A ban appeal is an opportunity for the person banned to present evidence/an argument that the mods may not have considered when deciding to ban someone. When done publicly, it also allows the community to weigh in regarding the person's benefit (or possibly lack thereof) to the community, which should also be considered.",

I think it is too harsh and is not a good one.Getting a second chance is not easy and to have it, a perman banned user should have a good contribution, good net-effect for consideration. So if that user eventually gets a second chance, if the forum de-ranks the user back to a newbie rank, it is like wiping out all the past contribution, all reputation.If it is applied, I guess people will choose to create a new account rather than try to submit a ban appeal and wait too long for a second chance.I only know with a second chance, there are some types of offense:- Coming back instantly, without a temporary ban (like 30, 60 or 90 days) AND without any time for signature ban- Coming back but with a temporary ban (like 30 days, after that the user can start using the account) AND a signature ban (like 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years).",

So, here goes: You're saying that (sometimes) after returning from a temporary ban, you should have to start from scratch with a new account?That seems a little harsh to me, especially once you consider the type of offenses that lead to temporary bans. I'm also not a fan of the double punishment (i.e. not being able to participate for a long time and \"wiping\" their progress).I think there's a good idea beneath the surface, and I like what you said later in the thread about reducing ban evasion and about having something harsher than temporary bans but not as harsh as permanent ones, to give the mods more options.What do you think about the idea of introducing activity reductions? I would have suggested merit reductions, but I think people will bare their teeth at that idea.So, maybe a very short \"time-out\" just to cool down (5 days or something) and then instead of locking their account and forcing them to start from scratch with a new one, just set their activity back to 480/240/120/60/30/1 depending on the nature of the offense?That way, their account stays intact (trust feedback, merit, etc.) and the punishment can be appropriately scaled to fit the crime. In fact, depending on how many punishments were handled this way, ban evasion could probably be almost entirely eradicated.",

And there are more then a few users like me. This way the mods have another tool in their pocket. Couldn't something more simple like a signature ban (that we already have but is imho underused at the moment) would be a sort of middle ground approach, instead of perma banning or not banning at all? People usually plagiarize because they want to farm merit as fast as possible to achieve higher ranks and join better signature campaigns, so if they can't make money but they continue to be active and helpful members their their case would be revised after some time (lets say 6 months- 1 year) and possibly signature ban lifted. Regarding eliminating ban appeals part, I like that even less because I would like to see ban appeal process being even more transparent that it currently is, where people don't get any feedback from admins for months or even years. I realize that sometimes no answer is an answer, but how hard is to reply in one of those threads saying \" we looked into your appeal once again and an answer is no\" or something along those lines.",

It's just your perception or, maybe you're understanding every the other person's appraisal the other way-round: don't pick an offense if no one seems to see through your vision.

Being banned on this forum doesn't really do anything but cost you the account that is banned. I do agree that we need to get rid of ban appeals period. There may be a special case that pops up (unsure what that would be at this time), but for the most part just eliminate them altogether. If someone is doing something that gets them a permaban, do we really want them coming back? Haven't you ever heard a leopard cannot change his spots? The naim027 appeal was the last straw IMO. He made the forum look foolish and he had higher ups(at least 1) protect his secret. If anything we need stronger bans. IP bans would help but ultimately is not the solution. The goal wouldn't be to turn people away from bitcoin or the forum, but to teach the shitheads of the world that we don't want or need their type. We all know the world isn't perfect and some users circumstances are much much worse than others, but you ultimately make the conscious choice on whether to be a shithead or not.
