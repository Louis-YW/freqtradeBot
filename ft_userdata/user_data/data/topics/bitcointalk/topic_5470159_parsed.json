That's the logic and everyone have had their own pattern of playing games. Some people might feel a particular day and time is very much favourable to them to play with the believe that they would win their games with luck on their side and it works out that way for them.

I remember hitting above 5 consecutive losses on 90% winning chance rate while your strategy is just using 80% win chance rate. The increase on bet is what makes this strategy lethal once lose streak occur because you will burn all your bankroll with just 4 loss streak.",

Like what you said lossing 3 times is not a good one. So we must think that  in the world of gambling we can not assure that we are always the winner in our bet so we need to think deeply and make a wise decisions..",

If you want to make an \"easy\" +0.5x then statistically speaking the most optimal way is to do it in a single bet.Just like with those very common and ancient method of martingale system. Few consecutive losses or streaks would really blown up your balance. Dealing up with dice is never been giving out that assurance that you would really be getting the same results on which you could really be able to exploit and milk out. I have experienced the worst martingale consecutive losses which it did really reach up to 24x as far as i remember. No matter how big your bankroll is, when losing streak comes then expect you would really be having a blown account balance unless if you do set some stop loss then you might save up yourself but since these bets are instant then knowing it beforehand would really be that too late.Single bet with 1.5x roll then its whether a win or loss then its up to you whether you would continue or would really be just continuing but most likely people would really be that continuing until they would blow up their entire account balance.",

But, the 0.2x payout helps balance it out, making it more manageable. Despite some folks being skeptical, I personally think it's worth a shot. Just keep your fingers crossed that you don't hit a losing streak of 3 or 4 bets right away, or you'll be in a challenging situation. It's even riskier with a larger bankroll, but if luck isn't on your side, it can be quite a problem.",

And you find the profit stop, it's easy, but the variance always does its thing and corrects it in the long term.",

Just choose x1.5 odd on dice and roll it. It's the quickest way to 1.5x your money.There is a strategy on one side and there is a mathematics on another side. Your strategy doesn't really matter when there is a math behind each game. Casinos have house edge that mathematically means that doesn't matter what happens, long-term casino profits. You can't make 2x2=5 because it's 4, this is the rule of math and no strategy can change that result.",
