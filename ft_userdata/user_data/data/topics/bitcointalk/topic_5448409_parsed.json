What are you hoping to achieve by spamming the forum with this same message over and over again?Ignoring the advice and warnings of other members in the community and continuing to push the same message just makes you look foolish and, frankly, a little desperate. Why are you still persisting with this foolishness?@All, I suggest you check his post history before engaging in a discussion with this member.",

Always remember that scammers will first give you an address that you won't recognize as a scamming site, then lure you into possibly downloading software there. Some will show fake dollar or bitcoin balance and ask you to deposit equal or more dollar or bitcoin to withdraw it. Those who claim to do such work are frauds. Without complaint you will straight up think scam. One more thing you should always remember is that someday you will get nothing without hard work. You have to work hard enough to get it.",

So that their bulk email campaign will stop operating.Use this link to report https://www.namesilo.com/report_abuse.php",

Losing money definitely sucks, but this is not the way to respond to it.Wait a minute, I am a bit confused.Taking a look at OP's recently created topics it seems that he was being targeted for some fishing campaign and initially I thought he came to the forum to confirm or deny whether it was a scam or not. He was of course told it was a scam and nothing about the mail made sense.So, how come you are implying he lost money? Because as far as I have seen everyone around here has been explicit enough about it.Â  Also, I doubt any white hat hacker can realistically revert Bitcoin transactions for others. This whole situation looks so weird.",
