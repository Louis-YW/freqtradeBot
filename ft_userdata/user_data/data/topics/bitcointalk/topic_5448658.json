Giving evidence and facts to back the accusations irrespective of what the accused have done, it is more to back up your claims with evidence so as not to cast doubt in your side for not fulfilling his own part. Without evidence one would think OP is not genuine and must have been paid for such act which in the real sense is not so but it has been ops experience with the accused.I think after seeing this accusations placed on his created thread he should have responded to it to clear the doubt and free his name from the accusations but no response yet. Seems and looks fishy though.",

But what indicates her confirmation is that the member deleted his recent posts and old posts confirming that he was actually providing translation services in the Korean language as a bounty hunter, and I do not think that he was dreaming of an offer worth 2 bitcoins.2 Bitcoin is a very large amount (more than $ 60,000 at the current price). How did you pay him this amount without any guarantees? I don't think you thought he was reliable just because he has an account on the forum. This is crazy, man. I would like you to tell us what this content requires $ 60,000 to translate.",

I have tagged the manager while we wait for an explanation. If they weren't guilty, why in the world would they delete their service thread? Makes no sense to me.Exactly, he can come and explain the accusation against him so that he can clear himself. But if there's no explanation about this and he won't come then that speaks clearly that he's the one that's guilty and OP's accusation is real. However, it's still unclear to me how was your transaction to him and how you've lost 2 btc on/with him.",

If you are accusing that person then kindly share complete details so that forum moderators and other high rank members can take proper action against the user.I'm still in shock that how could you send 2 BTC, that is a big amount, to a Jr member with just 1 merit. Things are somewhat fishy, I mean no one could be so irresponsible to trust someone with a Junior rank and blindly send 2 BTC worth of coins without any proper escrow channel.

If A hacker was the one who took control of the account, we could have been able to see recent password change as well.The fact that he edited the older ANNs shows that he knows what's going on.Quote from: SamReomo on April 14, 2023, 07:20:33 PMI'm still in shock that how could you send 2 BTC, that is a big amount, to a Jr member with just 1 merit.

The editing of the older ANNs points another finger towards the accused that he or she might have done something suspicious and don't want others to see that.

Those random girls have the power to scam even the technical nerds, after all boys will always be boys. But, still 2 BTC is a very high amount for anyone to lose. If that really happened to OP then that's a very sad news, and if OP gives enough evidence to prove his accusation, the accused should be punished accordingly.",
