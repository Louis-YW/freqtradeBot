I felt the need of compiling this list Â so that members could read them and take the tips into account since we are in for the ember month and this ember season things happen which calls for more vigilance and alertness for one to not be taken unawares by any of such unwarranted circumstances. Putting your personal safety into consideration maters Â a lot as one would need to be alive before he or Â she could be able to enjoy life and catch fun they desire to. So in that course, I decided to do a little article on it and would further add more tips as time goes on.The tips you gave is very important as well and I will also add it to the list while working on adding more tips to the already listed items in the OP.",

      "body": "It baffles me how people just scrap out some months of the year as more important month than the others. Until we change our narrative towards this so called months of trying to meet up target that will eventually lead to danger or loss of lives and properties, the better for us. Over the years, not only in our country but all over most countries they take ember months so serious to the extent that if you are not making efforts to meet up Christmas stuffs like others it will look as if you're the most lazy or unserious person in life. You see people running helter scatter just to meet up during this period. Some people even call it ,,,\"rush hour\" tell me what makes it a rush hour that people try every means to meet up, people drive carelessly and recklessly.It's about time we stopped this assertion of Christ being born on Christmas day after all Christ never celebrated his birthday while on earth. So there is absolutely nothing too special about ember months it's just the way people take this months so serious that makes it look as if there's something too special about those months. The most funny part is that after the so called ember months, as soon as we enter new year everywhere becomes calm again, hardship and suffering start again because people have larvish their money during the periods of ember months. It's about time we stopped this act and take every month as equal with others and spend money judiciously.",
