If I total it at the price of 42k, you sold your computer for 2520$, and for sure, when you sold it, it was second-hand. If what you're saying is true, it means that when you bought your computer, it was more than $2520, which could be double the brand new cost of the computer you sold.This is my honest opinion and review of what you are saying. First of all, the story is unbelievable. You mean you bought a brand new computer laptop for more than $5,000? I am not a rich person, but I am not ignorant. Let's assume that what you say is true. That kind of decision is not bad if you allocate what you sold in Bitcoin and then hold it until the bull run.",

If what you're saying is true, it means that when you bought your computer, it was more than $2520, which could be double the brand new cost of the computer you sold.I believe he sold it for more than that, read the “for the rest of the money I saved them in my bank account”I had to do a search of “most expensive laptops” and surprisingly some of them fits into the category of Op’s laptop because if he was to sell a used laptop for more than $3,000 then it should cost way more than that in its new form. And if you were able to get a laptop like that in the first place then it shouldn’t be a problem for you to save money to buy bitcoin without having to sell off your properties. Not sure, but will you be willing to let us in on the name of the laptop you sold?Edit:Quote from: puradak on December 17, 2023, 05:12:19 AMI missed one 0 lolNobody said you are ignorantOoh now I was really surprised that a used laptop would cost that kind of amount I guess we know why now.  Well congratulations on your bitcoin purchase.",

I don't know how you arrived at such a decision but I know that computer is a necessity for a young guy especially in our generation. Unless you have another computer. The best thing to do would have been to start small with any amount you can afford to hold for long, even if it is $10 per week or month, let it be what you can afford to hold for a long time without being under pressure to sell. At a situation like yours, if you encounter any emergency that requires money, that Bitcoin may be the first thing to consider for sell. To benefit the most from Bitcoin, it is always advisable to imbibe long term approach and that will only be possible when you have made provision on how to fund your needs outside your Bitcoin portfolio.",

Don't misunderstand the concept of buying bitcoin and hold. It doesn't mean you must sell your most valuable asset to buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin investment is for more matured minds whom have a tangeble thing doing, that generate a steady means of income which you can be investing little by little rather selling your computer and invest. If you don't have a business that brings money to you, I think you will still sell your bitcoin to use the money for other porpose. Except otherwise.",

Think carefully about the strategy you want to use to approach this market. Because here I also see many individuals selling their personal assets or borrowing to be able to buy bitcoins, don't consider it too forced to own bitcoins because the main issue is life balance. Because I understand that at some point, when the investment becomes profitable, it gives them the conditions to pay for many other things in life.",

He already sold the computer; now I think he only has a smart phone for him to do cryptocurrency stuff, and I think I said in his last post that selling his computer is not a good option if he needs it for his studies or bitcoin investment. But yeah, he already did; now the problem is, how can he grow the fraction of bitcoin he has? I hope the OP knows how, because even if you don't have a regret now, if you didn't do well in bitcoin, then there might be a regret you will feel, but of course we don't want that to happen. I guess it's good luck for your investment journey. I hope you earn from investing in bitcoin and bring another computer for your reward.Lastly, I think it's a better option if you don't sell your computer and just find a freelance job or sideline for your bitcoin investment, but I think you want to buy bitcoin immediately, so that's why your only option is selling your computer.",

OP, nobody gives a damn about what you sold and how many BTC you have bought. Just do your thing and good luck with your Bitcoin journey. This is a really tiny amount of BTC. Do you expect to become a millionaire overnight by making such \"grandiose\" Bitcoin investment?Just keep HODLing your coins and don't panic, when the price crashes(it will crash sooner or later).
