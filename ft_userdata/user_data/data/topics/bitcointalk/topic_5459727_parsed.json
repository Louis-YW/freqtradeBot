It was previously scheduled for June this year, but it has now been postponed to the second half of 2023..Looking forward to the good news from Brazil as well..What do you think guys, let's discuss...Source: https://blockchair.com/news/argentina-embraces-btc-with-its-first-bitcoin-futures-contract--17cb469d07",

Let's hope they will not let any corruption and bad operations from the exchange.We don't need to see things like Terra, FTX from Argentina. Market will be dumped or has fud if an exchange has problem with its operation.",

      "body": "Well, nothing to cheer in this news apart from the fact the Argentina government is showing a bit more interest in Bitcoin. Futures contract means it will follow the price trend of Bitcoin without buying or selling actual bitcoin. So people will invest by the name of Bitcoin but they won't get to hold an actual Bitcoin. So no liquidity will flow into the crypto market as no buying or selling will be done in physical Bitcoins. It's just a clever method of making money out of thin air and nothing else. But it's good that the name Bitcoin will get highlighted to the investor communities in Argentina and it may make some people intrigued about it. That's all!",

Plus, the people I hear don't even trust their government so they would not like to participate in this futures thing. Or maybe its just for rich guys who don't know the difference with real Bitcoin and fake Bitcoin.Right darxiaomi?",

Did Argentina really launch future contracts for bitcoins, or did they allow them?I tried to look at the source and since it is in Spanish, which I do not speak, it has been translated as shown below:QuoteBitcoin: cryptocurrency futures contracts begin to operateThe new investment instruments supported by the Bitcoin Index start operating in the Matba Rofex futures market. What features do they have and how do they work?So yes, Argentina has allowed Bitcoin futures trading on the Matba Rofex futures market.It is not big news, and futures trading is not trading in Bitcoin, but rather speculation in the value of Bitcoin, and therefore they making money from the price fluctuation, although it may affect the price before the time comes to close the positions.",

What I'm trying to say is that, this news isn't for you. Also, worth mentioning that some people will get curious about this and do their own research and then find out that it's not bitcoin per se, they would most likely press on and learn more about bitcoin then and there.Why did Brazil took too long to do what Argentina did? Is it because they're a member of BRICS and somehow China is influencing them?",

I sound like an asshole here but no matter how small the exposure, if enough people talk about it which is most likely increasing at an exponential rate, the exposure will increase anyway, and what you're saying will eventually happen because some of them won't be able to get those contracts, but they'll try to find ways to get their hands on bitcoin.Quote from: joniboini on July 14, 2023, 11:08:07 AMQuote from: Latviand on July 14, 2023, 09:42:34 AM~I'm not sure where did you get the impression that the gap between them is so long.

This is amongst the numerous steps implored for the smooth actualization of Crypto adoption in the world.

It is more acceptable and more easily adaptive at individual level.Oppositely if you are doing this at a national level, as a government, on behalf of your citizens, you must take a bigger risk. If anything bad happens, the nation will be collapsed financially and it is harder to accept for your nation and its citizens.Small nations are more easily to take risk than big nations because small nations and if their economy have been in bad conditions, they have reasons to bet with Bitcoin like El Salvador.",

I hope other south American countries will also adopt such steps to streamline the acquisition of crypto. Because such steps not only help the local citizens to make up a good living even in the high inflation situation but it also provide them a hope on to which they keep living and working to get something in return.Because a man with no job might become stressful as he/she has nothing in their hands to do while enabling such option they could do future trades with little money which before they can not. I assume (if I am not wrong) this one future contracts in platform is centralized means company is centralized which have it's own flaws but to attract the ones who have trust issues over Crypto or BTV will be resolved if such companies are backing the contracts. This will definitely urge other countries to adopt such steps just like different platform followed the steps of block Rock to get approval for ETFs. I hope this step will bring more adoption and less manipulation because as I said centralization has it's own perks.",

Because bitcoin world will not see that much money coming in from Argentina, it's not a rich nation and that means there aren't all that many rich people there that can help the price grow.On the other hand Brazil is a huge nation, still terrible economy of course and needs to grow a lot, but the wealth gap is there, which means that there are some super rich people there, and if those people get in with the futures, they can get in with buying as well. That's why that could be something good in the end, I am guessing that it will be a profitable business when this grows into a lot more nations and a lot more people as well.",
