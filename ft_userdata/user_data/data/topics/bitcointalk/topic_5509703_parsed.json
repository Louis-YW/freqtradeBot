Thour you should not hurt the emotions of the subscribers by reporting the emails, please show some respect as these emails help's them a lot to stay updated haha (Just kidding as the forum is getting worse with the political topics in this section).I'm sure this topic is going to be deleted  .",

All information is now fast-paced, even platforms are competing to publish, whoever gets the attention the fastest. So, if you mean a paid subscription, of course i wouldn't take it. Back to your problem, they have mainstream social media, maybe you can ask their social media representatives about your problem.",

You could also use another email account to see if you'd encounter the same problem. I also agree about the social media suggestion.I'm not subscribed to them so can't do a personal input. Though of course, there's nothing wrong in using a medium you're more familiar or comfortable with, you do you.",

I didn't know there is a Bitcoin magazine that delivers physical paper magazines to their subscribers. If you can't reach them via emails then find an alternative channel through which you can reach them. Do they have social Media handles? Are they on Reddit? If none of this works , then chill for some time and try again. Good luck",

Or is the September issue released already?Anyway, if you're up to date with your payment and you're sure you missed an issue, you could contact them through Facebook or Twitter or Instagram if they're not replying via email.

Aside from that, it's not ideal to subscribe to their newspaper if you don't get their emails now then you should be happy because a lot of these sites have forgotten about the initial mission and vision of their platform and are not sending unwanted, misleading, and inaccurate information to subscribers.",

And without it no development and promotion is possible. Although Bitcoin Talk is a good platform negotiation for all communities of bitcoin. But the launch of Bitcoin Magazine in 2011 is a breakthrough and development. Through this, people will get the update of bitcoin and the awareness of the crypto market. A very good team is working for its improvement. And it is striving for the improvement of this magazine. And I think it should be appreciated by bitcoin communities",

He probably bought subscription to some weekly magazine and stopped receiving those. He tried emailing to them, but they aren't responding. I would be pissed too if I paid for something, never received it and the provider stops communicating. And even if everything is in real time, some people still like collecting and reading magazines. I don't see anything wrong with that. And why subscribe to newsletters or emails and then report them as a spam if you don't want to read them in the first place? Don't subscribe to those emails, and you wont be causing problems to people that are actually interested in newsletters. You wont be offending them too.",

Even with digital options people still like physical magazines for collecting and reading. Companies should respect that choice. Customers deserve to get what they paid for on time and get help when needed. Good service keeps customers happy and loyal. I hope he will get it soon.",

The no response after waiting for weeks is the nail in the coffin.And frankly, there's good chance this situation could spiral into the same pattern in the coming weeks, as well. So might as well exhaust your options if there's even a slightest chance of turning the situation around. Probably consider posting in other communities as well.",

Since you have already tried email a couple of times, maybe try calling them if they have a customer service number. Sometimes talking to someone directly can help resolve things.  If that doesnt work, and you are really not getting anywhere, it might be worth looking into other options like filing a complaint or dispute the charges with your credit card company.  A scam accusation would probably be justified as well.",
