  "content": "Hey everyone, I'm the guy who runs crypto for the homeless. This year has been quite good for us - so I wanted to post and give everyone (especially our supporters) an update about everything.First and foremost, our volunteers in New Zealand have been absolutely killing it. They went out many times this summer and cooked/distributed 500+++ meals.https://i.imgur.com/ppW7FB5.jpgthe link above shows a handful of images from their amazing work.We've also had a chance to get interviewed a few times and the following pieces are now available to the public:https://cointelegraph.com/news/pennsylvania-pharmacist-feeds-thousands-of-homeless-using-cryptothis is an article an editor from coin telegraph wrote about myself/the organization. We are so grateful to be included on such a large website!Podcasts:I was able to be a guest on 2 different podcasts, the first one is called \"the room of lives\" which is available on spotify:https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bGpPyhgRKyN7knyZAiCy7and the misfit heroes podcasts ( our episode will release next month, but a link to the actual podcast is below)https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-misfit-heroes-podcast/id1469814756?uo=4It was such a great experience being able to talk about the project on a public platform, I really hope that this allows more people to discover us.Future things/goals:We are looking to get at least one person (assistant) working for us helping us out with reddit/social media. (someone with proficiency and experience preferably).We are looking for sponsorships with companies/organizations - basically we can offer a moderate amount of exposure for your company/project/organization and assuming we are a good fit for each other, I would like to introduce more sponsors into our project (can be pretty much any level of sponsorship even as simple as a link exchange).We are looking to get at least our full time employees paid even a minimal amount.https://cryptoforthehomeless.com/support-us/I've created the above wallets (which are entirely separate than the wallets we use for the non-profit) just for the purpose of getting some of our employees paid for their time/gas/etc. Every single person worked for the project completely pro-bono from the very beginning so this is something that would be nice to have as an added incentive to gain/support employees.Celsius relief:A cool idea I had somewhat recently was a result of the news of ce-fi collapse (specifically celsius). On the subreddit, a good amount of people seem to have suffered a great amount financially and I imagine potentially lead them to homelessness. I was thinking of using my existing platform/credibility to create a side project meant to partially restore a small amount of funds for the most dire cases of homelessness caused by celsius. The barriers to this would be a lack of trustlessness and thorough verification of the financial state of the people who would be restored. As \"bad\" of an idea this is, I've always been one to not back down from doing something literally nobody else is even lifting a finger to do - and this is no exception. Can be expanded to include voyager/other ce-fi situations of course.",
