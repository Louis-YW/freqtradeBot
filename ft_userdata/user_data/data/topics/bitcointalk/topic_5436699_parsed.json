  "content": "Back in September last year, I was introduced to Online Casinos and with the ability to use crypto, it interested me. I didnt know about any platforms, apart from Chips.gg, which was told by my friend.Being new to this and not knowing much details and being in a middle eastern country, I didnt want to open the account with my personal details, so i used sign-up with Google account option. The email I used was my alt account with a made up name of Brian Junior. Once account was created the details were auto filled by google as Brian and I didnt know that it will be the reason for me losing my winnings and account being blocked by Chips.gg and holding my funds in future.After the account was created, I started playing on their platform. I was loosing more than what i was winning and mostly played slots (sugar rush, time spinners and such) as it was simple and easy to understand for someone who was new to all this.In a period of one and half month my total wagering on there crossed $300K+ and reached the player level of 70+. I had been deposting and withdrawing the funds all through this time amounts ranging of 200$-3K$. In the first week of November deposited some money again and started playing slots. Luckily I hit a max win of 10K on one slot and withdrew the funds after sharing some giveaways in the chat as well. The deposit came to my wallet within 5 minutes. Even at this stage the account name remained the proxy name that was auto filled by google while opening the account.Later that day, I deposited some more funds of around 2900$ (by this time my account was already restricted but I was not aware of it, so basically they allowed me to deposit funds when the account was restricted) and continued playing and ended up with wins totaling upto 6900$. When i tried to withdraw the funds, it said i had reached daily limit and i was surprised reading that error, as that platform's daily limit stated was 50K$. Nevertheless, I tried to ask in the community chat on their platform and realised that i was muted. I couldnt write anything at this stage on their public chat. I didnt think much of it and thought of waiting 24 hour wait time to reset the withdrawal limit. Next day when I tried again to withdraw after the 24 hours cooldown, i received the same error message that my daily withdrawal limit was full.At this stage i contacted the support team, who initially were not sure what was the issue and said they will transfer the case to other team member. During this time i was reveiwing their FAQ to understand the issue. I came accross on their, that in some cases they need KYC. So I went back to the account verification page and completed the KYC process with all my documents and udpating the name to my actual name.After a day's time the team came back to me saying that my account was restricted as the system flagged my account for multiple account usage. Initially, I couldnt understand what was the issue, however, I later remembered that few weeks back I had lost access to my chips.gg account and was not able to use \"reset password\" as my email was logged in my other device. So, I went ahead and created another account and played for 2-3 hours (played slots and with no bonus as such, so no ill intention or manipulation was possible). Also, I was not aware that one is not allowed to have multiple account (i mentioned earlier, this was my very first time in online casinos and such). Later that day, when I was back at home on my personal laptop, I was again able to login to the initial account on chips.gg as the password was saved on that device. After that day, the secondary account was never used as I had not use for it and it was proven in their logs as well.I told them about this incident and clarified everything. They said they will investigate and review my KYC document and let me know their decision.After 2 days, they came back to me saying that my KYC document were rejected and they had to close my account and hold my winnings. I was shocked and surprised with this as their claim about my KYC document being rejection was insane as the documents provided were  the official documents and were used by me always for my Binance account, for my international travel and for my bank account. So rejecting my KYC document  didnt make sense and it made obvious that they were just using various excuses to not pay my winnings.Later I opened a case on Casino.guru about it and even provided ,y KYC with a video recording holding my documents. The team of Casino.Guru were helpful initially and they too were surprised as to how my documents could have been rejected. When it was clear that my KYC document were valid and authentic the team from Chips.gg came up with a new excuse saying that my KYC was not matching the initial name that was on the account when it was created. Since then their has been no response from their side and my winnings were never honoured. None of these were any issue for them, till i kept deposting and loosing. Only when i won something, they started making so many excuses and made false accusations about my KYC documents, just so that they dont have to honour my winnings.After looking around online, i came to know that i was not the only player who has being scammed by Chips.gg. Whenever a player starts winning some big prizes, they come up with various excuses and rules to make sure that they can hold back the winning and start accusing the players.I hope this serves as a fair warning for new players who intend to join this platform and to watch out before they lose their money. There are many respectable and customer friendly online casinos that should be the first choice rather than choosing a sketchy and scammers and worst customer service team of Chips.GG",

      "body": "they didn't really falsely accuse you since you actually made a second account and the initial name on your account is different from when it was created. anyway, it looks like there's really nothing we can do here since it is now deemed close for them, I am sorry for your loss and perhaps next time read the gambling site's ToS(or at least parts of it that you think is important), it is important to read it so issues like this can be avoided.",

      "body": "Thank you all for the response.I do understand your point and am not claiming that there was no fault from my side. However, I clarified with them and informed them about the situation. It was obvious to them that there was no manipulation or cheating intended from my side and no hidden agenda to open a second account. Only reason I opened a second account was for the fact of not having access to my main account. Also the second account was used only for couple of hours and never used again.My concern on how this case was dealt is the main points. Selective decision and implementation of decision to restrict the account only when the player won certain amount. The second account used was weeks before this incident and they didnt bother to convey the message to me or restrict my account. They allowed me to use my account for more than a week and allowed all deposits and me loosing money. Only when I won some bigger denominations, they decided to take account and withhold my winnings. Even when the account was restricted, they didnt inform me of anything, no email or any notifcation on the page to let me know that that account is restricted. Also they didnt restrict deposits on my account when the account was restricted. This seems to be intentional for decieving players and withholding of information from the players with intent of misleading. Due to this, I had deposited approx 2900$ in the account before being  Addtionally one can note that there reasons for their decisions kept changing. Each time I provided some evidence, they came up with another excuse. It was evident that the action taken by them was not for breach of terms but to make sure that they can hold back the winnings.Links Relevant to the case: Chat: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDSWy0koArPttyLDxA--9wC1i7o3mNW6/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1rrtHlhLU7zQem6uCnUratGScwd_wZlGG/view?usp=sharingLink to Chips Wallet where the funds were deposited (the last 3 deposits were made when the account was restricted and I was not informed, so i couldnt even withdraw my own deposited funds): https://bscscan.com/address/0x5d23033f78d61dfc5c99680642826084542e1c16#tokentxns",
