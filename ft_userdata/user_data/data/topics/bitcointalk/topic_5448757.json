What is your purpose and you posted it here in the forum? Are you trying this website you provided?From what I can see, if these predictions that are posted on this website happen, many communities here will likely rely on the predictions that you will post on this platform.",

      "body": "Your tactic of promoting that website is quite awesome. Â  But, if you made that site just for fun then why are you promoting it in this reputed forum? Why not on social media groups as they are too nice for such funsÂ  related sites and they admire such things. However, if your program can generate something useful that might be profitable for short term, but what will be the situation when innocent people trust the predictions of the program and invest their money according to the generated predications, who will be responsible for their loss?These types of programs are experimental and I would alert every trader to do enough research before putting their hard earned money on such predictions. I'm not against the idea of OP, but it might cause more damage than good to newbie traders. And, nobody serious enough about trading would promote such a thing.",

It does look very real and if you wouldnâ€™t had that note then Iâ€™m sure someone might have fallen for the trap.Â  Good to see that have been coded to such good detail. I gotta ask though what Ha the purpose of having such site except for fun. I mean I can watch it once or twice may be but third visit would be just casual one. I think slowly you can turn this site into a prediction game. Like what would be price tomorrow and distribute XY price from the pot. Itâ€™s about your imagination and willingness to do it. Good luck dude.",

Like, is there open-source code on this so that we can see what the algorithm is and how it works? Though I know that we don't take it seriously, I am amazed at how much the probability of winning this is. If you bought yesterday and sold today, how much is your profit? I also want to see tables like in the BTC history on the website (I know we can check it on other websites, but it is better to see it on that website).",
