It is because they know it was not really dangerous when you are doing it personally. All of these are presumptions from a person who is mentally affected by their losses due to investing the wrong coins. If they just investing in Ethereum, they are actually safe but because they get hyped from believing developers, huge offers (x1000), and it leads them to get nothing (losses). Focus on your goal OP and invest in ETH without a doubt, I was sure you get what you are trying to wish for before investing.",

There are old ones, but the profits you'd get aren't as big compared to investing in a completely new project that will grow. For ETH, I wouldn't really guarantee that it has a good future, any project has really if you think about it. Comparing it to other altcoins though, it has better chances of standing in the future as a big name (if it isn't already is) among cryptos. I myself have kept a part of my portfolio recently into ETH. If you're debating, then going for a DCA method isn't that wrong, especially if we consider how the prospects of ETH is better than other new altcoins out there.",

I think Ethereum definitely has a good future, next to bitcoin it is by far the most popular and also the biggest crypto project out there and if Ethereum should really fail, then 99% of the other altcoins will probably die way before that.ETH is the number 1 altcoin because they invented the whole smart contract functionality. Without that feature we would not have stuff like tokens, NFT's, Defi, Dexes, Yiel farms and other stuff today. All those other platforms like (Solana, Cardano) are basically just copying what Ethereum has invented.",

Because many people lost their money from investing in this and that possibly happens to you also if you are too careless with your decision. But if you can make it so well, earning a huge profit is not impossible. I would say that - don't look on the negative side but rather ignore them. ETH has been in the market for so long and it shows a satisfying performance that is why people never give up from investing this even during the dip.",

Probably the drawback for ETH is the slower network and one of the expensive network until now.
