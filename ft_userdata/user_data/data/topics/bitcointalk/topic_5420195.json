Also today multiple international companies like Meta, Intel, Stripe have announced thousands of layoffs. Overall the day is not good to judge the fundamental of bitcoin. There's panic all over the place. For me, it's an wonderful (once in a lifetime) opportunity to score some more bitcoins at a cheaper price. People who have surplus money, can average out their buying price during this period. The market will be up pretty soon!",

I don't know where the bottom line lies for the price, but it looks like $12K is still very good not to worry about being touched for the rest of the year.

Many smaller exchanges aren't taken into account by price tickers but insolvent exchanges are? Also, in traditional markets if there's a threat of insolvency and panic dumping you stop trading for the day at least until there's a full statement from the people in charge. Here people are left to themselves to add fuel to the fire and burn in it. I'll end this rant with a joke: Bankman is officially bankrupt.",
