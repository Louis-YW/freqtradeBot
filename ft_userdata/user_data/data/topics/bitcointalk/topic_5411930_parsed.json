If in the future the project turn to be scam, I wouldn't mind and hope someday they will get a karma.",

The organization is Built with Bitcoin Foundation. They are building communities. So the goal is more or less wholistic. They not only provide access to potable water, they also build schools, engage in sustainable farming, improve healthcare, and so on. They're operating in 5 African countries.",

You can become a philanthropist for any specific person or project that you could observe the life and development of. Helping a sick child, for example. If you write that you don’t have a lot of money, then it’s better to send more to one, to whom it will really help, than to send a lot of kopecks to the majority, realizing that you can’t change anything in their trouble. In Christianity, there is a concept that alms should be generous.This is of course my opinion, but of course, you can send to thousands of companies by creating a list of those you have helped.",
