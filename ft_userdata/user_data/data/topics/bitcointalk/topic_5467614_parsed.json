The forum and also google’s search engine that’s why they still have some certain issues or are unable to find some answers that’s somewhere buried inside an old thread. So do well to learn how to use keywords to search it will reduce the probability of you getting to scroll through threads that are not relevant to your problem. Another link I want to share with you is; https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook#chapters it will get you started in learning the technical aspects of bitcoin . One last thing make sure you share your idea or what you understand about a concept and if it turns out that you’re wrong you’ll be corrected by those that have experienced in it rather than just bottle it up inside your kind… the more you share your ideas the better you become in that thing so do well to share your ideas when you have the chance.",

So all you need is to search for good topics here. Even while asking questions seniors can quote the references.Here is [AUGUST UPD.]Beginners & Help Encyclopedia a thread that can potentially help you to find the good topics, just choose your category and search for the topic you are looking for, most likely you'll find all them, the list is regularly updated by the author.Ratimov created this list for the newbies to easily search for what they are looking.Quote from: Ratimov on October 07, 2021, 10:46:09 AMThis encyclopedia currently contains 1064 topics with various guides, articles and links to various resources. __SNIP__",

Always check the pinned post for every section where you're reading threads like on this section, the Beginners & Help. You'll get to see specific topics that are on the pinned post and start reading there.And based on your history, you've already posted on your local. I think it's better for you to converse there and interact with your other local members because it's going to be easier for you to understand the topics that you're interested with your locals since your local board is one of the most active.

Learning from them, you can also do your own research and add to that knowledge or run some comparisons, which can also help in the easy understanding and expansion of your learning life. But when it comes to wallet security and investment, you should be mindful of the kind of channel you follow up with and the kind of information you get from them and practice, as they can be misleading and some can also not be information from the real channel owners. YouTube's account of influencers is being hacked on a daily basis and used for some sort of malicious activity, which they can either try to mislead the users followers to their phishing link or any of such. This forum is rated as one of the best sources to get information from, as it forms from experienced people talking based on what they know, and when they detect scams, they always bring them to the public's attention in order to warn people out of them.",
