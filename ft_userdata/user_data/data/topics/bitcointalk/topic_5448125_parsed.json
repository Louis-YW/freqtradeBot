It's their responsibility with their decision, action and result of their investment.However, it can be different and turn to be your responsibility of you use their money, invest in Bitcoin on behalf of them, because they don't want to practice how to buy, store bitcoin. You will take all responsibility and risk if you do that.",

So because of these issues hope I won't into trouble for telling my naibours about Bitcoin investments. I don't think it would be a problem, for now since it's their first time knowing about Bitcoin, you should just start with the basics. Try educating them on how it works, the importance and what Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies can do for them. Don't rush them into investment and advice them not to invest now until they have fully understood how the whole system works. When you then see that they are fully ready to take the risk then you should stand again as a guide for them so they wouldn't loss their capitals. if everything goes well, then I think you just made your self a Bitcoin literate community.",

Agreed, the OP would have to make it clear that the information given is an introductionto Bitcoin and the benefits it offers to everyone.The OP would have to make sure they can make it very simple for other people to understandand be able to explain all the questions those people will have.There may also be a need for the OP to explain the FIAT system, a lot of people only see themoney in their pockets and accounts but dont know the wider details of FIAT banking system.",

So as a newbie I am, can I tell people about Bitcoin or will I get into danger if I introduce people to Bitcoin investment and they lost their little capital?Newbies giving investments advice to others often turns out with a bad result. I'll advise that you just talk to the people about bitcoin usage, benefits of using bitcoin and also the possible disadvantages of using or investing in Bitcoin. Give them resources that summarise everything that they need to know about bitcoin and if they're interested in the technology then they can proceed to buy some. I have never been a fan of helping others invest in anything the fact that something could go wrong at any point in time just scares me and could also turn the good you wanted to do into something else. Op, just try to write down the pros and cons of what you're about to so, if you feel the pros are far more greater than the cons you can proceed but if you feel the cons are things you won't be able to handle then I'll advice you look for other means to keep creating awareness without put hung yourself at risk.",

Imo the smartest play here is keeping your mouth shut about anything that's about money. Nobody needs to know how much money you got. Notice that, I said \"money\", I didn't even mention bitcoin. You don't need to give investment advice to your close friends because like you said if anything goes bad, they will blame you. Why take the risk? Since they don't have the same experience you have, everything they do can go wrong. They may lose their private keys, they may install trojans, make bad trades, in the end they will blame you for everything happened.",

I guess it's better for you if you are not going to tell anyone in your neighbors about your bitcoin investment. It's not that you are going to hide it from them or you are doing illicit activities. It's just anyone has it's connotation what bitcoin is, unfortunately, there are people who still doesn't believed or call bitcoin as a scam investment.And if by chance you gain financial freedom because of your bitcoin investment, then so be it. Let's them salivate on your success, you don't need to brag as well. Just keep a low profile, that's it.",

The fact that others are not vocal about their involvement or lack of in bitcoin does not mean you are the only one into it in your local community.

You also need to make sure that you aren't providing any sort of guarantees. If you are recommending it as an investment, express that it is a long-term investment that is highly volatile in the short term and provide all of the information that proves Bitcoin's technical infrastructure (proof of work, the blockchain) and use case (digital cash, store of value, hedge against inflation, limited supply etc). Also make sure that you aware anyone who is considering to invest in Bitcoin after you talk with them to ensure that they are well-versed in both non-custodial wallet solutions and that their security is ideal enough to not lose their coins from hacks/viruses/system compromise.As long as you follow the above and aren't providing any guarantees, creating unrealistic short-term expectations and/or holding any Bitcoin on behalf of anyone else, then you shouldn't feel worried about recommending people to diversify some of their investment portfolio into Bitcoin.",

You have already mentioned that you are a newbie in the world of Bitcoin, and you haven't mastered it yet; how could you spread the knowledge about it to your community if you haven't mastered it yourself? If you still want them to know about Bitcoin then you should teach them the basics of Bitcoin, like its Limited supply, usage, community, and current value. Also, teach them the risks involved.You should also inform them about Bitcoin's volatility and show them the history of Bitcoin prices. First, give them proper knowledge about Bitcoin and make them aware of those fraudsters. It would also be great if you teach them how to invest in it and, simultaneously, teach them to learn as much about Bitcoin as possible before putting the money into it. That way, you will be on the safe side, and you have promoted awareness about Bitcoin in your community.",

Hai OP, you has good intentions, but you also have to know your limits before you explain to the people around you about Bitcoin.In my opinion, there is no need to rush to introduce cryptocurrency or Bitcoin, especially to the wider community, if you are still a beginner and don't understand or don't have enough knowledge about it.If you realize that you are still a beginner, then you must increase your knowledge first so that there are no misunderstandings from your explanation later to the public.You better focus on learning more and maybe also take the time to prepare a good plan and strategy to be able to teach or introduce Bitcoin to the wider community.Before trying it out to the wider community, you might be able to start with your closest family. From your experience introducing Bitcoin to those closest to you, then you can evaluate what is still lacking.Good luck for you OP, and keep it up.",
