I was reading through conversation from 2011 and seeing people just throw around bitcoin not knowing its future value just blows my mind. I wonder where these people are today. I was searching up some of the wallets and it seems like most of the people emptied there wallets by 2012 probably during some of the first pumps. I also came across many old users that still have around like $50,000,000 in their wallets still but havent been active for years. I wonder if these wallets are abandoned.

People will check out some of the addresses used for campaign and will be surprised to see upto .5, .7, 1.5 BTC. They will also wish to have time machine to claim what we are earning today. Having this in mind will make us make some informed decisions because people already paved the way for us.Talking about post quality, definitely the only available boards then was bitcoin boards. But today there are numerous boards and it seems that the quality of posts in the future will be worse than we have now. Maybe, by then AI might take over this forum and we will be missing the good old days of human conversations.",

Obviously it’s the one thing man can’t have, a chance to reverse the time as this would offset the very balance in nature itself. So, any fantasy of having a chance to buy at such a low price is in the wind. Bitcoin at that price could mean there are no more investors but, we ain’t about that now.It’s had to imagine anyone who knew what Bitcoin was at that early stage, even with a small price projection to ever abandoning their wallet. The most that could happen is a lost key or having there coins on a non existent exchange but of course, they should have known better.So we take advantage of the times we have in today to do the most at where we find price, when our resources do allow and the space we’ve got in this forum.",

I believe most of them thought this currency was just like new currency that won\"t go mainstream. Many of them are now regretting for not keeping some of their bitcoins though.And in today's situation, it is quite easy to hold because people are thinking that this currency will go bigger in the future as they can compare to what happened after more than a decade of its existence in the market.

Imagine how much inherited crypto will be lost to the ages, and much that will lift the value of existing coin.If we look at the past, many people who owned bitcoin eventually died and couldn't access it anymore, maybe we can understand this because in the early days of bitcoin, no one thought that bitcoin could be what it is today, it's just that some people believed in bitcoin as future assets. I often read on social media people's experiences at that time when it was so easy to get bitcoin, for example from a faucet, but quite a few of them ended up forgetting the Seed Phrase which meant they couldn't access it anymore.However, as time goes by, we realize how important it is for us to pass on our Phase Seed to our wife or children so that when things happen that we don't want, our assets can still be accessed. So the lesson we can take from people in the past is that passing on bitcoin assets to their family is indeed important. but before inheriting we must first educate ourselves about bitcoin.",
