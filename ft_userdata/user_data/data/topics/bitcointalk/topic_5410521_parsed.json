  "content": "I am curious, have you heard about Digipad (DGP)? Currently hyped and I actually like what they are offering. Usually, I don't post any brand new tokens but Digipad seems interesting to me since they want to create a safer environment for crypto investors. Digipad is a private investment Launchpad where startup projects would raise funds. The most interesting thing is Digipad managed insurance if any of the project rugs are hosted on their platform. Because they will host only SAFU projects where project owners can't rug investors. After a long time, I have invested a brand new token lol. It's because they KYC'D with trusted Pinksale partners. Currently, they are in the presale phase. It's quite surprising they got listed on CoinMartketCap & Coingecko before starting a private sale. I have to say the team behind Digipad is quite strong. What do you think? You may look on their TG: https://t.me/digipadglobal",

After digging around I saw that there are indeed others that are talking about this project, but it was hard to find some concrete information, except on the official website, of course. The idea behind Digipad is definitely interesting and I am looking forward to seeing what the team can come up with on the future. It is still very early for a solid conclusion but I am genuinely curious to see how this project will develop.",

      "body": "Looking at the initial coins and the featured services to offer, I think DGP is one of the rare project that will possibly give its investor a huge return.  With only 10m initial supply, the price can easily get to x times since it can be easier to manipulate or undergo pump and dump.  But I don't see any innovation on DGP since all the features it offers are already existing on the market.  Even though the possible huge profit is enticing, I think I'll pass on this one.",

If any project makes a rug pull during this window, our DIF compensation will be activated for the project's private investors.",

Expecting 1 or 2 times return in a short time is still make sense at this moment. I didn't even expect this to go to the thousands percents return. A few times return more than enough,.",

But after seeing the activities in the telegram group, I have no interest anymore. It can be seen that the project only focuses on hype. This is very dangerous for investment.I don't have any good experience with projects that move on the basis of hype alone, let alone against communities that post token purchase notifications in their groups.",

Still, now I like their marketing strategy seems to have a banner on dextools and bscscan. And have managed a large number of Telegram communities where posted Digipad. Good Luck with those bought from Pinksale.",
