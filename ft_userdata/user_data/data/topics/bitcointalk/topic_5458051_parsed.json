First the number of activity or post per merit doesn’t guarantees a person has a quality poster, there cases where some could get close or above 50 merits on a single thread imagine this person has less than 40 activity or even post, it could simply be mistake that with higher merit this person posts are of quality but that doesn’t mean anything because aside the one or two thread that those merits were shared on the rest posts could be of less quality. Secondly the person with an higher merit might be as a result of posting in various threads that merit aren’t distributed on like the gambling section or even if the person has post quality most of the posts were skipped for merit unknowingly and that is why the likes of the Sceptical Chymist, fillippone, Ratimov and Loyce V have threads that you could report those posts on for review. That aside, the other thing again is when someone has a very larger number of posts varying from merit like 200+ activity and a single merit or less than 10 then it can easily be said that this person doesn’t post quality stuffs and that is he gets overlooked for merits. Most of these people are easily fond of creating meaningless threads",

A post that is worthy of discussion. Sometimes newbies tend to spam the forum with lots of different shitposting that doesn't really make sense(I was ones a newbie) in search for merit. The merit system was implemented to help reduce such acts for newbies and other members of the forum. So, quality posting is one thing that you are required to learn if you want to rank up. Here are some links to learn how to make quality posts as a newbiehow to make a quality postmaking a quality postQuote from: Mia Chloe on June 29, 2023, 08:53:08 PM.my question is simple and on behalf of other newbies like my self is it necessary to monitor your activity and post count in comparison with your meritsLike does it mean  someone with and account sayActivity;50Merit;87Post;51Has more quality post or is a better poster than someone with sayActivity;100Merit;87Posts;150As a newbie I don't think that should be a burden to you right now, if you focus on trying to balance your merits with activities and post, then you will end up not earning merits. Merits are earned when you engage with post and give a quality reply. But not all post you make are certainly to give you merits. And don't forget you need merits to rank up successfully so you've gat to follow the rules of the forum and try checking out the links provided for you by BIT-BENDER, they will help a long way.",

From the two examples you gave, the post quality of the two users cannot be determined by simply their activity/merit ratio because there are local boards where one can easily get 50 merits posting there, also participating in contests and positing in wall observer can boost one’s merit as there is a lot of merit spree in these sections. It’s often said that the rank of an account doesn’t mean the user is a bitcoin expert.",

A quality post is writing that fits in the discussion, is well-developed, is coherent, and is correct. A quality post should add value to the discussion through the addition of new ideas or exposing the discussion to other important areas. A quality post might also ask or answer relevant questions from the discussion. It shouldn't derail the thread or written in poor grammar or language. It should be written in a manner that others will comprehend it's contents.QuoteLike does it mean  someone with and account sayActivity;50Merit;87Post;51Has more quality post or is a better poster than someone with sayActivity;100Merit;87Posts;150Not everyone that has merits that is greater than activity is a quality poster. Indeed, merit will always be given to a quality post but members can get merit through some other means apart from posts. I have seen members get merits from humanitarian activity, competition or discoveries. Understand that quality posters will always get merits but it shouldn't make you assume that low-merit earners are not quality posters. Maybe some of them don't post on boards that are usually visited by merit sources.",

      "body": "If someone isn't getting a lot of merit, it's not a sign that most or all of their posts are bad. Merit is a limited resource and typically it's awarded for outstanding posts and valuable insights. If you are making average posts, you might be not getting a lot of merit while not actually being a shitposter. Also, using total earned merit can show incorrect results, because sometimes there are posts that earn a lot of merit, dozens or even hundreds; so a user can have a large share of their merit coming from just a few posts, while the rest of their posts are average. So a better stat would be median merit per post if you want to compare users' merits.",

Now, what I consider as a good post, - I don't think that there are a standard for an actual good post that everyone is agreed in this forum except the post shouldn't plagiarize anything, so it might be very subjective - If you are making a new thread, you need to search whether similar thread already made before, if yes read the previous thread and if your still can't find the answer just join the discussion and ask your question in that threadIf you are making a new thread or replying to a please make it at least understandable, use something like gramarly for tidying up your post, it's not rare that I saw some post that are not even understandabledon't talk bullshit, only talk about something that you are really have the knowledge about it, so you don't accidentally spread false informationNever do plagiarism, it will get you bannedI think that's all you need to make a 'good' post or at least 'fairly good' post, I know my standard is not that high on good post, but I think this is the minimum requirement that you are not considered spamming with your post.",
