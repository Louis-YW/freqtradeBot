  "content": "QuoteIn computer programming, a fork refers to the creation of a new process by duplicating an existing one. The new process, known as the \"child process,\" runs concurrently with the original process, known as the \"parent process,\" and shares its resources (such as memory and file descriptors). The fork system call is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to initiate multi-tasking and parallel processing activities.I made an introductory post on the term 'Fork' and how it affects crypto exchanges when it is agreed upon by miners and developers to undergo. I became much interested in the term after reading several comments on the slow transaction speed and network congestion that crypto currencies, mostly Bitcoin, has been experiencing lately.This forking can be one scenario that can be looked upon in such times like this where we experience network congestion and high transaction fees. Aside from the lightning network that was suggested by Bitcoin talkers, if push comes to shove with charts showing a steady decline, in speed of service, another Bitcoin talker suggested transactions speed be increased per second, knowing fully well a fork is what can be implemented to ease the situation. We see this example of a hard-fork with Bitcoins', Bitcoin Cash in 2017.Quote The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for demand.QuoteShort-lived forks are due to the difficulty of reaching fast consensus in a distributed system. Whereas permanent forks (in the sense of protocol changes) have been used to add new features to a blockchain, they can also be used to reverse the effects of hacking such as the case with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, or avert catastrophic bugs on a blockchain as was the case with the bitcoin fork on 6 August 2010.Visit source link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)Should a Fork be the next resort to accommodate the pressing transactions demand, here are some best practices one can do to qualify for and claim a fork.Remember the wallet you used, and your private keys before the snapshot block.1. You would have to transfer your funds/coins to a new address after the snapshot, do not forget to retain the private key of the old address. 2. Go to your stores and download the new wallet once it is live.3. Go ahead and import the private key from the address you had crypto on before the fork, to the new forked coin's wallet.Easy peasy!Visit source link:https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/how-to-safely-claim-any-cryptocurrency-fork/#:~:text=Best%20Practices%20for%20Qualifying%20For%20and%20Claiming%20a%20Fork&text=Move%20your%20funds%20to%20a%20new%20address%20after%20the%20snapshot,the%20new%20forked%20coin%27s%20wallet.",

I tried to use lightning network to see if the transaction and the fee will be okay but I could not use the lightning network. So I decided to use Mempool among the three network listed in the wallet. Which are: ETA, Mempool and Static. The first time I use static and it takes through out the week to process the confirmation, it is still on the unconfirmed stage. I send another transaction again with Mempool and since morning it still unconfirmed. The whole matter just tired me.",

Your take simply made my essay better understood.  It serves to show how the innovation process has been successful at ensuring investors do not loose their coins while issues due to the exchanges technicalities or network malfunctioning due to heavy demand of its usage, pose threats. Users or investors or traders can be sure that whatever the upgrade or forking that happens, their coins can be safely claimed and moved to their wallets of safety.",

Still, even when the congestion is much on the end of the user, it may take a while for miners and developers to agree on and create a fork in the network so as to enable ease of transaction and like a window to ones funds on the decentralized network, before the forking. I think only users on the network with crypto currency like BTC, not shitcoins , can qualify for and claim a fork on the Network they use.",

      "body": "OP's definition of fork is too technical like it's not even understandable. Simply forks in crypto are more like changes, upgrades in the network rules based on consensus. Fyi, don't get confused by hard forks and soft fork. Hard forks are those with split that a new coin is created like BCH and many other after that. Soft forks are those upgrades or minor changes within the network like the segwit. So talking like \"claiming fork coins\" are talking just like you can claim too out of segwit. Well, it's how people are used to say but, it's just an fyi.",
