And anyway if not upi then with what one should receive money with? Imps? Neft is slow so I don't think it's viable option for p2p transactions. You can chargeback a UPI transaction instantly. The amount gets reversed within 24 to 48 hours back to the sender's account. The receiver can dispute it but there is no guarantee that the money will get released. Whereas if you use NEFT, RTGS or IMPS it is impossible to reverse a transaction. The sender can only dispute it with the bank, for which the sender needs to visit his branch and provide valid reason for the dispute. Most P2P transaction made using UPI are being chargeback by merchants who are making good amount by such scam. You can report it to the Police but it won't get solved on the same day. Our justice system takes time to apprehend these scammers. Some of them do get caught but they come out on bail and again start the same scam using different name. Avoid P2P unless you get some guarantee by the platform providing the service.",

      "body": "Well firstly, I would suggest removing the personal data of the scammer from the OP, this is not an \"Investigations\" section/ Doxing is not allowed here.Secondly, thanks for posting this, such information will help others in similar position.Chargeback is something we have to take the risk of in such methods of payment. Paypal has been notorious in such cases previously when digital payments in India was still a thinktank blueprint. Even an escrow cannot save you in such cases they can force the chargeback months after the payment is completed.Has the OP started taken any legal steps yet/contacted the Law enforcement? Those guys in uniform are worth trying, such cases are not completely unknown to them.I would also like to ask because I have not used Binance P2P myself - is UPI part of their system or did you deal with them after getting their offer away from Binance P2P, meaning outside the site?",

First you need to choose the right trading partner, someone with highest ratings, trading volume, positive feedback not based on the price offered.2. I don't think accepting payments via UPI is not a problem when the trading partner is trusted.3. Now you lost 7K which may not be possible to recover but you can stop the user from doing such practices in future ith anyone by reporting it to the customer support and I dealt similar kind of scammers on Paxful and LBC and managed to lock their accounts with all their balance forever and they will run back to you and pay and beg to revoke the support ticket.",

      "body": "Chargeback and reporting a transaction as a scam has been an ongoing issue. Binance P2P is not a safe haven for anyone who wants to avoid a 30 percent tax. As per my understanding, the 1% percent TDS is a big issue, and if someone thinks it is not that then that individual is a fool. The 30 percent Tax is only applicable when you make a profit. Now, if I am someone who does not make any profit as I sell my crypto on the same day then the government cannot question me or can charge me that incredible tax bracket. It is so simple to understand and yet a lot of guys like you are falling into the trap of scammers. Please try to read our local board pin topics before getting into a situation for which you now regret as you lost money.",

So , is it BEST to deposit your crypto to Zebpay directly for an easy withdraw of the funds ?If 30% tax rate is not a concern for you then the most secured way is to use any centralized exchange that has INR pairs, I would recommend wazirx cause it has more trading volume than zebpay as far as I observed and their withdrawal of INR via IMPS is instant whenever I tried it so highly recommended.",

So , is it BEST to deposit your crypto to Zebpay directly for an easy withdraw of the funds ?Whenever you deposit any cryptocurrency on an Indian exchange and if you sell it on the same day without any changes on the price then you won't incur 30% tax. Tax is only applicable on capital gain, for example the best crypto to be transferred on an Indian exchange for conversion into fiat is USDT. The reason being the price of USDT hardly changes as it is pegged to USD. The only issue is 1% TDS to avoid that use international exchange where KYC is not required. There are a few centralized exchanges left that offer no kyc trading whereas all DEX offer the trading without any kyc.",
