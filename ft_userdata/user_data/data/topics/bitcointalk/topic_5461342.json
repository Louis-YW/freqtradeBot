  "content": "As I mentioned in my other topicDays you need to work your ass at minimum wage for a BTC, by countryI simply got tired of standard figures and numbers, maybe it's funnier and more interesting to see the price in other forms, stuff like the bigmac index although I personally hate PPP as much as one can hate stats. Adding the fact that there is no way in hell I could find reliable up-to-date info for every country and its living standard and current prices, I got a funny idea inspired by LoyceV topic and combining it with one of those spammy low-quality therapy session topics in which newbies tell us for a few merits what chatgpt told them on how to live a fulfilling life, here it is>So, to drink (alcohol, or cola or tea or whatever ¬† ) or to buy Bitcoin???Since it will be expressed in prices and tastes all over the world probably a more interesting image on PPP and DCA (drinking costs averages)In short, your favorite usual drink, no it doesn't really have to be an alcoholic beverage!!!, its price, and how many of them you have to forget and leave in the shop before check-out till you save for one BTC. Note:Use the drink you're used to buying daily or something, not some fancy thing you buy once a year because that would really screw things up.Second note, If it's something more exotic please drop an image or a link.Third note:If you're not afraid of getting doxxed, mention the continent at least.Me:Kozel Premium Pi√üwasser, 1.30E/ bottle, so I need to give up 20,472 beers!,",

Because they have passion or want to be a part of this Digital Currency. I even saw some are selling their assets or jewellery to invest in it. So it may varries person to person if they want to save their drinking cost and invest in Bitcoin. If I say my story I was very addicted to drink various cold drinks even 1/2 litter a day and occasionally alcohol. But I minimized it and other unnecessary costs to invest in Bitcoin. And now I have some profits what I usually use to drink to have a good health but I never waste. So I will obviously don't leave drinking but surely I will minimize it and invest rest of them in the most Potential Cryptocurrency.I think it's the best choice to have. And obviously alcohol is injurious to heath and I left it and reduced my unnecessary costs for drinking so that I can invest more in Bitcoin.",
