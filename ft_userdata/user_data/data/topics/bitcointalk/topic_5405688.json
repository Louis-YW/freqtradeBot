  "content": "So I made a tool to help you trade bitcoin: Image link:https://i.imgur.com/83sN2gA.pngTo access it you can go here: https://thesis-masters-project.vercel.app/(you may need to reload the page once or twice due as it's still in beta)the page is beta as I said, so it's not fully responsive so this means no mobile support or small screens pcsYou will need to sign inÂ  to see the tool,To sign in go to the Navigation button and click register or sign in and click sign in as a guess, once you do so it redirects you to the post-login page which displays the data.This will give you access to a real-time buy/sell overview of the whole market (a table showing each transaction and a bar showing an overview), you be able to see trades that are done and an overview of the bar which shows buy and sell overview, it supports BTC, LTC and eth, due to it again being beta we couldn't host certain high volume things such as btc/usd, eth/usd, but besides them, we support all for euro, GBP, and USD for btc/eth/ltc,if possible when you sign use the feedback section under nav (or just post feedback in a reply) if you like the app and if the feedback is overwhelming good Ill keep the project going.Thanks guys",

Can you give the advantage of using it instead of using the exchange built-in chart and data info about the coin and also is there a feature on your tools to change the exchange of our preference for the data that we want to get?Hey, thanks for your feedback/questions, I am not use to this forum as I specifically found it to get feedback so my response might be little messy,So simply this is just the exchange chart details but the only difference has you put on your website and repositioned the data to make an easy view experience?The tool is designed to allow the user to see all active trades that are happening in an easy interface and to be able to see trades across multiple platforms at a single time,The idea is just to allow you to see trades that are happening across multiple platforms in live time, without having the exchanges all open at once.Can you give the advantage of using it instead of using the exchange built-in chartThe advantage is that you can see data from multiple exchanges at once, rather than needing multiple tabs/pages open,data info about the coin and also is there a feature on your tools to change the exchange of our preference for the data that we want to get?On the tool there feature were you can filter by currency or convert to the currency or filter by setting you may need, I hope this answer that part if not just reply and ill reply again!",
