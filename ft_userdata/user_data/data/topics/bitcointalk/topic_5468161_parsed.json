  "content": "When we advice and warn newbies on here about clicking on random links, we always end them advice with finding official links to everything, including software for PCs or apps for smartphones, but today I screamed out loud, saying...  it wasn't supposed to be the official link  I planned to sell my BTC on the Huobi exchange, and I am not new to this exchange at all, I know about their official links, including their Twitter account, telegram, and discord channel, but something new happened. I login to my huobi account as usual and I got a message that they stop the BTC deposit for some maintenance until further notice, cool and acceptable, but I was curious to know when the deposit will be back, so I click on their official telegram link. Before you ask why the link when I am not new to the exchange, I joined too many telegram channels and scrolling through them to find huobi telegram seen annoying so I went through the exchange link.Here is what popped up after clicking on the link They are trying to give me money, that I don't work for, $1000 USDT, and the funny part is the official telegram channel do open up as well, and it's the old popular Huobi telegram channel that I've always used, now this crap is asking me to insert my recovery seed to claim this free $1000 USDT.For the fact that I click on the official Huobi telegram group, this is enough to confuse some people to insert their recovery seed, like what the hell? Coming from the official link? Like I share this to educate mostly crypto beginners, even if it's a messiah that comes asking for your recovery seed, you will be a fool to have trust them, do not trust any body with your recovery seed, it's yours and it should be yours only and privately.

Maybe you should post the link here to help someone newbies identify the clone one. Now the question is which application did you login your account into because you said it was from there you went to his clone site, if it is so then I think you have a bigger problem at hand because it seems you are using a wrong/phishing app or link to login to your houbi account",

I asked in telegram official group and surprisingly, he didn't know either. let's me to tell what's actually happened.Huobei updated their telegram group or username and telegram have a policy that after some time of inactivity they delete group/channel and then anyone could use same username/channel name. Scammer find this and created channel/group with same name. Is this is very old article Houbei team didn't aware about it.Here are some discussion that I made with adminThanks OP , you did a well job by exposing here and now Houbei team will also remove these scam linksQuote from: Bitcoin Smith on September 26, 2023, 12:10:45 PMAre you sure that you entered into their official website?Because when I visited their official link which is : https://www.huobi.com/en-us/ I don't find any such telegram links like you shown in the screenshot so possibly you ended into a clone of Huobi aka HTX while searching the name on Google.Always bookmark the official links, never trust the results appear on Google search.OP is right, this is official link but old data. you can check belowCode:https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/44890678845210",

Like I share this to educate mostly crypto beginners, even if it's a messiah that comes asking for your recovery seed, you will be a fool to have trust them, do not trust any body with your recovery seed, it's yours and it should be yours only and privately. Peace ✌️ This is the most commonly used trick that is always used by scammers. This type of scamming is called a phishing scam. In this method, the scammer designs the site just like the official one and then shares or sends it to someone, and people always trust it as they use the official name and logo. And after that, they offer free money to you. But the question is why people always trapped in their scams so there are according to me is three possibilities.**It may be possible that the person who has been scammed may not be aware of the phishing scams.**The second one is that they use the branding and logo of that official site so people can easily trust them.**And the third one and I think it is the most effective one is that they know how much people are greedy and they hold this greedy nature of people and offer free money.The official Houbi does not ask for your seeds because that is not their policy let's suppose if they ask for your seeds then think about whether your wallet is safe or not. How is it possible that you give your own wallet control to a stranger? The wallet is to save your funds and no one can access your wallet. So be active and not be stupid to spread your own seeds when you create a wallet at the time of giving the key they also mentioned that do not share your keys with anyone.",

That's why he did not fall for such a sh*t attempt. I doubt there would be many newbies who might have fallen for this scam. And as ZainMalik75 has already stated, this might be an attempt by the hackers. When they hacked the Houbi exchange,I was also going to mention that hack, which took place like 3 or 4 days ago, and the amount was definitely not that much, but the attempt was an attempt, and it left a bad impact on the reputation. We definitely do not place our funds on any centralised exchange because they are vulnerable to many hacks.For example, the hack of the CoinEx exchange (shared by some local members in our community), according to reports that I read two days ago, has already crossed almost 1 billion dollars from January to August. I mean, in 8 months, hacks have nailed it.Who knows the inside jobs, but all hands are pointed towards North Korea's hacker.",

It has been, and it will never will be a safe storage of our assets.With the number of hacks happened not only with Huobi, but in all of the Centralized exchanges, and even DEX'es combined, do you still think that it's still safe to store our assets there? Unfortunately, there are many investors, especially newbies who don't learn from this one, and still store their assets there maybe because they're giving free tokens just by storing your assets there. Like staking, but on an exchange.Arrest? Remember Axie Infinity where they got hacked, and lost around $600M. Correct me, but the perpetrators on that hack didn't get arrested. What are the chances that the hackers who hacked Huobi will get arrested? 0% unless they will say it in public that they hacked the exchange, but that would be an absolute bullsh*t. As for the investors who are still trying to store their assets in an exchange, you will only learn once you lost your money because the exchanged got hacked. Don't store your assets there. Giving you a certain percentage in exchange of storing your assets there isn't enough to cover your losses if they got hacked.",

It might convey that they do not care about users' safety, and do not guarantee a safe space with their services. Having defunct services yet still showing it from their end is surely an unforgiving mistake.

I am also aware that Huobi is now called HTX, I have their app on my phone all this while and I always use the app with no issue, I believe this is why people are able to fall for the hack that took place days ago, it's a slick move from the hackers. All in all, free things are bad, many people are able to believe the link because its from the official platform itself, if you are able to doubt that I did something wrong, it shows that if you are 100% of the link you visiting you will also have given up your recovery seed.",
