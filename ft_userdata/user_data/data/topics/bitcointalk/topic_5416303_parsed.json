But, to me, I just see it as an answer in search of a question.Yes, my phone may not be online all the time, but the back end node it talks to is. A store can't take CC payments now if it does not have internet, I can't send PayPal or Venmo or whatever without internet.Having the ability to transact with the Lightning network without internet is nice, but I would call it more a stretch goal, not something short term. More reliable routing and some other things would IMO be better 1st.I use lightning a lot both public and behind TOR. I connect my phone and desktop wallet to my nodes. I for now just don't see this as a big deal.Others, obviously think differently.-Dave",

      "body": "This is a great idea and probably a great move, but to me their might be a little bit of confusion when it comes to the transaction success, lets take for instance this development is has been done and payment are being carried out and store offline and a user like me, who usually set my gas limit when ever i want to send a btc transaction to minimum gas that can be charge, and leave it until the transaction finally execute and sometimes most of the transaction cancel in the process, and what if this kind of transaction has already been recorded by the said third party custodial which are in charge of the offline transaction and the person which i sent payment to has already release my goods to me since he/she is sure of the payment and in the process my transaction bounce back. who will be head responsible for such?",

Probably something that's less important than some other stuff, but it's definitely a great feature to have for those people who still insists to use BTC despite problems with internet connection. Let's just say the world is better with it than without it.",

On the other hand, this might be a total godsend for people in poorer countries/cities with bad reception.Could be, but the person receiving would also need to be able to verify it. So, if it's a local transaction, and niether party has reception then it's not really a solution for anyone. No vendor is going to sell goods or services without confirmation of the transaction. At least, with Bitcoin because of the way it works. I can see niche situations where this does apply, and that's great. I don't think it's as revolutionary as some users are suggesting though. It's just a nice to know feature.",
