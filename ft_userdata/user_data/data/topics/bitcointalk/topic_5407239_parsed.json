      "body": "People get addicted if they do not discipline themselves, if they have no source of income, if they are not busy with something else. But if they discipline themselves, they will not be addicted. Some people said that because a gambler win is the reason they get addicted, but that is no. Addicts can first lose, then win and lose again, but hoping to be successful in gambling is the reason they are addicted.To stay not being addicted, it is always good to know that you can not be successful with gambling, that makes you always think that you should use just little amount that you can afford to lose to gamble.",

Do not self-diagnose; if you think that you have the characteristics of a problematic gambler but unsure whether you really are one, seek the help of your psychiatrist. Personally, I feel irritated whenever I'm being interrupted in my gambling exploits. I mean, if you're enjoying something and in the middle of it all someone bugs the hell out of you, wouldn't you be annoyed? Per your post, that's one characteristic, but I don't feel like I'm a problematic gambler because I never chased losses, nor do I allow my wallet be emptied because I wanted to play for long.",

It's really simple, I'd consider people to be addicted if they forego the consequences of what they're doing continuously. An impulsive reaction once or twice may happen, but if it continues over a period of time, then something is really wrong and should be taken care of early on.",

A better strategy would be substituting the habit for something else that is instead of quitting gambling and doing nothing which can cause restlessness, the time you invest in gambling formerly, try investing it in something else like developing a new habit.",

At a certain time luck is on the side of the gambler, every spin that is missed always wins. When in a continuous position of winning, Gamblers seem to fly with their fantasies, what they have in mind is this is their lucky day. Unfortunately, when you keep on winning, the bets are even more doubled, so that the victory that is already in sight can just disappear because of greed. Smart gamblers can always control their emotions, when playing several rounds without winning, they will stop playing for a few hours. When they play again with a win in a few rounds, they will also stop, because the win is already earned.",
