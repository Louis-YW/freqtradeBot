It is important and advisable to also extra vet the information and advice you get on this forum before application. To assist in your information or advice gathering process, whenever you start a topic of interest to you, or a topic is started that interests you, do well to follow through the topic by reading as much replies to it as you can, so you can compare people's opinions/advice for you. Where you say that a particularly opinion or advice is been given by many forum members in different ways, you can tell that that is a good advice. That is one method I use, which other methods can forum members use to determine the best opinion for a topic of concern?",

Even if your post includes wrong information, moderators won't take any action against that. Moderators will delete your post if it has been made against the rules and gets reported. For example, your post can be deleted if it's considered as spam or off topic. Your post won't be deleted even if it includes obviously bad suggestion. For example, your post won't be deleted if you say \"it's safe to hold your coins in an exchange and you should avoid non-custodial wallets.\"Quote from: royalfestus on October 13, 2022, 05:56:52 PM While I am unaware of the age limit in the forum, There's no age restriction in the forum.",

In my opinion, anyone smart enough to surf the net for information, should also know that there would be a lot of good, bad and outright foolish answers. However it can never be stated enough on the urgent need to do your own research, and know at the back of your mind that not everyone on the net and on here are innocent angels.",

Reading through the whole thread (normally one can, unless it’s a massive megathread) let’s one potentially contrast different opinions and perspectives (some bound to be rather repetitive), and that often broadens one view on a given subject. Good or bad advice or information is often subjective, and even time sensitive. Over time, there are some posters that one may give more credit to, but even so, contrasting other viewpoints, or even with external sources, seems like a reasonable thing to do, especially if one is willing to follow some advice he’s been reading around.",

The would be some way to directly hinder free speech and bad advice could be definitive as, its based on individual interpretation to be good or bad.I have seen a couple of advice that I could categories as been bad, especially from the anticryptos/antibitcoins that sometimes finds there way here. They make you wonder why they are here but in truth, they in turn serve there purpose.This is why it's always important to DYOR and when you happen to give an advice, add a disclaimer as its never ultimate on what a user says.",

The good thing about this forum is that it’s free to everyone’s opinions and ideas, and you will not be criticized for that because I believed mostly are not only gain from simple observations but definitely from their own experience in crypto market. However, it’s up for you how you will rate them but as what is expected, those who are made by reputable and high positions in this forum will always be highly favorable by the majority as they have longer experiences here compared to late comers in the market.",

The advantage of asking your questions here is that we cannot all be wrong and you rarely get one or two answers in a thread. Usually it's 20 or more and it's your role to read them and decide who is right. Ultimately, a forum is only a bunch of opinions, the decision is yours.",

Always remember that this forum also welcome newbies and that they are also free to share whatever ideas they have in their mind. So just try to anticipate that some of their ideas are not tested proven by time, the reason why most of their ideas fail. And if you’re not cautious enough, you will end up believing on them without even doing DYOR first, and then you end up failing too. That is why always learn to weigh things right so you won’t be misguided. And for you to do it, make sure to do your part first to be more knowledgeable and skilled in the crypto market. That way, you will never go for wrong decisions in life since you will always favor those positive advices coming out from pros in the market.",

However, if this is about certain information, sharing, and also knowledge based on certain trusted sources, we can use it as one of the consideration for our own leanring process. Moreover if this is about sharing experience in which can also be one of our teahcers here. But,t ehre are also some other opinion coming from individuals that will also lead to different opinions and advice, including some people who may post about certain information but based on their own thought, not based on the sources. Thatis why we are here not only ready and taking the information, but also we must be able to filter the information that we can take or not. We can actually find so much information to be sources for us, they are so various. But, we cannot also deny that there may be scammers among us that may convince us to do what they want, and then they can scam us easily. Once again, this needs certain filter from ourselves to avid negative sides of the information that we gain here.",
