Only if one has more than half percentage of the hash-rate the attack can probably be possible. It's not definite that you'll reverse the next block, but it's a matter of time until you attack successfully.When a miner possesses 51% of the hashrate and having it mine in secret a second chain is close to impossible right now, because 20% of the hashrate is controlled by public companies (which is 100% likely to increase in the near future). This won’t be the only first bankruptcy but will also face lawsuits after lawsuit for this act.",

Hashrate of 255 TH/s (specified) Required Equipment = Target Hashrate / Hardware Hashrate = 200,000,000.00 / 255 ≈ 784,300 Units.Hardware Cost = 784,300 Units * USD 19,890.00 = USD 15,599,727,000.00Assuming Electricity Price is USD 0.01 per kWh :Electricity Cost = 784,300 circuits * 5.30 kWh * USD 0.01 = USD 41,567.90/hour or USD 1M/daySo, according to this rough calculation, to carry out a successful 51% attack on the Bitcoin network with said hardware would cost at least $ 15.6 billion in hardware and at least $ 1 million a day in electricity costs.",

Like whats said above, the 51% attack won't help. Even that 15Bn because it will just fork another chain and what they'd get is an altcoin. All the BTC holders will receive free money thanks to them.There is no hijacking in BTC. This is why they'd rather be regulating BTC miners to hijack it and we have seen it coming already by the narrative that BTC waste so much energy.",

The banks in America are charging ridiculous fees to their customers and many of these don't exist in places like Europe. Bitcoin will always be competing with the fees charged to businesses by payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, that's what you should be focusing on and they are in the range of 1-3.5%. In hindsight it seems rather foolish to supposedly having held your Bitcoin all this time - if you had sold a chunk near the peak, or even as it slowly dropped down, you'd be able to buy in more as it continued to drop. but admittedly that gets into trading territory that some people avoid.",

Are you saying that enough people would see the fuckery taking place and produce an alternate means of securing the network?  Could you elaborate a little more?  And also for the record, explain it like I can barely use an iPhone.  I am not the best ELI-5 candidate but I can give this a try.If the 'US gubmint' decides to take Bitcoin over, they would need a LOT of mining equipment.  All of this equipment they need obviously requires resources to be produced and there is of course an approximate or specific amount of such equipment that can be produced per day or year.The government needs to own 51% of the hash rate in order to 'overtake' the network.  Since more and more and more powerful mining equipment is added every day, they need to have all this massive amount of equipment built, shipped and ready to be powered on in a reasonable time.  Otherwise, if all of this is done over years, the mining hash rate may increase enough so the government needs even more power to compensate and reach 51% again.Now say they have everything planned so well they actually do get to own 51% of the network.  Now they 'control' Bitcoin.  What happens next?Bitcoin developers, miners et cetera move on to another mining algorithm.  If the algorithm is changed and Bitcoin 'splits up' similarly to how Bitcoin split up into BTC and BCH years ago, the government's massive effort are redeemed worthless and useless immediately.  Because their massive amount of equipment now can not mine the real Bitcoin.  It can only continue to mine the old Bitcoin that they attacked.  But as soon as you and I find out there has been an attack, we will discard the attacked network in favor of the new one.Let us say we get to change the algorithm so that this special mining equipment can not mine Bitcoin any more.  Let us say we get to change it so that computer graphic cards can be used for mining instead.  Now the government needs to purchase enough graphic cards to own 51% of the new, intact network.  If they can do this, we just move on to another algorithm.  And so on.At the end of the day, it is just wasted time and efforts for them.  If someone has something to correct about my 'theory', please chime in and do.-Regards,PrivacyGThank you for taking the time to explain that.  I get it now!",
