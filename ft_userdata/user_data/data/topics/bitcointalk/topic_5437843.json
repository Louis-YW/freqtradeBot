If we keep going up now, there will be a huge correction again and alts will hurt way more then btc from that. It can feel like a doomsday for sure. I genuinely hope we stay on these levels for a long time to make room for steady growth that can later turn to parabolic growth again, i wouldn't care, if it happens in 2 years or so. Right now going just too high seems like paper hands are about to be shaked off.Answer to your question: i think we most likely are breaking 25k but i would prefer less volatility now.",

Although we have some minor correction after going $24,000++ but that's how it has been throughout this bull run.So I think this dump is just like that, a minor correction and then maybe in the second week of February, we will see a price increase to $25,000.Let's see how it goes, everyone is very excited after last month's pump and I'm sure no one has anticipated that.",

But we can't rush to expect the price to go straight back to $24k as I see the market situation will stay like this, up and down, over the next few days. Moreover, the market is currently on the weekend, which will usually trigger the market to experience a correction. And hopefully, if there is a correction, it will not bring the price down even further.",

Along with the positive news about the Fed starting to slow down rate hikes, I believe a bitcoin pump to $25k could happen this month, but to go further, I'm not sure. My prediction is bitcoin will hit 25k in February, but bitcoin will go up or adjust we need to observe more, I can't make predictions after that.",

I don't think, the price of Bitcoin will decrease to $20,000 or $21,000 before it will increase higher because this year 2023 will be different from last year, which this is the right opportunity to buy Bitcoin as much you want so that you will be part of those that will celebrate soon. I believe the price will definitely hit $30,000 before the end of February for those that invested to start earning from their investments.",

The increase is no longer a bear trap, it's been more than a month now since we have this kind of upsurge in prices.So probably our next biggest test will be $25k this month. We have reach $24k and higher already, so it's possible that $25k might be in the end of this month. And then obviously the next stop for this hype train in $30k for this quarter.",

Meta had a huge day and Bitcoin failed to break to new highs and when the sell off started in the late trading session it didn’t look well for Bitcoin.We might chop around in this area for a couple more weeks before we go higher. I don’t think we topped yet. If we get crazy 20% daily gains then I can see us topping out soon like an echo bubble from April 2019 but hasn’t happened yet.",

That was the highest monthly close for Bitcoin since August last year. I'm leaning on the side that we're pretty safe now and it's one of the best times to start accumulating again. I don't think we will see new lows (below $15k), as most of the negative developments have already occurred, although we may see some fluctuations and a bit of volatility in the $20k range.Again, it's always not a wise decision to go all-in or create a leveraged long position even now, but buying spot is very attractive at current market prices IMO.",

It's a time when many people in Asia, who are known to have a significant impact on the market, make investments and gifts. While it's definitely possible for bitcoin to surpass $25,000 in the future, I wouldn't be too surprised if the current high is just a temporary boost. Let's wait and see what happens in the next few weeks. March maybe a more affordable time for bitcoin to truly increase. I doubt that it's the reason for the spike in price, I remember the same case in 2018, when people are speculating that the Chinese Lunar New Year will have a impact (be positive/negative), but it has none to be honest.For this month, I think the sentiments will continue to be positive, so I voted to remain bullish and going to reach as high as $25k.Again, the bulls have control of the market unless there is some negative news again or black swan event this month that will negatively impacted the market.",

I again think bitcoin will break through $25k and possibly hit $30k before a sharp correction after that. Even though bitcoin has rallied to $23k, the market still shows very weak buying power, people are still very wary of what's going on. So bitcoin needs to go up to $30k to attract people who are afraid of missing out and will rush to buy bitcoin, and then it will start to correct again, causing everyone to continue panicking.",

The price will still rallying if bulls is already in control with the current trend. We just barely print a green monthly after the good news about the inflation slowing down in the US but the inflation problem is still there and  might hammer down the price agin with just a high interest rate.We need consistency and strong buying power to convince more trader to have confidence on buying Bitcoin.

The month of February starts great and currently there are no hard falls yet so we can't tell if this month will be like last month when the recovery is fast.I think it's not a big deal if the recovery will be slower this time but it was great actually because it gives us a window of opportunity to buy more coins. The OP should add an option for \"I am not sure\" because this is what I am feeling for now but this can change later once I saw more price movements.",
