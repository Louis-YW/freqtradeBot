But the two here like Axie and wemix games are no longer so noisy and trendy. Because if I compare it to the present, it's hard to make money right now, compared to last year when at least it was quite popular and you can tell if there is any profit.I don't know about Sandbox but I think until now it seems to be better than Axie and wemix, this is just my opinion.",

But I think it wasn't really for those who are busy attending to a lot of things. I tried Axie Infinity but it was only for a short time. Now it seems most of them are not giving much earning anymore. But still I heard of some friends who are continuously playing P2E games despite the low rewards. Aside from Alien Worlds, I heard of Mining Network, Farming Tales, etc. I think they're all in the Wax blockchain.",

Thanks for the share.I think STEPN you need to buy at least one pair of shoe to start earning.  Means you are looking for a game that is free and requires no investment? I can say that there will be no such project and those that are not invested, the rewards are very meager, not worth the time and effort we put in. P2E trends in my opinion have gone down and are almost no longer profitable, participating in them at this point is not a wise choice. If you want to earn free money in tough market times you can learn about testnet, retroactive.",

Let's say you need to invest $1,000 first and you can earn 500 token that worth for $0.01 at the moment, which mean you can earn $5 per day. You will need 200 days or 7 months in order to get back your initial investment. But after a month the token is only worth for $0.001 this will make you hard to get back your initial investment, then after 3 months the token price is only $0.0001 which make you impossible to get profit through games.Just try to learn new skills and offer it to fiver, you can find a real life job too.",

Choose wisely.  You can still earn some coins but the problem here is the numbers of time you need to consume playing the game before getting any reasonable amount price. They just not giving it for free because they also invested huge money in it. In other words, it's more like forcing you to play games rather than free to play because you will see the others upgrading their items and skills fast when using their own money for some upgrades and you will force to do so if you don't want to be left behind. If you want to earn, you need to invest at some point and the problem is when you get addicted and you cannot stop anymore.",

Did you invest in it? Are you playing it already? How's your experience? I read some suggesting Sandbox. Can you guys share some details and experience?I'll continue to watch this thread. I believe p2e will continue to grow and soon we will be able to see games that are economically sustainable. I still have my Axie pets but only because I do not have the time to check them 1 by 1 before selling them. My new p2e investments were League of Ancients and Synergy of Serra but they haven't launched their games yet and I am starting to doubt their potential.",

You can search for most of it and earn tokens from playing them.But the thing is that all of them have dropped in price and their value has decreased a lot. That means that it's market capitalization has also decreased too much. If someone recommends you with those, good luck if you've got plenty of time to play with them and you're just for accumulation of those tokens preparing for the next bull run.",

Thanks for the share.I think STEPN you need to buy at least one pair of shoe to start earning. No problem. Glad to help you a little bit but as far as i know that if there are two choices you can earn from stepn. The first thing if you must buy one pair of shoe to be able to earn from doing daily walking or running and the second way is if you can rent shoe from the market. The income might be different with when you have owned one pair of shoe to earning in the stepn. That's why renting may be better to earn free money from only walking everyday",

I believe that play to earn games will have a trend again but in our current situation, It's pretty impossible to have a hype game right now.

Most of the games were basically rubbish and not fun to play but only attract speculators that traded the tokens for gains and now they have dump them because there's no longer hype surrounding this projects. If you want to invest in play to earn project then wait for the bear market to end and watch which projects are getting the media attention as those are the ones that'll get hyped next and much gains can be made from them. Buying this current ones will be a mistake as most of them can never return to their all time highs.",
