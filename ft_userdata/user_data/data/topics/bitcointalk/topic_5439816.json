Since the fees have been charged on BTC balance, shouldn't the total LN balance be 2,3M?Why instead I have this balance?Missing 6689 sats...",

So why the total is not 4,3M but 4,289,841 instead??!?What am I missing?",

I come across this option which I thinkÂ  can help you know about output balance differences.OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY in one of the discussion at bitcoin stackexchange forum. where the term was clarified.It basically checks, if an input's sequence number is smaller than the sequence threshold (1 << 31 = 2147483648), and if so, it will compare the nLockTime against the sequence number of the input.This may give you some insight into the wallet balance output... Hope I am not misleading you, but give alook at that.",
