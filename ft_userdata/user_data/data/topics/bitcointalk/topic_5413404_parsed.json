That 12.5 bitcoin were they block reward or transaction fees as you said. I've been using bitcoin since 2014 and didn't know that there is another reward other than mining that is on transactions.But if there aren't going to be any block rewards, then where the transactions will be placed as a collection for the miner to process.Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 13, 2022, 10:56:41 AMAs long as bitcoin adoption continues, no problem.

I've been using bitcoin since 2014 and didn't know that there is another reward other than mining that is on transactions.Do not get this wrong, or comparing one coin to another in relation to mining, fearing bitcoin could collapse if all bitcoin are mined.If a block is mined, the miner that mines the block would be rewarded with mining reward (presently 6.25 BTC) plus transaction fee. Where did you think that bitcoin transaction fee is going to? Miners take both the reward and the fee.Conclusively, when all bitcoin are mined, miners would only depend on transaction fee, which should be sufficient by that time.",

It's too much money involved there and far too many will not agree to this kind of chance.Then the \"Where miners will mine something other than bitcoin.\" is funny, since there are already plenty of such miners: the altcoin miners. They may or may not exchange their altcoins into bitcoin ... so this point is imho off topic.Bitcoin no longer being main crypto is also a matter of time. At some point a worthy replacement will emerge. Imho that's not ETH, no matter the wishful thinking of some altcoin traders/investors.I will add that changing the rules can be done by anybody, really. But the consensus will or will not follow them. And if the bulk of bitcoiners don't agree with the changes, that anybody will end up with his own fork, most probably a worthless one.",
