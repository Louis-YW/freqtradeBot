Operating a mixing service is not illegal but when they are found to be abused by users to violate the laws will get them to face the consequences. So whatever crypto mixers have broken the guidelines such as it has been used for money laundering purpose can face legal actions.Quote from: Becassine on July 05, 2023, 01:56:22 AMHow to know if the holders of such an address have committed illicit activities or not? Can the owner of the mixer know?

Though there is always a debate on the importance of mixers and how they can also be utilized by non-illegal means, there is no question that when you are hiding something then we can assume that there can be something wrong, that is aside from claim of privacy, of course. Now, I have not used any mixer in the past and I don't I will ever use one. I think Tornado Cash was targeted because of the claims it was heavily used by hackers and scammers and we have to admit it that mixers are accepting business irregardless of the source of funds and they usually do not ask who their customers are.",

QuoteAs for whether Mehdi himself might be identified, indicted, arrested, or sanctioned, he told WIRED he remains relatively confident about his own fate. He shared a long list of cryptocurrency mixing services on the forum BitcoinTalk, pointing out that relatively few have faced those outcomes. \"It would be silly not to worry about it at all. I take all the necessary precautions to protect my anonymity,\" he wrote—notably, prior to Elliptic's revelation that Sinbad and Blender may be connected—but he added that \"I expect to remain part of the market and not become one of the unfortunate exceptions.\" — Source",

The laundered assets include $445 million hacked by the Lazarus Group, a well-known North Korean hacker group subject to US penalties.

Which make the mixer most wanted among others. I can see on a news that they are investigating this case from quite some time but one of the founder caught by the Dutch law forces. I am also speculating another mixer which is being promoted on this platform. After the last one was seized by official. I do not want to mention the name but I have read some reports from quite some time and I think official will shift their interest toward that mixer too. The point is when the officials will have something in their hands to capture anyone involved in laundering then they will proceed until they cannot make any step that's why they are catching the ones who may be involved in Tornado but they are not catching those on whom they have nothing in their hands.
