On a second thought I was wondering the relationship between justice, dispute resolution and cryptocurrency or blockchain and it came to me that there are could be some disagreement, defaulting of contract or what more in crowdfunding or purchase of coins that may arise in litigation like we have seen in the past with ripples etc.",

I do not think that lightening network is a good example of this. I also doubt if it is decentralized. Anything that is not running on blockchain may not be totally decentralized. Not only running on blockchain but have a PoW security system. I will like to know what franky1 has to say on this.",

Many took the risk for not using a blockchain technology and instead they used lightning network which is more effective for them. There’s a lot of interesting network honestly available in the market and if you are planning to put up a project and looking for alternatives, then lightning network is one of the best option for you.",

Kleros brings interesting insights to decentralized arbitration. It is built on Ethereum and handles smart contract disputes. However, can a platform such as Kleros, with its use of crowdsourcing and game theoretic incentives, work without blockchain but still be decentralized?Yes, decentralization can exist without the support of a blockchain. If you are an old school computer user, you must have used torrents to download movies and games. That's one prime example of a decentralized network existed long before blockchain came into existence. I don't know how Kleros works, but it can certainly exist without a blockchain and still remain decentralized without an authority figure.Or is my understanding on decentralization flawed?",
