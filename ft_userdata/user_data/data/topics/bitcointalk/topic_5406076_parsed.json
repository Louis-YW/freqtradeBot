It's like saying people use cars because they have a window!People don't believe in bitcoin only because it has a capped supply, they believe it in for a lot of reasons including but not limited to:- decentralization- censorship resistance- cheap transactions compared to other payment systems- having fastest transactions among payment systems considering both propagation and confirmation (aka being irreversible)- highest security- and of course because its price keeps rising!Quote from: libert19 on July 13, 2022, 04:29:07 AMto increase Supply if validators consent? Bitcoin is not a centralized shitcoin to have a centralized authority to give consent on changes. It also has no \"validators\".To be honest I'm a little surprised to see this question from someone account that is 5 years old!",

But the fact that has been presented is what makes people interested in bitcoin. the fact that bitcoin is the solution to financial problems that have always been centralized. and bitcoin managed to get people out of the nightmare(centralized finance), and bitcoin made a new hope with a decentralized system. we are already frustrated enough with being controlled by the central government and it is with bitcoin that we get freedom.",

      "body": "the very first blockreward and every one since. and every transaction are measured in satoshi'snothing is measured in \"btc\" at hard data level. a \"btc\" is a graphic display calculation for human visualisationchanging the supply ruins the whole point of bitcoins offering of never changing supply. thus losing that trust by changing it because no one can trust other changes might occur again later if it happens even just once..'once you open pandora's box you cant close it again'.other idea's were to instead make a change where 1btc is 11 decimals to allow more sharable units without breaching the 21m wall. firstly again its a misunderstanding of the rules and also where the scarcity exists plus itwould be very clumsy and cludgy code because it would mean changing alot of things and then having alot of silly checks and validations to try to not cause a 'unit measure bug'the mis understanding is that data is not whole bitcoins with decimals. its satoshi units that are displayed on screens as btc by doing math at display timeanyway lets explain.changing625000000 units=6.25btc (legacy/native) into625000000000 units=6.25btc (new idea)which would literally make anyone with legacy/native UTXO of 6.26btc(8 decimals) only have 0.00625 new style btcbecause you cant change the units of already existing data.. so the GUI(display) calculator that does the converting would represent the numbers wrong. unless you then add extra cludgy checks and conversion code to separate old tx numbers from new style ones, but then increase risks of bugs/abuse trying to mess with thatyep there is no actual \"btc\" stored in hard data. its all sats based. so changing the base units would cause alot of issues that then need alot of messy code to try to work around, prevent abuse ofit doesnt matter if you are trying to change the 'decimal' to being 11 decimals of btc.. or having 1000x extra btc.. at the hard code level its the same thing. its adding 1000x extra units to a transaction/reward and then messing with the display GUI code of the conversion to a btc measure.. to either represent that 1000x extra units as either 1000x btc or 3 extra decimals of btcit simply makes it cludgy to then try to have different calculations for different transaction formats. cludgy code that can then be abused by wallet softwarehowever. other idea's have been:if you were to change the halving code to halve less often EG every 420k blocks instead of every 210k blocks. that can allow more coins. but is kind of pointless. we are already at over 19m already mined so adjusting the halvings now wont allow much change to how many can be mined (maybe 3 million more)EGwe are currently at 744777(time of post) meaning 95223 blocks left of 6.25 meaning 595k coins left of this cycle.if we extended that for another 4 years1312500 excess created(6.25 until 2028)656250 excess created(3.125 until 2036)328125 excess created(and so on)164062.5.. and so onwhich adds up to about 3m extrabreaking fundamental rules for just a 15% change ruins the trust and promise and hard code rules... for what 15%!?no majority would agree to that",

To increase the total supply of a decentralized currency built on a distributed network of self-sovereign full nodes, you merely need to convince every single person operating the said nodes that possibility of mimicking the traditional financial system on the bitcoin blockchain is worth considering and that inflation leads to hastening of economic growth, and that they should give up part of their wealth for the common good. Rational actors will surely refuse such an offer because no one sane would agree voluntarily to become a person who is gradually being robbed by whoever will be in charge of the bitcoin printing press. Scarcity is a core characteristic of bitcoin that was set by Satoshi themselves. Had Satoshi come up with a smart algorithm of inflation adjustment independent of human decisions and implemented such an algorithm initially, the scarcity of Bitcoin wouldn't have existed, and we would have been using inflationary Bitcoin, but still in a censorship-resistant, unstoppable, decentralized way as we do nowadays with scarce Bitcoin. But Satoshi decided that, in the absence of such an algorithm, the most prudent solution would be to make the total supply fixed and known in advance.Keep in mind, no one forces you to use Bitcoin. If you don't like bitcoin being disinflationary, you can always fork yourself off chain and spin up your own version of inflationary money.",

Its supply is limited.  Due to which there is no fear of inflation here.  Bitcoin will no longer mine after a certain supply.

The bitcoin community didn't agree to increase even the block size which created multiple forked coins till date. So I can assume it is next to impossible for the community to agree on the supply increase. Also scarcity is the beauty of bitcoin to be honest. Many people have invested heavily into bitcoin mining to earn their share into the 21 million coins. If the supply suddenly increases, this is going to create a chaos and a drastic price drop. It will be a total mess. So I don't see such proposal is getting a green light from the network participants anytime sooner or later.",

Artificially increasing the supply is basically just debasing a currency, there’s some people who believe such changes could fix security or distribution by ignoring what this basic concept does. This isn’t a new method and happened countless times with any currency almost, and always failed and never benefited the majority of a currency users. Such a change would probably lead to a hard fork, and the OG Bitcoin would still come out as the better currency with more value. It’s probably impossible that every node would agree to such a change ever, so count it as impossible. That an altcoin will do it one day, is highly likely tho.",
