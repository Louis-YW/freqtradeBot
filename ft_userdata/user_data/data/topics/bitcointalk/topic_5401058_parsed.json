  "content": "The billboard has lights and is located near 6715 John Harden Dr, Cabot, AR 72023 which is a Little Rock, Arkansas strip club called Sensations.It is one of the only sides of a billboard not rented by politicians at the moment.  It is located right off the main drive into Little Rock.I'm looking for three people to go in on this for $200 a month with me for 12 months.  This covers everything: designing the banner, creating the banner, hanging the banner, maintaining the banner and renting the banner!  The banner normally costs $500 a month (feel free to call yourself), so this way... you'll save money, I'll make $100 a month, and my little FreeBitcoins.com gets some \"free\" marketing too.Banner idea:Full payment for the three sponsors is required upfront.  I drive past this sign at least once a week servicing salons and vending machines. I will take care of making sure they sign company does their job for us and our monthly bill is paid to them.(Please keep in mind I will have to get the sponsors and stuff approved by this Jim fella.  I do not own this sign or club.  Jim did say FreeBitcoins.com was fine though.)Advertise your business, your phone number, your dog, your love for your wife... I don't care as long as I can get it approved & you pay up front, so I don't have to worry about monthly collections! Is anyone interested?  I'm happy to handle all the leg work, dealing with Jim, and getting stuff approved (in fact, I prefer it this way)I'm trying to market my little company smarter, not harder... or am I... har har  thank you",
