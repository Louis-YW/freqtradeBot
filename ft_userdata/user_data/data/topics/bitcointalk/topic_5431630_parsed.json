And one of the good things this year is that MetaverseGo partnered with SM Megamall to give away Astro NFT's. What is Astro NFT?QuoteAstro NFT is an art collectible with an actual utility, to top it off, redemption is free,” Jake San Diego, MetaverseGo’s Co-founder and Chief Business Development Officer, stressed.Source: https://bitpinas.com/nft/sm-megamall-nfts-metaversego-astro/   In addition to that, I have seen a T-shirt displayed in the SM mall department store that says Bitcoin, it's just so cool to see because malls like this are open to this kind of innovation in the virtual world in terms of mass adoption.",

Whats the utility of the free nft?Yes, you need to drop by on their place at megamall to get your free NFT, and the utility as far as I know was MGC according to what I saw to their platform when you're gonna top up on it.

SM Supermalls have been known to ride on to these promotions whenever there is one, and most probably this promotion is paid and not because SM believes in the project whatsoever. But nevertheless, any publicity is good publicity, although to be honest I don't know what they mean when the NFT has \"utility\" apart from its assumed value. Anyways, from experience this booth is nothing special compared to other booths that are present within the mall. Perhaps it's just too uncommon to see a crypto brand trying to promote its name in a place where people are still quite unsure what cryptocurrencies are. Oh and that shirt looks nice, too.",

I love it how they are going very far to promote this NFT and they must be killing it with the real deal. On this thread itself there are so many people who are interested in visiting the booth and understand what is it and also try it out. :-) I wish our locals had such approach towards the NFT or other crypto related product. In here they will have to go through lot of paper work and law makers. Hope so this becomes the usual thing everywhere.",

I don't expect that NFT to have a unique utility for now but it's free, No harm to get that now. I might go there after the new year celebration. I hope that their cute shirts doesn't cost that much since I do might plan to purchase a bunch if their price is affordable. I should make a schedule of my visit to that mall now.",

Good luck to those folks that are looking forward to having that. I'm far from that place but I know how to go there and have myself travel just for it but I don't know if I'll do that for this NFT. It's cool to see merch that's tied with bitcoin and crypto stuff but I've realized that I'll not wear that in the public to avoid a wrench attack.",

They are also entitled to a free 1-day Game Pass which they can use to play within the MetaverseGo app. Swing by the MetaverseGo booth located at the Level 3, Mega Fashion Hall in between Uniqlo and Faceshop to know more about promo mechanics and NFT utility.This.. doesn't really say much imo. Also for those trying to claim, here are the steps from their site itself for more specificsSource: https://app.metaversego.gg/launchpad/astro/mechanicsI also checked the utility on their site, and confirmed that it's just the free spins (so far at least). Doesn't really make it that enticing, but if it's free then if you're going to swing by then you can probably get it easily. I'd rather they held off it's release and instead developed it's utility more to be released all at once though.",

Apart from that, they start transacting with anyone from 6 pm to 10 pm.And This giveaway NFT that they give is the Gudi squad NFT that started on November 25, 2022. Then the only thing I don't understand is that you can buy NFT via their utility but I'm not sure about this yet. That's all I can say because it's their MGC, it's the utility because it's the one that appears in their payment method when you top up.",

Soon we will start accepting NFT as mode of payment, gaming houses in the malls, parks and what not.At least I would like to think about it in that way. From past readings I understand that there are shopping malls who also tried to accept the bitcoins but due to it's volatility they discontinued it. However, in case of NFT the value could be growing all the time since it is more or less based on the art and collectible ventures. The get valued more as they keep passing on from one person to another. Hope so they do best in the near future",
