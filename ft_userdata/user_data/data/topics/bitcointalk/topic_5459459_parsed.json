      "body": "Totally possible. In fact,Â  NSA has routinely inserted backdoors into computers and various devices to conduct mass surveillance. As such, it would be very much possible that there is some form of backdoor in devices that you interact with on a daily basis. I think the crux of the issue is whether your Bitcoins would be stolen or your privacy would be compromised in this case.The answer to that is probably not, and nothing is ever completely safe.Your hardware can get compromised by an evil maid attack because there is probably not a good way to ensure the integrity of your supply chain and thus it becomes an attack vector. However, keep in mind that most of your hardware wallet and devices are shipped in tamper-proof packaging which helps to mitigate this risk significantly. If you're using your wallet on a normal air-gapped computer, then the possibility is slim. The entropy of your keys are unlikely to be compromised if you properly verify the installation. An airgap makes it a lot harder for information to be transferred and your keys to be compromised. In an air-gap, your wallet probably utilizes counter-measures against side-channel attacks which makes it difficult for your keys to be compromised without your knowledge (cold boot attack, signal analysis etc). So it would be difficult as well.Tl;dr: Is your airgap perfect? No. But the attack vector would be reduced by so much such that it becomes so difficult to compromise your keys such that it probably isn't worth it for any attacker.",

You need to ensure that \"completely offline\" means a dedicated and permanently airgapped device. It should be airgapped at that hardware level, with cards/modules for WiFi, Bluetooth, etc., physically removed from the device. Also make sure you verify Tails before you use it. You can also pull the hard drive entirely and just run from a live CD or USB.If you don't trust the entropy being generated, then use a combination of von Neumann's coin flips, the SHA256 function on Tails, and the BIP39 word list to generate your own entropy and seed phrase manually.",

Yes, in theory it could do something that would have a way to store an old Wi-Fi password that you entered into something else so this mystery device could then connect to the Internet and do something. The odds of that really happening on your average home desktop computer or somewhere between slim and none. Nobody wants to admit it, but I keep telling people the same thing, I could hand you a totally compromised virus infected PC. And I could hand you a totally clean secure PC.

Just don't use an OS that was widely used in terms of user percentage AND doesn't receive any fixes anymore, where EOL applies. You can use it offline of course but why would you bother to use M$ Windows crap for that. (Not interested in OS flame wars...)For crypto I recommend a Linux base as there's less malware attraction to those, compared to M$ Windows. If you like golden caves you can \"punish\" yourself and your fiat wallet with Apple's ecosystem. Just my opinion, don't take it too seriously, I'm just no Apple fanboy. If you like it, that's your decission, I'm not here to judge.Quote from: DaveF on July 12, 2023, 09:48:53 AM...Well said, I'm with you. No need to fuel paranoia.

How could you tell if there was indeed some backdoor on the hardware in your device?Don't get me wrong - as I said above, I think such attacks are incredibly unlikely and even someone as paranoid as me does not flip coins for every new seed phrase (although I do have some manually generated seed phrases).

Most of the airgapped devices are not sufficiently hardened against sidechannel attack vectors, so in technically, they are definitely not the safest form of cold storage. ColdCard, which I have been using now can offer both and generally hardware wallets are sufficiently safe and fool-proof.Any software/hardware can suffer from having insufficient entropy and thus there are more steps and precautions (validations, sanitization, etc) to take than to just run your wallet on an airgapped device.",

It is particularly interesting because it would work even airgapped!The Nonce Covert Channel Attack isn't too exotic and surely a problem with software and hardware wallets that are opaque blackbox closed-source pieces of crap. This attack would make it possible to slowly leak pieces of your seed and bury them in signatures in transactions recorded in the blockchain from such a malicious wallet and you wouldn't even notice it until it is too late. The signing cold wallet could perfectly be offline and airgapped, it would still be able to leak all necesarry data within a certain number of transactions. It might take a while but the attacker has time and can wait. He can put some recognition pattern in the nonce to find his \"rigged\" transactions. If you're covert enough, likely no one would notice or have you ever checked the randomness of nonces for signatures?",
