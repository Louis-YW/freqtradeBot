  "content": "The widest variety of Bitcoin Penny® collectible coins available since 2015!The Bitcoin Penny Company is proud to present our newest off-the-wall product in the world of crypto-collectible coins! Introducing the NEW Bitcoin Penny® Wonderfully Wacky, Mixed-Up, Who-Knows-What’s-Inside, Surprise, Mystery Rolls — filled with rare and random collectible goodness from 2015 all the way thru our current 2022 Copper Collection!THE STORYWe’ll soon be entering our 9th year of minting Bitcoin Penny® Commemorative Coins. And with each passing year, more and more crypto-enthusiasts are discovering our little copper collectible coins. Unfortunately, many of these new collectors entered onto the scene too late to snag some of our earliest and rarest coins. We’re going to fix that now.Hidden deep in our “archives” (office sofa cushions, vehicle floorboards, inside rattling washing machines, etc) was a vast treasure trove of both old and new, shiny and scuffed, dinged and darkened Bitcoin Penny® Commemorative Coins. We gathered up all those loose coins and hand-rolled them to become our new Bitcoin Penny® Wonderfully Wacky, Mixed-Up, Who-Knows-What’s-Inside, Surprise, Mystery Rolls!Each of these new “Mystery Rolls” contains FORTY (40) Bitcoin Penny® Collectible Coins randomly chosen from the following list. (NOTE: Some of the coins on this list are so rare that we’d totally forgotten they ever existed!)THE FULL LIST OF BP® COINS DISCOVERABLE IN THE MYSTERY ROLLS2015     CJB              Standard / Inaugural2015     CJB              Error (Accidental Book-Turn Orientation)2016     DAVE           Standard2016     DAVE           Error (Accidental Book-Turn Orientation)2016     SN               S.

Nakamoto Signature Edition2022     NFD              Mini Physical / DIY Fundable Physical Bitcoin*Where did this ultra rare Double-Headed Sample Proof Coin come from? It’s a true mystery! As a fun and exciting tradition, The Bitcoin Penny Company mints four unique Double-Headed Sample Proof Coins along with four matching Double-Tailed Sample Proof Coins at the start of every year. These special DH/DT Sample Proof Coins represent the rarest of our collectible coins. At the start of every annual release, we auction away to the highest bidders and most serious collectors these unique coins as four individual matching proof sets. As far as we knew, all four sets of 2021 DH/DT Sample Proof Coins were long since added to private collections around the world, so why did we find a single 2021 Double-Headed Sample Proof Coin in our lot of random sofa cushion coins? Did the mint send an extra set by accident? Is this a deep state hoax orchestrated by the underground lizard people? And what other crazy, few-of-a-kind coins might be discovered inside our new Mystery Rolls?** As we said above, it’s a true mystery! **We honestly don’t know. After 30 minutes of cataloging and verifying each and every coin variation listed above, we quit due to intense boredom, so only 10% or less of the “Mystery” coins were ever actually evaluated.PRODUCTBitcoin Penny® Wonderfully Wacky, Mixed-Up, Who-Knows-What’s-Inside, Surprise, Mystery Roll — $100.00 USD     Contains FORTY (40) randomly selected Bitcoin Penny® Commemorative Coins minted since 2015.     All coins are guaranteed to be perfectly old or new, shiny or scuffed, dinged or darkened.     Hand-rolled in that classic brown, heavyweight Kraft paper you’ve come to love.     Wrapped in our glossy “bulletproof” sleeve for ultimate protection!     Includes TEN (10) Mini Physicals DIY holographic security stickers.     Total production is limited to approximately 25 rolls.PURCHASING & PAYMENTSPlease make all BTC payments to the following addresses only: 1TBPCoEc2MYiQtjT4xduZjAqCBjPhTNDh or 3MJZ18DfLWBMF5hFjFLQS6DCLgyeLPg3Tx.PayPal and/or other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Roocoin (ROO) may be accepted upon request.
