  "content": "I am using electrum, I created a 2fa wallet with it. I wanted to be able to access my two master private keys while the third is with TrustedCoin, I imported the seed phrase on another electrum wallet, I disabled TrustedCoin and made it 2-of-2 multisig. I removed the password and backup the wallet file. I used text editor to easily see my two master private key.But I will prefer file backup with my password included, but if I backup the 2fa wallet with my electrum password enabled, I was unable to read the wallet file on text editor as it is full of what I did it know. I think the password of my electrum makes the file to be encrypted which is safer. Is there a way or a tool I can use to decrypt the file?",

The password will work so long as the file is uncorrupted, no matter where you decrypt it.I would be more comfortable with using the seed as a backup method. It would definitely work and there is no reason why backing up the file would be better than it, unless you need the labels and stuff like that. I would probably avoid exposing the seed so much as well.If you're looking for a method, just make sure the wallet file is unencrypted (with the encrypted keys) then extract the encrypted seeds. Afterwards, just use OpenSSL or similar utility and decrypt it with AES-256-CBC.",

Though I will have my seed phrase too in case that does not work.A corrupted file is a corrupted file, regardless of whether it's encrypted or not.  Sure they're may be some readable text in an unencrypted file that might give you most of the private key(s), but that's just a roll of the dice.  Regardless of whether the file is encrypted or not, you'll want to make regular backups and keep them secure.  An encrypted wallet file can be opened on any machine with Electrum installed, all that's needed is the password. Quote from: ranochigo on June 10, 2022, 12:58:43 PMI would be more comfortable with using the seed as a backup method.

I would probably avoid exposing the seed so much as well.Of course the seed phrase should be your primary backup, but it's nice to save labels and contacts.  That is, in fact all that backing up the wallet file will buy you.",

It's still 2-of-3 multi-sig, you just have two private keys in the same wallet.Quote from: jackg on June 10, 2022, 11:05:32 AMDoes the wallet actually store 2 master private keys?The standard 2FA wallet doesn't, it only stores one. If you use the seed phrase to recover the wallet and disabled TrustedCoin's 2FA, then the recovered wallet will indeed store two, so you can spend from it without going through the 2FA process.I would say it's safer to not do any of this, and just keep your seed phrase securely stored offline. Once you start storing two private keys in the same unencrypted wallet file, then you have lost all the benefits of a multi-sig wallet and are essentially just using an insecure hot wallet.",
