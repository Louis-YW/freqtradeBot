It is essential to weigh the dangers and advantages of leaving profits at the exchange versus transferring them to a steady wallet.That's what I mean and everyone should consider security in trading and keeping their assets in a safe place. The point is that a centralized exchange is not a safe depository for assets for the long term, but we still need it to trade, let alone talk to day traders who are actively trading.Finally it is up to the individual how the pattern he wants to implement, whether sending profits every week or having some other pattern which is much more secure, most importantly we must remember that any centralized exchange is not safe to store assets, even though they have complete security features.Quote from: Oshosondy on May 12, 2023, 08:51:49 AMWhy leaving your asset on a centralized exchange for a long time?

If you want to trade, you open a position. After you close the position opened, you can move your money back to a noncustodial wallet. Nothing justifies that and if you can understand what I'm trying to convey, it is impossible for an active day trader to move and deposit money into noncustodial wallets and to centralized exchanges in trading every time they want to trade as this requires transfer fees. You will find it difficult if after trading you move assets to a wallet without custody and when you want to trade send them to the exchange, just imagine if you were a trader who is active every day and how you get around transaction fees.That's why I say you have to have a pattern of trading on a centralized exchange, for example when you reach $10,000 you will send your profit to a non-custodial wallet and the rest is left to trade as usual, but still monitor the exchange regularly at least if something happens you can be notified regarding the stock exchange.",
