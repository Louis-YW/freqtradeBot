I know there were few news about Bitcoin seizures in other countries and it's the local police that handle it, but there are related to clear cases e.g. scam and ponzi scheme.",

      "body": "It's indeed concerning to see reports of the US government seizing Bitcoin assets and exerting control over a significant portion of the circulating supply. These actions raise questions about the balance between individual ownership and government authority in the realm of digital currencies. The concept of Bitcoin was founded on principles of decentralization and autonomy, yet incidents like these highlight the challenges it faces in the real world.While governments have legitimate concerns about illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies, such as money laundering and terrorism financing, it's crucial that any measures taken to address these issues respect individuals' rights and the core tenets of privacy and property ownership. Transparency and accountability are paramount in ensuring that government actions in the cryptocurrency space are justified and ethical.The idea of any single entity, especially a government, controlling a significant portion of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin raises red flags regarding centralization and manipulation. Such actions could potentially undermine the trust and credibility of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, affecting its long-term viability and adoption.The notion of \"blood money\" associated with Bitcoin transactions involving seized assets underscores the ethical dilemmas posed by government interventions in the cryptocurrency market. It's essential for users to be aware of the origins of the assets they acquire and the implications of supporting entities involved in questionable practices.As governments around the world navigate the complexities of regulating cryptocurrencies, finding a balance between safeguarding against illicit activities and preserving individual freedoms is paramount. Collaborative efforts between regulatory authorities, industry stakeholders, and the broader community are necessary to develop effective and fair policies that uphold the principles of decentralization and financial sovereignty.In the face of government intervention and control, Bitcoin's resilience lies in its decentralized nature and the widespread adoption and support it enjoys from a diverse community of users, developers, and advocates worldwide. The inherent transparency and immutability of the blockchain provide a level of accountability that traditional financial systems often lack, offering a beacon of hope for those seeking alternatives to centralized authority.While incidents of government seizure and control may cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency landscape, they also serve as a reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant and proactive in defending the principles of decentralization, privacy, and individual sovereignty. Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be shaped by the collective actions and decisions of its users and supporters, who strive to uphold its founding principles in the face of adversity.",

They literally confiscate it from criminals, people either who did illegal stuff to get bitcoin or who stole the bitcoin themselves. \"throwing people in jail\"...yeah cuz they were criminals who got caught. Very bizarre narrative you're trying to make.Anyway I'm sure they will eventually sell all the bitcoin they have, as they always do. Or in the case of retrieving bitcoin from hackers presumably they will go through the courts to hand those bitcoin back to the people they were stolen from.",

I mean, they do that annually.Also, the Bitcoins that are confiscated are resold in auctions within 2 to 5 years, and I do not think that the laws will allow them to keep them as a reserve. If that happens, Bitcoin is not a POS. Even if the United States were able to collect 2 million Bitcoins, it would not make any change other than increasing the value of Bitcoin.",

I don't see how it would matter where you buy your BTC and you have no idea whether you ever bought from Uncle Sam or not. Whether they auction it in several lots publicly or whether they deposit it on some exchange and sell it there, it doesn't make a whole lot of a difference. Apart from that, I doubt that they arbitrarily put people into jail. There have been some questionable cases for sure, but I would say the vast majority of confiscated BTC was rightfully confiscated according to existing law. But one thing is clear here: BTC seizures have become a profitable business for government authorities. It's a many birds with one stone situation as they need to stock up their cybersecurity agencies anyway and they know they need to develop capabilities and capacities as they sector and its relevance will be growing further and further. Understanding how digital assets work, can be stored and hidden and used is a must no matter what. Pursuing cases like hacks and theft will be the bread and butter in the future and if they develop the understanding and the tools how to best locate and seize digital assets, they can grow their security agencies while financing the expansion with seizures. At the same time they gain influence over the most important financial network in the world.",

Because then we will not be in a position to use it in our favour and the entire system will become centralised. It is definitely not ideal. But countries like United States will continue to play their dirty games. Some Bitcoins they have seized, are from criminals and hackers so those should be fine.

From time to time we have seen the government auction some of the confiscated coins to fund its crusade against crypto criminals and payment to people who have suffered from crypto scams. China would have had the opportunity to stockpile enough Bitcoin but they missed the opportunity when they started making anti Bitcoin policies.

Most of the crypto currencies which the US government has seized were connected to fraud, hacks, or scams. I might not be correct, I don't know any case where the government confiscated people's funds without them being connected to criminal activities.",
