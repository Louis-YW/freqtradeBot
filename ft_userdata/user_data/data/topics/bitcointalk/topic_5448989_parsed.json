I have heard it a lot of times but have not dipped my foot into it yet. Have you tried it? Maybe you could provide some samples so we could see what it looks like before the battle against another gambler will happen.It would be biased if I would pick sports gambling even if I have not tried the other one first. But I do like predicting the outcome, especially in NBA, and also betting on player props which I think is the nearest comparison in fantasy sports when building a team.",

I nearly wanted to put fantasy sports on the skill-based side, but luck is still involved as players can sometimes perform better and hit a career-high. Quote from: bitbollo on April 16, 2023, 09:56:37 AMRelating fantasy sports, did you mean simulated sports, or games related gaming platforms (like CS:GO or LoL?)OP is likely referring to fantasy sports where you'll have to form your own team by picking several players from different teams and the participants will get a score based on how well the player's performance would be during that week or match.",

Well, probably these gamblers in this current generation can more relate to fantasy sports as these games are often played in the internet and are played by imaginary participants. So it’s still gambling but I think I have higher urge to gamble with these real sports betting games. Maybe because I am used in betting traditional games that’s why these new set of fantasy games don’t really excite me that much.",

Meanwhile, fantasy sports is played in the internet which is composed of teams that are virtually simulated with real players to play the role of a team member. I think it's almost similar to online games nowadays, but with a twist of betting on the side.

I don't consider them to be the same as they're entirely different. What I am saying is the concept is the same you get to bet on certain sports but the actual players are different. But whichever makes you win the most, get to stay there and keep on winning until you ran out of luck. The most important part here is we get to enjoy and also win at the same time. Don't think of others' preferences but put the center of your attraction where you're enjoying and like the most.",

It still is but there's a difference in level if I understand what libert is trying to say correctly. It's not as simple as the game happening virtually but you get to pick or assemble a team to compete. We can look up on the other mechanics but the bottom line is that it's as if you're the manager so you have more control on the outcome of the match and that's not possible in pure sportsbetting.",

Fantasy sports consist of a manager (i.e. yourself) putting together their team with real life players strategizing and so on, this is similar to fantasy sports instead of creating fantasy teams for sports like football and basketball or others. It seems complicated and must really have very supportive skills and mastery.So I prefer real sports betting, because here I get a lot of sports knowledge, especially in pursuits, like football and I also like playing football, so it's better to bet on what we like, can and understand because we will feel entertained while watch.",

It's not even bad,  heck, it's far from that, plus without the statistics from sports, where the hell would fantasy sports get their data from? If we were to talk about match-fixing, I don't think fantasy sports can get out of that as well either? Nor do I think sports can, but at least, it's a lot easier to prevent it nowadays (or to find it when it happens).",

Do you consider both of them same or different? I have no real clue how fantasy sports exactly works and how you could bet large sums of money on it. A few friends of mine played fantasy football in the past and where building ridiculous strong teams with the best players all around the world and would be winning every match. I never really understood how the results were generated, there must be some algorithm behind it. And when there is an algorithm determining results, can't there be players figuring it out and using it for their advantage? My main concern is to not fully understand the risks involved and not being able to make correct predictions to bet on. I would expect only gamblers who have an advantage to bet on fantasy league games.",

I did a quick search about it if there's a difference between the two and this is what it says.Quote from: https://wolfsports.com/sport/fantasy-sports-versus-sports-betting-explanation-legality-market/Both fantasy sports and sports betting are both essentially wagering money on the outcome of a game. This is why they have been put into the same category by many; however, they are viewed as two different approaches in the eyes of the lawmakers.The difference between the two is that one is a competition between multiple players (fantasy sports), and the other is a competition between the player and the bookmaker (sports betting). Also, it is seen more advantageous for the bookies, who in almost all cases have much larger resources of data and technology to profit from the bet compared to the sports bettor.Still quite confused but most of descriptions that I've searched are also telling a little bit difference of these two.",
