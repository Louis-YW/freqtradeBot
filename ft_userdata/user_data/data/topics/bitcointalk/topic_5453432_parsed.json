The toxic loans have also been used to transfer wealth away from much of the world population, and into the coffers of the wealthy banking elite.It's not about being able to work as a complete commercial bank, it's about your vision and mission, these two things could help in realizing so much wealth even than some commercial banks. It's also good to point out that in some economic uncertainties of a country, banking and banking-related sectors are not always poor, especially this time when the interest rate is dangerously high in many countries.Also, the bank issue in the US has caused a lot of misconception globally, it's not like that. Any country could have an issue in their sector, while other countries are booming in that sector. Taking my country as an example, banks are recording huger annual gains compared to the time without inflation issues. So, we should not use the US banking woes to judge globally, this is as the economy of the UK is even improving.By the way, congratulations to you on the £100.",

      "body": "If the government restricts banks from giving loans to some institutions it might hurt the economy because it is not all businesses that fail to service their loans. The problem with most banks is that they go against government regulations and engage in countless financial malpractices. Recently a bank manager gave out an uncollateralized loan to his brother-in-law making which made the bank collapse. Because most of these top bankers are politically connected they are not persecuted. In my country most of these big companies and wealthy people that made banks collapse due to toxic loans are not openly mentioned. I think this secrecy portrays the fact that there is a collaboration between the government and these powerful debtors. This is the first time I am learning about a bank like Nationwide that operates as if its customers are shareholders. It is also interesting to know that they abide fully by the banking laws. If all banks operate this way, there will be fewer bank failures.",

It's been a long time since I've seen this kind of thing. In fact, the bank I work for charges an annual fee for using my credit card and can change this fee every year. While reading a topic like this, I tried to understand the level difference. Of course, this does not apply to everyone, but banks that see their customers only as people who make money should be replaced by such banks.",

Last one I got was like $300 to just open a chequing account at a bank and leave a balance for 3 months and make a few bill payments. Other banks had similar offers. Generally they are from the big banks.They do this because they pay crappy interest. I can put my savings in a money market and make 4-5% and do nothing and it’s risk free. So for some with a low balance it’s not a bad incentive but no point in moving the money back and forth this way.",

      "body": "The Nationwide is one of the few building societies left in the UK. Building societies are a bit like the US savings and loan companies. They were created to help people save up and buy houses. You lent money to the society whilst you were saving, and they lent the money to house buyers so that they could pay interest. The government imposed quite a few restrictions on them, and this was intended to protect savers. For example, they cannot open accounts for businesses, or lend to commercial enterprises. Initially they didn't offer banking services, but with the arrival of computers, they started to introduce some bank facilities. They aren't members of the bank clearing association, so they have to clear cheques through a clearing bank, but that isn't a problem for most people. They offer the faster payments service, and this allows me to pay up to £100,000 to another UK bank account, and the money clears in under 1 minute. There is no charge for this transfer. I was originally a member of the Portman building society, and about 25 years ago that was bought by the Nationwide. As depositors are members, I got a cash payment for that, and I have been with the Nationwide ever since.Many of the other building societies were bought by clearing banks, and they lost their status as a result. For example The Halifax ( the largest at the time ) was bought by Lloyds Bank.There are some other benefits as well. For example, I pay for my hosting and domain renewals in US dollars, and I don't pay a transaction fee for these international payments on my credit card. The exchange rate is very competitive as well. Another unusual payment that I don't understand is cash back on my debit card. I was rewarded with £10 per month for using my debit card instead of my credit card to make payments for groceries in some of the largest supermarkets. This only lasted for 3 months, and it must have been funded by the supermarkets. Still it was another £30 I picked up for no additional effort. I know these amounts are small, but they do mount up. The 3 payments I have mentioned in this forum - £50+£30+£100, are already at £180, and that is just in 3 months. I have friends who belittle me for bothering with these amounts, and some of them throw away small coins as annoyances. One of them couldn't afford his electricity payment last winter ( he is on a prepayment system), and had to sit at home in the dark with a blanket over him. He doesn't seem to realise that small savings mount up, and can make quite a difference to your quality of life.",

If banks stay true to the services that they are suppose to be rendering they won't collapse.I hope they'll continue paying the £100 because when they stop they'll also be criticize as the other banks.

It may be unexpected to people from other countries, but Ukrainian banks are doing really well now, during the war. For example, in January 2023, 90% of Ukrainian banks made the highest revenue since the start of the full-scale war, but also, the banking sector accumulated reserves in 2022 which are 35x higher than in 2021. Financial restrictions were also introduced because of the martial law. I don't think there's a strong case for a causal link here, but it's an interesting correlation.",

As a mutual building society, Nationwide operates differently from traditional banks, with customers having an interest in its profitability. It's interesting to note that their profitability may be attributed to the government restrictions on certain activities, which prevent them from engaging in risky lending practices.Your perspective on the abundance of toxic loans in the banking industry and its impact on smaller banks and wealth distribution is thought-provoking. While it's true that the financial crisis revealed significant issues with toxic loans and their effect on the global economy, it's important to note that regulatory measures have been implemented to mitigate such risks and promote stability in the banking sector.The banking landscape continues to evolve, with a focus on stricter regulations and transparency. However, it's worth considering diverse viewpoints and engaging in constructive discussions to foster a more inclusive and equitable financial system.",

The UK government is scratchung around for extra things to tax. Energy companies and some othersare always being considered for \"windfall\" taxes.

Of course, the story of providing services to private investors is a different story.Well, My view is that why small banks leave is not entirely caused by toxic loans, but this involves many complex factors, including market dynamics, government policies, the economic conditions of the relevant banks which are considered to have made the wrong decision. For example in the case of lending that is not on target on a large scale which is seen as not meeting the target after their internal audit and it could also be unforeseen economic factors.",
