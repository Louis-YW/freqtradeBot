If you're selling freshly generated keys or seeds, you are charging for something anybody (and their mothers) can do for free. If you're selling keys or seeds for funded wallets you're most likely a scammer, and in the (astronomically small) chance you're not scamming your buyers, you're helping them commit fraud (but the odds of not scamming your buyers are astronomically small)",

Good day!There is no use to buy private key of the wallets if there are no bitcoins in it.
