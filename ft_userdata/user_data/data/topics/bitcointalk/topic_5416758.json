Why make another Dash when it's already a thing. There's probably been other and there will probably be far more then we'll ever need made after the next hard fork too.",

All the other coins are altcoins that either initially forked from BTC or more often than not were created by someone looking to cash in on the crypto craze by creating yet another crapcoin, pre-mining the shit out of it and then hoping it get listed on exchanges so they can cash out.",
