They refused to let me withdraw and locked down my account. After contacting support, they said i had broken their \"TOS\" and had multiple accounts. This turned out to be completly wrong, after a few weeks of investigatio, they admited that they where wrong and that i only had 1 account but still refused to let me withdrawn ðŸ¤¯They basicly robbed me 100k. This is Shameless behavior, worthy of a low-class casino. Stake Username : Lavafreez",

      "body": "I hope someone from stake comes here to give an explanation on the subject, although I understand that they are more careful with large amounts like this than if it were $50. In any case it seems fishy that they first accused you of multi-accounting, then said no, and now they come out with the opposite betting. I don't see what's wrong with it, I guess it's against the rules, but if I bet $50K and meet a friend or something who bets $50K, in the end what we're going to lose is the commission, no matter how much one of us wins. If I were the master of the casino I would want them to repeat the bet many times.",

      "body": "Before anyone believe on this story. Who will bet all in on a roulette game at first bet? Of there are some users then they are rare. Some user are doing multiple account and avail promotion such as cashback while betting both side using 2 accounts. This way, the user can claim the cashback while 100% still holds his original bankroll that go to the winning bet account. His only danger on this method is when the ball goes to zero which is very low chance to occur. A french roulette game gives 50% refund when ball goes to zero. I believe this is what he use. This kind of bonus abuse is very popular which the live casino provider usually detect multiple account that oppose bet even on 2 different casino involved that play same live game.Quote from: Lavafreez on September 11, 2023, 12:56:23 PMAbout the conversations with the support, and the \"reason\" for stealing my money is about their policie of \"opposite Betting\".

      "body": "@BeparanfHello, I understand your point of view and i respect your position.Â However this is not my case.Â Saying \"What kind of user does an all-in on his first bet\" First it's not true i had been playing dice before. Second, \"A french roulette game gives 50% refund when ball goes to zero. I believe this is what he use.\" False i didn't used the french roulette i used the VIP Roulette will prove it showing you the bet \"Do you have active promotion when you place your bet?\" No i didn't had any promotions active. The only promotions on stake are Weekly and Monthly. The weekly is a promotion done every Saturday, your bonus is calculated depending on your week gameplay. So if Stakes belive that my bonus could be illegitimate they can and have time to decrease it significantly. It's exactly the same for the Monthly, Their is also the reckback that is indeed an instant bonus however the bonus is so low that it has no sens to even talk about it. Exemple: for 50k bet on the roulette i only earned 30$ of reckback... I hope i have answered all your questions let me know if any doubt or wan't additional evidence",
