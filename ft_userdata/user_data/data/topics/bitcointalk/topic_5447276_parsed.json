Scam karna hi agar purpose ban jaye to phir chori karke kamao ya dakaiti se baat ek hi hai. Ye to ek dum sahi baat hai. If you want to know a project better than my advise is to read it's white paper. After reading it if you think it worthy of your investment then go ahead. Still there is no guarantee whether that project will work or ditch you in the future. Blindly never follow any influencers. There are a lot of example of influencers recommending project which later on became a scam.",

If you are looking for a channel to learn trading or just casually know about what is going to hit moon soon then unfortunately there is no such single genuine channel, all of them make random guesses which aren't accurate most of the times and also can be pretty dangerous because a few are just pumps and dumps, but if you want to learn about the technology there are plethora of channel, infact most of the channels will teach it to you quite accurately.",
