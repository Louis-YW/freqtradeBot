KYC does not provide any security. It gives pseudo security, a sense of security that only puts people at greater risk (reduces their vigilance), and because many sites require KYC, darknet databases are full of leaked photos and informations. KYC hurts everyone.",

      "body": "Is this the yet another shilling of the Oscar swap project and agitating the passage of KYC? You have the wrong forum, KYC can be useful for project founders as it can help avoid fraud and rug pull, only it is unlikely to benefit ordinary users, especially in the cryptocurrency industry. Cryptocurrencies are not created for us to throw away our personal data. There is no way I will send my passport data to some obscure service just because it claims that KYC is an extremely important element. It is not an extremely important element, it is an extremely dangerous element for the crypto user and should be avoided.",
