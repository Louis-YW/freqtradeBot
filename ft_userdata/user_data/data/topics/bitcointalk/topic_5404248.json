  "content": "As the title reads, I'm hiring a graphic designer who specializes in character design using tools like Photoshop/Illustrator, etc. You'll be developing a character off given details and in way that can be further utilized for generative art. Don't worry if you're not much acquainted with NFT's or generative art. Your job primarily will be to create the character based on the details given to you. Creativity is the king here.Payment: BTC/ETHEscrow: Yes.Please send me PM or the message below. It would be great if you can send links to your previous work. If you're experienced with creating banners or web design layouts, you might not be a good fit here as this is more of a character design job than a 'graphic design'. Thank You!",
