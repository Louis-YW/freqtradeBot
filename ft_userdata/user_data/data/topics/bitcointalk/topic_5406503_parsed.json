Also, some of them may ignore information of this nature due to the fact that they are not worried about the safety of personal data and are ready to buy a \"new model\" of ledger's device as soon as it appears on sale due to \"new features\". You have probably heard about the category of people who buy a new iPhone, even if they have a previous version of this phone. It could be the same here.Exactly. In the next topic, OP just mentions the reason why he wants to buy a new hardware wallet and is inclined to buy Ledger's device.Quote from: niftyswifty on July 16, 2022, 07:01:09 AMHeya everyone!I was looking for the second HW wallet (I already own Trezor One for BTC, ETH) to hold my alts (like ADA, ATOM, NEAR etc.).I thought to get Ledger nano s+, but are there any open-source alternatives for +/- the same price?",

Windows XP is EOL; bugs have been found afterwards, which haven't been fixed. Yet people still use Windows 10 or Windows 11.Same thing applies to outdated Linux or macOS versions, of course.With all the issues of current Ledger products and their business practices that I don't cease to criticize, I don't think a bug in an old product that has long been discontinued, on its own, is enough reason to draw conclusions about new products.Quote from: PrivacyG on July 16, 2022, 12:43:42 PMQuote from: DaveF on July 16, 2022, 11:41:53 AMAs for support, it should matter.

If the Trezor is too expensive, you're not making enough on those shitcoin trades and should stop doing it, and simply HODL Bitcoin in cold storage..",

You are forgetting the most important part. Two things need to happen for this vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker needs physical access to the hardware wallet and that is something that you shouldn't allow at any circumstances. And the attacker needs to know exactly how to execute his attack. Even if someone knew how to get to mocacinno's HW.1, they most probably wouldn't know what to do with it unless he is targeted for that purpose exactly. There isn't a public tutorial about the attack (hopefully) or a software you fire up, click the 'hack it' button and the seed appears on screen.No matter what hardware wallet you have and what security measures you have taken to protect its private keys (passphrase, multi-sig, SD cards, etc.), you should look to move your funds from it if someone stole it from you. That applies to Trezors, Ledgers, and the other bunch.",

I like modular devices and it's especially important to have more modular smatphones and laptops, for changing battery, memory or processors, but this also means device will be more expensive.If I remember correctly Fairphone also released more than one device version, individual parts can not be exchanges between different models, and price is to expensive for specs they are offering even for older Fairphone 3.I could consider SeedSigner to be a modular signing device, you can buy any RaspberryPi zero model you want, print any case you want, buy and install your own compatible screen and camera.You can replace most of parts yourself following simple instructions, and you don't have to worry someone will hack it because there is nothing you can extract.Additional bonus benefit, there are no ''marketing newsletter'' partners to leak your data",

Nobody should assume any hardware and any software to be 100% secure for eternity. That's one of the reasons I said this in the past.Quote from: n0nce on May 14, 2022, 01:04:41 PMI recently thought about this and maybe it helps people think of hardware wallets a bit differently: think of the device mostly as a signer. Don't rely on it not breaking, not getting lost or not ceasing to turn on, to be able to access your coins; instead, rely on your seed backup(s) and use the device as a convenient way to utilize said seed in everyday scenarios.A hardware wallet is a pretty secure way to store your seed on an electronic device, which gives you the benefit of being able to quickly access it (sign a transaction) without having to transcribe a seed phrase from paper or metal.For long-term storage (as in 'bury and forget it' like you described), there's nothing better than an offline-generated seed phrase that is not stored on an electronic device of any kind.Quote from: PrivacyG on July 21, 2022, 02:16:28 PMWould be cool if a Hardware Wallet maker decides to build a modular Hardware Wallet so that we do not need to upgrade by purchasing new Hardware Wallets but simply by upgrading parts, similarly to a PC.  Need more space?  Need a better processor?  Need a new display?  Open it up and switch the components all by yourself.  Would buy one without a doubt.  I am pretty disappointed that some of my Hardware Wallets will become unusable within an year or so unless I constantly update them.  You can leave an airgapped PC for a decade and still use your Bitcoin.  When it comes to Hardware Wallets .. not so much.I don't honestly see the utility of this. Since the firmware doesn't really get more complex over time, processor upgrades won't be needed. As evidenced by ancient microprocessor technology in both Ledger Nano S and Trezor One. They work just like they did when they launched. Maybe Nano S less so due to the whole 'altcoin apps' story. It's like trying to run an old BASIC game on an old CPU; the same old software runs just as well on the same old hardware as it did in the past.The only reason for upgradeability that I could see having a use case would be storage, for storing more altcoins (thus more seeds). But then again you can easily get a few GB of flash that costs nothing and will suffice for the next gazillion altcoins.",
