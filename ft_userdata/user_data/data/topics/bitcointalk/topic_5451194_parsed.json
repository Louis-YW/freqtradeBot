      "body": "As em d now, peso no fit sae until the swear Tinubu in as the president of Nigeria. Any other thing apart from that peso no fit tell how Tinubu 100 days in office go be like. First of all, em go start with appointment of ministers wey go work with am, na those ministers go determine how em first 100 days in office go be like. Tinubu first 100 days in office no suppose to be our major concern now. Wetin we suppose to reason now, na make the swear TInubu in successfully without any problem. After that we go na come here to analyze how em 100 days go be. Inasmuch we d except to see how Tinubu 100 days go be like, make we no forget sae Nigeria as a country get so many problems that even 4years in office no go fit solve like that.",

I only post to know the peoples opinions and I expect a good answer to this. Let us always be transparent in whatever we do or say on this platform many people are watching.It's a rhetorical question. It needs no answer. First, 100 days is too short to determine how a new government will better the country.Second, we do not know what would happen. See when Buhari became the president, we all thought everything is going to change for good with Nigeria having better economy and quality standard of living, but everything we thought was otherwise. That is why I indirectly meant that we have no seer to know what would happen.I hope we would have a better Nigeria.",

Key positions require experienced individuals to tackle pressing issues. Tinubu's success in Lagos shows effective leadership can make an impact without government support. Prioritizing expert recommendations for the first 100 days can address insecurity, a weak economy, high unemployment, and unstable inflation. Positive change is possible with the right team and planning.But then in all these, God remains the greatest and we are only pencils. We pray for the best for our dear country and also pray God uses Tinubu as a tool to turn the situation of the country for good.",

What i can only say is that we have to be optimistic about their leadership because I know he is old enough and may not know the heart of the youths that is why in my opinion a vibrant young Man should have rule the country.But let see what may come out of them, I don't really expect something good to come out of APC leadership any longer.",

OP there is truth in all you have said but in Nigeria here, the reverse is always the case. It is true any successful government in power hids to advise and ideas of their executive cabinet but some governor's have turn their executives into cabin biscuits that they no longer have say in their various positions and offices. They are just ceremonial heads with portfolio without pocket. Nothing comes to their table everything is done by the oga at the top.Where are all these so called experts when the campaign was going on. Would they not have said something about the various aspirants?Â  Why now coming to making useless suggestions. Are they the government? Who made them advisers? I just think they are looking for cheap popularity.",

But my prediction be say em go try to prove critics wrong by performing well. Me I no be Tinubu fan, but the truth be say em don get experience well well for Nigerian politics. So if em really want to perform and turn Nigerian economy for the better, em get the experience. Although wetin we suppose to concentrate now na whether them go swear am in, because the matter still dey for court. Last last, you no go fit trust politicians finish, until you see them performance.",
