This looks like one being paid to shill the casino which is far below standard and if OP is likely the owner like the first commenter has said, then it very bad of OP to have take  such a step. OP should get registered as a copper member e upload some pictures of the casino site for viewing and illustration for better publicity which would attract more participants to commenting and making reviews which would be of help to op when updating the casino.I would advise any one wanting to deal with OP should do his or her own research by conducting due diligence. Do not fall for scam.",

It offers a safe and secure way to transfer funds, without the need for personal information or credit card details. This makes it an ideal choice for online casino players who value their privacy and security.One of the best online casinos that accept Fast Token (FTN) is Onikabet.com. It offers a wide range of games, including slots, poker, and blackjack. The casino is fully licensed and regulated, ensuring a fair and secure gaming experience for all players.Great if you want to make a thread about an online casino around a token, in this case we are talking about an FTN token, then you need to create a thread in the Service Announcements (Altcoins) board, since casinos accepting bitcoin are discussed here.Upd: OK but after looking at the casino you are talking about it is clear that they also accept bitcoin so",

Don't use this website, it's pure scam.looking at this casino, there are no reviews on sites like trustpilot, guru.casino, askgambler, there is nothing about this casino on the internet, which makes me think that it is a casino created by a scammers who had no money to pay for advertising elsewhere and for that reason it did not manage to get many customers, so without many customers there would be no reviews from people who have used this casino, so I am not surprised that it is a scam casinoWhat I can't understand is why you stopped using casinos with a good reputation like casinos like stake.com that have been in this market for years, are very reliable, have given bonuses and many benefits to VIP members and you went to use that casino without reputation , new and to make matters worse there are not even reviews about this casino on the internet, so how did you find this casino and why did you decide to use a casino in this condition? the only thing you can do from now on is not to use shady, unreputable casinos that haven't been operating for years anymore, be very careful with new casinosthis is an already saturated market, new casinos will face a lot of difficulty to survive, so going bankrupt soon is expected, so be careful with new casinos, the creators of new casinos probably at the beginning are very hopeful that they will make a lot of money in this market , but then they face the harsh reality and the casino goes bankrupt, they take all the customers' money and run away",

This does not argur well as it shows how unreliable this casino could be. So I am not surprised at your complaints because the casino do not have good customer service care here not to talk about their website and funny enough as you have said that they do not live online support but rather a bot that keeps repeating questions and answers over and over again.If you feel you have been scammed by this casino by conviction, you can raise a scam accusation thread here with enough evidence to back up your claims.SCAM ACCUSATIONS THREADhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0You are free to create a thread there for your  further resolution.",

With op trust and the feedback it's very unlikely for you to receive your money back, I doubt if op is even going to reply to this thread even if he comes across it. I don't know how you found out about this casino, might I ask which site suggested the casino to you? But you can so help prevent this type of thing from happening by creating a proper scam accusations thread that way newbies and those that haven't heard of the casino before might become aware of the activity that goes on in the casino.
