Then a user copies address and accidentally sends tokens to scammer.This is impossible.People can't send coins from your address without your private key, but what they can do is generate those transactions with a smart contract once users have interacted with it.And is important to say this transaction had a cost, it wasn't totally free, the one who spent cero dollars with multiple inputs and outputs had to pay a transaction fee for it. So, if this is an attack, I don't think it will be brute-forced because each transaction has a cost.",

Of course, anyone can send transactions to us without having the need our private keys. But with that having 0 tokens sent, it's making me believe that this is just another dust attack. From what I think, maybe there's a fake token from the attacker that sends it to anyone that he's got their addresses and that's to know if the address owner is responsive or active because they'll eventually move that away from that wallet. Also, don't click those tokens because they'll direct you to their website and with an interest of exchanging them, that's probably where the scam starts.",

I am not really sure though how this transaction attack would work. As others in this thread have already said, there should be no way that a scammer can send tokens from your wallet if he does not have access to your wallet which means to your private key and if he would have access to it then he definitely would not send 0 token transactions first. He would instead just send all of the funds from your wallet to a wallet that he is controlling. So i don't think that this scam works as you said, but i also don't now how it could work any other way. This kind of scam would be new to me.",

There’s a lot of hackers out there, waiting for the opportunity so stay cautious. That is something suspicious though since you can only create transaction once you have the access on your wallet, which I think hackers still have no access, whatever it is be careful and protect your crypto as much as possible.",

Another point is it is hard for someone to create a wallet address that is similar to yours. Personally for years now, I haven't seen any wallet address that is nearly similar to my wallet address or I could mistakenly thought it was my wallet address. Let's say that what you are saying is true, I don't see any point that the hacker made this things to just earn 0 value transaction attack. Or maybe we are all wrong since I myself is also confused on how this works. I'm just thinking it's logically hard or nearly impossible.",
