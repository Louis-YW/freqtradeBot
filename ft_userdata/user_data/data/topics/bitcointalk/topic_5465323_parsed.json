By decreasing the circulating supply, AIT naturally becomes scarcer, potentially leading to increased demand and value. • The burning mechanism is not merely a technicality; it’s a testament to AiMalls’ commitment to innovation, value creation, and a more dynamic and rewarding digital future.CertiK Partnership: Elevating Security StandardsIn a bid to further fortify the platform's security, AiMalls entered into a strategic partnership with CertiK, a renowned name in blockchain security.
