Just recently, SUI raised a total of $300m from various crypto venture capitalsThe Founders Evan Cheng, Sam Blackshear and Adeniyi Abiodun were all former employees at Facebook META, they both worked on the LIBRA project when working with META.when working on LIBRA they helped develop the MOVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (MPL), MPL technology can run more than 160000 transactions per secondMPL technology will also be used to run the SUI Mainnet, so it is extremely fast and secure. Now letâ€™s get started2) Where can I buy SUI ?Currently, Sui ecosystem is still in its early stage and still on devnetNOTE: Devnet will go through periodic wipes and reset as the dev team is still adding a number of core features and also changes made to their contracts and nodes will need to be thoroughly scrutinized.When launched, just be sure that you will be able to buy and trade SUI $SUI on all major exchanges.Sui Ecosystem is valued at $2 Billion, with VCs involving FTX, Coinbase, A16Z, etc.3) What Sui wallets can i use ? -Sui Wallet (recommended)-Suiet Wallet -Ethos Wallet-Hydro WalletÂ  -Morphis Wallet Sui wallet is backed and supported by Mysten LabsAlso all the above wallets only works for Chrome on Windows or Mac.4) What Marketplace can i trade Nfts on Sui ecosystem? -Bluemove Marketplace - Sui Gallery Marketplace - STARSPACE Marketplace- Clutchy Marketplace- Keep Sake MarketplaceThese are the nft marketplace been built on the ecosystem as at now.5) What upcoming Nft projects can i look into ?

The requirements are still remain unknown but i don't think there will be an airdrop. So many people are asking this in the telegram group and mod has been even clarifying it if there will be no airdrop for the future. I have been running devnet node for sui and apply for incentivized testnet. It seems like that airdrops will be only coming for node and validators. I would like to see how VC will be pumping this coin. SUI will be as big as solana. VC is a key to make your project becomes big instantly.",

Here's a helpful thread on how you can get the potential of its ecosystem: https://twitter.com/Sui_Station/status/1579459522665803776?t=p0dn5zIIJB2GSrYBzv91kQ&s=19. They may not issue an airdrop but platforms built on Sui are likely to be good on its potential airdrop just like what BlueMove is doing right now.",

      "body": "I tested this ecosystem on the testnet. Minted a few NFTs, tried to buy a domain name through a wallet, but it didnâ€™t work out due to an error. The general impression is that this is another useless clone of the competitors of the Ethereum ecosystem. If there are 100 or slightly more validators in an ecosystem, then it makes no sense to talk about its decentralization. I still donâ€™t understand why there are so many clones of Ethereum competitors with similar DeFi projects on the market?",
