I think Oppenheimer’s role and responsibility in the development and use of the atomic bomb are complex and ambiguous.On one hand, he was a brilliant scientist who contributed to a major scientific breakthrough and helped end World War II. On the other hand, he was also a human being who had doubts and regrets about the destructive power of his creation and its impact on humanity. I don’t think he can be easily judged as a hero or a villain, but rather as a flawed and fascinating figure who faced a terrible moral dilemma.What do you think?",

      "body": "Oppenheimer was a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb. He lead the scientific effort & served as an advocate of its use in war.He went on to accept responsibility for its deployment. His moral & ethical responsibility is difficult to assess but it can be argued that his actions were justified as a necessary measure to ensure the security of his nation.",

Not even the end of World War II or the security of his Nation could justify that.They went out to defeat Hitler, but in the end they surpassed Hitler with Hitler.",

(Like the one ring granting Bilbo Baggins invisibility)But there is a question as to whether that power elevates us, or seduces us in a way that is regressive over the long term.",

      "body": "I think the movie was a great educator to those not familiar with the concept. I feel it helped in making this a more 'known' truth.Regarding the actual fact that Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb,' was at the epicenter of a groundbreaking scientific achievement, is I for one command the steadfast and conviction that Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb' had ultimately leading him to champion the wartime.To me the most heartfelt moment was that he also grappled with the weight of its aftermath. It's like being proud of baking the world's spiciest chili and then wondering if it was too hot to handle. Assessing his moral compass is like splitting atoms - complex! But one thing's for sure, he was looking out for his nation's safety first and foremost & if he wasn't the one to do it the Russians would have done it anyway. It was all a political war and it wasn't of question of 'If' but 'when - and Oppenheimer with his group of elite scientists did it first, and then left pondering on the significance of his breakthrough.",

It has still not left the minds of people even after decades of that invention.That atomic bimb display has changed the course of fighting in the history of humanity. And as with inventions, you only create, it is within another mind to chose how best to cause havoc with your creation. If he hadn't created it, the damages would not have been",

And even though mostly countries say that they didn't use their Atomic Bomb because there are some agreements with the United Nations (UN) and if they use it United Nation will take action against them. So what is the use of it I didn't understand. Just give other countries threat?",
