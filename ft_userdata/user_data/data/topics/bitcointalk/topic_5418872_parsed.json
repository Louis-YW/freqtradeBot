But sometimes I listen to classical music while betting on sports games. It relaxes my soul and makes my decisions healthier. I think betting platforms should provide music service. I guess this is a service related to social activity. If they provide such a service, they can differentiate themselves from their competitors. I would prefer betting platforms that recommend good music to me. 1. Chopin - Spring Waltz (Mariage d'Amour) [Please Read Description]2. Vivaldi: Nisi Dominus (Cum dederit) - Jaroussky3. Badinerie - Johann Sebastian Bach4. Turkish March Mozart - Rondo Alla Turca",

My soul would be attracted to some rap music blended with R&B from rappers from the West Coast in the US. The lines of JayZ, 2Pac, Bone Thugs en Harmony, would be good for the soul. But when I am loosing I prefer silence, no music. Its time for mediation and concentration. If the day is a bad one, I would prefer to go home and listen to some romantic blues by Donnell Jones, Babyface, Brain McKnight, Maroon 5 or Mario Winans. But if it is a good one, the West Coast rappers would still occupy the stage of my soul.",

I feel like it makes me feel lucky when gambling. It's like framing you to the right mindset and it just goes into your feels and possibly results in a positive outcome lol.",

Sometimes just the full playlist of 90's alternative rock. The thing on Youtube where you only see the playlist picture and the quality of sound is better or louder, I think. It's like a routine habit to play it at whatever I do (unless I am watching) because it brings more energy to me.",

I also, like to play some old songs like \"The Beatles\" and \"Queen\". It helps that the songs are calm as I am more focused on my games and do not get too excited when winning or losing. Other than those, I also listen to local slow hip-hop and R&B songs. I never play any music that is too tense like rock&roll and fast rap songs.Lofi Music on youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdkThis is The Beatles on Spotify:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO2iBPiw?si=696b85061e164d16",

I enjoy listening to instrumental melodies while sipping coffee ☺️Feels like a distraction for me also but since I only play dice and slot these days with the coins I get from faucets like in the Betfury, I turn on the radio where sometimes it plays old songs. The instrumental band that I found amusing is the Menahan Street Band, saxophone improvisation sound is soothing as much as the blues.",

This make me feel real good when am winning or losing because I gamble for fun,so if I don't listen to music it is no longer be that too entertaining. If I win big,I will high the volume to the max and I might just start parting on a low key.There is this Africa artist I love listening to his song too,if am not listening to hip hop I will listen to his songs. He is an afro beat singer Fela Anikulapo Kuti,though he is late but his songs are my type of song as it inspires me so much when gambling in winning.",
