Anything the future holds to look forward to?You can find them all at the Wall Observer thread.In the future, crypto exchanges will be heavily regulated, almost like banks. That is a good thing, because it means they won't be able to get away with lax business controls.Everyone has already implemented KYC and KYB. The next technology to be developed could be something which I call Know Your Institution (KYI), with verification requirements for the exchanges themselves similar to how we need to get verified and they're all strict about it.",

      "body": "It depends on what you mean by \"crypto\" and \"survive\".The shitcoin market (aka crypto market) will continue to exist and survive the same way it has been surviving so far, by pump and dumping to attract gamblers for quick profit/loss based on their bets on different altcoins. It is not actual survival though since the altcoins will remain useless and without any actual adoption outside trading.As for bitcoin, nothing has changed and nothing will change. It is going forward with the adoption and if anything the recent FTX thing proved how much stronger bitcoin has gotten. You should know this better if your claim of being around for 9 years is correct! Each time a hack of such scale happened the crash has been massive starting from 40% all the way to 80%. This time we only saw a 15% drop and this is during one of the worst global economic crisis in bitcoin's entire history.",

Anything the future holds to look forward to?No matter how we cut the cake, we have to realize that this entire crypto arena is in a consolidation phase for now. So, it's no surprise that Bitcoin fails to break new all-time highs over the next few weeks. If and when it peaks, BTC price will likely sideways a little more before resuming its vertical rise. So if someone is sustaining a long exposure for a while, do it with both eyes open.I don't know how long or how clear it will be down, but I'm sure the price will rebound. Keep believing and don't regret anything because we can all become billionaires even when the bitcoin price drops to $12,000 later.",

Anything the future holds to look forward to?The future of crypto as a whole would largely be a switch of the current shitcoins to different ones which would again attract newer investors and the cycle continues. Majority of the current altcoins on the market would not exist in a few years and would be replaced by newer ones.1BTC would always be equal to 1BTC.",

But as we have always done, we will get through it! Some hands will burned but they will get the lesson of a lifetime not to repeat their mistakes! Also, it is important to notice a tremendous opportunity it gives to us to enter into crypto market at a rock-bottom price point. That opportunity may never come back again!",

Anything the future holds to look forward to?Stay strong and believe in crypto currencies. As a 9 year veteran you should be more optimistic, right now we are just in another bear market. Crypto will survive as it has in the past. Up and down cycles are part of any financial assets and as long we are not selling at the moment we should be fine. In my opinion this is good time to buy, rather than selling any of our coins. Look forward to the world going back to normality. The war in Ukraine has to end eventually, inflation can't stay in double digit territory forever, economic growth will come back. Once we beat the recession everything is going to look much better again. In a few years people who have up on cryptos and sold all their coins will feel terrible. The long term trend for cryptos is still upwards, a few bad events are not going to change that.",

Beside many rug pulls of exchanges and hackers also played a big role in destroying many projects and burning big money of users. A lot of people lost hope and became scared of putting more money inside crypto. To survive from this fall we need a very big good news which we hope to see in this close near future before 2023",
