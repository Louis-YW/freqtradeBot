Although he might still control Twitter but the company needs a neutral professional to run its affairs. Twitter is too important to be handled by a man that is accused or guilty of constantly attack of his perceived rivals or critics. Twitter needs someone that is less controversial and more professional. With less than few minutes to the end of this polls, it is glary that he might step down as Chief Executive Officer because currently 57.5% favors the decision to step down, while 42.5% is opposed to it. It is possible that he wants to step down because he has realized that he lacks the skills and the goodwill to run Twitter. Maybe a new CEO would be announced in few days.",

He can step behind to guide and direct but not to be there in every aspect because workers can become biase to give the best they have. He sack workers which will get some workers afraid with him being all around. He should handover administrative running of Twitter.",

Elon may not be really surprised about Tesla stock value fall because he himself admitted the share is overvalued on many occasions so he knows how to play the game better than us especially the social media users like Twitter community. So he may step down from the position but maybe in a few weeks or months later he may regain the position whenever its needed like something important event is coming near or election or something he can make millions out of it",
