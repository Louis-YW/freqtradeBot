This is the only top altcoin that I can see 6 years is the all-time high.",

There is no way that XRP breaking it's previous ATH and even if it does it won't be natural but rather due to manipulation from the dev team as they can control the supply and demand. I have never been a fan of XRP and just utilizes it's crazy market pump in 2017 that's all. It's like a dead coin now but we will occasionally see sudden pump followed by gradual dump as dev has to make money.",

Do you consider how much the circulating supply before and after that ATH to your prediction since having a 3.4$ price now will give XRP a marketcap of 150+B which is too huge for this project. 1$ is the most realistic target since its just twice the current market cap.XRP is currently the 5th highest marketcap which means investors will rather buy other altcoin with lower marketcap instead of buying coins that is already on the top since itâ€™s not Bitcoin.",

XRP was pumped to 1$ after winning case news but it was just temporary news and case is not over yet then once again price dumped but this up and down gives gesture that Whales are ready to accumulate XRP if XRP win the case from SEC.. In short term even if XRP win the case I think it will not cross 3.4$. I am expecting 2$ in the bull market which is average price we could expect.. Overall I think XRP is good investment for long term and we could expect big in the future.",

Their technology is good, they have a dedicated community that supports the project, recent lawsuit wins give the project a positive impression, a large portion of tokens is controlled by the team behind the project and all this gives me a positive sign that XRP can do really well in the coming bull run. This project has already done very well in the past few years despite the case against it and now they are free from it. Their current technological advancements have allowed institutions to develop their own payment network with ISO standards.",

So if any coin can't maintain its efficiency then it might lost its investor and volume and value. The won against SEC is going to pump XRP a lot. that means SEC will become the main problem but the fight has not ended yet. It's still long way to go. XRP has been winning it in some cases but the case has not finished yet. You will be seeing more nwes about this to come. Once XRP will be fully winning the game against SEC and it will send XRP to da moooooon. Quote from: Justin999 on December 01, 2023, 09:58:23 PMSo what do you think?

You need to tell whales to send XBT to the moon like 100k for each BTC. it will be instantly pumping the price of XRP as well. This is the only possible scenario owned by us. You will not able to see XRP to go to the moon without the whales try to send XBT first. XBT needs to go to the moon at least break its old ATH.",

Even though I'm not paying much attention to this category right now, that ATH level is frankly not too big for XRP to break. With just a little hype and fomo, I believe it will create an unbelievable price increase. There are other cases in the market that we do not expect, so XRP will be no exception and has its own risks/returns if we decide to invest.",

I think it was something about their supply and being pre-mined. The same issue ETH were facing. XRP are also known to be related with the banks. And we all know that in crypto, people dislike the banks because they are opposed to its real purpose which is decentralization. Maybe it is true that everything in cryptos are subject to manipulation but it doesn't has to do with their use cases.Some cryptos are plain or we can say no use case but there are still some who has. Apart from Ripple maybe there are still top altcoin out there who seems sleeping for a long time now. I think LTC is a good example. But we don't know what if they are a giant? (Sleeping giant).
