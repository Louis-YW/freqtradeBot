      "body": "This is the latest of them all, they're fond of sending messages to contacts whom have participated in previous scam projects and as many contacts as possible to gather. They are mostly interlinked as  most crashed scam projects launches another with a different name to continue their evil businesses. The new ones are still maybe friends of those whom have succeeded in their projects earlier.There are several ways to know that an offer is a scam1. You're being given an offer you never  applied for. Like who employs someone without first interviewing them?.2. Their offer sounds too good to be true: How can someone pay me 56k daily. Calculating it in a month, its about #1.6m. Just like that. I mean who does that?. Some will even claim to pay you 25% of your income daily. Like what sort of investment is such that the ROI is that high? Do you even ask yourself how they make their own money and how much they make daily to be able to pay you that amount as interest?.3. Their companies aren't registered under CAC: most, if not all of them doesn't have a cooperate affairs backing and are not permitted to operate, but because the Internet is decentralized, they can't be totally prevented from operating, and every campaign against them will not be heeded to by the desperate masses out there. I'm not saying that all unregistered companies are scams, but you'll need to register your company to demonstrate its ingenuity and get an official license to operate.4. Their media presence is always bullshit:  some of them use websites without SSL certificates and their website is the very unsafe, and when you arrive at their media handles, you find it almost scanty, that's if there's actually one. I believe that a strong business venture should have a very good online presence in the today world.5. They have no definite founders: Unlike Bitcoin which was founded by Satoshi, even though he's invisible now, but there's a lot of documentary about him, these sites have no founder, management team and sometimes include  some foreign names as founders which after  proper research, you'll observe that they never had anything to do with the projects. Please always research on personalities that invite you for interviews, they clone peoples names and kidnap people in the process.A friend of mine have once been invited for an interview and was told its urgent, his  plane ticket was even booked, when we researched about the name the speaker called, we got to know that whom he's calling had no business with recruitment in that company and there was no recruitment exercise going on in the company at that time.You're to research properly any project or company you're venturing into cos most are just scammers looking for unsuspecting individuals to prey on.",

Something in me keeps telling me that this could be the hand work of an insider who knows or who always in the office registering people's phone number that could lead to leak of information. Otherwise how did they know our names and our full details I think are data are not secure in the hands of our network providers and or it could be their worker selling our details to those scammers who calls and sent us personal messages.",

The one I hate the most is when I get sent messages like this as a referral link from a close friend telling me I won an iphone 15pro max or something of a cash prize . Mostly as we are nearing the end of the year with just 2months to go, the vigilance level should be higher both for online and for offline activities, because even the scammers and hackers want to have a detty December and wouldn't mind who gets to pay for it. With passwords and codes, be extra vigilant and be mindful who pays attention to you while on your device.",
