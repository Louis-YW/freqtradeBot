I don't know what the reason is, is it against forum rules or what? I don't mind the deletion of this post, but I was really wondering if that every thread of donation is no longer allowed in the forum?",

Most likely scenario is that it was reported and the mods agreed with the comments of the report, therby deleting the post. The user could try opening a new thread and checking if it gets deleted too.",

He got quite lot of enthusiasm from forum users who wanted to donate little money to the Pakistani people affected by the disaster. The thread is still available and not deleted until recently.[Donations] Fundraising for the Floods disaster in PakistanAbout the OP's question, I don't know what the problem is - but it's possible it was reported and removed based on the reason for the report.I can probably assume that this donation thread about Turkey does not involve escrow which is in fact direct donation managed by a non-forum member [trusted person]. I don't know if this is the reason, but it could be right or it could be wrong. Only the users who reported it and the moderators who removed it know why, maybe they have the right to answer that.",

Now, I don't know if it's strictly forbidden on the forum, but it's something that should be done very carefully.That was not a scam post. We are already very sensitive about those scam posts. Instead of collecting donations individually, I waited trusted NGOs to accept crypto donations. After long talks, we got the permission from the authorities and shared those crypto addresses from the original source.Quote from: Stalker22 on February 07, 2023, 09:56:17 PMBased on how some past aid efforts on the forum turned out, it is smarter to send all help straight to trusted non-profit groups like the Red Cross and Red Crescent working in Turkey and Syria. I am not a fan of those big and sluggish NGOs and I would rather give directly to those in need, but even that is far better than falling for scams who will use this bad situation for their own gain.Unfortunately trust in government organizations here is much less than NGOs we mentioned. Also, they didn't have the option to donate with crypto. You can donate blood to Red Crescent though.Quote from: _BlackStar on February 07, 2023, 10:00:41 PMirfan_pak10 had donation thread some time ago when Pakistan was hit by flood or natural disaster.

Anyway, the thread is restored second time. Thank you theymos.I also don't understand that there is a different approach for the two threads [both donation threads], but I don't want to speculate too much about deleting and restoring thread. As I said, the mod who handles the report may have his own interpretation of the decision-making, and the user who reports the thread also has a reason that is expected to be very wise without any other elements.Then I looked at the thread again: [DONATION] A donation campaign for the natural disaster happened in TurkeyEFS, I wish all the Turks the best at this time. I will definitely be very sorry if we lose some members of the Turkish forum due to the earthquake [hopefully that doesn't happen]. Take care of your safety, the earthquake will usually occur several times as aftershocks.",

A good move from crypto community when it comes to donation drive. But expects scam attempts will show later on. That's why mods are wary of this donation threads without any verified sources from the said organizations.",

If the original thread was opened in the same place as the restored version: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5438361, then there are 2 mods overseeing that section: @Cyrus and @hilariousandco, to protect the innocence of the staff members who didn't commit the evil blunder, I think the mod at fault should be immediately made known to public. Thanks to @EFS for bringing this matter to public attention and keeping some semblance of sanity in this weird place...",

I have two viewed about Turkey donation thread have been deleted between as scam or people try to get advantage from Turkey earthquake and some people have real donation opening. We are so sad heard what happen in Turkey and exactly with how many people was pass away until one day later after earthquake, possibility with many people will pass away because many of them still have not been evacuated.Better with donation for Turkey opening by local board moderator from Turkey, there are less from scamming and possibility they know more about what happen in their country. Maybe better solution how to make thread about Turkey donation keep existing here and need transparent after donating collected.",

For example, opening donations for disaster victims.

But since the admin has undeleted the thread I mean, then I think this thread deserves to be locked now. Anyways I don't expect the mod or whoever reported the donation thread to provide an explanation here why it was removed or reported, but honestly I'm wondering about this. About the donation thread, it is worthy to be in the forum because of its noble cause. It should be the same with several other donation threads including the Pakistan floods as well as others. Thank you to the admin for canceling the deletion of the donation thread.",
