After a day your Note balance would be 1.00033333BTC and so on until you withdraw. You could deposit today, wait for a day, withdraw and you would still get to keep the rewards for that day.At the moment there are no fees on Whirlwind, not even for on-chain withdraws. Unless you choose to donate voluntarily it's completely free to use and all fees are on us. We will update the FAQ in the second post with more information",

I understand it much better now, and it's really nice that you are operating a very transaction-free platform. I thought it was just temporary when you implemented it last time. Keep up the good work, and I will try this out and get some daily rewards for why I'm still exercising my holding exercise.",

With the current balance of around 11BTC our costs are about 0.11BTC a month. In order to reward early depositors we were considering setting a 'floor' for the total rewards paid out at 0.5BTC a month, meaning that with the current balance a depositor would receive 4.5% monthly return. This figure would go down continuously until it comes back to the usual 1% when the balance hits 50BTC and will continue like that until our Anonymity Set goal is reached.Quote from: ChuckBuck on May 11, 2023, 05:59:18 PMSo, it mean, monthly interest amount is fixed and it is not cumulative, no compound interest, only 1% per month is the maximum reward for participants.

On the other hand that would mean that there is no interest at all in Whirlwind, even though it's hard to believe that will be the case. All the feedback we received until now from people that tried us out was very positive, especially for the Pay to Note system. We built a novel system and that's almost surely the reason why it takes longer for users to get accustomed to it and understand its advantages, but with time we are sure this will change for the better.Quote from: CryptSafe on May 11, 2023, 09:59:23 PMThis is a good idea you have shared OP.

How come So soon it is a mining farm with a 12% APR daily yield rewards. Is it not worth explaining so we could know?We've been transparent about the fact that we pay these rewards ourselves from our reserve. There are no partnerships with any other projects and it's important to make it clear that this campaign is temporary, Whirlwind is not a staking platform and it will never be. The point of this campaign is to grow the Anonymity Set and this is only needed at the beginning of the service, the stage we are in now.Quote from: dansus021 on May 12, 2023, 12:01:42 AMI am also curious when there are not enough people who deposited into the pool, but One things is sure that this staking service acts as add more security into the mixing itself but correct me if I am wrong.Yes it does, by having a larger Anonymity Set every current or future user benefits from a higher level of privacy when using Whirlwind. If it's still not clear why this is the case please ask and we will explain again.Quote from: Little Mouse on May 12, 2023, 01:42:09 AMWho is going to hold the privkey?

Only users have access to their Note private key, we do not have that information. If you have a funded Note, including if you received the signature campaign payment on it, then you are automatically participating in the campaign and are receiving daily rewards based on its balance. If you want to exclude yourself from this campaign the only way to do so is to withdraw your balance to your on-chain address, otherwise rewards will keep accumulating.Also keep in mind that if it makes economic sense for you (daily reward covers the network fee for another deposit), you could withdraw the entire balance right after receiving the daily reward and then deposit it again right before the next daily reward is distributed. This way you would keep your risk at a minimum, but if you think we will steal your funds then there is no argument for depositing in the first place.",

It could originate from one or multiple deposits out of the entire 10,000, or it could simply be a Pay to Note transfer, how could you know? Even if you have access to the most advanced analytics software in existence it's impossible to figure it out unless you have outside information. This is why it's crucial to grow the Anonymity Set as fast as possible, if we manage to succeed in doing this then nothing comes close to the privacy you're getting when using Whirlwind. The Anonymity Mining campaign's role is to help us get there faster by basically paying for these deposits to happen.",
