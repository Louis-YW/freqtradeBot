Another point is that we are extremely into innovation these days, and we can't seem to stop it. What we truly need to do is incorporate it into our daily lives. Why not if it helps?So what Mark did is significant for the Ray-ban firm, because we know that in addition to Ray-ban being well-known all over the globe, Mark Z is also a well-known person, so people all around the world will most likely continue to protect it.",
