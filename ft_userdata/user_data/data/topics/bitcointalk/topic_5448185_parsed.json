  "content": "When you're short on cash, it can be difficult to quit borrowing money.Everyone has been there. We're short on cash and in a lot of debt, but a cover loan to get out of the red and even improve our readiness is the light at the end of the tunnel.Blissful days? Sadly, no. It all comes down to the straightforward, yet frequently misunderstood, formula that says borrowing more money equals more debt. It is more difficult to return to black the more debt you accumulate.The majority of us live beyond our means, which is one of the primary causes of our ever-increasing habit of borrowing money. Simply put, incomings are outpacing outgoings. It's also getting worse.More than at any time in the past two decades, millions of Americans are spending more than they earn. Spending on credit cards, the most common type of personal debt, is estimated to be rising at a rate faster than at any other time in American history.",

It represents the only solution in every crisis, because it must be a circumstantial solution and not a strategy to postpone getting into trouble. There are businesses based on borrowing, but they have their own strategy that cannot be applied to individuals.Personally, I have to borrow from time to time, but it is always for a short period and small amounts that do not exceed $2,000. And I do it when I can't find an alternative solution.",

But there are others that actually borrow money for critical needs or situations that their savings can’t really cover.Most people are in debt because they want to please other people. Some people are very competitive that they want to buy what they can not afford because they want to look like others. I have seen people take loans because they want to have a lavish wedding or birthday. The only reason one should borrow might be because of emergency or critical needs. One might decide to borrow because there is no money to but food or pay for certain basic needs such as housing, etc.  QuoteAlso there are many businesses that have been built through loan or grants and they went all the way to been successful.

Otherwise loans aren’t all that bad Taking a loan to start up a business might not be bad advice because a good venture can grow and bring profit. But it might not be the best option because business is risky. If the business fails to pay back the loan might become a problem. Many sound businesses were started or expanded using loans or other credit facilities, but many failed and put their owners into debt that they can't afford to pay.",

Let's say, for instance, that you are in need of medical refills and you don't have enough money at that time, but at the end of the month, week, or day you are expecting to receive something for work that you have already done. At this point in time, you need to borrow money so that you can pay your medical bills, and then when your wages and allowances come in, you settle your debts. This kind of borrowing is encouraging. The kind of borrowing which is a bad habit and contributes to the economic downfall of a nation and the financial instability of a person is when an individual borrows just to satisfy his casual, unwanted, and pleasure, like when you don't even have any source of income, where you are expecting money from, and because you want to gamble you went ahead to borrow money. That kind of borrowing is sometimes not encouraging, and we advise anyone who really wants to make it far in life to stop.",

The inflation rate is growing day after day, and it's so bad in some countries that even with their salaries, average citizens of those countries where inflation is high cannot even completely fulfill their basic needs with their salaries without having to take out loans. OP, it's really not easy for some people. But the best way to help their situation so they don't incur a lot of debt is to always make a good financial plan and budget for themselves so they don't spend what they didn't really budget for. Even some wealthy people still borrow to add up, and that's when the money they have at that moment cannot completely cover what they intend to do with it. Even some SMEs (small and medium enterprises) still borrow to support their business.",

Personally, I cannot afford to have a debt specially I don't have a big reason to. Aside from that, I didn't have that much income in order for me to receive loans or decide getting in debt. In our country, it is much difficult once you get inside that non ending cycle of payment, every month you'll get exhausted by only paying those interest leaving nothing on your salary. I have seen so many people on my neighborhood doing the same thing over and over again, and to add more salt on their wounds, even if you say that by living below your means will somehow help you, to be precise, no coz sometimes the most basic meal you can afford is already equivalent to an expensive meal. The primary problem in our country is due to lack of financial support and management in farming areas which makes the basic necessities like vegetables very expensive. In this regard, most victims of those non ending cycle of debt are farmers due to lack of capital for their farms, and usually all our goods are imported out of the country.I also understand that getting in debt is not really a wise thing to do, but there are some circumstances that this is the only solution they have in mind in order to survive.",

Borrowing when you have a remedy or pay back plan is ok but when you are hoping or depending on a means when you are not sure of it is very much not alright. I believe most times it is not as a result of satisfaction people borrow but at times they encounter emergencies which results to their urgent request for financial aid or assistant to solve their problem immediately.Borrowing  in terms of setting up a profitable business is not bad. As long as you have set your repayment plan depending on your terms and conditions, it is aright to go with as the business venture for which the loan was taken is profitable enough to repay the loan, running cost and every other financial commitment to service.",

The US has been exporting its dollars which have been used as a global reserve and in return has been able to consume many goods and services that it did not produce, something that is beginning to change. On a personal level, getting into debt is not always negative, it is negative for consumption, which is what most people get into debt for. On the other hand, borrowing to invest can be reasonable and provide leverage, making it possible to reach goals more quickly, and many companies do so.",
