  "content": "Story time  My nephew, who is around 15 years old, has gained knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies through exposure to discussions between his father (my brother) and me, as we frequently talk about bitcoin. Whenever he has free time from school or chores, we allow him to listen in on our conversations and ask any curious questions he may have. For instance, he often asks questions like, \"Uncle, what is bitcoin?\" or \"Is it a type of currency? Can I have one?\" We do our best to explain the concept to him, but sometimes he grasps it easily while other times he struggles to understand. What I do know is that this young boy is displaying a keen interest in the subject.Recently, he expressed his frustration about his teacher and classmates labeling bitcoin as a ponzi scheme or a scam each time he talks about it. I'm seeking a variety of advice that I can offer to my nephew in this situation. Although his father suggested that he should stop discussing bitcoin, I don't feel comfortable with that approach. What are your thoughts on this matter?",

      "body": "It is difficult to explain something to a prejudiced person, especially if you have to resist the authority of a teacher. It might be worth looking into what a Ponzi scheme is, how it works, how not to get caught up in it, and why Bitcoin is nothing like a Ponzi scheme.As for the scam in general, you can only try to tell in more detail about what decentralization is, how it is embedded in the bitcoin code. What are the real threats such as a 51% attack and why are they unlikely. You need to be open and not afraid to talk about what the potential difficulties could be. But this can only be told to those who want to listen. Anyone who simply says that Bitcoin is a scam is unlikely to hear any arguments.",

Is that not scam in countries that are not developed but hit with inflation? The fiat will decrease in value even in countries that are developed. Let him know that he suppose to understand something before he can call it a scam. A business that the business owner collect Peter money to pay Paul is what that is called ponzi. Is bitcoin like that? No. You know what is bitcoin, you know how volatile it is, you know that you can either gain or lose, unlike ponzi schemes that the business owners are lying to make investors to invest.",

What are your thoughts on this matter?It's great to see your nephew developing an interest in bitcoin, thanks to you and your brother.But you have to make him understand that not everyone will have the same mindset and it's okay to have different opinions.This itself will be a huge lesson for him since it will make him understand about different perspectives in life.Also, keep encouraging him to learn more about bitcoin and focus more on the technical side such as decentralization.Tell him to keep talking to others in private and know how each individual think about bitcoin.May be he will be able to find more like minded people and that way he will get to know there are few people who are interested in bitcoin.",

It is even bad that the teacher can not do a little research to be updated with knowledge of bitcoin and how it works but rather silence your nephew. This shows how funny some humans can be at times. I expected the teacher to be challenged by the reality of your nephews input by going into research.If I were your brother, I would have withdrawn him from that school as the ignorant attitude of the teacher has already shown how the teachers in that school are which is very bad and as such do not really show any sign of research attitude from them. This was the reason why other students too criticised your nephew because they depend on what their teacher told them and do not do further research and findings.",

There is no way that his teacher will believe him that bitcoin is not a scam because he believes that your nephew doesn't even have any knowledge on it. However,it is not everyone that will hear about bitcoin that will believe that it is for real due to lack of knowledge and no prove that bitcoin is for real. Tell your cousin not to discuss bitcoin with anyone until he is up to the age. I hope that bitcoin is legalized in your country, if not your nephew can put you in trouble.",

Or are you willing to make some investment for him on your behalf, or will his Dad (your brother) do that for his son, or does your brother already have a Bitcoin investment that he will definitely have to hand over to his son in the future? Well, if you really know the desire of your nephew, whether he needs the knowledge at that moment or not, then you will have to decide what to do. You know you cannot force someone to learn what they don't want to, and perhaps the Dad has asked, that he should stop engaging in Bitcoin discussion. 15 years is really old, though, and even if he makes up his mind to learn at the age of 18, he can still grab quite a good knowledge and always seek your attention or his dad's any time he requires it.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

We have different risk tolerance that's why even people with a good educational background gives such remarks since they can't handle high risk and just simply categorized it as scam just to avoid being involved.",

It is because other people may not know the truth about Bitcoin, they have no knowledge and just hear FUDs around them. But if Bitcoin or crypto is legal in your country, you can allow him to share about Bitcoin with any peopleBy the way, not everyone cares and understands Bitcoin, so it is not surprising that other people may think it is a Ponzi/scam. People who never learn about Bitcoin, probably will easily conclude it scam/Ponzi whenever they read FUDs on social media about Bitcoin. It should take support from any party to realize people that Bitcoin is a true digital investment. Luckily I live in a country where Bitcoin is legal as an investment, so people begin to trust Bitcoin here. However, there are still many people who claim that Bitcoin is a shit investment, Ponzi, or scam.",
