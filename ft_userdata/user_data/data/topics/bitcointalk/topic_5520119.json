Everything boils down to the investor goals, capital and capacity So there isn't any universal answer. Personally I believe it's cheaper getting or starting in a Bear market and continuously accumulate To a level you satisfied with.

The only problem is that it will be long and tough as it might take years to do it and so it's not just about the budget, but how mentally ready you are to go into a long haul.Although motivation is obviously the big profits, so you have to look at the bigger picture to somewhat overcome that psychology. For me personally, I think about it this way, if others can do it, they why not me? So yes, if you are just average joe investors, then you might want to look or start your DCA when prices at a discount, and this could happen during the bear market.But think about it, if we got into a bull run at around $180k, then the next bear market is around $50k lowest low, isn't it still too high for us in the future?",

That would be the ideal time for anyone to buy and accumulate more bitcoin. There won't be any ATH recorded at that time so I don't think one should really worry about the price they will be buying in at that time.Quote~ Do you just buy at every market price while DCA?Me? No.I try to wait until the market dips before I buy again and when it is high I do not buy. When it goes and dip again, I buy. We all have different approaches towards DCA. Some do not like having to check the price because the point of DCA is that they regularly buy bitcoin without being restricted by their own decisions. Like if we do not follow a strict DCA schedule, one might be wary of buying yet and then they miss a good entry point. But with a fixed pattern, they don't really have to worry about this as long as they are able to buy.",

Typically, you are trading with spot market if you will use a DCA method since you want an average price for your holdings while trading on futures should be done via short term method since it has a risk of liquidation and at the same time you have a stop loss which should be hit before you can even do a DCA.Do a spot DCA instead of futures if you want to purchase in red market. DCA is supposed for o use on red market tho.Quote~ Do you just buy at every market price while DCA?I usually set a DCA bought that purchase everyday on specific time like before the market close since the price typically make a move on that time.",

So just be consistent on accumulation and don't pay much attention on pumps also dumps since you are not doing any short term trades.",

Whether the market is bearish or bullish, you can buy Bitcoin and no needs to think much about the market moves. You can focus to buy Bitcoin weekly or monthly and hold Bitcoin for some term. You only sell when your term is finish or the Bitcoin reach the new ATH price.

Quote~ Do you just buy at every market price while DCA?Of course, that's it. The reason of DCA is for you to buy with little amount gradually consistently every week so that you can keep on growing your bitcoin stash overtime and it has not specific market timing, because if you stop, your bitcoin portfolio remains stagnant and wouldn't grow. Is just like you have a savings of 10% of your income to build a house in 5 years time and whenever you get paid, you keep that 10% in a bank every month till it piles up to the required amount. You don't stop saving that money monthly because the cost of cement is high or cost of sand is high or bricks.",

The DCA method of bitcoin is a practice that is consistent and it is an investment that you are looking into the future that is why the current price of bitcoin is nothing to fear about because you already know you will definitely make good profit if you hodl. If you think you must buy bitcoin by considering what the price of bitcoin is I don't think it will be possible to practice DCA method and to hodl bitcoin.

I've learned that no matter what the price as long as I have the money for DCAing, I'd do it. Sometimes, I feel that the price is expensive but I would take my own words for that. I've sold in the past at a lower price and that gave me a lesson that if I do believe in BTC going further, I should take it and buy whenever I am available to and my pocket says so. We have our own interpretation of DCA. The most believed is to buy at any price that we can. The next one is whenever we have money to buy for and still at any rate, I think that both compliments each other and your goal for holding Bitcoin will support your own thought when you've got some emotions or your mind is telling you that it's not the best time to DCA because the price is quite expensive.",
