I was under pressure yesterday to make sure say I swap my old naira note without me knowing that the date has been extended. When I heard about it this morning, i was a angry, the thing pain me very well because I know how it happened that yesterday just for me to swap the old note. Sometimes, the government can be very frustrating, bending her citizens to do otherwise as a result of their ineptitude.  The worse of it all is that the new note is not in circulation and most banks have not been able to get it as a result of this, most bank git their ATM closed which means that the Banks are not reliable. If bank no fit get new naira note for distribution, na people go get am.",

If di bank manager sit on top of the funds sent to her or im to deepens to the citizens the CBN governor had to sack the management. Now how many unemployed youths do we have in Nigerian? A lot. How many staff does CBN has few. Why CBN can't employ even ad-hoc staff to monitor the process.  Today I was interviewed by AIT TV station at the front of access Bank and I told them di reality.

He has played his part diligently well by printing enough note for circulation but the so called commercial banks are the ones selling the money to highest bidders, hence we couldn’t have enough money to use. Not everything we should blame our leaders for, sometimes we cause ourselves the problems by given ourselves unnecessary and unjustifiable conditions.

You can't tell me that CBN doesn't know the amount of money that is deposited in banks. The transition would have been much easier by allowing the flow of the old notes in line with the new notes, whereby any old note that gets to the bank never comes out again.
