  "content": "Guys I have a S9K asic miner that I want to sell because it's not profitable anymore for me but I am curious since this is a sha256 rig is there anything else I can use this asic miner for? Also I want to upgrade to a better asic miner and I have up to 14,000$ to spare.I will also like to know which Asic miner is the most profitable right now because I can't find any, Antminer S19 XP with 255TH is the highest I can find and this earn 4.7$ per day, is there any Bitcoin asic miner that do better than this?",

      "body": "The difference is that the hydro does not have the large cooling fans. Running at full speed each fan can easily draw 50-75w. That said, the hydro *does* need to use circulating pumps and fan cooled radiator(s) which are not part of the efficiency spec. When running just 1 or 2 of the miners it's a safe bet that after adding in the power for cooling system will it be nearly the same...",

I tried in local forums for buying Antminer, but on calculation their is no profit for me.What to mine showed me loss a year back. I think the OP later can have profit if the BTC price moves up else mining is worse for most countries.",
