Altcoins has done so much and they are making scam more possible, see Do Kwon pump and dump UST and Luna, see DeFi scam, see DAO hacks, another are NFTs, the most scam about NFTs will be not in short period of time, it can be long period of time, NFTs that are created today, worth certain amount of dollars but they may fade in price over time and become worthless or less worthless in the future.",

And ~95% of them had no unique utility and no value today.This is what happens with erery trend; DeFi and now NFTs; they are getting so much hype and this attracts devs looking for quick cash, and creating lots of rug pulls.I would say there are some real utility for NFTs, but it's greatly overshadowed by the bulk of scam and money grabbing projects.",

There are some worth watchin and investing but not all are good and some just created for hype and follows the trend for some quick scam cash.We cant let those to continue but since this is a decentralized space, I guess whats trending will always be the talk of the town.

This is exactly what NFTs are today, everyone can create theirs.NFT doesn’t meant for big time investment because it’s main purpose is for collection since there’s no ready liquidity for you to cash it out whenever you want to take profit. They are not scam because you are getting the NFT that you purchased while most of the artist  didn’t promised any returns for there buyer. I believe most scam happening on NFT project are those rug pull projects that turns the token value in to but not the NTF itself so definitely NFT is not the scam but rather the token associated with it.",

Now, how many will be valuable in 5 or 10 years? Very few of the ones we see now. With NFTs a bubble was formed that has also started to burst some time ago and that will wipe out the vast majority of them.",

And it is useful for the people who wants to buy it or people that want to develop software with that.For example, cryptokitties was probably the first NFT game , and it was a success. I think it is idiot to breed cats and sell them. But there are people who pay for that.There are also other games like Axie Inifity, and maybe in a few years we will have NFT in bitocin network (who knows?)Social networks are already implementing nft  to their platforms, so there nothing about \"scam\" in this technology",

Like everything else, some NFTs serve a purpose, some do not. Some are art, some are not. Some may be valuable to collectors, but others will not. I don't think it's good to generalize things like that. Take the Internet and the World Wide Web for example, anyone today can create their own website, but that does not mean all websites are useless and worthless. And to expand on this analogy, back in the 90s, no one could have predicted the rapid development of the Internet over the next 20 or 30 years.",

This is exactly what NFTs are today, everyone can create theirs.I totally agree with you mate, I currently own several NFTs, from crypto kitties, to Dego finance NFTs, to Money Tree, to several others I either bought or won, all this NFTs are there in my wallet with absolutely no means of selling any of them, one i managed to put up for sale has been there for over three months without a single buyer. I will advice every newbie to stay far away from NFTs, NFTs are only useful for keeping and preserving important documents in the form of a digital signature, it is never meant to be sold for money.",

In this desperation, many have bought many valueless NFT's and in holding now seeing that it as a waste are calling it scams. Almost all, but not all are scams. People will profit from NFT's, people will still profit from crypto...but as a newbie, best advice is to invest and give more attention to crypto than NFT's.  Quote from: 5W-KILO on June 29, 2022, 06:59:02 AMNewbies, NFTs should be the first thing you fear the most in crypto space...

Not sure when, but surely it is now slowly dying as I do not hear it a lot in social media unlike in the earlier days.",

NFT for me is a good idea, everyone could be selling some crappy token for USD but the NFTs are actually a good idea. An NFT can be digital art, collectibles, any kind of unique digital item, in fact the possibilities of NFTs may seem endless and the market for NFTs is only getting bigger. However, the vast majority of these tokens don’t have any use at all, other than you are selling them to try and make a quick profit from. It's all about the hype, speculation and a tiny little percentage of what NFT really are, but I don't believe that almost all NFTs are scam.",
