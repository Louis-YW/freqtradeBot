Even one of my classmates told me the same thing.Your friends narrative about bitcoin is both wrong and just a little bit right. Bitcoin doesn’t get you really wealthy as you put it out to be. It is usually for transactions but due to its volatility and limited supply it is the advantage of been a store of value and People save in it to avoid the devaluation that comes with the fiat currency. It is this volatility that causes it to have a ROI and people gain profit from it when it is hold on to for long time or bought at a low price. But it doesn’t burst up like you painted it to be Quote from: Macoach on August 10, 2023, 10:30:07 AMSo, here's what I want to know: Is it a good idea if I use the money I've saved up from 3 years of my trust fund to buy Bitcoin?This seems more of a critical question, one of the first thing in investing in bitcoin is having to invest an amount you can afford to lose and this is not any amount you can afford to lose so it is a No. Also the timing for when you will want to get back the money or withdraw is very important. The market might be in bearish period and you would need the money back and selling it off that period could result in a loss for you. So the question is how long are saving this money for, if it is above 5 years then it would be advisable to save in bitcoin since the fiat value is threatened with devaluation when hold for long due to inflation. But if it less than then I wouldn’t advise you to save in it. Also you need an extensive knowledge on how to safeguard your funds, so before getting this knowledge do not go on and just buy. Lastly stay away from other cryptocurrencies as investment coins.",

I've been hearing about this thing called cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. People say you can buy Bitcoin and become really wealthy. Even one of my classmates told me the same thing.According to my observation you are a newbie and don't know details about What is Bitcoin, How it works and How it is a potential investment, How to secure your Bitcoin. So first learn every details about Bitcoin and about it's advantages and risks so that you may not regret in future if there is a unexpected dump. I will suggest if you can hold it for long term then you can easily choose Bitcoin. Holding fiat currency isn't a good idea as it has inflation. If I was you then I will study much more about Bitcoin and research by own to decide if it's suitable for me or not. But to suggest you I will say obviously Bitcoin is a potential investment but you have to know the correct way or time to enter. You can do DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) to make a good investment plan. And hold your Bitcoin in a Hardware wallet or in Open Source non custodial wallets like Electrum, Blue Wallet, Micelium Wallet etc.To learn details about Bitcoin you can read this article: What is Bitcoin?",

It's important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards, as the value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Make sure you're financially stable, have an emergency fund, and are comfortable with the possibility of losing the money you invest. It's also a good idea to research and understand how cryptocurrencies work before making any investment decisions.",

I believe buying Bitcoin is really a good idea if the money you will be investing on Bitcoin is just personal savings and not for your school expenses. Bitcoin is very good investment to fight inflation because it’s value is not related to fiat while the supply is very limited. Your Bitcoin will surely grow in fiat value when inflayion hits hard. But you should be aware that Bitcoin is not an instrument of wealth or something. Bitcoin is an which doesn’t affected by inflation. Bitcoin price grow because fiat value is decreasing while the demand for it is increasing due to its limited supply.",

Investing is a risk, you have to understand and accept that there are no guarantees that you will profit in the end despite historical data on that investment. You also need patience; if you do not have enough money at your disposal to handle other expenses then do not risk all your savings in Bitcoin.Quote from: Macoach on August 10, 2023, 10:30:07 AMPeople say you can buy Bitcoin and become really wealthy. Even one of my classmates told me the same thing.Depends on your definition of wealth really. Ten years ago Bitcoin could give you a profit of ×1000 or more from your initial investment, but not you should realistically expect a Mac of ×4 during the bullrun season and depending on what price you bought at.You can hold longer that the next bull run and have a ten year or more target, but there are still no guarantees of wealth.",

But, on the other hand, it could also go down just as quickly, and you might end up with less money than you started with. It's important to think about whether you're okay with the idea that your money could go up or down in value. Are you someone who's cool with taking a bit of a chance, or do you prefer to play it safe?As a student also consider what you need your money for. If you have important stuff like bills or loans to pay, maybe those should come first before you think about Bitcoin. And if you're using money from a trust fund, make sure it's okay to use it for Bitcoin.",

Even one of my classmates told me the same thing.There are some problems buried in this statement, in my opinion: Bitcoin is a high-risk investment and should be treated as such. Therefore, you should never invest more money in Bitcoin than you are willing to lose.As an investor you should never follow investment tips blindly, crypto influencers who promote \"the next big thing\" will teach you a hard lesson otherwise\"this thing called cryptocurrency\" shows that you haven't really dealt with the topic(s) in general. Here I would strongly recommend you to read up on what Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) are and why Bitcoin is so much more than an \"investment to get rich quick\". Only after you understand that would I think about buying Bitcoins. When this time comes, the first point applies again: never invest more than you are willing to lose. You can find a lot of information about what Bitcoin is, how Bitcoin works and what is so ingenious about Bitcoin here in the forum - or via simple Google searches. For example, you can find a great video right in one of the pinned threads here: Newbies - Read before posting",

Bitcoin investment is not a \"get rich scheme\", and there are a lot of scammers here that you attract you to invest in them and make claims like x10 or your investments will grow overtime in just short amount of time.As for putting your trust fund into bitcoin, just remember that there is a big risk as well. As market moves in a bear to bull market in a 4 year cycle span. So it's not going to be very easy to you to see your money going down in a bear market.",

Just as you have stated that the money you have today does not possess the same purchasing power again as the value of the fund has reduced drastically because of inflation, if you are not going to be in a hurry to make use of the money that you have saved up for about three years, then I will advise you to choose Bitcoin as a means of saving those funds, but you can consider it as an asset used in stocking your savings rather than a get rich quick means as your course mates have advised.Having a higher expectation when it comes to the amount of profit that you will be expecting to get from Bitcoin might lead you to disappointment, which might result in panic selling out of fear because you are not getting what you were expecting as told from the beginning. Instead,  focus on the amount you can be able to buy and hold before the end of your schooling. Maybe if luck is on your side and your selling time falls under the bull season, then you can grab those decent profits.",

You must try to know about the period of time it will take for that project to yield a good result for you.2. You must try to know the strength and weakness of that project.3.You should look at the amount you have at hand,and know the amount you use in starting it.Having at the back of your mind that while starting an investment,you don't start with a huge amount of money to avoid regret,you should atleast try it with a little amount of money and see the outcome before putting in a reasonable amount if it actually comes out very good.4.You should try to seek advice from people that are experienced in the field to have an in-depth knowledge about what you are into.I believe these are some Cardinal points you should atleast consider before making any investment.",

The essence of the narrative written into this topic is to ask whether the existing funds are suitable for investing in bitcoin and getting rich.Bitcoin is not a scheme or method to get rich quick. Finally, I said in a post about investing in bitcoin that there is no guarantee that investing in bitcoin will benefit quickly by seeing the price rise quickly as in other types of investment because the price movements of the crypto market are very volatile, but I dare say that investing in bitcoin could be the best way to preserve the value of your current fiat money in the long term compared to other coins in the crypto space.You have only heard about the types of benefits that will be obtained when investing in bitcoins, but the risks involved when investing in bitcoins also need to be known from anyone who explains to you about investing in bitcoins.I hope I'm not wrong in answering your question.",

Another important area I would want you to familiarize yourself is wallet security. It would be really sad to invest your trust fund and have your wallet compromised or funds stolen by a hacker.",
