This is bad, but you should have elaborated on it. How much do you have in the account and how fair are the transactions you made with it? \"Not your key, Not your coin\" has played again here, it's another lesson.Regardless, if an exchange could lock an account without a due reason for doing so, then they are not worth using irrespective of their reason. I don't have an account with them, and you have given me another reason with the image provided not to have an account with them ever.",

There could only be a few reasons why your account has been closed by them. It's either related to your orders as considered Spam Order/Account. That's one and another one could be the area of restriction. Honestly, I'm also curious as to why they've closed your account without giving you any reasons. Maybe they're going to remain intact and won't disclose a reason why you've been closed suddenly. Keep on emailing and contacting them through their various channels to alert them if you still have some money left there.",

From the image you linked to us, Bitmex did say you breached their terms of service so there is a violation. Perhaps, you were truly at fault -- whether you did it knowingly or not. However, we don't know the specifics so it could go both ways really. CEx do rely on suspicions so I wouldn't be surpised if it's something dumb or a false positive.In any case, it's unlikely that they will explain the cause throughly. With CEx's it's either they don't tell the specifics or give a vague reasoning which as user, I know, sucks. Most of these exchanges also have clause/s in their terms of service indicating they may not notify you the exact reason for cases like this.So my advise is to focus your energy in getting your funds out. See if you could request to delete your personal data with them as well -- i know we have to rely on trust with this but it's better than nothing.",

Then OP did not understand to the reasons why he was blocked. Possibly OP did not read to understand why his or her account was blocked which would require a KYC before trading. So it would be on the best interest of OP to go do his or her KYC and wait for verification approval before coming here to complaining anything.

If you check possibly they might have blocked OP as a result of his or her ignorance with respect to their publication. Maybe OP tried trading or making withdrawals without doing his or her KYC which warranted them to block the account. You can see that OP has not been able to provide any additional evidence since then to prove his or her point.",
