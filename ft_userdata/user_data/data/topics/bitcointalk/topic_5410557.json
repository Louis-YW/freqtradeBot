      "body": "Such a nice thing that you have done, many merchants are yet to introduce bitcoin as a means of payment in their business because of volatility, and some accept it, but through payment processors; another drawback is the customers, many of them are reluctant to pay with bitcoin because it is a currency and asset that has an appreciative value, so they treasure it & want to keep it and spend fiat that is depreciative, it makes sense, but it is good to spend bitcoin a few times as you can. I don't know where your business is located, but your post sounded like many of your customers are now actually paying with bitcoin than fiat, that's not possible right? Which makes me curious to know how you go about it. Cheers Superdoctor.",

There'll be always some sort of limitations with the banking which isn't there with cryptocurrency. This makes cryptocurrency far better against the traditional banking system used for business needs.Introducing bitcoin as payment option is really good and doing it by now makes you one among the earliest to do so. For now the business transactions are much into banking and other payment applications. Soon this will move to cryptocurrency. What people like do is the the base for large scale progress.",

Sometimes the bitcoin network gets very slow and expensive because lots of people use it and your customers might want to use the alternatives. LTC, XMR, DOGE are good solid alternatives which have been around since forever. They are not as cool as bitcoin but providing some alternatives is still a good idea. imo. Your other choice is enabling the lightning network but I don't think many people use it.",

It would have been motivated more business dealers to integrate Bitcoins in one of their payment method also.",

Until now, there are still lots of people (especially the senior citizens) who aren’t aware of Bitcoin yet despite the trend increases. But I have a question though. Which Bitcoin wallet are you using for your business? Is it from a centralized wallet? Or Bitcoin lightning network?",

OP, could you give more details on whether you use a custodial wallet or what kind and if you used an exchange like PX-Z asks? It would also be helpful to know if you are in a poor country or one of the more industrialized ones. No need to say the exact country if you don't want to.",

Crypto users will be able to figure out your organization very easily. They will be more motivated to get the product with the new payment system. Moreover, there are some common advantages.

Bitcoin is meant to excludes various bank processes that could an account holder tired of kewping money in the bank. Bitcoin is here to stay to we'll have to embrace it more and appreciate the creator. I have also used Bitcoin for many payment of services and I never regretted of getting to know about Bitcoin at the first place.
