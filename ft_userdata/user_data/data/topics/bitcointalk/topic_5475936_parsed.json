  "content": "Not sure if many are aware of Myria but I bought 100,000 when the price was £0.0012 back in August and the price is currently £0.009 which means I am now 750% up on my investment. I bought 100,000 after watching a few videos online saying how Myria can see the returns Gala did in 2021 which was over 100x. I am not tempted to sell yet but think I will be if it gets to point where I am up 10x on my investment but part of me wants to hold on till bull run in the hope that it can 100x. Anyone have any thoughts on Myria at all? Like i said above many say it can see the gains Gala saw in 2021 but I am not sure if that is just youtubers trying to hype the project or if it really can do that well.",

Yes I think that is what I will do take out my investment and then leave the rest to hopefully see a great bull run over the next few years.It has gone down a little in the last 12 hours so will wait for it to pump back up and then take out the money I put in.",

Anyone else invested? Wow thats a good profit mate. It seems your timing is totally sync with the current market. For sure many have missed that game even me just heard it when theres so much noise already. But I dont want to fomo with its current price especially it pumped 10x already. Maybe a pull back if theres a chance then I purchase some. What network does myria do?",

Anyone else invested? I think Myria will blow and it will be huge imo and if your initial target was really 100x then why not stick with it until the end? We aren't yet in the bull run and gaming sector is likely still be a top contender in the upcoming bull run so better hold on them. Well, it's not bad to take profit or get your initial investment and let the other tokens play along.",

I only now need it to reach £0.12 which would be a £1b market cap and 100x for me - I just wish i put more in but to turn £120 into £12,000 would still be a great return.",

Although its price is not higher enough that anybody cannot afford it but still there occurred a recent surge in myria token so I think if someone wants to diversify portfolio then they should not forget about myria.Most of the people are greedy enough that when they sometimes see pump of certain token then they rush towards its investment but i think that everyone should buy any token with lower value and should investigate about it first. The current price of myria is 0.012$ which means that those who have bought it previously are now in profit and as Bull season is coming so I think all coins are going to show unexpected gain.",

When a project we invested on pumps, it then means we're currently open to becoming one of very young crypto traders that are impacting people around with positivity. The market is in different view, I totally understand we're earning and losing good quality time in the market, more reason we should adapted with trending projects in the market.",

Anyone else invested?   If I were to sell it to you, because of what I can see in its graph chart, it will continue to drop because it has been able to lift quite high, and of course it will have liquidation to have an uptrend again in the market.  And besides that, this is also not the right opportunity to buy it because its price value will drop because, at the moment, its price movement is quite volatile with what is currently happening in the exchange. It's still quite high risk, to be honest.",

Success is everybody's friend and I'm happy for the OP for buying into a reliable token that is still pumping and has the potential of giving multiple times profit, although I hope that he takes your advice and sale the worth of his investment capital, then let the ROI to be playing along.Myria, is not Bitcoin, so it can dump and not pump again. Many investors that have taken advice from YouTubers and influencers from different platforms on the social media have different stories to tell, some bought into scam projects and coins that are doomed from the start, so it's better to carry out proper research after hearing about any projects from a YouTuber.",

Sell now, as all chances are that the price will decrease. If an agreement is reached on ETFs, the price will decrease because investors will turn to Bitcoin. If the opposite is true, there will be a major correction in the price. Therefore, in both cases, the possibility of a decrease is more likely, and it is better for you to sell now.",
