Currently I have TREZOR ONE and BITBOX02, both were purchased directly from the official website. Since you are working with altcoins, I don't see the point in adding a 3rd hardware wallet to the mix. I don't have a a lot of positive things to say about most altcoins anyway. The Trezor One is a decent unit. I have never used a BitBox, so I don't feel like saying anything about it.

Thank you! The Trezor Safe 3 is a younger, stronger, and more modern version of the Trezor One. It's probably going to replace Model One completely one day. But dkbit98 mentioned something interesting. OneKey had a serious vulnerability a few months ago where it was proven that the keys from its secure element weren't encrypted and thus could be intercepted. That's exactly what a security company did and made OneKey aware of that. Despite the existence of a SE chip, it didn't make the wallet safer because it was coded wrongly. Who knows what else they did wrong that is yet to be discovered.",

Originally, I only intended to use Trezor as it has the most users and the most open-source nature. I came across various user reviews of hardware wallets on the website https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ , and found that Trezor had the most stolen customers (= 12). Although it is widely believed that users' responsibility led to these thefts, but a single mistake could wipe me out.

Firstly, forget about trustpilot and review sites like that in general. Don't believe what it says as it can very easily be fake. Secondly, what do you mean with 'stolen customers'? I feel like you are using google translate or something like that. Perhaps you are referring to complaints by 12 customers who lost funds/had them stolen. Again, that doesn't mean much. Most problems that lead to loss of funds are a result of user mistakes so I wouldn't worry about it.

Or if the app/wallet has a bug it wont matter anyway? I would always go for the wired connection instead of Bluetooth. Bluetooth connection can in theory be intercepted, but that's really not something the average person should worry about, unless someone targets you personally. The attacker would have to be close to you. 5, 10, 50 meters... It all depends on the type of Bluetooth device and connection. You are out of luck if the wallet has other vulnerabilities besides the faulty secure element implementation.",

Hopefully trezor will also release an air-gapped HW product.The ability to use a hardware wallet fully airgapped is only a benefit if the device has a large enough screen to clearly show you the entire contents of every QR code that you scan, and it's only a benefit if you have the discipline to always read it to make sure the text the device shows you (from the QR code) matches what you were expecting (from the transaction you're doing).Â  Otherwise, there's still potential for a hacker to hack the app you're using for the transaction - or worse, trick you into using a lookalike app.I'm not badmouthing airgapped hardware wallets though.Â  I'm a huge fan of a project called Krux, which is fully airgapped, stateless, uses encrypted seed QR codes, and has very active development (they've also won grants from OpenSats.Â  They're legit).In my experience, most of the people who jump from hardware wallet to hardware wallet care more about cool gadgets than they care about actual security (I'm not talking about people who test hardware wallets).Â  I wouldn't even consider a Bitbox.Â  Look how tiny that screen is.Â  The smaller the screen, the easier it is for you to make a mistake.For your needs, I would recommend a Trezor.Â  Their hardware wallets are fully open source and probably have the most eyes on the code, which means it's safe.Â  You don't even need the latest model.Â  Yeah, I know, the new model has a secure element chip, but as Ledger taught us all, keys can be extracted from a secure element chip (P.S. Don't buy a Ledger).Â  The use of secure element chips is mostly just marketing, because people who don't understand this stuff see that term and think it's what they want, because it uses the word secure.",
