The issue might be in your sim provider try other sims it might work or FTX 2fa SMS is currently not available in your country.Why not switch to the 2fa app instead because this SMS issue is known problematic compared to using the 2fa app?

They are contracting a 3rd party service to do it for them.If you are sending SMS all over the world it can get very expensive very quickly. So these 3rd party services have SMS gateways all over so it's more likely to be a lack text for them.The good side is that it saves these services money. The bad....you have no idea who is seeing / getting access to the codes. In a bubble it does not matter. In the real world if I have access I now know phone number 123456789 is getting texts from BTC exchnages.Hmmm I wonder if any of the data leaks have that number and a username / password.Or as others will keep telling you SMS is not secure, and as you are seeing. Not reliable.-Dave",

My primary exchange is binance for ding trading and other exchange which I use after binance is FTX. As far as i know FTX is one the most secure and good exchange. Any reason why you call this a  \"First Mistake\"  I don’t use KYC exchanges, so my objection to FTX is mainly that they are effectually anti-Bitcoin.  Its founder wants to shove the POS scam down all our throats.Mine is not a typical “Bitcoin maxi” position.  I used to respect Sam Bankman-Fried.  I disagreed with him about many issues, but I tend to respect highly intelligent people.  Moreover, I actually appreciated his promotion of defi—that will shock some of my friends; yes, really:  More permissionless!  No KYC!  More DEXes!  As a C coder who hates EthVM, I’ve had some fun writing on-chain programs on Solana, the SBF/FTX favoured chain.  Overall, I regarded SBF as a formidable financial shark who just might do something for the greater good—maybe.Then, I saw this:https://archive.ph/RN7Jo (Archival link to avoid paywall for https:// www. ft. com /content/02cad9b8-e2eb-43d4-8c18-2e9d34b443fe.)Quote from: FT.com (2022-05-16)[...]Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the digital asset exchange FTX, said the proof of work system of validating blockchain transactions, which underpins Bitcoin, is not capable of scaling up to cope with the millions of transactions that would be needed to make the crypto token an effective means of payment.[...]The 30-year-old billionaire, who has expanded FTX into one of the world’s largest virtual asset exchanges, said an alternative type of blockchain known as proof of stake, or other technological innovations, will be required to create a functional crypto payments network.(Why is it that they are all suddenly pushing in the same direction?)A few  years ago, I believed that POS was just a flawed consensus system that would obviously be favoured by whales.  But it is shaping up to be an attack on Bitcoin—an attack on Bitcoin’s freedom.  As I studied it and gained some experience with it, I also came better to understand how deep and deceptive the financial manipulation of POS really is.  It is intrinsically corrupt.  POS is plutocracy, a sham of fake-decentralization that centralizes everything under the control of the whales.All in all, although I will not categorically condemn all POS projects in absolute terms, anyone who tries to push POS into Bitcoin is attacking Bitcoin:  I will respond accordingly.SBF is also bringing to cryptocurrency bailouts and moral hazard, a concept implicitly deprecated by the message in Bitcoin’s genesis block.  Well, I guess that getting rekt in liquidation is only for the little people:  Corrupt whales who undermined the BTC market with giant scams get bailed out, so that they can do it again.If FTX is so incompetent with security that they offer SMS 2FA and then screw it up, maybe that’s an additional reason to avoid them.",

If so, then why is it not safe to keep all my bitcoin stash in there?Well, it is not safe to leave your funds in any centralized exchange, not even FTX.  The reason I said most secure is that the probability of FTX exchange to scam exit is less as compared to other small exchanges. but still, no one knows the future. I hope this is clear now.  But now if we want to trade, what are the options? The decentralized platforms do not offer many features possessed by the centralized platforms.So the only option left is to take the risk, keep a certain portion of our money in the FTX exchange, trade with that money, keep moving the profits out of the exchange, and hope that the exchange does not scam exit until we have funds stored with them",
