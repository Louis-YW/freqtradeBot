What a pity story Uche, it's not easy to live a life without dad and no one to sponsored your study or to feed yourself and you are very lucky to have such a good uncle who didn't left his brother family or throw back at them, you can see that life without a dad has lead many people into a bad way like joining a bad gangs or stealing just to have something to eat, and as you join this group is a good idea to know more about bitcoin.",

      "body": "According to G. Michael Hopf, \"Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.¬† OP, I think I have read a similar story before in a novel, but all the same, a lot of people did not make it on a plate of gold. The truth is that some people passed through a very difficult experience and labored very hard for a very long time before they could enjoy the fruits of their labor. You lost your dad; I'm sorry about that. You also have a good heart to have agreed to drop school for your younger ones to continue. I'm glad your uncle's help was worth it and you were able to share your story here.",

I would tell you something, every great man you have heard about passed through one challenge or the other and all this was a preparatory for them ahead of their task. Only God knows why you passed through that experience but I strongly believe you are stronger than you were while growing up as a child. ¬†But in all, you have to improve better so as to grow higher than you are now.

Alot of people have worse stories than what you have passed through and most times no one comes to help, even family members. But come your dad's younger brother did not know his brother passed away? Was he not communicating with you people until he cane back from abroad? Life is not fair and this is why those who have currently should not boast because they have and think others do not have because it is their sins that is preventing God from blessing them.",
