Crypto can adapt and evolve, and it will have to in order to stay relevant. And even if it falls to it's lowest, it will still be something of interest for enthusiasts.",

Bitcoin since its inception has seen a lot of scams, a lot of regulations & scrutiny. It has even seen levels much lower than the current levels. Remember we went to almost 3k in March 2020. So this level at which it currently hovers is definitely much higher than that level for sure. I think regulations might come and it could change the way in which bitcoin operates and the way in which people perceive bitcoin but it will not hamper the very existence of bitcoin for sure. Cryptocurrency is imminent now be it bitcoin or any other coin.",

This is a discounted price of bitcoin which you may never be able to see again! So if you think bitcoin is dead, you can sell off your holdings or give them to me. I will ensure to make a better use of it. I don't know how many times, but I have seen such posts multiple times where people have claimed bitcoin is dead. But here we are again discussing the same thing over and over again. Bitcoin is not dead! It can't be! It is just available at a discounted rate. Now it's up to you whether you want to make a better use out of it or leave it. I am personally accumulating more and more bitcoin as per my financial capacity. because bitcoin is a kind of asset which will someday give you the biggest return of your life!",

Huge scams : It already happened since many years ago, but it never made Bitcoin or crypto to be over.2. Increased security and regulation : Note that the security or regulation isn't intended to limit the activity of crypto investment or trading. It only facilitates people to be more secure in investment or trading.3. environmental concerns : Do you mean it is related to mining activity? Not everyone agrees about this, it is just a perception of some people. Even if mining is stopped, it doesn't mean stopping crypto world as well.Regarding the current drop in price, you must know we are in the bearish phase. So, it is normal if the price continues to decrease.",

The truth is, we are just starting to engage some newcomers as before crypto has a lot of negative connotations attach to it. People are just now understanding the benefits of blockchain tech as many are now educating themselves about the truth of this technology.",

I guess you forgot about all those ICO scams. At least more scrutiny and regulations means more business will be able to accept crypto currencies more easily with clear laws (though bad for decentralization, but as long as you don't interact with fiat or third party financial institutions, you should be fine).Quote from: SmallCapCoins on August 19, 2022, 06:58:23 PMAs of late, Bitcoin is trading at the lowest levels I've seen it trade in quite some time.-snip-The question is, due to any of these issues, or a combination of them, are we finally going to see the end of Bitcoin andCryptocurrency or is it still a safe haven?It is not the lowest level.

The point to notice is that crypto enthusiasts are dealing very well with issues and challenges. If someone told me the end of bitcoin was between 2017-2018, following the crash and the bearish market I would accept that as a real possibility, but now I just can't, because the scenario looks much better than before, despite the fact we are in a bearish market again.",

Because they know that cryptocurrencies have a long future.That's because you can't just say, \"My currency has been invaded by thugs\", that's how all coins are.And whatever happened to Three Arrows Capital is not relevant to decentralized cryptos. Because their very nature prevents them from going down if any single entity crashes.Just last month I received multiple emails from this platform called Vauld, that filed for bankruptcy - they apparently are insolvent (I don't remember how the hell I signed up for Vauld, but I never used it). Their reason? \"UST collapsed, we had too much UST, 3AC and Celsius also collapsed, and we loaned too much money that we can't recall.\"",
