  "content": "Inflation is quite a convoluted concept that involves money and currency, both objects that contains and retains its value because we believe so. It doesn't help that most economists provide lackluster explanations that doesn't really strike any thought towards the masses, the ones that should know most about this concept. So I took it upon myself to provide a bit of an explanation on what is inflation in economics, in hopes that this may one day help someone's economics homework (LOL) or at least shed light in this very confusing subject. For starters, unlike most economics teachers, we wouldn't use analogies, as those prove to cause even more confusion than help. We'll get straight to the point. Money has a value that we decided it should have, and that value always fluctuates depending on consensus when it is compared to different items or commodities, sometimes even different money. This isn't inflation. Inflation happens when the demand/supply equilibrium of money is disrupted through numerous causes. In simplest of examples, during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, USA printed out more money than they normally do, to make up for the sending of stimulus checks that the Americans can then use for purchase of important goods. And since supply of money is higher and not in balance with the supply of goods, its inherent value fell down. This is but one of the few reasons money could lose value over time, but it is best seen in that particular scenario.Feel free to chip in more information you are most willing to share within this thread, or better yet, tell me how you and your family is being affected by today's inflation rate!",

      "body": "There's two types of inflation also:One is set by money supply as you said, the other is determined by a rise in prices (the two are often used interchangeably but the first is hard to measure and normally doesn't get mentioned by the media).For example, the first type of inflation increased dramatically over the pandemic but the second wasn't noticed until much later (the prices of most things dropped at the start of the pandemic and continued to stay low throughout - this is also why the current inflation could be reported as being even higher than would have been expected if we just had a normal recession).The other thing to explain is WHY we have inflation and that's generally become harder to explain. It was initially thought that inflation would cause people to spend their money rather than holding onto it (which it does) but it also disproportionately affects those who work for their income compared to those who invest for it. If you invest for a stable income, workers pay you for the product (in dividends) and likely also pay you by buying similar stocks (in things like a pension). This means a lot of big investment funds are able to perform at 8-20% a year (matching US monetary inflation with the 8%), but workers don't normally see that sort of growth in their salaries.I left out the idea it promotes the economy to grow by giving a few % instead of a flatline when the economy is stable (for values like gdp) as there's a chance it'd just be measured in another currency that's inflation based if a country's currency was deflationary.",

The rate rises and fall but it is there. Whether money is printed more than the usual amount or not, inflation is there. Money is devalued little by little all the time. Prices of goods and services rise little by little all the time. Overprinting of money, as a matter of fact, isn't even the primary reason for inflation. The point is that inflation is there because it is intentionally designed so. Inflation is desired.",

Debt to GDP ratio is something that I would pay attention to, and to your point, the money printing in 2020 caused the debt to GDP ratio to fall out of reasonable proportion. Debt can be a great thing as long as the economy continues to grow. Unfortunately the U.S. economy is stagnating so reducing spending is essentially the only way debt will be reduced. High inflation reduces the value of the existing debt the U.S. has to repay, but it also would cause new incoming debt to be placed at a higher interest rate by the issuer. Obviously it isn't in the interest for the U.S. government to continually spend money and have their currency inflate, so they wouldn't attempt to keep up inflation rates for the sake of reducing their debt burden.",

Supply and demand can be absolutely artificial in nature (for example, speculation), and therefore do not display a real picture. For example, the same Bitcoin It's probably easier to explain - it's like a balance of the money supply of the state and an estimate of the GDP of this country. In this case it becomes clearer:- (A) The state (in total) produces some GDP. With an estimated value, let it be 1 trillion coins.- (B) State Bank, prints (issues) 1 trillion real coins.With this approach, there is no inflation.But if the balance of these indicators changes, then we have either INFLATION (A is less than B), or DEFLATION (A is more than B)This is domestic inflation/deflation. It, if A or B is violated, also gives currency inflation, since the balance between, for example, estimates of GDP in dollars does not change, but the mass of the local currency grows - we get not only INFLATION (domestic), but also devaluation of the local currency to \"indicative\" currencies .At the same time, a very delicate question is which is better - inflation or deflation? And at what volumes? And is it better?",

It doesn't help that most economists provide lackluster explanations that doesn't really strike any thought towards the masses, the ones that should know most about this concept. The increase in the price of goods and the money supply are both effects of inflation that will occur. Fundamental factors that influence the concept of inflation, through the interaction of supply, demand and exchange rates of international and local trading partners, although there are many other factors that can accelerate inflation, usually in these two areas inflation is more likely to occur.To suppress inflation, the biggest target is to stabilize these two things, this can be done jointly, both the government and individuals and groups.QuoteFor starters, unlike most economics teachers, we wouldn't use analogies, as those prove to cause even more confusion than help. We'll get straight to the point.At the heart of any inflation problem is the emphasis on more potential problems, if basic needs are materials that must be met, then every head of household should be able to buy as much as possible and store it according to need.The role of the government is also very important to reduce high prices to lower prices, by regulating the prices of basic needs in accordance with existing regulations in each country.QuoteMoney has a value that we decided it should have, and that value always fluctuates depending on consensus when it is compared to different items or commodities, sometimes even different money. This isn't inflation.The value of fiat currency will continue to change over time.A simple example that we can easily analogize, let's say you used to buy a motorcycle for $983.99, but in the next four or five years $983.99 is no longer enough to buy a motorcycle.This is what is called fiat currency going down and unable to maintain its value.If the currency value category is defined as inflation, then this factor can be referred to as the inflation base.QuoteInflation happens when the demand/supply equilibrium of money is disrupted through numerous causes. In simplest of examples, during the height of the COVID-19 PandemicMore precisely this is the law of supply and demand in the economic system.If supply and demand are not balanced, it is likely that the price of goods will soar higher than usual.When the Covid-19 Pandemic occurred, basic needs jumped so high, without anyone being able to control them, including government authorities in this case, the so-called supply and demand law did not run normally during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this did not only happen in the United States, but almost the whole world is feeling the effects.QuoteFeel free to chip in more information you are most willing to share within this thread, or better yet, tell me how you and your family is being affected by today's inflation rateIn general, the impact of inflation that occurs on families in the basic material fulfillment sector, almost most households will experience difficulties in meeting food ingredients when inflation occurs.Personally I have practiced rice storage during inflationary times which coincided with COVID-19, so the impact of inflation for me is not too big, although I can't completely control it, but to meet these needs I am not too worried and already in the category enough to stock up on a few time.Based on this description, every head of household should be able to make provision for basic needs, thus this sector can be suppressed and will return to normal.",
