Who says Blackrock would not screw the entire market over by pumping and dumping Bitcoin? My only advice is to hold on to your coin and avoid panic selling. Actually, from my experience, selling on any kind of reason is always a huge mistake.But the question remains of why are we so concerned about the current price of Bitcoin, which is liable to be manipulated by such huge institutional whales, instead of excited that Bitcoin still has an ocean of untapped potential. Anyone holding even half a Bitcoin is going to enjoy a nice life in the future.",

The supply is still intact in the wallet that owns the real Bitcoin. Because the company still thinks, this instrument is the same as their asset like a stock which I think is really different from others.",

I am never very supportive to the fact that the large corporates buying into bitcoin. It ends the decentralization effectively and ensure that the corporates control the crypto market. It is never an ideal situation. While corporate investment increases the liquidity in the market, but they get the power to control the market. Companies like Blackrock is here because they sniff profit. Think what will happen when these large corporations will start booking their profits!

During ICO all coins are in hands of DEVS and yet they collect hundreds of millions for few % of supply.2- satoshi never had 21 million bitcoins.

Let's conduct a hypothetical thought experiment: \"What if Bernard Arnault (LVMH) buys 2.625 Bitcoins than joins the religious Order 2.625 and continues to sell useless luxury for insane amounts of money?\" Let's delve into this scenario further. As a plebeian of Order 2.625, Bernard Arnault should be interested in the liquidation of the degen risk takers using exclusively Bitcoin. If Bernard Arnault chooses to liquidation of the degen risk takers using by selling them Birkin bags or expensive cognac, it goes against our Creed (84.9% Strategy). In such a case, the LVHM company could be immediately liquidated through clever manipulations by the Great Liquidators, who have control over all stock exchanges (let's assume BlackRock Company). Thus, it is more likely that someone as seemingly intelligent as Bernard Arnault would choose to adhere to the Creed (84.9% Strategy), causing the price of Birkin bags to drop from $66,666 to around $66, which is their fair price.",

Furthermore, the authors' positions seem to be at a mid- to senior-level, which further increases the likelihood of this paper being circulated internally. Hence, the findings presented in this paper are better suited for understanding the behavior of retail investors, as they typically have a significant portion of their personal wealth invested in Bitcoin and tend to be less risk-averse compared to institutional investors. Conversely, when considering institutional investors, it would be more reasonable to assume a relatively high level of risk aversion, leading to a Bitcoin allocation closer to 10% as suggested by the model, which seems to be a more plausible scenario.",

Your thought experiment about Satoshi keeping all Bitcoins is intriguing, however it oversimplifies cryptocurrency valuation processes.Since the total supply is strictly limited, and decentralization of supply is crucial to avoid market manipulation, the optimal strategy in this game for approximately eight million players (the ideal and unattainable outcome) is to possess exactly 2.625 Bitcoin and never sell (never rebalancing a portfilio).In any case, what is 2.625 Bitcoins at the current price?
