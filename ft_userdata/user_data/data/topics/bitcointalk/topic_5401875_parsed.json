      "body": "If you want to overclock/underclock your ASIC machines those firmware will work plus you can have a better feature like autotuning that could improve your miner's hashrate and efficiency.Only two OS are best and active here on the forum Braiins OS and ASIC.to firmware braiinsOS dev fee is 2.5% asic.to is 2.8% but they both have the same feature(Not all).If you want lesser dev fees then Braiins OS+ is the best choice and you can also get 0% pool fees if you mine directly to slushpool. But if you don't want to pay dev fees then stay with stock firmware.",

If you earn $38 for an s9 miner with OS like Braiins the 2% is around $0.76 or even other OS mentioned above are not so expensive except Hiveos which is $2 per month. But according to hiveos if you use HiveOn ASIC firmware than their HiveOS client it's free the $2/month is only for people who don't want to use their OS.",
