It was caused by a single, very risky ALTCOIN, where fundamentals of were not proven sufficiently. It was a weak Altcoin causing a huge crash. An Altcoin, where no link to Bitcoin's tech was around. Bitcoin and Altcoins are totally independent, still people are getting FUD and sell Bitcoin causing a crash. People should be aware for a similar situation: Bitcoin wasn't responsible for what happened, Bitcoin was safe, working as usual and as usually proven since Bitcoin was started. No need to sell Bitcoin. People need to learn to be wise and don't sell Bitcoin when different Altcoins are having techical problems. It will likely happen a lot more because we have a lot of shady Altcoins! A very good recommendation: don't sell Bitcoin when a different Altcoin crashes! After all, such crashes will only re- distribute coins from weak hands to strong hands (HODLers). To be succesful means to understand Bitcoin is independent from Altcoins and to understand HODL.",

Just look at the price today, slowly recovering and seeing $31,000 start of the week. So now we are in a good direction and probably the shitcoin that causes this wipeout can't bounce back again. But Bitcoin? it will, so resilient from this kind of attacks that the effect of the flash crash is for short term only.",

The reason people sold Bitcoin is because they knew that guy had moved $1.5B and that is when the sell off started.

This is not the first time though, we've seen Tether de-peg and it did affect the price but in short term only.Lesson here is that as much as the Terra Luna or any other stable coin for that matter had a impact on the price movement, maybe because of panic selling or any other reasons, bitcoin will still go and continue to perform better in the future.",

If Terra (LUNA) falling down has any effect on Bitcoin, it should be net positive rather than negative. LUNA falling down could mean much of the funds coming from LUNA might be moving to Bitcoin. There is heavy selling on LUNA and if investors are looking for a safer exit, they would be directed towards Bitcoin. Also the falling price of Bitcoin has already been happening even before the LUNA fiasco took place. There must be another reason why Bitcoin is in its current bear phase.",
