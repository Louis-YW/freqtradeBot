I really hope in the next coming months we don't see many topics where it's saying exchange x seized my bitcoin or service x seized the bitcoin deposit because they found I mixed my coin with Chipmixer. I don't think there are not many people who care about their privacy but never used Chipmixer. It's a big blow for all of us.",

Just only the most straightforward examples.some services tried to keep the coins earlier (before this closing of ChipMixer) because they came from the mixer. All are under the umbrella of the AML fight. For example, read this thread and watch account fixedfloat statements as representative of one exchanger.",

Monero will protect his identity.It could be done via P2P, like on Bisq or any other platform providing P2P services. Your friend could also imagine to cash out his BTC from an ATM, and buy again BTC with this cash from an other ATM.In this second scenario the fees would be more important.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on March 19, 2023, 09:47:55 AMAre there any complaints about closing KYCed accounts, tax reports or problems that resulted from depositing ChipMixer mixed coins? Specifically after ChipMixer.com has been seized.Most of the regulated CEX (even each one I guess) would mark your account in a SAR form once they have access of the Chipmixer's addresses. Most of them probably already own a list, we could imagine that Chainanalysis for example is proactively working on it, if it is not already done of course.Depending on your past activity on the CEX, the amounts and the frenquency of your exchanges, you could be blocked, asked for Source of funds documents, and for more explanations. In some cases funds could be seized, it already happened in the past",

No, because all of his txs will be identifiable easily by on-chain analysts I think as there are a lot of different criteria, and clues they use. Well, I'm saying this in general, not necessarily applied to OP.@OP, I have deposited ChipMixer chips in a centralized exchange and I got no problem so far. That was to break the link of my personal saving wallet/cold wallet. For no other purposes I used mixer though",

Well, I'm saying this in general, not necessarily applied to OP.I believe that an exchange will not make a complex on-chain analysis/investigation on every user. They will just look a few transactions back (at most) looking for \"tainted\" addresses.if you look coins whole history you will see that a lot of coins have been in a mixer or casino at some time, so they must put some kind of limit to their search. Like the past 2-3 transactions.There is a good video by Andreas Antonopoulos about it:Bitcoin Q&A: Blacklists, Taint, and Wallet Fingerprintinghttps://youtu.be/BILcJ3WtdLQ?t=195He explain exactly that, there is a limit in transactions (hops) which the exchange is going to look back.",

Scammy instant exchanges that can't wait for a second to fleece a user by inventing all kinds of stories, that's a different thing and I would advise anyone to avoid them completely.",

Specifically after ChipMixer.com has been seized.- YamaneSo far there is none because its too early to tell, their concern now is catching the owner of Chipmixer he'll have to testify or the authorities makes him spill out about the data that they've seized, while you have the time you can transfer it to wallets that you own or trade it from one exchange to another so if ever the coins will be disassociated to the mixer, and as long as you are not a hacker or a scammer and for a legal reason you want your coins to be private there's nothing to worry about.The authorities will probably go for big-time scammers and hackers not for small fish because this is part of the main reason why they seize Chipmixer.",

Specifically after ChipMixer.com has been seized.- YamaneYour friend doesn't necessarily need to use regulated entities like centralized exchanges to sell their bitcoin. They can contact people in the local area and ask them if they would like to participate in peer-to-peer exchanges involving real goods and decentralized digital currency. Moreover, it may well be that by the time your friend decides to get rid of some part of bitcoin holdings, bitcoin will have already achieved the status of globally-accepted currency, which means all people around will be aware of bitcoin and willing to accept it in exchanges without problems. They won't be asking your friend about the source of funds because globally adopted currencies are by default interchangeable and fungible, which means coins from seized ChipMixer will be no different from coins sold by the US government.",
