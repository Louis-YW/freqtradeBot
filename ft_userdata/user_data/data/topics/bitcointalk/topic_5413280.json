  "content": "This topic is borne out of the pain I feel when I hear/read that the rich are better than the poor. I have met with a lot of poor people, and I could feel their pains and destiny wastage as their knowledge, wisdom and dreams are being chattered due to the lack of resources and opportunities around them, not due to their mindset. Not that these people are foolish, lazy, not energetic or time conscious, but many are just unlucky with the country or environment they find themselves. Even many of the so-called rich people extract their ideas and successes from the poor, only to take the glory, honour and riches, which is the most painful part.For this misconception (at least to me), I concluded to put this piece together so that I can read an honest opinion directly from you people. Correct me if I am wrong; the poor is better than the rich, only that they are not privileged.Below are the excerpts from the OP I'm rebutting and the reply I gave to this misconception implanted in many by the so-called motivational speakers as far as I'm concerned:\"The OP has totally crucified the poor just for being poor, perhaps he/she has read/watched a lot of the articles or videos by these motivational speakers. Their sayings appear not to be particularly true in many cases.Let me take your point one after the other to show my support and opposition to them.Your point: The rich believe that money makes money.My opinion: The poor also believe so, but they are not privileged.Your point: Rich people make money work for them.My opinion: Poor people are doing the same too with the little they have.Your point: Rich people spend on necessities and what is needed not what is desired.My opinion: The poor people are more prudent than the rich because they have limited resources.Your point: Rich people think of a long-term goals but poor people set at best short-term goals or none.My opinion: I agree here because impatience is there for the poor because their wants/needs can't wait that long.Your point: Rich people tend to be risk takers but poor person is more likely to be risk averse.My opinion: Very true, the rich have calmness in risk-taking because they have more money, insurance cover and rich friends/families to run to in case it boomerangs. But the poor will always fear losing the little they have because no extra money, insurance or friends to run to.Your point: Rich people are eager to learn but poor people are not eager to learn.My opinion: I disagree with you, poor people also learn, it is evident around you my friend. They even learn under unfriendly conditions compared to rich people. Just a piece of evidence that they learn, they are used as skilled labour in every facet of life by the so-called rich. Do you think they can fit in if they did not learn?Conclusively, there is a lot of nonsense going on online that the rich have it better in terms of timing, management, expertise and all that. But I will always disagree with most. The only peculiarity is that the rich have money and privileges, which is why it seems as if they know and do better. Many poor people are better than the rich in terms of many things but are only unfortunate that they are poor, especially when they find themselves in a very bad country. While some lucky ones still find their way to the top, and some rich people become poor due to mismanagement.\"The link to the original post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411835.msg60925934#msg60925934",

Many poor people are better than the rich in terms of many things but are only fortunate that they are poor, especially when they find themselves in a very bad country.I wouldn't want to pick each point and respond to them individually, but they all have a lot of generalization. You can't lump up the rich or poor into any character description or mindset. They all have individuals in both brackets which are on opposite ends of different spectrums;• There are bums, who were born into wealth and built on privilege, • There are people who were not and created wealth for themselves, • There are yet those who were born into wealth and worked had to expand on that, with the privileges available to them,• There are also those who were not privileged and did not develop a winning mentality and remained in an unfavorable situation.Saying \"many\" poor people are better than the rich is also a hasty generalization. What constitutes \"better\" and how does one's financial situation make them better than the other?Quote from: EarnOnVictor on September 12, 2022, 02:31:55 PMWhile some lucky ones still find their way to the top, and some rich people become poor due to mismanagement.Getting rich is not luck, or is barely 5% luck. There are lots of mindset and character factors that go into play. We shouldn't downplay that, to try to make some demographic or ourselves feel better.",

      "body": "Discussing the comparison between rich and poor people's mindsets and how they managed things can be quite hard as it will truly depend on the personality, strategy, and even hard work of each individual. You can say that poor people have great ideas but have limited resources to fulfill them however they can strategize and ask for help or even crowdfund their idea. On the other hand, rich people can also have great ideas and a lot of resources to fulfill but with a lack of strategy, it might still fail in the long run.Both \"Poor\" and \"Rich\" Mindset cannot be compared as both can be the same and produce similar or different outcomes.",

They're less likely to make money \"work\" for them by engaging in passive revenue or dividend or interest based gains.2.  In my experience the poverty demographic is the least disciplined and most impulsive in their investment and financial strategies. 3.  Do they learn? The poverty income bracket is the most disadvantaged demographic in terms of education and learning. AFAIK it has always been that way throughout history.",

Can you be specific ? ( Knowledge bout education? Money ? ) Not picking on you in the slightest way here.Just as you have concluded, it's all for the poor to bring his/her ideas and dream's to reality. OP, dream's come to reality you know, it takes a lot of work, discipline, passion and consistency. One can't skip all of this. You have to take Bold steps to bring those dreams and positive mindset to Real life.",

For example, I will tell you a story from my country. A poor family with several minor children is engaged in the sale of products that are given to them to sell by more affluent people. So their children are completely deprived of an education. They forbade them to go to school, explaining that helping the family at the moment is more useful than expanding the horizons of children. Children are deprived of the Internet and all the other things that ordinary children have. They are far behind in development. If parents wanted a different life for their children, they would probably give them a chance. But the future for children will be exactly the same. They will sell other people's vegetables and receive a very small percentage in return. There is not a single chance to get out of poverty for such people. And if we compare people who understand the value of education, they will first invest all the money in the development of their child, thereby building his future.",

Any chance that lower income people get to save money is often overridden by immediate demands which will wipe out smaller saving pots that might have taken a long time to accrue. There is also the idea that it is expensive to be poor. People on higher incomes might spend $250 on a pair of work shoes that last three years, as opposed to those with less income who are forced to spend $100 every 9 months because they wear out a cheaper version much quicker.",
