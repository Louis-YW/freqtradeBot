  "content": "EtherFlow Faucet Script IntroductionSupports any EVM / Ethereum like blockchains such BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom, ETC.Faucets are web services that dispense small amounts of cryptocurrency for free, primarily for testing purposes. The Ethereum faucet script presented here is a simple yet effective tool that aids developers and testers by providing test ether to specified Ethereum addresses. Let's break down the key features and characteristics of this script:1. Direct RPC Operations:- The faucet operates directly via Geth RPC, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. This direct approach ensures swift transactions and complete control over the dispensing process.2. Web-based Interface:- Users can easily request test ether by entering their Ethereum address into a web form.   3. File-based Storage:- The script uses a file-based storage system as opposed to traditional databases.- Each Ethereum address has its dedicated folder, ensuring organized data storage and easy retrieval.- Claim data, comprising the Ethereum address, IP address, and timestamp of the claim, is stored in a file inside the respective address folder. This arrangement simplifies monitoring and limits abuses.4. Google reCAPTCHA Integration:- To deter automated bots and prevent spam, the script integrates Google's reCAPTCHA. Users must verify themselves before making a claim.5. Claim Limitations:- To maintain fairness and prevent misuse, users can claim test ether only once every 24 hours. This restriction is based on both the Ethereum address and the user's IP address.6. Modularity and Security:- Designed with modularity in mind, the script can be expanded or integrated into broader platforms easily.- Proper file permissions and storage practices have been implemented to safeguard user data.7. Minimal Dependencies:- With no reliance on external databases or extensive libraries, the faucet remains lightweight and straightforward to set up.Offering a seamless blend of efficiency and direct control, this Ethereum faucet script is an indispensable tool for any Ethereum test environment. Whether you're a developer, tester, or an enthusiast, this script ensures direct and hassle-free access to test ether.",
