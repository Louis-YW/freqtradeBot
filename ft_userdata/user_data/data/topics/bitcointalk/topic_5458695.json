  "content": "Procrastination which is said to be the act of delaying something important despite knowing the consequences of doing so, is one of the reasons why many people miss out on big opportunities. I've had conversations with several individuals and I found out that most them are fully aware of the benefits of cryptocurrency at large but are still having doubts or would I rather say the fear of the unknown due to the unstable price of bitcoin, they focus more on the negative side or losing or fear of losing out completely other than the benefits of investing in bitcoin, there are others who are willing to take a bold step but have little knowledge or need guidance from crypto enthusiasts, i have an information for these set of people because knowledge they say is power and constant education and information would enable people to fast track the adoption of bitcoin and enjoy it's benefits.  In the crypto ecosystem there's something called the crypto solar eclipse also known as the bitcoin halving. Bitcoin Halving- The bitcoin halving is a period when the price of bitcoin goes high, due to it's scarcity because of the drastical removal of bitcoin in a block. And it happens every four years circle and many people are not aware of this ongoing in the crypto space, the previous halving was in (2020) and the next halving is forthcoming  so now is the best time to purchase and hodl btc because it could go beyond the price it attained in the last halving which was about $60k and In my opinion I think it might go beyond $100k. https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769 This forthcoming halving is very important very important because at this period the price of bitcoin affects most other cryptocurrencies in the market, so now is the best and perfect time to buy and hodl cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin and make profits when it becomes more scarce thereby making it's value to go High.  You can share your ideas and opinions if you know more about the bitcoin halving and for the procrastinators, it's better late than never.",

You're on the right track so keep doing what you do. OP should have added a disclaimer that explicitly stating this. There's difference between having the financial capacity to acquire Bitcoin but fail to do so and not havinf the financial capacity but really want to do so? I saw bitcoin at the $500 prices (per bitcoin) but I was unable to buy anyone simply because I didn't have money at that time and I was just on verge of finishing high school so I had no way to get investment budget.

At the same time, some are too hasty, and one news story about a profitable business is enough for them to dive into investments without checking whether they are ready for them. There is always a need for a golden mean, where the heart and mind speak in time, increasing investments, understanding all the risks, and at the same time ensuring the accumulation of knowledge about how much and where you invest.",

So let us stop procrastinating and do what we know will bring us great benefits.  But if I may say what bring about the mentality of many People's postponing their investment in bitcoin despite their awareness of the halving period, I may say that is a lack of proper understanding of the cryptocurrency market. The fear may be in them that maybe the bull run will not happen, but I see all that as a lack of proper knowledge of cryptocurrency or lack of enough money.",

This is not a wrong procrastination, but is the strategy of each investor in an effort to get a good return while minimizing risk.But in reality, buying bitcoin at any price for a long term investment is fine. But the problem is, when they expect the price of bitcoin to fall at a price that is very unlikely to happen. Those who expected bitcoin to drop to $10k last year must have regretted their decision, of course after the bitcoin price recovers above the current $30k price. Procrastinating isn't always wrong, but sometimes their decisions don't make sense when on the one hand they expect long-term benefits. Even if they are afraid of falling prices, then DCA is a wise strategy to consider.",

If you remember bitcoin's price at the start of the year was at $16500, and now it's $30,440. So, if a panic hit the market before the halving we could see it going down to $20k. And to be clear, this is just speculation, but the point is, it isn't a wise move to buy at the moment when Bitcoin is at its highest price in 2023.We must play it smart and don't be impulsive, let's wait for the right wave to ride it.",

You have plenty of time to buy before prices start to rapidly rise after the halving.I don't know if I'm wrong but I think one of the reasons why people are not buying bitcoin  this period is because they don't have the money to buy it and sure everyone who knows  about bitcoin  already believes that bitcoin  should be expecting an all time high after all this mess and I personally fall into the class of people who have barely  have investment or any hodling right now.So outside procrastination,  I think lack of money to buy is one of the major reason contributing to why people aren't buying and investing in it right now because most persons are barely making ends meet and maybe their earnings isn't even meeting up giving them a normal life and how to you expect  such a person to invest?",

You can still invest when Bitcoin is at $30k and I'm confident that in the future, especially after the next halving we will witness a new ATH for Bitcoin, and probably surpassing $100K$.",

However, it's important to understand that not everyone in the world is motivated solely by the desire to profit from Bitcoin. Each individual has their own priorities and commitments, which may take precedence over investing. Not everyone will actively pursue Bitcoin. Even those who are familiar with Bitcoin sometimes fail to seize opportunities. We tend to wait for further price declines during market downturns, and when prices rise, we wait for a dip to accumulate more, inadvertently causing us to miss out on potential opportunities.",

The math proves otherwise because if you bought Bitcoin in June and sold now in July, you would've made about 20% in profit just from a single month of holding, which outperforms everything else, like stocks, bonds, gold, and so on. Saying that bitcoin is dead is just dumb and Gensler is 1 guy with a jurisdiction over stocks in a single country. He's not going to be in that chair forever and he's already getting sued left and right for not being objective. Personally, I can only laugh at this because I've been stacking sats for the last 12 months.",

Our position as supporters and their position (the SEC) as regulators (may actually resist). So it seems that it's a natural nature that will continue to exist under any conditions. The SEC as an official agency that has regulatory authority, has the right to do anything. But we as supporters also have the right to do anything with a record of not breaking the rules. This is because we live in a large group that has rules made by the government within the state. So this kind of problem problem will continue. Hopefully the SEC is indeed independent and has good intentions, not on money.  IMO",
