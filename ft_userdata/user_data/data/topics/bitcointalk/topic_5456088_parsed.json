      "body": "people are often afraid of such unlocks, but history shows that they are mostly unfounded. If the project fundaments are still there and the project is not dead, the unlock shouldn't affect the price significantly. It was the same with ETH and unlocking staking coins. A lot of people were afraid of it, and on the day of unlocking the price increased instead of falling. This was due to the fact that many more people were selling earlier in the hope of buying back cheaper after unlocking. Their demand after unlocking exceeded the supply of unlocked coins. But fundaments must be there and should be stronger than the moment coins were locked.",

What do you mean by saying it would leave bad impact on price, i will like to inform you that this can only be what will happen within the token itself and not affecting other cryptocurrencies price, secondly i will like to give a strong warnig from investing on memecoins or tokens not enlisted, they may just be there to trigger us through their hype for their investment which is why we need to make careful resea before investing on any going getting unlocked or newly introduced.",

Not only people preparing for the unlock to sell before the potential crash, but people who get the airdrop will sell immediately just to get something for free. As this can still go down a lot and everyone knows it.And this is even without counting in the current overall crypto market sentiment. Alts are bleeding and times are uncertain for the whole crypto scene. This could be the best time to invest if you think you should buy when fear is most but there are more things happening that will cause more fud. Like new regulatory legislation that's going to happen in full force. People are just now focused on CEX attack and seem to be blind to anything else. So i guess they are not prepared for what's coming. MICA is coming",

Bottom after bottom, this unlocked seems got bad effects to the Blur token.If you trust the project, then buying now is an excellent option, because the price will rebound to the nearest point, which is at half a dollar, and then it is a good gain for the short term, otherwise consider it a loss and that the value of that token is zero, and something may happen in the future.unlocked is the false price tax which was about 0.8.",

Everyone knows it can drop a lot from here, so why not sell and get something.Remember IMX and GODS airdrop? I sold gods in $5 which was near all time low at the time. So was it low and absurd to sell too or was it having a perspective on over priced valuation? As now GODS is $0.12IMX i sold little under $5 which seemed like a bad price at the time. I just saw it over priced, and now it's $0.62.It's not always about having some pocket money. People have made a lot of money selling BLUR and it's still quite high in the marketcap considering that it doesn't have an interesting or attractive useful use case that i can see.",

These restrictions can limit the supply of circulating tokens and it affects the prices once the lockup period expires and the tokens become unlocked. So the user can sell the tokens and buy back from the dip. Then you can get more tokens than just holding the tokens.",
