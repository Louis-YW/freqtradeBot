I think the main concern here is the site belongs to China, I don't think if it would have belonged to anyone else like some local then they would have taken this step. No offense but just a thought, although if that site is gaining some kind of information about the base and the authority is raising national security concerns.Then no one can stop them from make Chinese to leave the place. I think they should comply, but government should give them another spot for mining, so they could continue there business. Giving them 120 days is a lesser time in my opinion. My words might not be liked by US citizens, but I only meant to say they should give them some relaxation too if they just suspect them, as if the MineOne is really sharing some kind of information then they should take action on the basis of proof otherwise such actions are so obvious.",

To a far extent, the US government are right in they decision to move the mining farm away from a military base, this is not debatable at all since it matters of security intelligence.Having a military based and a bitcoin mining farm in the same location will lead to a more severe security challenge in the future, so it better to prevent that from happening as soon as possible, this is not about the United States government and Chinese government.",

They aren't necessarily trespassing because they legally acquired that property, but the state can of course invoke national security as a valid reason to demand that they leave the place. Whether this ends well with the Chinese or not isn't the point. The point is that this is a Chinese-owned private company in a highly strategic location as far as national security of the entire country is concerned. I'm not necessarily a fan of Biden but a sitting president can't compromise national security.",

The weather balloon that was actually a spying device should probably be enough answer to this one, China's been upping their espionage game lately so I'm not really sure that we should be too lenient when it comes to this kind of things, better safe than sorry especially with ICBMs caches at stake, I'd rather be paranoid and awesome that everyone's trying to spy on me than be relaxed and then know later that there's someone rogue that's also in control of those world ending weapons.",

Nevertheless, there are still a lot of miner farms across the globe that can cover so the effect might not be felt and there could be no impact to the price itself.Really hard to comment on the repercussions or what is the motive by the Biden administration but it's obvious it is political. And this is not the first case though, there are many countries now specially in the South east Asia that there are suspicions that China is trying to insert someone in the government and thought to be sleeper agent.

I don't see its attack of crypto currency miners but maybe they see it as national threat since they always think that they have bad blood with chinese government and US government just avoiding the possibilities that there are spying activities happening hiding in that industry. Remember what US government actions made on Huawei? They are been accused as a security risk of their country that's why expect some actions made if they see any Chinese related activities happening in their country. Maybe US is just avoiding some consequences that Chinese government to find weakness on their national security. But Hopefully it cannot also affect the whole crypto industry since its unfortunate if they totally erase all crypto mining activities and disallow them to operate in their country.",
