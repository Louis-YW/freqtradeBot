In order to increase your receiving capacity you need to spend funds from your channel first. If you don't want to pay fees for that thing, you can send your funds to an exchange accepting LN deposits like Kraken or Bitfinex or another platform. And then withdraw your BTCs on chain once you have accumulated a bit of them there in order to avoid paying too much withdrawal fees at the end, you can also withdraw them to another LN channel you need to top up sending capacity.",

(seen as the percentage in the lightning icon)You can also try directly swapping through Boltz website and see if there's a difference: boltz.exchangeIt's the same service as Electrum's swap feature.",

I tried an open channel with Trampoline and Local routing (gossip). As shown in the following screenshot:For the \"No path found\" error issue, maybe the following link can be an additional reference for information: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7291.",
