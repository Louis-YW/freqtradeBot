      "body": "The greater impact it will do have is the fact that its features or pack purchase will become smooth than before. The countries that would enjoy this benefits would be the third world countries that do not have store to access this games and with bitcoin the hassle having to transfer from one currency to another which is discouraging would actually be eliminated. They’re by making it a swift and easier transaction process which could also lure in more players into the game since it was the lack of availability that caused the low number in these parts. The other thing could be price. 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin and as such a fixed price for the games and probably it consoles will make it easier for the gamer to know the exact amount in bitcoin they would be getting the game and not necessarily be disturbed about the rate  of their currency to the country’s currency where the game would be purchased. With bitcoin some gamers would even buy the coins at a period where it is low and keep it in there wallets till the period where the game feature or pack will be available for purchase",
