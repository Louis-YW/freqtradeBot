Though with mixers we put an explicit condition to the platform not to send out the same coins you gave them to avoid money being traced back to you if privacy is your concern, unlike normal exchanges might send you your own coins as they don't offer the extra privacy feature.Quote from: dwarren on November 13, 2023, 02:25:10 PMOnce it has been converted to XMR, it is private correct?Just wanted to compare the pros and cons to both methods.Thanks.When it comes to mixers vs XMR both will give you a world of privacy and these are recommended mediums to use for privacy-conscious minds.",

When you swap your coin on any exchange that is centralized, you must have done a KYC before they allow you to do that, no documentation no use of the exchange and when you are verified on any exchange after provision of documents, you don't have any privacy to protect any more.But if you use a decentralized mixer to swap your btc to xmr, you have increased your privacy for using the centralized exchanges and addition swapping to xmr is highly a privacy protected coin and this is the reason why some countries hate to see their people use xmr because it is difficult to crack but doing it in a kyc centralized exchange is as if you protecting nothing.Using a mixer is good though if you have bought a bitcoin from centralized exchanges because when you withdraw bitcoin from exchanges, the explorer usually tick it with exchange name as the source of the fund, mixing it will clean that and it will become untraceable depend on the mixing service you use.",

E.g of a Bitcoin mixer is Sinbad.ioQuoteOnce it has been converted to XMR, it is private correct?No.. Using a Bitcoin makes your transactions more private than mere converting to Monero (XMR)",

When introducing XMR in the equation, you're most likely going to receive better levels of anonymity. The reasons why you might want to use a mixer over XMR swap are: comfort and pricing. Quote from: dwarren on November 13, 2023, 02:25:10 PMOnce it has been converted to XMR, it is private correct?Correct. If you run a Bitcoin full node, a Monero full node and make the exchange through Bisq, then you're achieving the highest levels of privacy there are.",

But in both scenarios, you become traceable again in the moment when you decide to sell your coins because for that you need an exchange.",

As mixing can be done there too but in mixer's case even after choosing one mixer that suits you best, you don't know either you are getting the level of privacy that the mixer has promised.

I think any mixers that still promoted in this forum is safe enough, the user can choose which one he prefer. I don't think there's a decentralized mixer, I guess you meant CoinJoin.",
