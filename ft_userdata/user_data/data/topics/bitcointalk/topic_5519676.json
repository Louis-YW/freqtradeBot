Maybe he want to use the Post to gain more followers from social media, so that people will begin to see him as a friend to Satoshi   which is not true, I have heard so many from some people in the social media claiming to be Satoshi, but they failed at the end to prove to people he is the real Satoshi, but I have never hear this one claiming to met Satoshi 1993, and it sound funny to me, how did him know that the Satoshi he met some years ago is the founder of bitcoin, if not that he is trying to deceive his followers to make some funds from them.",

To grow there followsThey know very well that if they say such thing some people will start following them and that is because some people feels anyone close to Satoshi Nakamoto or working with him on Bitcoin creation will be very important in the world of cryptocurrency, however what some people has failed to understand is that Bitcoin is a decentralized coin and there's no way the number of Bitcoin can add more than the original number it was and so people who are claiming to be close to Satoshi Nakamoto has nothing to offer them and following such people won't be of any benefit.If they have gotten the followers they want they will be using there page for content and making money out of it.2. To scam people.Some people uses this strategy of being close to Satoshi Nakamoto or working with him on Bitcoin creation to scam people, those that believe them will reach out to them and when they do they bring up strategy that they will use to defraud them.I heard of something like this some time ago where a man came out and started telling people he worked with Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin and they are about working on another project and a lot of people were scammed of there money.People should be guided in other to avoid being used by other people.",

      "body": "Another Joseph maybe? Here's another one where he claimed Satoshi revealed Bitcoin price to him. Although the article is about two months old, it still tells us a thing or two about the guy and I'm not surprised that this sorta thing is happening. He's an ex professional basketball player and when you no longer ball, you'd have to find a way to remain relevant in the social space so aside from him delving into NFTs that didn't favor him and switching to creating his own meme coin that still didn't have promise, I think the next best thing was to use to popular phrase \"I've met Satoshi\". Only, this one sounds a little delulu when he stated he was told the price at which Bitcoin would be on Nov 5, by Satoshi himself in a dream.",

For me, when people put out unverifiable claims like this because it raises lots of red flags. If he can’t provide solid evidence then it’s probably just another conspiracy.

Everything happened just through such discussions. It's nothing more than creating tension between others or us.And I think it's impossible to find Satoshi. If it was possible, then all these years wouldn't have passed like this. He could have been found inside. But since he couldn't be found, it can be said that he can't be found anymore.",
