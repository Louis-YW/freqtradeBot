At the moment I dont think knowing Satoshi would be that interesting especially since the claim of holding 1 million bitcoin looks invalid. Saying Satoshi is a poor guy is never true with your premises, inventions in IT are not easy and cheap especially in 20th century. Bitcoin was described as a PhD project, after it, many marketing process followed into making it known which I dont think is cheap as well",

Imagine take 2 hours+ for a build to find a bug, fix it and take more 2 hours+ to rebuild... Building C/C++ sources with old CPUs wasn't like nowadays, it takes ages for compile and link! Nick Szabo would have resources for test it with Vista, and probably MacOS and all Linux flavors, even if not his own hardware, as he works with universities.This also give Bitcoin the aura of being created by a common person, \"for the people, by the people\".Though yes, I keep respecting his privacy, if that's his wish, yet from all the stories I read about the attempts to get his identity or people coming forward claiming to be him, that story was the only one I can give some credit.",
