They are able to poison your transfer history, which means that they copy the first 5 and the last 5 digits of the address you recently sent crypto to.But they change everything in the middle and they make their own address this way. Their new address is listed in your transfer history, replacing your genuine history (How can Ledger let this happen??) So you copy paste the address, thinking you are transfering to your friend but you transfer directly to the scammer. The fact that this is possible, scares the hell out of me and really makes me question the capability of ledger as a company.This one here lets you enter all the details of a transaction in the live app. And then when you check the ledger, the amount displays your full account of that token. You think it is just displaying your full balance, but if you confirm the transaction it sends your full account to a different address (of the hacker) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwLyvZR1KCIYou can also receive spam in Ledger Live (app), which looks totally innocent. But if you click on it, your entire account is drained.Or they can make transactions appear in Ledger live, that never happened. Or contact you as being Ledger Live support when they are not.If you have any other experience with hacks, please let me know.Isn't a company like Binance more financially capable of protecting themselves against professional hackers? I think they just have more funds than Ledger. I am not convinced that it is safe to leave my funds there.",

Ledger is only a company that sells you a device - their hardware wallet - which makes you able to receive/sent cryptocurrency.

      "body": "This has nothing to do with Ledger, their company or their device.This is a social engineering attack. Something you fall for if you don't know what you're doing and isn't careful enough. To fall for it, you need to copy an address from the block explorer thinking it's your friends' (why would you do that?), send coins there AND manually physically accept the transaction on your device. If you do this = your OWN fault.Also, this is the same if you're using Ledger, Trezor, Electrum, Metamask, whatever... name a wallet, social engineering attacks are possible with literally every single one of them.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 18, 2023, 10:10:54 PMBut they change everything in the middle and they make their own address this way. So you copy paste the address, thinking you are transfering to your friend but you transfer directly to the scammer. The fact that this is possible, scares the hell out of me and really makes me question the capability of ledger as a company.Very easy not to fall for this: just copy the address directly from your friend and verify it. No issues at all. What you're scared about is someone not checking the address they're sending to. Just do not do this and check the address (besides not copying the address from a random transaction on a block explorer).Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 18, 2023, 10:10:54 PMThis one here lets you enter all the details of a transaction in the live app. And then when you check the ledger, the amount displays your full account of that token.

A malware or a fake Ledger Live can prompt you to accept a transaction that has been altered, but if you do not accept it physically on the device, the transaction will NOT be made and your coins will be safe.The hardware holds the private-keys for your wallets and is responsible for signing your transaction. This is literally the purpose of having a hardware wallets and what makes it different from a regular web/desktop-based wallet.This is why verifying your transactions ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN is so important. Do not confirm any transaction before checking the address and amount. And actually verify it!

By default you shouldn't trust strangers on the Internet, let alone having them \"supervising\" such operations. The process that you fear to do alone since it is your first time is nothing too complex that you can't understand or even do by your own. I've tried searching YouTube for a video - max duration 5 minutes - that could explain you the steps you need to recreate in order to make the first transactions and I've found this one[1].The video is simply to understand and reflects o_e_l_e_o summarized steps. If you are still unsure you can always come back here and ask whatever questions trouble you and surely someone will help you out.[1]https://youtu.be/9skbU7ICKjY?t=98",

It's a social engineering scheme that fools those who don't know better.     Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 18, 2023, 10:10:54 PMApparently scammers can get a hold of the latest addresses you have sent funds to. Bitcoin uses a public ledger. The same is true for the networks that were the primary targets of address poisoning schemes, like Tron, BSC, Ethereum, etc. All transaction history is public and anyone can see the transactions that got confirmed on the networks. That's not a mystery, it's the way public blockchains work.  Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 18, 2023, 10:10:54 PMThey are able to poison your transfer history, which means that they copy the first 5 and the last 5 digits of the address you recently sent crypto to.But they change everything in the middle and they make their own address this way. Their new address is listed in your transfer history, replacing your genuine history (How can Ledger let this happen??) So you copy paste the address, thinking you are transfering to your friend but you transfer directly to the scammer. That's not true. It doesn't replace your history. The history is there and recorded on the blockchain. It adds a new entry which will logically land on the top. If I send you a PM, my PM will appear above the ones you received yesterday and last month, wouldn't it? It would be the most recent entry in your PM folder. But my PM doesn't replace the other ones. If you make a mistake and send me some sensitive information that were meant for someone else, that's your fault and nobody else's. When I post this message, it will be the newest post in your thread, but it doesn't replace the older posts.  Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 18, 2023, 10:10:54 PMThe fact that this is possible, scares the hell out of me and really makes me question the capability of ledger as a company. It should scare the hell out of you because you don't know how to send and receive crypto properly. You need to question your own capabilities of owning and holding bitcoin. Ledger gave you the proper tools, your lack of understanding and knowledge about how to use them is not their fault.

Any similar device can be technically almost perfect, but in the wrong hands and with the wrong understanding, it is actually worth nothing.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 23, 2023, 01:40:09 PMThey seem to get more creative.This video here is about a crypto millionaire who lost a significant amount of coins because of address poisoning, recently. Apparently scammers can get a hold of the latest addresses you have sent funds to. A classic example of a person who does something without being aware of how to use the device correctly, which would mean that he should only read the basic instructions, which boils down to always checking the coin address to which you send or receive a transaction. Being a \"crypto millionaire\" does not necessarily mean being smart, as this example clearly shows.",

It will take some experience and education not to fall into any traps, as is the case with any other form of online payment.Not all traps are obvious. There seem to be some forum members who like to label the less tech savvy users stupid for not having experience with ledger. See how your attitude changes a bit? Change it a bit more. It's completely fine to be a beginner and not be tech savvy and come and ask for help by saying I don't understand this or that, or can someone help me figure all this out. But that's not how you did it. Your approach was criticizing a service for something they are not responsible for, and claiming they somehow allowed this disastrous scam to drain millions of dollars from innocent users. Ledger is guilty for a lot of bad and negative events that you may or may not know about, but this isn't one of those. So if you are ready to learn, you can do that here, and many will help you. If you want to throw around baseless accusations about something you don't know anything about, then don't be surprised if you get negative comments that you might not like. This thread should have been about you having bought a Ledger and asking help how to use it. I have heard about address poisoning scams, are they dangerous, are the funds/keys on my Ledger in jeopardy? How do I properly protect myself, etc., etc.",
