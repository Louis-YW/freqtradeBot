It wont be a surprise if teams Canada, USA, Finland and Sweden are the strongest, but I am gonna focus more on Switzerland and Germany.

These two happens to surprise me with their games from year to year. It's already common thing to held IIHF to hold championship in tow different countries, probably it's a bit cheaper for hosts. I read that tickets is quite expensive in Riga, despite that there was many spectators in arena. I agree with your predictions more or less, usually group stage is just warm up for big teams. While teams on two lowest lines is going to fight to avoid relegation.Opening day was interesting. Sweden had difficult match against Germany and scored their only goal just in 3rd period. Bad day for hosts, Latvia had no chance against Canada, while USA made an upset by beating Finland. In 1st period of Czechia - Slovakia we saw 5 goals, but there was not much action in 2nd and 3rd periods and no goals were scored.Friday results and schedule for Saturday:",

One of the most awaited game of group stage between Finland and Sweden also ended with penalties were Sweden won. And hosts Latvia achieved their ever win against Czechia in World Championship, they won after OT 4:3.It's sad to see Germany still with 0 points after 3 games because all their games with favorites wree really good.",

However, yesterday team Latvia managed to bring a surprise for their fans by beating team Czechia 4:3 in overtime. I've managed to watch that game and it was worth watching, as Czechia managed to score first, but later was the one that have to catch Latvia and survive. But I would not call it \"team Latvia\" is strong at this tournament. They will do their usual - lose most of games, play draw against average teams, but manage to give a good competition or even beat one strong opponent, later finish tournament at top10 as usually. So team Czechia was their \"strongest opponent to beat\", meaning they will lose to Switzerland and Slovakia , win Kazakhstan and have draw against Norway",

They already achieved 3rd win in a row after beating Slovenia. They're not wasting points in games where they're favorites and if they will beat Kazakhstan on Saturday, they almost guarantee themselves spot in playoffs.Meanwhile Kazakhstan made an upset by beating Slovakia after penalties. 6 more games on Saturday and Switzerland - Canada looks most interesting to watch",

Well, maybe playoffs will bring more interest. In final day of group stage hosts Latvia jumped into playoffs after beating Switzerland in extra time. After Slovakia win Latvia needed point in this game, while win in extra time moves them to 3rd place already, while Czech Republic is just 4th.In other group game for 1st place between Sweden and USA also ended in extra time where USA won. While Slovenia and Hungary finished last and going down just after one year in top division. They will be replaced by Italy and Poland.Final standings of groups and playoffs pairs:",

Never seen Latvia having 5 win streak in ice hockey  Magic of prelims, Latvia lost to Canada (a disaster game), Canada lost to Switzerland, Switzerland lost to Latvia  I think Latvia won because the game was in their homeland. Fan support made that 4:3 happen. Because usually for team Latvia, it is loosing most of games in prelims, having a draw or beating one strong team, and that is it, no more power to continue playing. And now they are in play-off. P.S. I have noticed that forum members are not interested in ice hockey at all. No matter if this is Olympic games, NHL or IIHF, topics are usually empty.",

It's true that hockey players have protection on that part of the leg, but a player should be penalized for a move like that. And I'm not saying about 2 minute penalization but an extra penalization after the game so that he never again think of doing something like that. And that dive when Niederreiter touched him is something you see on football games, not ice hockey.",

Ice hockey is a rough sport and players shouldn't do such things to make it dangerous. And for the medal, I think that he deserves a medal if Canada wins it.Now let's get back to the tournament. Two games already started and later we have two more. Germany is currently leading 1-0 against Switzerland but I'll be surprised if they manage to win the game. I think that USA, Switzerland and Canada will qualify for the semi final, but I'm not who to pick between Sweden and Latvia.",

Everything for the first time seems to be very special and the moment have come for Latvia. The country holds the good audience support. The country plays for a medal for the very first time. The fans were out of excitement and as a way to show their joy of entering the quarter finals some have thrown their TV's through the windows.",
