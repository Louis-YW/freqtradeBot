Maybe we will have to wait a few more minutes to see what's going on from behind.",

There have been several threads discussing the same issue on the meta so far, maybe you'll want to take a look too and find some helpful answers.Here's theymos response some time ago about the same issue:Quote from: theymos on May 19, 2023, 05:31:47 PMMy best guess at this point is that it was a random failure of some networking hardware. It doesn't look like any failure I've seen before, so it's difficult to diagnose. It doesn't particularly look like a DDoS or other attack, though I can't rule it out.There won't be any downtime if/when I change anything regarding images.",

But when you check your profile, your comment has been posted already. As you can notice in this board already, someone has multiple posts. Perhaps he thought that his original post didn't went through so he just click the \"Post\" button again.So I will suggest to check your profile after posting to see if it went it or not to avoid double posting.",

I seems this issues was much with smartphone, I tried accessing the forum using my mobile phone I still face same issues but with my PC its working fine without error displayed. When I red some post about people complaining I was thinking it a was joke I never is that effective.QuoteWhat if theymos is unhappy one day and decides not to renew the BTT domain. Will it be the end of the forum?To my greatest knowledge I don't think Theymos would just end the forum knowing the true Vision and Mission of this platform, it will be so disappoint for him to just take such action without fighting for the core Mission of Bitcoin and its forum. But whom are mine, if Theymos decides to not to do anything I have no option as well.",

But later i was also facing the same issue and you were able to make some post but mine was not opening. So, i just gave up, and waiting for the website to recover into normal function. Still i think telegram bot is facing some difficulties to scrap data. But an hour ago i did received some notification which indicated that things are normal now. Thats what i hoped though.",

But sincerely speaking whenever I sees all this error it gets more scary as if we gonna lose the forum entirely.",
