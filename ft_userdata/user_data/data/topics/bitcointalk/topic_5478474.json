  "content": "Last week, an old friend of mine back then in the university in 2013 who later traveled to Canada to further his studies returned back to the country and yesterday, he coincidentally met my mum at a shopping mall and requested for my contact and my mom gave my number to him so he called and called the nickname that we both normally call ourselves back then in the university days I was so shocked to hear that and I called his original name and he answered and told me he is back from Canada and he requested we meet at a bar immediately.Â So with excitement to hear from an old friend after so many years I just immediately took my bath and zoomed to the bar he directed me, so I got there lo and behold my old time friend. We exchanged pleasantries and started discussing about life and I told him how life have been so uneasy but that I got a job in a factory were am paid $60 for about 2 years now and i told him that my colleague at work introduced me to a forum called bitcointalk where i registered on the forum and learnt a lot of things concerning Bitcoin and i also showed him the amount of bitcoins i have stored in my wallet so far and he became curious to know about bitcoin and i explained everything i know about bitcoin and encouraged him to join me in buying and holdling bitcoin that we are awaiting the bull market after the halving so he became so furious and told me that since he knew me that I don't normally give attention to anything online (internet) but for me to hodl such huge amount of Bitcoins that it means am really serious about it so he became interested and ask me how he can buy Bitcoin as well so I told him step by step on how to buy Bitcoin and he bought Bitcoins worth $520 that is about 0.012194 btc so he told me that he wish to acquire 1 btc so I told him not to worry that he will use the DCA method to buy same amount of bitcoins at different interval then with time he will surely acquire the 1 btc. My question now is that is it wise that I showed him the amount of Bitcoins I have accumulated before he developed interest?",

Although I don't recommend that you trust your friend even with how much Bitcoin you own, I assume that what he bought is way larger than what you have. Your friend is probably in a much better life situation than you. You said you are only paid $60 for about two years. That's terrible. On the other hand, your friend has even travelled to another country to further his studies. If your story is true, did you friend buy $520 worth of Bitcoin just like that? He didn't inquire more about what this Bitcoin is or how does it work?",

It is better to research in depth before thinking about investing.",

I will call it a \"1BTC syndrome\" where people especially newbies want to get or acquire a whole Bitcoin where they can just hold a portion of it.I mean if they can buy a single Bitcoin then they can just do it I guess. It's good though that you shared the DCA strategy because it's the safest strategy for newbies like your friend. Quote from: Cryptoprincess101 on December 18, 2023, 11:39:13 PMMy question now is that is it wise that I showed him the amount of Bitcoins I have accumulated before he developed interest?No.It isn't wise, and it isn't safe. I know it's your friend and you might trust him, but from my perspective, it's never safe to show your holdings to other people even with close family members. Well we don't know how close you are with your friend, and you might trust him more than anybody else around you thus, you showed it to him. Nevertheless, you did it already. I guess just take care of yourself, and your holdings as well because you don't know what can happen.",

It's a very decent sum of money to start investing in BTC! Besides teaching him how to purchase BTC, I hope you have also advised him on how to store his coins safely from hackers and scammers.Quote from: Cryptoprincess101 on December 18, 2023, 11:39:13 PMso he told me that he wish to acquire 1 btc so I told him not to worry that he will use the DCA method to buy same amount of bitcoins at different interval then with time he will surely acquire the 1 btc.Well, who doesn't want to possess a whole BTC? That would be great. If he does DCA every month, purchasing the same amount he firstly acquired (0.012194BTC), it's going to take him 82 months or almost 7 years... And that is supposing Bitcoin price is going to remain relatively stable on the currently price range, what is really unlikely. So we can conclude the longer he takes to invest larger sums of money in BTC, more unlikely it is he will have 1 BTC on his wallet. DCA is a great strategy, but if he is able to invest more money right now at once, it's better.Quote from: Cryptoprincess101 on December 18, 2023, 11:39:13 PMMy question now is that is it wise that I showed him the amount of Bitcoins I have accumulated before he developed interest?Considering he isn't a close friend of yours, as you had been out of touch since the university, I don't think it was a good idea. To show how much money you have invested in cryptocurrency is a very private thing, which should be shared only with close people you totally trust in. I understand your intention was the best as possible, because you wished to introduce him to Bitcoin showing how engaged you were with the digital currency, but be more careful next time!",

But you have to give them the right information and also teach them how to keep their Bitcoin safe. Although this condition is relative to my location, I don't like telling people that I own Bitcoin because it could attract criminals such as armed robbers, kidnappers and fraudsters. Most people in my area don't know that Bitcoin can be bought in bits so they assume that you own one Bitcoin and above if they know that you own the coin. This has made me keep my hodling secrets and only discuss Bitcoin with fellow Bitcoiner. Now to your question,Â  I don't think you had to show him how much you have accumulated or how much profit you have made to attract him to the sector. This might make him see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme which is a wrong perception. He should be able to understand the Bitcoin space before investing to avoid regrets.",

Maybe the OP became too excited or got into a deep conversation with his friend. Based on his story, maybe that's the case, but the thing is, I don't know. I don't want to judge the OP. Maybe it's a little bit too much to show your friend all your assets because, although it's your friend, he may have an interest in your wealth or assets, or out of envy, he will sabotage you. But yeah, I'm here not to judge, but to give my opinion. Next time, don't just show off your assets. Yes, you could mention that to them, but don't literally show how much you have or the exact amount because it's still much better if you are on lowkey.Anyway, its your own life. I'm sure many here have also had violent reactions to your bragging or being a show-off. It's not a bad idea to know that you are doing crypto currency or bitcoin stuff, but literally showing your assets is what's bad.",

OP, you taught your friend about Bitcoin and did a good job getting your friend interested in investing which is commendable. OP, did you explain Bitcoin to your friend correctly? Did you properly explain the risks of Bitcoin to your friend? If you can give your friend an idea about Bitcoin in all aspects, then surely you have done a good job. Your friend should be told in such a way that he does not hold you responsible if the investment suffers in the future. If your friend can invest in DCA method from now and hold for a long time then he will get a lot of profit.OP, as everyone told you, I'd also say you shouldn't have shown your bitcoin holdings to your friend. In today's age, you can't even trust your own brother, friends are far away. But not all friends are bad, there are some friends who will give their life for their friend but will not let anything happen to their friend. Don't know what your friend is like? However, you should be careful and take care of your holdings. You ask your friend to hold bitcoins in a good wallet.",
