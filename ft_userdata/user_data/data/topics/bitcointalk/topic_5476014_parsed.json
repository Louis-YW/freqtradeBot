Please understand that only a miner can \"accelerate\" a transaction by putting it in their next block.spider703 claims to accelerate a transaction, but he really does nothing except perhaps submit it to viabtc's acceleration page. He is hoping that when the transaction is eventually confirmed on its own or by viabtc, the sender will believe that he helped and and then tip him.",

Since you will be paying that person, it is better to use a wallet that supports RBF and rebroadcast the transaction instead of searching for a mining pool.The only mining pool that provides an open service to everyone is ViaBTC, but with certain conditions. You can ask in the mining pools section here if there is someone else who can help you, but it is a waste of time. Switch to a wallet that supports RBF.",

Personally speaking, if you're looking to process a transaction ASAP why not just use a different network instead of bitcoin? I find that using other networks when I make crucial purchases more reliable and less stressful than having to wait a whole day for your crypto transaction to push through. But idk man, might just be me. I just don't see the point of already paying something to process your transaction faster, on top of already paying the corresponding transaction fee in in your crypto network. You're basically getting fucked sideways (just my opinion). Alright, Yapping over, go check the services board and discern whether the guy's honest or not",

In hindsight, the accelerator service is hard to get in since it's capped per hour and if the mempool is free, no need to accelerate a tx. Yeah I remember trying to use it back in 2017 and gave up. You needed to set an alarm and at the beginning of the hour try and get your transaction in, most of the time it timed out or it was already full. Eventually gave up and paid the $50 fee to send a small single input single output transaction.This is why from now on I always have the RBF enabled , so if after a day or two it still doesnât fill I can up the fee and resend it. In the past I got burn this way by having transactions stuck for days.",
