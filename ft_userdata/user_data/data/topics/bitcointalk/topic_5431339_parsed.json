  "content": "cttoDate: TBDVenue: TBDQuote“His next fight will be with Lomachenko. We are working out the date and the site right now. But that’s his next fight. Devin win or lose is going to be a big, big factor in the sport of boxing. A terrific young man. A very very good fighter. I like the way he carries himself. I like the way he fights. And with lomachenko he’s in with the master. So that will be a very interesting fight.”- Top Rank CEO Bob ArumIf we were to believe this words of Bob Arum, this fight will be the biggest fight in the lower division next and i personally believed that this would happen as Haney needed this fight with Loma to get the respect of the hard core fans but also a risky one for him as he has everything to lose to the master technician Lomachenco.Who do you think has the advantage on this matchup?",

      "body": "The bad thing in this fight is still not officially confirmed yet In the other boxing matches, I usually consider about the reach advantage about the boxers, but Lomachenko is an exception. There's huge reach difference between Lomachenko and Haney, Lomachenko reach is 166 cm while Haney reach is 180 cm. But Lomachenko have fought many boxers that has 180 cm reach e.g. Commey, Nakatani, and Campbell, Lomachenko doesn't have any problem with it.With a high technical, a lot stamina and quick movement by Lomachenko, he would win against Haney.",

So I'm not going to be surprised that Devin Haney will be the favorite in this fight.However, we should wait for the official date though.",

Probably we will just have to wait for the official venue and date but I will say that 99% this fight is made already.And yes, this is going to be a great match games, style makes fight as we say, so it will be another test for Loma's ability to overcome a very technical boxer such as Devin Haney.",

So mostly ring rust has caught up with him but it doesn't mean he is losing his prime years. I think he is still in the peak of his career. And this is what he dream of, winning a unified title because his first attempt was a failure as he was injured against Teo Lopez that time. So this is want we fans wanted to see and both fighters have good ring IQ and the winner will probably the one who makes the best adjustment in the fight.",

Loma will probably have a hard time getting inside Haney with the latter's significant reach advantage, but he has to. That's his only way to score. He needs to come closer to land those punches. Haney, however, is not only good in maintaining that distance, he is also a good counter puncher. Any attempt for Loma to come in, there will definitely be a punch waiting. But I think Loma still has that speed and footwork. He can probably handle Haney well. I'm really looking forward to this match, and cheer for Loma.",

Better days of Loma have passed and he is small against Haney who also has the speed to match Loma. Loma has a slim chance of winning against a younger and more powerful puncher Haney that will be what other observers in boxing I suppose. You might not see this fight come to materialize unless there is good money for Loma to gain because this is close to a certain loss for him.",

I personally have also thought that Devin Haney will face Shakur Stevenson instead of Lomachenko while the undisputed champion is not yet due for a mandatory fight. I've read a couple of article that is also saying the very same thing and that Haney wanted a much more interesting fight, a boxer that still in his prime years to be exact, that's why Shakur Stevenson's name has surfaced.QuoteWho do you think has the advantage on this matchup?Considering both Haney and Loma's recent fight, I think it's Haney who will have the upper hand once this bout will be announced with its final details. The latter is still good no doubt, both of them are impressive when it comes to technicalities but Loma is somehow showing some signs that will get him into troubles in this fight, although, at the back of my mind is saying that maybe Loma is still adjusting. I guess, we will know it soon in this bout.",

Let the old dogs like Loma achieved what he has looking for in this division, get all the belts. And I think this is more interesting than a Shakur fight because Stevenson is somewhat a defensive fighter as well. So it will be somewhat boring to see both Haney and Shakur I reckon.I will still give Loma a chance to win, yes, Haney might be in his prime and tall and long, but we have seen Loma fight this kind of fighters before and won thru his skills. So I will go with Loma probably in a decision.",

I would agree to that. Haney has been very excellent from his old performances, and those I’ve seen from Lomachenco is quite nothing compared to Haney. But I don’t want to jump to conclusion as there might be twists and surprises when the real fight happens. Of course, I believe Lomachenco has his own hidden potentials too, and he’s not gonna make it this far if he is just an ordinary underdog boxer. So let’s see when the real match happens.",
