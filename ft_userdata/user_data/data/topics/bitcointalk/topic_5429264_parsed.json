I read news before that NFT are the new honeypot for criminals to launder their money by buying those expensive art?Not sure if this is true though, but it makes sense, sense other \"loopholes\" in crypto has been closed already by regulators, so the criminals will have to find another way to sort of mix and hide their illegal money.So just matter of time before regulators comes with their heavy hammer and go to NFT space and crack it down.",

Trumps NFT is not really impressive but its sold out or maybe he is also the one laundering 99$ worth each.",

I read news before that NFT are the new honeypot for criminals to launder their money by buying those expensive art?It might be and I have created threads having this argument in the forum, with many arguments accusing me of being always the antagonizer again hehehe.However, my argument against NFTs as the next to be strictly regulated is the government will concentrate on Defi first and this will not be an overnight development. It will be a process that might take more than 3 years, I reckon.In any case, only one of you replied with a suggestion and this suggestion is a Trump NFT hehe. It is too early to speculate on Trump NFTs but start observing them near the Republican primaries on 2024. Trump will certainly declare his intention to run as president and it appears that he has strong support. My suggestion would be DR/VRS NFT. https://weownthenight.io/homeI like the artwork, their roadmap and their team appears to be good on paper. They are also cheap and the price is going lower. This might be a good longterm investment.",

Anyway, I don't regret having purchased those NFTs, as they proportionated me entertainment, and in the case of Axies some profit as well, while I was playing.Now I expect NFTs may revive once more in the next bull run, with new projects related to the gaming industry.

NFT hype crashed with the rest of the market and it would be weird to assume it wouldn't crash with it. And since there's only one real market cycle so far for nfts, we are in uncharted waters. I am thinking that some of the nft projects will come back bigger then ever. Some will obviously die like most of the altcoins. NFTs still have way more activity and volume then 2019 when i started buying them https://www.theblock.co/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/nft-overview",

Is this possible to happen?I think you are missing the point, forget the art for a moment. Aside the fact it's more then abut jpgs, explaining NFTs makes me feel nostalgic because it's like explaining altcoins to my friends in year 2014. Basically same phrases over and over just because it's a new concept. \"Why would it be worth anything\", \"Value isn't based on anything\", \"It's a ridiculous scam\", \"Probably money laundering\", \"Why wouldn't i buy stocks instead?\", \"I'll keep using cash money\". And after a while \"If i only had invested back then i would be millionaire\". Thing is, these people never invest in the bottom because in the bottom everything is scam for them.",
