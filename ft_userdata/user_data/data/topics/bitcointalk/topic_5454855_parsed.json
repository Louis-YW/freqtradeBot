This is aimed at thwarting      introduction flooding DoS attacks by introducing a dynamic Proof-Of-Work      protocol that occurs over introduction circuits. This introduces several      torrc options prefixed with \"HiddenServicePoW\" in order to control this      feature. By default, this is disabled. Closes ticket 40634.It uses the Equi-X algorithm, which is itself developed from RandomX, which is the ASIC resistant PoW algorithm used by Monero. It is also being developed by the same user, tevador.There's a fantastic post here which explains how this is going to work and what the end user will experience: https://darkdot.com/articles/tor-ddos-leads-to-proof-of-work/. Site admins can manually decide how much PoW is required to reach their site, and users can decide how much PoW they are willing to perform.Hopefully this puts an end to DDoS on Tor.",

The service will periodically update a suggested amount of effort, based on attack load, and disable the puzzle entirely when the service is not overloaded.So it's not an all or nothing thing as I had initially assumed - the service stipulates x amount of work, if you complete x or more you are connected, if you complete less than x you are not connected. Rather, it's based on prioritization. If you complete less than the suggested amount then you might still connect, but your connection will simply be a lower priority than those who have completed more work.I'm really keen to try this out.

The HashX docs make these claims regarding Performance [1]> HashX was designed for fast verification. Generating a hash function from seed takes about 50 μs and a 64-bit nonce can be hashed in under 100 ns (in compiled mode) or in about 1-2 μs (in interpreted mode).Obviously, with hash function generation being about 3 orders of magnitude slower than a SHA256 hash computation, fast verification was not the prime design objective.It was designed for ASIC resistance first, and fast verification second.The EquiX PoW verification makes 8 HashX computations, but they're all from a single generated function, so detecting the bogus PoW takes about 50 μs. Hopefully that's fast enough to deter such attacks.EDIT: apparently TOR already faces about 260 μs overhead in request processing before it can verify the PoW, so there's very little benefit in further reducing this 50 μs.[1] https://github.com/tevador/hashx",

The HashX docs make these claims regarding Performance [1]Thanks for the info but:A few comments on this proposal: https://github.com/torproject/torspec/blob/main/proposals/327-pow-over-intro.txtQuoteThe protocol involves the following major steps:  1) Service encodes PoW parameters in descriptor [DESC_POW]  2) Client fetches descriptor and computes PoW [CLIENT_POW]  3) Client completes PoW and sends results in INTRO1 cell [INTRO1_POW]  4) Service verifies PoW and queues introduction based on PoW effort     [SERVICE_VERIFY]  5) Requests are continuously drained from the queue, highest effort first,     subject to multiple constraints on speed [HANDLE_QUEUE]The Service seems like it could be still subject to ddos attacks anyway as it has to provide POW parameters in step 1 and then verify the PoW in step 4. So it has to first communicate to the client, providing some information, then it has to perform processing to verify the PoW is correct. if all of those requests by the client are fake then that's wasting bandwidth of the server and its computing power.Quote3.4.1. PoW verification [POW_VERIFY]   To verify the client's proof-of-work the service MUST do the following steps:      a) Find a valid seed C that starts with POW_SEED. Fail if no such seed         exists.      b) Fail if N = POW_NONCE is present in the replay cache              (see [REPLAY_PROTECTION])      c) Calculate R = ntohl(blake2b_32(P || ID || C || N || E || S))      d) Fail if R * E > UINT32_MAX      e) Fail if equix_verify(P || ID || C || N || E, S) != EQUIX_OK      f) Put the request in the queue with a priority of E   If any of these steps fail the service MUST ignore this introduction request   and abort the protocol.I'm not going to pretend like I understand the reasons for all of these steps but if any of them fails then the introduction request must be denied. That means all of them have to be checked to make sure none of them fail, in the worst case scenario you would find yourself going through all of them until you hit step f. For every bogus request, it might have to go rhgouh steps a,b,c,d,e and then maybe it fails on step f for whatever reason. maybe all those steps are extremely fast and efficient, well they better be!  Quote\"Third-party anonymous credentials\" -- We can use anonymous credentials and a         third-party token issuance server on the clearnet to issue tokens         based on PoW or CAPTCHA and then use those tokens to get access to the         service. See [REF_CREDS] for more details.This seems like a better idea to separate the PoW component of things completely. Then you could add on PoW protection to all kinds of different services too. After looking at this thing for a few minutes, the only real question that comes to mind is why they didn't come up with an idea like this sooner. Presumably DDOS attacks are not a new thing for Tor...and it's not really anything new. I think they did it with email way back in the day. Where to stop spam, they required some PoW be done that took a few seconds. Simple way to stop spam...Quote from: Cricktor on June 04, 2023, 09:46:34 PMI'm not a Tor expert either.

So people with more powerful machines (modern ones), well they can be expedited while poorer people with lower end machines can get ignored. Ignored means treated with lower priority. means more waiting.",

I2P is way newer than Tor so why is Tor only now adopting a more effective way of dealing with DDoS?I don't know since when I2P add Hashcash. But PoW proposal for Tor has been around since 2020[1] and the idea itself seems to be few years older. And FYI, I2P isn't exactly new since it was created on 2003[2].Quote from: darkv0rt3x on June 06, 2023, 01:56:31 PMThey did use anything else before now?Yes, some of them mentioned on their documentation[3].[1] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-June/014381.html[2] https://www.geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2021/08/28/History-of-I2P[3] https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/dos/",
