  "content": "Auction for ColdKey victims of the apparent theftLINK: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434506.0This thread is going to serve as a collection list of items people are willing to donate to a future auction that will take place on January 31st 2023 and will run for a period of time.Each item will be listed as a different lot to bid on.The payment address will be supplied by another community member who is trusted to collect these funds, not me.As items are brought up in this thread or via PM I will add it to the list here.I'm so sad for those who lost funds in this debacle. Hoping everyone involved can get restitution.If you would like to add an item to this charity auction please send me a PM here on the forum with an image of the item or email me, or reply to this thread.Please note that whatever items you choose to donate you will be responsible for shipping the item to the auction winner for that particular lot.
