Later i remembered that i had it and for my surprise it had like a thousand followers, amongst them were bored apes yacht club and others. I decided i would be more active with it when i have time. I still haven't asked for any followers or retweets, or hold fake competitions like others for followers.Thinking maybe i should.",
