Â We don't know if you're alive or dead, but we will always miss you and we owe you a big thank you, Satoshi Nakamoto. Once again we want to thank Satoshi for creating Bitcoins for us.If I hadn't seen this article, I would have forgotten this important date.https://www.facebook.com/BitcoinBlueWhale.ethQuoteOne email changed everythingSource: Twitter",

      "body": "I also cane across this recently where it was reported to spot the openly display of bitcoin whitepaper on the street https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1583775234817417216?t=8V6bDf3RA9L3ULTPPKqBEQ&s=19 and the country where this was spotted is believed to be in Scotland, what I don't really know is maybe they were been intentional in doing that just in the bid to celebrate the bitcoin whitepaper day or it was just a coincidence about one week ago, the white paper has the very answer to all discrepancies that may come with people's adoption and the technicality with the bitcoin network in general, i do call it the road map with bitcoin.",
