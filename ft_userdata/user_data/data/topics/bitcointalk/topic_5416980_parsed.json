Then he'll become very aggressive and continue to procrastinate until you get fed up. Once you complain, he'll block you immediately. HE'S A SCAMMER!Use Escrow if your Life depends on dealing with him. But understand he'll do his best to push you to unknown Telegram escrow. Insist on Trusted Bitcointalk Escrowers. I bypassed that and paid dearly with my hard earned $100.Don't fall for his Gimmick, he hasn't installed anything to anyone.",

Look buddy, I only told you to pay if you're going to pay. You wasted 4 weeks of my time. You asked SOOO MANY questions and I gave you an answer to each of them. Then you tried to lower the price from $200 to $50. And you kept begging until I agreed to $100 for source code.I told you I'd install the script for you after I was done with everything else. (Unlike some, I have private life and a real life job too.) But you just KEPT PUSHING me every 30 minutes for updates.You tempered with the source code I gave you and then accused me of giving you invalid code. Well guess what, it takes some knowledge to install it. It's not in install.exe form you dumb fuck.Believe it or not I have customers, this is not the only place where i advertise. I was trying to be helpful and nice to you but you just don't understand what the words NO and WAIT mean.I've wasted enough of my time on you and everyone with a bit of brain will understand you're just an asshole who thinks he's entitled to whatever he wants.I never ever claimed the code was mine but I DID many customisations on it. I've reported your posts to staff and hopefully they remove you so i can conduct my business in peace.",
