  "content": "I can't understand why Solana is still at the top, when it's been a victim of constant network outages and hacks. For a Blockchain network which aims to provide unparalleled processing times and low costs, this instability makes everyone look elsewhere. But for some reason, SOL hasn't gone all the way down to zero. Maybe whales want to keep Solana afloat for their own benefit? Whatever the case may be, there isn't any indication Solana will disappear anytime soon. The project's developers still haven't solved the outage issue, so why would you use Solana when there are far better blockchain networks which focus on security and reliability (eg: Cardano and Ethereum)?What are your thoughts? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

If someone overtake their cap then some will advance. Its not about the tech when it comes to ranking on cmc, coingecko or coins out there. Its the quantity of volume and marketcap they are basing the ranking whether the token or coin is worthless one.In terms of security, clearly the one you mentioned are good ones and more dominant than solana and probably other chains but its not like that. (example) Even shiba can surpass btc on ranking if he surpass the marketcap of btc even their project is just a meme and has no vital utility.",

Especially it has 200x growth in the last bull run. It will be corrected to $10 or $15 that can be its bottom range. Honestly I think it can fall under $10 as well.After hype in bull run and lot of promise about Solana blockchain's capacity, we already saw many flaws of the chain. It means Solana is vulnerable in bear market. If network has issues, bear market will amplify its flaws and has big negative impact on price.",

Solana faces outages but this didn't mean the system was broken like terra luna which was printing multi billions of tokens and these tokens dumped to the market. In this case, solana was also backed by alameda and SBF. I do remember if SBF was also a die hard for solana blockchain. That guy is always hyping anything related to the solana. This is also making people still hold it although so many problems have been faced by solana.",

Of course because there are still many people who believe in this token, even Terra Labs is experiencing more dire problems than the problems faced by Solana recently. We don't know for sure if there really is a whale involved who wants to keep Solana on top just for their benefit. But for me, Solana is dead, very unsuitable as a place to invest because it is very risky, we don't know what will happen in the future on their network, whether there will be a bigger problem than the hacking that happened.",

Instead, the project's been focusing on a new Solana-powered smartphone to help attract investors into it. If the team doesn't care about what matters most (security and reliability), then why bother investing into SOL in the first place? I think the only reason why the coin is still among the top ranks in market cap it's because whales are keeping it that way. The high-performance and cost-efficiency of the Solana blockchain makes it perfect for day trading and other sorts of things. It's like a profit machine for whales, but a nightmare for the end user.As I've said before, there are far better platforms which focus on security/reliability above all else. Let's see how far SOL will go as the competition becomes fierce each day. Just my thoughts",
