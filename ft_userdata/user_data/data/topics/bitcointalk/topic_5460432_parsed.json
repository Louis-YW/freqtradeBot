      "body": "I don't like cross-chain integrations because it has recently proven that it is more vulnerable to negative changes in terms of having a lot of competitors or the possibility of hacking.When we go to define Moonbeam, we will find that they define themselves as an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot.Polkadot has become less attractive to developers than before, and therefore the development of its bridges will not attract more liquidity as it was in the past, and therefore do not expect to return to £0.18 soon.Also, the current market condition is dormant, and therefore it is unlikely that there will be a breakthrough, so you buy near the top, which is often a failed investment.https://moonbeam.network/Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 20, 2023, 10:32:17 AMWorth buying? If you are a strong believer in cross-chain integrations and Polkadot then wait for the price to drop to £0.09 to £0.13 and then it could be a good opportunity.",

Looking at the chart it looks like any other chart during a bear market and with the bull run only months away now should be getting back to all time high and beyond no problem?Its presence in the top 20 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capacity does not mean that it does not die, but rather in the speed of new projects moving to it. Most projects prefer the Ethereum and polygon network due to high efficiency and cheap costs. However, Polkadot did not develop to meet the needs of new projects, so it is described as a dead blockchain. We can describe tron as a dead blockchain because if we delete USDT, the liquidity will almost disappear from it. Transaction speed, fees are competitive advantages between these two blockchains.",

But who knows what could be their main platform specialty. Ive seen its more of a crosschain and probably another competitor with most rising platform now. But I think the newer the project the better since people will think this is an old project already. Majority of degen and risk taker loves new hype project but this one is a medium cap project that has worth a shot in my opinion.",

Not for me...I'd never invest in DOT and so no reason why I have to invest in projects that has a similar function. If it dumps today, we can't expect it to recover back strongly in the future but likely it was a sign that it lost its opportunity to gather more investors and help that situation out. It was really hard for the projects to sustain when they don't have strong market support, unlike Bitcoin and ETH. Because even we can see it dumps countless time but when the bull season comes, it rises back high as well and make another record.",

Currently, there are no big projects building on the chain, if they can successfully attract developers then we should expect price to follow. L2 has taken over the narratives, but the good thing is that most of these projects now have fair valuations that I think is better than most of these L2 coming out with Billiona of dollars valuation.",
