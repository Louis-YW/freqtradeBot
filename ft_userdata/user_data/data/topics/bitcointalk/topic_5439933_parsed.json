Ah well, who knows if crypto winter ends here with them closing down ? That should be a perfect punch in the face.Quote from: alterra57 on February 15, 2023, 11:28:12 AMWhy pay such high fees when you can go on Binance and pay less?Right, and btw you dont pay any fee for p2p trades on binance. Its completely free.@OP, you should move this to exchanges board.",

      "body": "LocalBitcoins didn't just shut down overnight. It was a slow and steady process that had to do with legal and regulatory issues. They started putting the brakes on their services in some areas, like in Germany where they stopped offering services to users in 2019. They also pulled the plug in some parts of the USA, like New York and Washington State, because they didn't have the right licenses.Basically, they had to adapt to new rules and laws as they came up, and that meant they had to cut back on their services in some areas. In my opinion, it was the combination of regulatory pressure and the recent decline in cryptocurrency values that led to its downfall.",

We do KYC because its a way to prevent scammers from making multiple accounts.How do you stop scamming without KYC? How can users be safe without KYC? Multiaccounting and scamming aren't exactly the same thing. But if you meant fraud when you said scamming, then it's easy to stop that with KYC. Almost impossible without it, unless you are restricted to trading cryptocurrency pairs using a \"dumbed down\" smart contract.There will always be fraud associated with crypto-to-fiat and vice versa exchanges though, because you can always just rob the buyer or seller.Multiaccounting is pretty easy to stop without KYC though. Just make all users verify with their phone number and check their GPS location to make sure that all accounts are created in the same place.",

You probably did it because it was a prerequisite by your trade partner, but KYC was never a requirement to sign up and use localcryptos. In their terms of use and service terms, they never maentioned anything like KYC or AMLQuote from: CCMS on March 16, 2023, 02:57:55 PM What do you think will happen to the KYC documents there ?Nobody knows… try checking out their privacy policy.
