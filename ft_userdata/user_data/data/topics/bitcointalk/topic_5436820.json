Anyway, your work is good but it will be better if you add a few more and add on the first post. Also if you have bitcoin or you can arrange bitcoin then you will be able to post images yourself.",

I think that would really display how beautiful your work looks, having only 2 images without proper address your business may not attract customer. What are your targeted area, location and country. What are the min and max amount, and possibly dropped an email if you don't want to drop a phone line or twitter page, even facebook page will be more appreciated.",

Don't know if i dare to ask but it will be good if you can tell that you offer Customes only for females or deal in gents suits too ?The reason i am asking this as your sample pictures only contains female stuff.Quote from: jayce on January 26, 2023, 05:16:26 PMNo offense but how can we trust your service?

Perhaps the shipment fee could be higher than the product's price itself.We now know that OP location is Philippines but still there are too much things to consider. The first is the size and the texture of the clothes and what is the return policy. I prefer to buy clothes physically otherwise there is always some fitting problem.",

Perhaps OP should've bought a Copper membership do they can easily display images on their own. That won't cost an arm or leg. I think it's around $30 to get it and they will be free from image issues. Quote from: bnbstorm on January 26, 2023, 12:18:42 PMBeware of scams in this space.You're right. That will be OP's greatest hurdle to cross at this moment, seeing that their account is barely a month old here and they're already advertising a service to the community. I ain't saying that OP isn't genuine but they've to prove that on their own.",
