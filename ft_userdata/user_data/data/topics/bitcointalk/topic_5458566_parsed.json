  "content": "This user ps34 created Thread today to offer something for good Merited user. I DM him to check what he offering. he ask for telegram ID to talk further. In the telegram discussion i found out that he was asking for 500€ loan and he know that without merit his request will be rejected so he is now taking help from active users( in second word, want to cheat them). he is offering KYC documents in the return of loan and from his message i deducted that he has many kyc documents. This user is probably a scammer and tried many time with different accounts. i am afraid that if he success in this mission then it will make difficulty for lender especially Shasan who has big heart for borrower but these scammers don't care of him.Below is our conversation which clearly indicate that this man's intentions are not good.",

Before I forget, he has an alt account I don't remember the name but I'll edit my post and add it here so that everyone can identify the alt and avoid getting scammed.",

He understood that all the documents he collected (illegally I think) were completely useless.One of the KYC things I like and I hope every platform out there starts implementing it so we can finally get rid of this black market with selfies and id scans that have simply gone insane, a few days ago I saw offers for as low as 5$ for EU and US combos, (id,selfie,utility,bank), it needs to stop! And people who are using those to bypass country blocks, also need to stop, you never know how much trouble you're getting your ass for a few hundred dollars, and you might regret this all your life.Quote from: ps34 on July 04, 2023, 01:45:06 PMif you smell money then you are there huh   what were you trying to do here sir?  (your the only one who contacted me by pm)  So?
