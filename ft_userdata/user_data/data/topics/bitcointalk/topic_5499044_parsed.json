Since bitcoin is decentralized and no one is in direct control of bitcoin, no one can actively influence the price of bitcoin by pulling a few strings. So in the end, no one can exactly “decrypt” as you say the price of bitcoin. All we can do is to try and predict the price the closest as we can and make a move based on that assumption.Quote A few (multinational) guys conveniently moving whales, you lose, I win but I give you a bonus. Whales impact how other investors see bitcoin as an asset so individually we should know how to identify whales moving their assets to an asset actually losing value so to not raise panic.QuoteAnd if that's the case, I propose the legalization of BTC (WITHOUT KYC)The government will not allow that.",

What's truly interesting is that in every war, there are casualties. Who will be the future sell?I agree that the tech war is an important aspect of world affairs, and it's easy to get distracted by the noise while the real battle is taking place behind the scenes. The concept of cracking the price of BTC  to win this war is intriguing, and  raises questions about the role of cryptocurrencies in  future financial and power trends. The idea of ​​legalizing BTC without KYC (Know Your Customer) regulation is intriguing, as it could  democratize access to the financial system and create a more level playing field. Integrating complex algorithms and BTC education into the education system could be a game changer, especially when it comes to preparing the next generation for a world where technology and finance are increasingly intertwined.  The idea that BTC has become the best long-term investment asset is currently debated, but there's no denying that it has sparked a global debate about the future of money and power. Your comment about the transfer of power from older people to younger people is particularly insightful because it highlights the potential of technological advances to break down traditional hierarchical structures and create new opportunities for those  willing to adapt and learn. The question of who will be the future rulers is troubling because it implies that there will be winners and losers in this technology war. It reminds us that we must recognize the consequences of our actions and strive to build a more fair and equal society in which the benefits of technological advances reach everyone.",

Most governments are still walking on eggshells around bitcoin and crypto. They don’t know what to do with it except a lot of them are very much against with the idea of it. There are many conflicts around the world between different nations but I have never heard of crypto being utilized as a leverage against their opponents.QuoteDo you really think that mass crypto education would solve the problem of market manipulation? I don't think so.“Market manipulation” through whales does not have anything to do with its adoption. So the answer is no.

Strong foundational understanding on economics is the very important for students, before they can go into Bitcoin in full. If they lack this basic, they might get stranded along the line while trying to grasp everything concerning Bitcoin. In a more convenient manner, I think finer specialization on courses like Bitcoin should be at the PhD level, were all advanced and technicalities will be taught. issuing cert at the University level might just be enough.",

But not it has evolved, we have this opportunity now to have Bitcoin and understand the basic principle and then make a lot of money and apply what we have learn in the previous generations and apply it right now.And as per what the OP stated, being a long term bitcoin investor could be a must for the majority of us. I mean 2017 could be the golden era of bitcoin. and fast forward we are what like almost 99% of bitcoin already mined? So just image what will be the price in the future, next 3 halvings is going to be huge so we should look long term, invest and be a holder.",

I think the financial education of teaching kids about financial literacy is a job for the parents and guardians and seniors who have already come into the wake of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and know that it is a reasonable investment that could help them achieve their dreams on time instead of going through the journey of working to gain experience and saving up before they can achieve what their hearts has been set out to do, that's if they don't get swayed by drugs and unfriendly-friends in the nearest future.",
