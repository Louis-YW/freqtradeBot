So I agree with you that there is something really fishy going on or that person simply suffers from very serious bad compulsive decisions and should get help as soon as possible. It is possible there is some tax evasion going on, because as far as I am informed in many countries people get tax discounts for important quantities of money donated to organizations, in the United States one can also get those benefits by declaring one has given gifts. Perhaps the people behind those organizations are friends or family members of him, who knows, it would not the the first time something like that happened.",

Not that crazy if you think that people were hoping for bitcoin to reach $1 then $10, $100, $100, $10000... Every few years it's another \"unreachable goal\" that people talk about and dream what cars and boats they'll buy if it goes there and then boom - it does. I think that it's very likely bitcoin will reach 1m in the next 10 years, but yes, the prediction of 1m right now was largely exaggerated I think that he did it to raise awareness, boost cofidence... Maybe he was trading on leverage and wanted just 10% rise in value to be even on his bet? Think about it. You put 10m on the line on 2x leverage. If bitcoin goes up 10% you get 2m in profit. You bet 1m to potentially get 2m if that boosts market confidence enough.",

Also coinbase is struggling which means he has no luxury to made such bet while his company is burning down.",

He had to know what chance of success his bet has and with the coming FED rate hike that 80% of people expected (according to the polls), there's not going to be a large bounce back in stocks and bitcoin. Possible large bankruptcies that in long term would pump bitcoin in short term were expected to start panic where people only care about getting money from banks and not about investing it. I think that it's possible he made more than one bet and only announced one of them. Do you remember the joke Tarantino told in Desperado about the bet with the bartender? Look it up if you don't.It's all about the things you're aware of and not aware of. You may be thinking the guy must be stupid to make that bet, but you don't know the whole story.

If ever he do able to donate or give out 1.5M instead of 1 which adding up some500k for bitcoin development then it does simply shows that he's really that a huge supporter of Bitcoin. He might be able to lose up a million_ but doesnt mean that it is really that indeed overor having the same that he had failed out such bet. Lots of us or 99.9% are really that believing that there's no way on touching up that price in a short time or basically it was alreadythat a sure loss type of bet. Good thing that there's someone who do able to take up that bet but actually it was really just that indeed an easy money for a short duration of time. In speaking about possible tax evasion then we cant really point out fingers about those things. Its never been that good on assuming that bad on someone.",

No signs of any conspiracy brewing under our noses but that doesn't mean we should dismiss it. For all I know this \"donation\" can easily be written off of his taxes and could very well keep the IRS off his ass for a while, so he didn't really lose anything in the process. As for the betting, I don't think that's deranged too, he probably did that in hopes of riling the people to his side but he's no 2020 Elon Musk, people outside of FinTech Crypto don't even know who he is, let alone what he could do.

That seems like the only possible idea and should be considered as the reality, that is what has happened if you ask me and that is why it probably worked the way he wanted it to work.",
