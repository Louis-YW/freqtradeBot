  "content": "Dear All,We are thrilled to announce the successful rerun of the Catena Mainnet, which has undergone numerous tests and is now operating seamlessly. We take great pride in this accomplishment and are excited to share the news with all of you.As we progress, we are now focusing on the integration of Delegated and Validators with the Mainnet. This crucial step is scheduled to commence on ‚ÄúJuly 12th, 2023‚Äù, precisely one month after the rerun's date. We believe this integration will further enhance the functionality and robustness of our network.In addition to the integration, we have several exciting features lined up for launch following the Portal initiation. These include the Catena Bridge, enabling seamless interoperability, and the new Mainnet Staking Portal, which will facilitate staking activities for our community members.Regarding the Catena Explorer, we would like to address a few significant points. The launch of a hybrid network accompanied by an Explorer capable of reading two simultaneous data sources, namely the EVM compatible and the Native network, at a remarkable speed of 50,000 TPS with a 2-second block-time, is a highly intricate task. It is worth noting that many well-known projects have attempted such a feat, but we are proud to be at the forefront of this pioneering effort. Our Explorer represents a new generation of Explorers, serving as the foundation for the Universal Block Explorer.As we progress on our journey, we anticipate the unique features of the Catena Blockchain to continue expanding the network's applications, unlocking new possibilities and opportunities.üí†TOGETHER WE GROWüí†CATENA Explore:https://catenascan.com/Twitter:https://twitter.com/Catena_NetworkTelegram:https://t.me/CatenaOfficialCMCX CoinCATENA Network",
