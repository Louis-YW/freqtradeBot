  "content": "We have an idea for a mechanism for collecting resources, focusing a community in a specific direction and deploying resources to solve global problems. Rather than fluctuate based on market signals such as demand, the protocol would instead track a proprietary index that measures whether the world is growing happier or is worse off.Prices rise as the world grows happier (through our communityâ€™s action) and the price goes down when the world regresses. At scale, we see a DAO being directed towards lobbying governments, funding medical research, fighting deforestation and combating global hunger. Assets within this proposed index would include indicators tracking happiness, health, social cohesion, climate, economic inequality and freedom.Would appreciate feedbackhttps://arda-index.gitbook.io/arda-taking-crypto-beyond-economics/",
