What is funny to me is that people can make large sum of money from trading if truly they are good traders. If you are very perfect to the extent you are giving people your signals in order for them to win, then why is there anything like paid subscription? The only way to successful money making in trading is for a trader to learn trading, learn the technical aspects and be patient, having risk management and never use the amount of money he can not afford to lose. It is better not to depend on paying bots, I do not even depend on bots generally, I prefer trading manually. A trader should not also depends on copyimg trading and lastly, a trader should not depend on signals. Paying signal groups are only looking for ways to earn from people, they do not care if the people later win or lose. A trader that do not learn and understand the basics of trading will fail and likely the person will be scammed.",

      "body": "well, i don't know how far you've managed to provide reliable signals and i can't accuse you of anything because you didn't do anything wrong, but if i may i would like to know how far your signals are reliable? could you at least post in this thread some signals a day or at least some price predictions a day? I think that with this people will be able to see how your skills can be useful or not and they will also be able to see if you are trustworthy or not. I hope you will think of my suggestion, I believe this (posting signals in this thread or posting price forecasts in this thread) will not take you much timeQuote from: _act_ on June 16, 2022, 10:36:11 AMDo you know what is most funny to me about people that are providing trading signals?

That way, people will know whether it's working or not. It's exactly like people who claim to have fixed matches but won't be able to prove it.",
