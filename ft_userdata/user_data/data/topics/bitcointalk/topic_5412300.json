You can chat or ask questions from there but it isn't a community that's frequently active who will gave signals for you to follow. They also have trading resources just to get your feet wet.Or...you can just hop in to the Speculation[1] or Trading Discussion[2] board here in this forum.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0",

Many user keep sharing there setup which is so confusing if you are new since your mind will not be focused. I suggest on participating with VIP group rather than general trading group to avoid mixed opinion and confusing signal that being shared by other members. Are you looking for public group or paid group? Reply here your preference group type so thatI can drop an invitation link for the discord group.",

They don't disclose to the public what will benefit them, they are always owners of shit project that have paid group the pump and dump coins.. You stay in such group in vain, it is better you keep to try your luck yourself than to rely on paid group.",

Day trading is not something impossible to learn. love your assets.It’s very hard to find legit paid signal group that will give an authentic signal base on the market sentiment because most of them are giving signal on the coins that they already early purchased. Most of this paid signal groups offer signal for shitcoins that has high volatility that usually result to pump and dump because they usually sold there bags once the paid members bought there signal.This process keeps repeating and there’s always a member left out especially the public group that this service shared later after the private group make a position too. Joining on this group is like participating on a market manipulation.",

Yes, it is a thing in the past, when ICO is in surge, but all it did is just hype, lure its members buy a new shitcoin or buy the hype then leave them hanging in the top when the group leaders sell almost their holdings. People knows such thing still exists today but yeah, better to read news, follow what specific trader in crpyto twitter and learn with yourself.",

Instead of paying a subscription fee to a paid trading group, it's better to use that money for trading capital. At the same time, you learn more about trading to get good skills in analyzing and knowing when to enter the market. After all, the fee is not cheaper as you thought. For free trading groups, I don't recommend it because we don't know if their signals are valid or just suggest we enter the market and buy certain coins without knowing anything. I suggest you learn about trading so that it will be useful for you to gain profit and gain analytical skills.",

My suggestion is to learn trading on your own and never depend to any signal group, just like the suggestion of many here. We already know the risk of a signal group and that’s why as much as possible, we discourage newbies to get involve on this especially if they are going to pay just to join any group, I’m telling you OP it’s really not worth it.",

I would not recommend those telegram groups for any of the reasons you want to use them, if you want to share information there are many forums dedicated exclusively to trading which could help you improve your strategy, when it comes to signals not a single one of those groups is a good one whether you have to pay for the signals or not, and finally if you want to read the news about what it is happening at the markets in which you are interested you can just search for that information yourself.",

You’re still a newbie, better not to rush getting into this market just take it slowly and the right way. My suggestion is better, try to look for a good source of knowledge in the market, you can always have that in google of course and try to understand the basic rules of trading. Again, that is for your own benefit because trading signal is not good at all. If you want to succeed in long term, better to start doing this and start being committed especially in learning how to trade.",

I would prefer to have my own research, unreliable sources could be your problem in the future.  Why not just start in simple and basic trading like buy low and sell high.  It's up to you now.",

Don't just use it with a single full blast as they trade, each amount should be used carefully so that they don't miss the lesson that they should learn.",
