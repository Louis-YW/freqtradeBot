Then they go on Twitter and make a tweet that \"Funds are Safu\".Yes, that's exactly why simply having a \"proof of reserve\" isn't sufficient to assess the financial health of an exchange. It only provides a snapshot of one side of the picture and doesn't give us an understanding of the exchange's liabilities. As you pointed out, the methods used by exchanges for \"proof of reserve\" in 2022 were easily manipulatable, as assets could be moved around.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 04, 2023, 07:20:07 AMAs for the auditors, they don't even know how to audit in the first place, or is it right to say that exchanges just know how to get smarter than auditors? Some of the top firms have conducted audits for well-established exchanges. For example, the audits for Coinbase are performed by Deloitte, which is a reputable auditing firm. Given that Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the US, it's safe to assume that its audit process is thorough and rigorous. So when top auditing firms deny audit requests from exchanges such as Binance, it surely raises red flags and questions.",

So in the end many of them don't even want to have anything to do with exchanges, like Mazars removed Binance proof of reserve audit from their website and halted all the other ongoing audit for other exchanges.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 04, 2023, 07:20:07 AMNo matter what you plan to do on centralised exchanges, do not trust them. You are preaching to the choir.

We're in a world that all you just have to do is have money and you can be treated differently. Exchanges aren't smarter because if they were a little bit smart then some mistakes that they do that causes investors huge losses could have been easily avoided. It's no secret that a thief is only declared a thief when he's caught, if he hasn't been caught then he's a free man just like the rest of us. SBF was caught and it's just a matter of time before others get exposed as well. I believe all centralized exchange are guilty of similar crimes but just that the industry is not regulated so they can get away with all their evils deals. Exchanges are never to be trusted and your funds are never saved with them irrespective of how they try to make us believe that our coins are secured on their platforms.",
