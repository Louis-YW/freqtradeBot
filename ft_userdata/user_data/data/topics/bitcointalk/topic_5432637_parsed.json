  "content": "Happy new year every one!I just released the first update of the year for my puzzle game Cryptyles (www.cryptyles.com) and would love to receive some feedback for the game.Cryptyles is a daily educational crypto puzzle game where your goal is to match coin logos and names.New puzzles are available each day and they are the same for everyone.It runs directly in the browser, desktop and mobile, and is completely free to play.At the end of a game you can click on coins to learn more about them and will also be shown facts and terms from the cryptospace.If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can use hacks to help you out at the cost of energy, which replenishes slowly with daily logins.Here's how the puzzles look like: https://i.imgur.com/cIAkyBu.pngThere are several modes and features you unlock by playing and special events each day that have unique gameplay mechanics.You will also earn an ingame currency that can be used to unlock minimalistic crypto wallpapers like these:https://i.imgur.com/pZMhjSh.jpeghttps://i.imgur.com/IyHlH0K.jpegOne tip I can give: You will see a lot of altcoins that you have never heard of, so treat the game more like a logic and deduction puzzle and try to find connections between the coin names and logos.The game difficulty can be adjusted on the home screen if you find it too hard or too easy.So what do you guys and gals think?Thanks & have a nice sunday everyone!",
