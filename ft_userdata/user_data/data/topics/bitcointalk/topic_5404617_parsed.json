  "content": "Creating a password is very important, weak passwords means hackers can easily gain access to your accounts, and many of us have a lot of online accounts across different platforms, so creating a password for each account, including emails becomes a task. There are two ways of creating a password, either through your brain or with a password manager, like keePass for example.The purpose of this topic is to know which of the two ways this community thinks is the safest!!!If you create passwords from your mind it will have to be complex so hackers can't get it, and it will be difficult for you to remember so you'd have to write them down on paper, because if you save them in your email or online, then it is unsafe, but what of in a situation that the paper you used to back up your password is misplaced or damaged, what are the additional back ups for people who use this method to ensure their passwords are safe forever.Password managers seem to be the safest, for those who use them, what are the 'do's and dont's', i do not have too much experience with password managers, so can anything go wrong when using them? Any knowledge or experience you have on password creation will be appreciated so others can learn from it.",

I’m not claiming it’s the best solution, but so far no one has hacked me and I’ve never lost a single important password.If the password is complex enough (lowercase/uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) it is enough to have up to 15 characters, each password strength meter for such passwords will show the time for their crack would be in billions of years. Maybe quantum computers will reduce that time a bit in the future, so no one will make a mistake if they use more complex passwords.Quote from: ImThour on June 30, 2022, 10:26:03 AMI don't use any password managers as I have a good enough memory to keep them safe in my mind however I do use a similar password for multiple websites.No matter how safe you feel at the moment, the risk you take is very high - not only because you keep passwords in your mind, but also because you use similar passwords for all services. However, there is a better chance that you will hit your head and experience amnesia, than that someone will hack you if you have a somewhat strong password.",

But all this hack event is only possible if you share your login details or you download malicious software that will give the hacker your login details.Actually if the password is long enough and complicated enough it still takes longer than the hacker's lifetime to crack it.Even more, while secondary security is a good goal, far too many don't understand that SMS can be stolen/impersonated and even more fail to understand that having a 2FA tool on the same device (phone) as the one used to go to the various websites and platforms pretty much voids the benefits of having two layers of security.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 30, 2022, 10:00:04 AMTake note bitwarden could be either self-hosted or use their cloud service.Indeed, I am lazy enough to use Bitwarden with their cloud service. I hope though that my password is strong enough.I will add that it's also good to not keep life changing amounts (of bitcoin) on online platforms and also it's a terrible idea to save HD seeds and private keys into password managers (and I've seen such ideas here and there).I think that it's best to have a \"good enough\" security, but also ensure that if that one fails it won't be the end of the world for you.",

Also some cases their are times that we will forget what password we set that's why I don't trust saving some important details by using memory only because anything could happen so I mostly I always written up my password on multiple 2 notebooks then lock it on my computer desk, so far I never get encounter any issues since I can say I'm safe by using this to any online hacking.",

I just feel more secure if my password is completely offline than being stored by any software, no matter how secure someone thinks it is. In addition, there have been many different revelations about how some password managers have been hacked or found to have serious vulnerabilities - which means that user passwords are always at risk to be hacked.",

Any knowledge or experience you have on password creation will be appreciated so others can learn from it.I think the most important key to a safe password is not in the creating of a password that can't be guessed by anyone or brute forced by anyone. A mean, you can create a supper complex password bt mixing random alphabets using upper and lower case, numbers and special symbols in a completely randomised manner. It's nothing far from what the password managers do. The most important task for creating a password is in you ability to memorise and be able to reproduce it. If you can't, then you've ended up securing an account and you no longer own it Am no big fan of password managers, not that I don't trust it as I find them to be supper complicated and can't he easy guessed as opposed to creating passwords out of your brain but, getting to memorise it and reproduce it out of memory could be tasking bacuse, its got zero relativism as per clue to its guessing. I'll go with my brain anytime and have got my ways to archiving maximum security.",

While for those who choose to play it safe and avoid hackers hence use passwords from memory can easily be disappointed by memory and mix up the passwords for different accounts or even forget some passwords.
