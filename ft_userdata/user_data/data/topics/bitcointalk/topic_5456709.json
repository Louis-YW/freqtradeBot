The truth is that once you let go of your coins, it is not safe anymore. Once you lose control of your coins, you can no longer assume that they're safe. Indeed, banks and centralized exchanges are no different from each other. They're using their depositors' money for something else. They risk and invest and even give away and spend money they don't own. Supposing each and every depositor decides to withdraw all that they have in their accounts right now, they will all end up short.",

Encouraging CEX (especially Binance while it's under current scrutiny) is not wise.",

The only problem is the exchange is prone to attack and they could use that as a back lie after stealing funds that it was hacked. QuoteI always thought that, same as banks, I don't want to save it for long time, because banks often go bankrupt, and the owner run overseas.This is the right way to actually way to deal with exchanges. Treat it like a market place that it is supposed to be and withdraw your funds from it once you’re done. If you’re are trader and the transaction fee to actually withdraw your funds daily might be expensive then do it weekly or monthly but even at that do not have much on the exchange for this period too. If you want to trade in large number it is better to split it up in 2 or more exchanges to minimize the risk of hack or collapse of the exchange",

Just for example in Binance, we know that CZ is its owner but we don't know him personally.Now, the question is, why are we still putting money into the Binance exchange to buy Bitcoin when we don't know its owner personally? That's because many traders do trading on the Binance platform because of their trust and belief in Cz's management, that is, the trust we feel is what dictates why we still put money into it to buy Bitcoin.",

I mean, if the stock exchange, operating honestly, can generate 1 billion profit per quarter and function like that for years while developing itself and the entire industry, or it can get away with $ 10 billion today and always look back hoping that interpol is not behind the corner, then the probability of the second scenario is rather low. It is different when you see that the volume is falling, the stock exchange loses the competition and everything indicates that its business is on a downward slope. Then stealing seems to be more lucrative, especially when it comes to money that changes the owner's life (beyond a certain amount, it's not about money anymore, it's about power). BTW Imagine that you are a CZ who cheats 150 million people by doing an exit scam. That's about 2% of the population. This means that every 50th person you pass on the street has been deceived by you and wishes you the worst. Wouldn't you be afraid of a knife in the back? Plus, people know you're a billionaire who won't go to the police if your loved ones are kidnapped for ransom.Another thing is that it is a big temptation for centralized exchanges to use fractional reserve, which with poor risk management can result in a collapse like we saw with FTX. So funds are not safe even with market leaders that run profitable buisness. And fractional reserve harm bitcoin - Money creation system - is bitcoin creation resistant?",

Meaning you don't entrust too many assets to an exchange.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on June 18, 2023, 01:51:10 AMI always thought that, same as banks, I don't want to save it for long time, because banks often go bankrupt, and the owner run overseas.You are actually over-sounding this for a reason best known to you as if you were not using banks before cryptocurrency. Are there no banks that can be trusted? There are even some like Banque de France, The Washington Trust Company and others that have spent over 2 millenniums. How much has cryptocurrency spent that you are sounding this way?Besides, Bitcoin can't stand in isolation, it will always need fiat for exchange, so just find the right banks and financial partners for your convenience and trust.",

These factors include exchange's overall reputation, quality of security systems and insurance cover of its account holder's deposits. Even with all these assurances provided by an exchange. it is important to note that security systems are never 100% immune to hacking attacks, as hackers persistently search for vulnerabilities in the system to exploit it.Therefore, it is always advisable to store your funds in your personnel wallet and take measures to secure your keys.",

I simply doubt that an exchange as large as Binance can go bankrupt from one day to the next. It even settled the lawsuit against the USA's version, and things are looking quite bright now.Whether we like it or not, centralized exchanges are safe-ish and convenient to use, which are the main reasons they'll continue to be in business.

I said so because each time I look up the full meaning of what \"Exchange\" means, the meaning always remains that, Code:\"exchange is an act of exchanging or trading, or a place for conducting trading.\" In any situation where one is not carrying out any trading with their coins, it's not meant to lie on their centralized exchange accounts. That's why self-costodial wallets were built, so that when we are not making use of our coins to trade on the exchange, we can store them in our self-costodial wallets. To explore exchanges better is only to carry out trading and not to store our coins there, and I assume that whoever is still storing their coins on the exchange has not realized that exchanges are not for storing coins and also has not realized the risks involved. I remembered I had saved coins on the exchange before for some weeks and months, but those days of such a foolish act are over.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",
