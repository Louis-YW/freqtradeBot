There are many complaints about spam and other issues on this platform. You can simply ask members to share their findings here.",

So you need to have a rethink about what you are asking and make another strategy for it.Feels like you just read title and not understanding the content. Glory? Authority?  Now you just accused someone just by reading the title lol.The whole purpose of OP nothing but good. You just tell him that this site a scam exchange with proof ofc, and you got paid, you can post it on scam accusation board too. Benefits? you got paid and shared important warnings to people to stay away of these scams.The whole doubt of this thread, is only if op is paying or not, its hard to proceed unless theres a middle man securing the payment.",

However, I think the best thing you can do is make the newbie know that there is some scam exchange site that operated like genuine exchange so that can be more careful.In the meantime, it will be nice to be more specific about what you mean when you said new one because of the people that might be interested in your offer.",
