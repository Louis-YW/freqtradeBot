Â On this site I like everything - the design, the speed of the game, convenient layout, nice sound, and most importantly, you can hide the treacherous button maxbet)) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Not a bad dice ... The design is great nothing superfluous, I do not like the lack of sound, and that maxbet button is always pressed at an unnecessary moment)There is no graph of statistics, this is also inconvenient. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Oh That's not my dice )) I'd better go play the piano)))) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â Very interesting game design, has all the features, especially like the picture) when you lose a lot will howl like a wolf....

I play dice in casinos where I am active, I like it when there are more options for auto and live stats, and if a casino has both I will play more often, if not it will be just a few throws from time to time.

The only one that I remember is Luckybit.On your list again, wintomato's dice design seems too crowded and they mix different colors which doesn't look good in my eyes. I don't know if what is the name of the second and third dice site in your pic but anyway my favorite dice site is not in your list. It was called Primedice. I'm sure a lot of users here already heard of it but who wouldn't be when they are one of the OGs when it comes to dice game.",

I've played on the crypto.games site, but I haven't played for a long time, it's hard to get a win there, I I prefer to use Stake because I still often get wins while playing dice and using the martingale strategy and even then I play by controlling the rhythm of the game so I'm not too passionate or greedy using small bets.I've also played craps on primedice but not so much sometimes on weekends, but it seems you haven't added primedice to the list because they are also the oldest dice site in this forum compared to some of the other dice sites in the list",

When I keep on losing I just take a break and try with those platforms. Those were also really good, but the light graphic and the access to play on the smartphone makes me choose Stake. Here we were able to understand things better than other platforms, which means even a first time user will find it easier to use.",

They're not that different when compared to the other top dice sites but what made them stand out from the other dice sites at that time was their flash betting. I would also consider Bustadice as one of the best but i'm not too familiar with using the scripts on Bustadice so they're my second best. If only Yolodice hasn't closed down they'd be my first pick instead of Bitsler and what I liked about their dice are the betting speeds and the range of numbers you can roll from.",

And as you said, the \"bet max\" button is not existing which keeps us from endangering our funds into just one shot failure.

I don't think there is one that is best of all when it comes to that area. Before, Yolodice was a good site to play and the UI has a dark mode that helps those who don't like bright lights.
