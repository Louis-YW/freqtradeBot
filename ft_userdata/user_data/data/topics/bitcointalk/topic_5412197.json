I dont think there be any problem with this, what you think?It's definitely a security risk.Even using the same private key or seed phrase across multiple bitcoin wallets is a security risk. The more different pieces of software you import a key or seed phrase to, then the more potential security bugs or vulnerabilities you expose it to, and the more chance of something going wrong. I don't use Litecoin or Dogecoin, but given that Doge is a literal memecoin, then I would bet a lot of bitcoin on the fact that many of its wallets and other software are far more buggy and less secure than similar bitcoin wallets. Even if your key isn't stolen directly, then something fairly simple like reusing r values can result in your private key being calculated by an attacker.I wouldn't even use the same private key to generate both a legacy and a segwit address in bitcoin. I think it's a bad idea to use the same private key across different coins.",

Dogecoin is nothing but a marketing scam. I'm convinced that more than 90% of its users hold it on centralized exchanges, not only due to scant connections but due to scant rationale; most don't even know there's an alternative.

For various reasons I wouldn't reuse a particular private key for different coins, as I can't figure out a good reason to do it! Why bother the risk?",

A better option would be to either use /dev/urandom or Bitcoin Core to generate entropy which you then paste in to your airgapped version of Ian Coleman to convert to your seed phrase.Secondly, you shouldn't do this after simply turning off your internet connection and then turning it back on again after.

I dont think there be any problem with this, what you think?For me, I don't think there is anything wrong in doing this as long as the private key is kept securely with no body having access to it except the owner.Infact, using one private key to store three different coins is actually very convenient since it relieved you the stress of having to deal with how to keep three private keys securely without worrying about misplacing one or two out of the three.But the down side (con) of this that loosing that one private key means you have lost three different coins if actually you hold those three coins controlled by that one private.I personally have one private key acrossEthereumBinance smart chainPolygonFusionAvalancheHoubi chainEtc. This is actually very convenient for me since I don't have to deal with having to device a means of making sure all the private keys to this different chains are kept safe , since its just one controlling them all, but like I said before, loosing this one private key is a disaster as it will mean loosing all the assets stored on all this different chains, it is like loosing the master key that opens every door in the house.",
