  "content": "Enjin coin was one of my first buys when I first started crypto in February this year.It is now one of the smallest parts of my portfolio as I have been focusing on many others since the crash in June and have not bought as much Enjin at these lower prices which currently leaves me 32% down on my investment. The reason I haven't bought so much Enjin is purely down to believing in other crypto more and hardly hearing anything about Enjin these last 3 or 4 months which isn’t a good sign to me. I am intrigued to see how many of us hold enjin or at least rate it? For those who know of Enjin, is it worth holding or better to invest elsewhere?",

I guess you have lost lots of money on ENJ. You bought at average above 1,5 , right? Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 06, 2022, 12:49:31 AMIt is now one of the smallest parts of my portfolio as I have been focusing on many others since the crash in June and have not bought as much Enjin at these lower prices which currently leaves me 32% down on my investment. Glad to see that if you have been giving small allocation to the enjin. That was very good decision for you. Im still down alot in my investment too.  Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 06, 2022, 12:49:31 AMThe reason I haven't bought so much Enjin is purely down to believing in other crypto more and hardly hearing anything about Enjin these last 3 or 4 months which isn’t a good sign to me.Me too, i rarely heard a good news came to the enjin again. It seems like that this token is not a good thing anymore. I personally prefer to take sandbox rather than enjin.

For those who know of Enjin, is it worth holding or better to invest elsewhere? That doesn't to be look good as investment for now, i prefer to take sandbox rather than enjin caused by sandbox is also having so many active users than enjin.",

I am intrigued to see how many of us hold enjin or at least rate it? For those who know of Enjin, is it worth holding or better to invest elsewhere? Right now Enjin is one of the coins that have low volume and out of hype. I used to trade it when their main games were poppin' but now I don't see many people talk about Enjin and their games. I don't know what developers think but I believe Enjin still have some potential. I wouldn't say I'm bullish specifically on Enjin but when we see a general rise in the crypto market Enjin will definitely take part of it. Current prices look like a good buying opportunity considering it's almost %90 down to all time high price. I suggest small part of your portfolio can stay in ENJ as I'll do the same.",

Don’t feel it is worth selling just yet being 32% down may as well hold and see what happens I hope it speeds up soon. Because they will pass Polkadot as layer 2 network. They will also launch side projects such as Efinity and NFT.io. In addition, enjin wallet 2.0 will be soon in the wallet update. While all of this is going on, I think it will be a wiggle. The drop from 4 dollars was very fast, and the bull season was not very productive because there was no product that was working properly. Either they could not grow these products or they are waiting for the right time.",

Problem with most projects is that in terms of price it usually only gets one massive push and then traders move on to newer projects to push.  Haven't checked back in awhile but if you believe they will continue to press forward stick around.  You never know could hit big if they come through.  Always liked the idea of enjin just never knew if they could make it a reality.",

There is also a lot of platforms that offers easy minting of NFT that defeat the sole purpose of this project. NFT is not hype anymore while the project itself has a lot of competitors. It's not bad to still hold or accumulate some of it on the current price but don't expect that it will really that much again without a new hype on NFT market.",

That deacreases your lose in enjin but this token is not worthy anymore to hold other than betting with the bull market that can come anytime. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 06, 2022, 12:31:52 PMMy main Metaverse play is Decentraland which I have been buying weekly this year.Decentraland looked good in the past but not for this time. I think that you can re consider to invest in another metaverse. The metaverse like sandbox was offering gradual reward for their active users. I have been buying heavily when the price reached at the bottom (btc price 18k 19k)I have not yet sold my sandbox token caused by i staked it and playing the metaverse gradually. Why are you seeing decentraland as a good investment than any other metaverse like sandbox? Tbh if decentraland has a horrible graphic compared with sandbox. It's poorly built by the developers. No reward or anything. T",
