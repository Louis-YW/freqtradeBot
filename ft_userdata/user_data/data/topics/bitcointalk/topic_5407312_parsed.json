Neither it’s great to ask for money/BTC first.You can send the gift card first to users who are trusted, but yes don’t send these to newbies at first.Moreover for a better transaction and safety protocols, deal with ESCROW. While dealing with ESCROW, both the buyer and seller have protections against each other.Also you may find potential customers for your gift cards in Digital Goods https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=93.0 section.Also a pro tip:- mention which country amazon gift card it is for more customers to show interest in your offer.",

At the time of sell which was a little after this post $500 in btc was worth 0.0223 which is what I sold it for... At the time of post $500 of btc was 0.0225 on preev.com ( I can practically hear your bubble popping cause your not getting your way) guess what? Btc price changes literally everything second of every day. I was looking for a 1:1 rate and I got what I needed( giftcard was sold and it's completely irrelevant what you think) I only had one to sell and I wasn't out to screw anyone over but I'm not signing up to be screwed over either.

There goes all that overpowered ego of yours right out the window. God damned idiot.Dude, even at 1:1 your card is overpriced af with a bitcoin exchange. This what I pointed out in my first reply.I have purchased same amount for 400 USD from this place. And they are still selling Amazon cards come with a huge risk too(stolen cards suspend your accoint reak quick). This is why I mentioned purse.io or a trusted seller on this forum(this way at least you can get your money back) and both option will cost like 400 USD for a 500 USD Amzn purchase +you will get safety.Your card was way overpriced.

Period.My card was spot on accurately fairly priced. Period. Your only upset because you think this world owes you shit when it dont. Equal value equal fair value, your so fucking stupid, get your entitled ass out of here. Also the might've could've bullshit is just that bullshit. Card wasn't stolen I sold it for the same value that was on the card and that's that. The only reason you think my card was overpriced is because I didn't sell for less then equivalent value period. ( There's good your ego out the window again) you reference that stolen cards will get your Amazon account shut down like it had any relevance to this sell. The card was originally PURCHASED by me at a fucking Walgreens and I hate to break it to your but if your stealing shit to sell it for Bitcoin your a god damned pussy. You want something then man the fuck up and earn it, get that cowardly bullshit outta my face, bitch.",
