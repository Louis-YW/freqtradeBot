But with regards to the world that we live in, we really can't stress that enough. We need to educate ourselves on safe practices here, online and offline so that we will not be another statistics to the growing crypto enthusiast who lost it to this criminals.",

Ransomwares won't do anything to the hostage data, they are like some kind of a car boot for your database where you can't do a thing about it until you've paid for it but they can't really steal the car but they can inconvenience you, that's how ransomware works I think or how I understand it works.",

Stronger regulation of cryptocurrency will not salvage this problem. Individual vigilance helps.

So company should first teach their employees to catch first sign that they have been a target, like phishing emails and that they should stay away with it.Same for crypto users, don't simply trust anyone, even if it looks real and you know who send the email, we need to be very cautious and think many times before clicking any link.

I appreciate it that they don't physically hurt people to rob companies, but they're still criminals, and them using Bitcoin doesn't help its reputation (even though it's unfair to blame Bitcoin in this case). I can see articles claiming that the usage of Bitcoin is very common for ransomware attacks, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. For example, this academic paper claims that, since transactions are done via Bitcoin, and then criminals need to cash them out, it's often possible to trace and track down these activities.I can also see that there are cyber ransomware insurance companies for those who want protection against this kind of situation, which I believe makes sense if it's a rich company or individual.",
