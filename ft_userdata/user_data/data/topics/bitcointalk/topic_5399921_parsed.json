  "content": "i think this is the first time in bitcoin history that bitcoin made 8 red candles on weekly candle. this shows the bear market is not over yet. because the seller still dominates the market. but it looks like the red candle is getting thinner. Will this be a sign that there will be a green candle in the next candle (next week)? and allows bitcoin to return to its bull market. or will continue the decline as many people fear.but what is clear is this is the first time bitcoin has made a red candle 8 times in a row in a weekly candle.what is this sign?",

      "body": "First, this should be moved into the \"Speculation\" subforum, please give it a more meaningful title (and edit the image insertion as it's not shown currently. Thanks!Second, Bitcoin does not have trading hours, so the \"daily\" and \"weekly candles\" don't really make sense, because depending on your timezone your candles will look different*. For example, the candles of the last three weeks have increasingly higher lows, although they also have lower highs. So what's currently happening is a triangle pattern pointing approximately to the price of ~29-29.5K.What is true is that there was no strong bounce until now - which is a sign that traders are still \"waiting\" for something to happen, e.g. for a retest (and confirmation) of the lows, or of higher highs forming, at least for a dead cat bounce. I guess this is due that the Terra/Luna crash was shocking for many; it was a top altcoin and top stablecoin and many probably lost lots of money, so they need time to get over it.I don't rule out a lower low this week, but I wouldn't bet on it either. The worst may be over for now, if we're in a mid-term bear market then we may have lower lows in 2-3 months and then \"the real bottom\".*there may however be traders and trading bots which take them into account.",

Especially with all these bad earnings. 8 weeks ago the news was not too good either. starting from America's policy related to interest rates. followed by the recent incident with Luna Terra. it was enough to make investors panic.but good news came from the microstrategy team namely Michael Saylor, the CEO, and Co-founder of Microstrategy as reported in cryptopolitan Quote Michael Saylor, the CEO, and Co-founder of Microstrategy, has allayed fears over the recent decline posted in the crypto market. According to the Microstrategy boss, this recent crash will position Bitcoin for greater things to come. Notably, the current crypto market crash has been ongoing for weeks, with more tokens joining the bearish party. The crash was triggered by fear due to the massive decline witnessed by Terra’s native token, LUNA, weeks ago. note: Microstrategy holds more than 129,000 BitcoinAnd Michael Saylor predicts increased Bitcoin adoption. Sourch Linkbut still it is not clear to what extent this decline. and what is clear is that it is most likely after this crash that bitcoin adoption can be faster and more numerous",

The problem for the little man is that he doesn't have the extra money to invest in anything because he has fallen victim to inflation that has diminished the value of his money - and unfortunately Bitcoin hasn't helped him if he invested during the bull run hoping the price would reach at least $100k.Change for the better next week? If you don't know about some super good news that isn't yet publicly known, don't hope for better than what we have now - it's much more likely to expect an even bigger drop, but it's a reality and you shouldn't make a tragedy out of it.",

You can have a lot of red candles that barely move the price and you can have a single one that takes us down by 30% what would you rather have? If you really want to get into details just check how much we were going down each week in 2018 and what volume that was and compare it to what's happening now. In February 2018 we went down 30% in 1 week with volume reaching 70k bitcoins on bitfinex alone. In that \"big crash\" in May (which really wasn't big) the weekly volume was just 10k bitcoins. This tells a lot about how much supply is being held and how little is being used to determine fiat price. The market is much more mature.",

I never know if it's the first time in history, but I'm sure it's not something that means bad for bitcoin. The down-trend isn't over yet, that's possible but stay positive because it's actually a good time to buy and hold on to it for the long term. Try to buy on every drop for whatever you can afford to lose, it will benefit you in the long term as I believe higher ATH awaits in the future. DWYORBut remember, don't take anything that people suggest as financial advice, you must stay focused on your stance based on the analysis you make. So far I'm trying to buy it and hold it for the long term, hopefully it will benefit me in the long term. I'm very sure about that.",
