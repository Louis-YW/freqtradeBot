One can invest in Bitcoin as it pleases them but to be in the safe side, it is best taking advantage of the bear market to take your position. Buying at that time puts you in a better profit stand as it approaches bull run for those in a long term holding plans. When investing, you should know that it is best to invest with your spare cash or funds you could afford to lose.As for your safety, do not trust third party exchange with your assets because they own the private key to the wallet holding your assets so in that case it doesn't belong to you but them since it is under their custody and they can decide whatever measures as it pleases them before you could access it. Make sure to keep your assets under your custody as you have the sole control over them. Save or keep your private keys in a secured place only you have access to for the safety of your assets.",

You can buy bitcoin keep it until profitable and the story before starting is the capital, and the story behind when is the right time to take profits Like when I can't advise you how you should eat a sandwich, but if you have it, you should just taste it. Similarly, bitcoin has many problems that cannot be expressed through just a few opinions, so I still highly encourage people to research it carefully before starting to do something.

If you are familiar with DCA or dollar cost averaging you can do it anytime. But if you have a tight budget I think bear market will be the best time to invest as you can place the best entry while the price is quite lower.2. First acquire knowledge, do your own due deligence, set your budget and then jump into the actual thing. 3. If you are a long term hodler you don't need to take time checking it every single day but if you still insist and you also have other business then you need time management. 4. If you have enough knowledge and capital then you can start right away but remember crypto is volatile it can always turn against your decisions so be aware of that. Just keep calm and buy as long as you can.",

When it goes 50% lower than its last ATH, it is usually a very good time to get in with big chunk of money. If bitcoin is at its ATH or near ATH, then start DCA'ing because the chances are quite high that bitcoin won't be able to go much higher from there. Also decide on the risk levels you are willing to take. For example if you think you shouldn't risk more than 5% of your total wealth on btc, stop investing when you reach that percentage and start working on your sell strategies now instead of buying more. If you carry more risks than you could afford to take, you will make stupid decisions in the future. Risk management is essential.",

During the bearish period. Doesn't seem reasonable, but in this period the price of Bitcoin reduces drastically and people sell out their assets due to fear. The type of people who usually do these are those without full knowledge of how the Bitcoin market works. You buy during this period, of course after obtaining proper knowledge of the market too, so you don't purchase it and it becomes a loss.2. This question is a little bit vague. planning for what exactly? If it's planning to invest in Bitcoin then you can start by getting a job, saving, reading investment books, and taking action. You may fail, you will fail, but it's an experience you'll need for a bigger quest or goal.3. Review. Track your progress. Literally, follow up by tracking your progress.4. No one is ever ready. ( There's a high probability this is from a movie). Take action, you will fail, get up and learn. Waiting till you're ready may take forever.",

I would suggest learning about the different kinds of things you can do with bitcoin aside from just holding.
