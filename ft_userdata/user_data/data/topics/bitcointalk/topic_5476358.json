  "content": "Bitcoin prices have been on the rise for the past two to three weeks, with no significant correction observed during this period. Currently, the bitcoin price hovers around $39,300. The surge in bitcoin prices can be attributed to the news of ETF approval circulating in the market.However, what is your opinion? Do you anticipate a potential drop in the bitcoin price, revisiting $30,000 after reaching $40,000, or do you believe it will continue its upward trajectory towards $50,000?",

Even if it has been approved, the price of bitcoin will increase over $40000 if It has not increased to the price before the approval. Bear market may still come, but not until spot bitcoin ETF has been approved after the price has first continue to increase significantly after the approval. I mean after the approval, the price will also still increase, then little bear market may come before halving but which may not be significant at all.",

It is my prediction but it is good to hold your coins, don't sell it before or shortly after the halving. When a bull run starts after 2024 halving, price will be higher than $40,000.Quote from: Oshosondy on December 03, 2023, 09:55:12 AMI do not think there will be any significant drop until spot bitcoin ETF has been approved.

Even in a massive parabolic bull run, there will be many big corrections and with good recovery of Bitcoin during 2023, so far there is not big correction.I am not surprised in last days of this year or early days of 2024, there will be big corrections. Those big corrections are healthy to get rid of gamblers and prepare for a healthier bull run in 2024 with a halving.",

But we should have nothing to worry about, as long as we are holding tight and focusing on our goal in waiting for the bull season, we have nothing to lose as we never sell any. Let us embrace and understand what the volatility looks like, it pumps today and it may dump or pump by tomorrow.

While the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs could have a positive impact on bitcoin prices, it is not guaranteed. Additionally, the probability of a bear market is always a possibility and can be affected by different market conditions. But I think Bitcoin price is expecting a possible correction, it might take a correction after reaching $40k. if $39k to $40k could be a lot of targets to set as those holding bitcoin from the bottom might have a target I think is logical but not very logical. But anything can happen, the event is only hypothetical.",

We know that ETF have a big impact on prices in the market regardless of the negatives and positives but for retail this kind of momentum can be utilized well so that price drops will always be anticipated to buy more. I'm not worried if christmas Day is the point where prices drop but  next year is already a tight grip that should be ready to be welcomed.  Touching $50,000 by the  end of the year doesn't  seem difficult if you look at the chart dated October 1-31 Bitcoin gave strength to ±$7,700. And from November 1-30 the Bitcoin price pushed up to ±$3,800. So it will be very interesting if the end of the year should touch $50,000  then a major push of ±$11,000 should be seen over the next 4 weeks.",

In a few days, we can hit the 40k+ target and from that range, there will be major resistance in the path towards the 47K almost and I'm expecting a small consolidating area between the $41k to $43k.Hmm, At the same time OP, I think the drop to the 30k is not logical according to the latest developments and market sentiments. keep the safe side it's the crypto market you never know until or unless a black swan event happens market is going to continue with its highly bullish rally. December will be a good month at least this is what i think.",

I might be wrong, but I am getting a feeling that this might happen. As soon as Bitcoins crosses 40k usd, all the short term holders will start selling the coins, which will reduce the demand to buy the coins. Hence we might see small set back in the coin. Else reverse can also happen if the demand increases and we might see Bitcoins crossing 50k usd. So let’s hope for the best.",

For now the only bad news I see is the Binance being sued by the SEC. I think that was still a threat to the price of BTC as Binance is a huge crypto exchange and BTC is the main crypto. Not only BTC actually but other coins can also be affected with it.Let us only hope for the best though. It is still best to see a good year end. It can also give us a good luck seeing a new year with a positivity even only in the price of the coins and not really to the happenings around.",
