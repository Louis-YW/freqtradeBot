The university is an institution established to produce individuals that would contribute positively to the development of the society. And they actualize this goals through teaching, research and community development. I assume you were a Professor in one or few universities in your country and it is possible that through observation the university you once taught promoted violence. Maybe the government of your country are mismanaging universities making them to derail from their core functions. But I can comfortable state that almost all universities in the world promotes peace and peaceful coexistence. And most university graduates are not worthless like you stated because they are contributing greatly to the development of their country multidimensionally .",

The professor believes that all universities promote violence and label graduates as useless scumbags who seek to harm others. No matter what he went through at university or how he was treated, he does not have the audacity to accuse universities of promoting violence. Generalizing it is very bad, even though we cannot put ourselves in his shoes to understand how he feels.We all have different perspectives on universities, regardless of where we come from. We are all aware that the majority of institutions all over the world support peaceful cooperation amongst all of us. Despite their shortcomings, I have never heard a university promote violence. Those are terrible remarks to employ by a professor who appears to be one.",

University is a place where you acquire new knowledge and skills with the aid of making research. Graduates are decent and respected people in the society, when you pass through the university, you will adopt an outstanding life style that will make you think beyond violence.

It makes more sense to believe that all universities are fucked up (well, at least all universities in the USA), and I have not encountered any evidence that will lead me to believe otherwise. If people in academia hate me for calling out academic institutions, then that only convinces me that those haters are a part of the problem and that they are violent sociopaths as well.

I will do no such thing. The reason you say that I have mental issues is because you are a bloodthirsty monster who has absolutely no place in decent society. You just want me to get fucking murdered and you also want my dead body to be gangraped by people like Jeffrey Dahmer and Elon Musk (who murders monkeys). If my experience does not reflect the experience of others, then that just means that academic institutions hate me and want to see me suffer. This is really bad. This is evil Nazism.I have some news for you. You are just like the Nazis who were 'just following orders'. You are sheep. You cannot see when institutions are doing wrong.
