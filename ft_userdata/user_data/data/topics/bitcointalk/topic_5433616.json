  "content": "Bitcoin have indicated some positive price movement in the early hours of today 9-01-2023 haven't stayed down below that price for several weeks back and haven't rely around $16,000 price for over the past few weeks. Today bitcoin price suggested another new price movement direction and at the moment Bitcoin is around $17,277 which is a significant improvement. Most especially for now as the market have struggle for long to resist a further pull back since the past weeks, even some speculators predicted a $15,000 low before recovery. But at the moment bitcoin have broken that benchmark and if the present price is sustain for long and possible more price increase occurs it will become clear that we should expect more bitcoin price improvement in this first quarter of 2023.",

      "body": "Today Bitcoin holders in large numbers have seen the very sweet reality of the Bitcoin price having broken through the $17K level this month which is still a very good start to the year. And there is a possibility that it is true as you said that if this price level can last longer, especially this month. So it would be reasonable to expect more increases in Bitcoin after the month is over or within the first quarter of the year.I personally am very happy to see that Bitcoin can increase again at the beginning of this year because this is what everyone, including speculators, expected during the past year when it was still in a bearish condition. And it would be extraordinary if in the first quarter of this year Bitcoin could immediately get a slow price level recovery in the market.",

There is no path for bitcoin to sustain greater than 10 consecutive days above $18k this year. We could possibly see it in 20-30 years when bitcoin is a digital collector's item, but by that time the cheapest Toyota EV will cost over $200k and a starter home will be over $2m.",

It is not only related to Bitcoin, but many markets started to rise, and perhaps the reason is the US employment data, which may indicate a slowdown in the pace of interest rate hikes that the Federal Reserve may carry out.the markets are preparing themselves for the next Federal Reserve meeting, which if it goes in the same direction as expectations, we will witness more rise, or a rebound to levels closer to $16,000.This is an overview of the market trend.Quote    S&P Futures 3,932.25 +0.43%    Dow Futures 33,878.00 +0.31%    Nasdaq Futures 11,171.75 +0.52%    Russell 2000 Futures 1,811.50 +0.45%    Crude Oil 76.27 +3.39%    Gold 1,879.50 +0.52%    Silver 24.07 +0.37%    EUR/USD 1.0696 +0.4493%The price of $17,000 is nothing more than a convergence level, more than a psychological level, which means that we need to break the top at $19,000 to confirm the rise.",

Now we will see if this continues breaking over $20k or we will sit on this new price for a while. It's been a while since we haven't seen a major negative news so yeah the market should breath better now. Even though there are people who try to control their excitement for a while, that still can't do a harm in the market since they won't be selling but they may continue buying more coins so we can witness an increase after some time. If you ask me if this will stay or not, of course, I will gladly say yes but for some, they can say that it's too early to tell yet.",

I am positive that this current market condition will continue and we go passed the face of the Bitcoin downtrend, even if we don't see any significant bull market.",

That doesn't mean that something like this has to be a real issue, it's going to happen until the bulls win.We just need one win, if we could get that, all the other bear wins will not matter.

So clap back to all investors and speculators who invest again.I'd say though that we should look at how long we can maintain it, or the question is if we can sustain this price or there will be a lot of sell off for short term profits. Specially those who buy at the lowest low around November at $15,500. Those short term holders might do it if we somewhat goes to $17,500. So we will see as I'm not that confident with this break out run until we settled first and have a sustain momentum.",

Everytime the market becomes bullish, news relative to the increase surfaces the web but there ain't any so if there will be a sudden increase at this point, I doubt that it would be continuous. There was a huge downfall fro its ATH so I guess there should be something 'big' in order to be back to its original price and that is what I am hoping for if not this year, for next year, in relation with the next anticipated Bitcoin halving. But ofcourse if it is possible for the increase to take place earlier, then that would be better for sure.",

If it does though, its definitely possible to start at 17k+ level right away and go to a great level after that, it will definitely have some good standing ground because we have built a great support here.",

We could possibly see it in 20-30 years when bitcoin is a digital collector's item, but by that time the cheapest Toyota EV will cost over $100k and a starter home will be over $1m.17k is just the very lowest bar, I'd argue 20k is more like the proper first rung on any ladder to consider a change in direction or proper move up.     I dont agree on most points above but I do like the idea you really dont take a price as a serious statement to discuss until its maintained that level or higher for 5 days or more.   Basically 5 days as a working week or the full week is a fairly low ask.   The reason why you wait 5 days and also why the other points are wrong is that volatility exists.  We can reach any price in theory when weighing in volatility in a price, this is not a steady ship we're on its in fact all over the place and price will swing wild high and low inaccurately.    I will also argue that is why BTC will be used so long as it is useful to a global online audience.  Why would you state inflation in all other assets but not Bitcoin, can we agree if its used the price goes up.   Disagree outside of that that you decided BTC is not useful to you personally so perhaps you cannot envisage anyone else using BTC.   BTC is not a perfectly assured physical asset, it is speculative but it also will continue to be used so presuming only negative progression in price from here is not adding up.    I'll be waiting for anything better to be invented, of course society does benefit when new improved assets arrive especially when more efficient so price negative for one thing is often more then just inflation its the rebalance to greater efficiency elsewhere; right now all I see is very likely continued currency failure not improvements.   Society will suffer from that failure, anything more reliable will be positive imo.",
