  "content": "https://i.imgur.com/qIOtKBF.pngProsecute suspected fraud on major exchanges.The project we know has made a reservation for listing on an exchange called okx.Then, sent them the $ they asked for and was promised a 100% refund if the listing was revoked at any time.And about 4 months passed, and okx did not approve the listing.So rightfully asked for a 100% refund under the contract, but they said they would deduct about 15%. That is, the 100% refund they promised was proven false.And, by tracking their accounts, it was confirmed that several people already divided the money like a multi-level company.However, the project team recognized that they had made the wrong choice, gave up 15%, and requested a refund of the remaining amount.However, okx initially paid a small amount, constantly delayed the date, and eventually started acting suspiciously of refusal to pay.They sent a small amount of money in several installments, and the refund has not been completed even after more than 50 days have passed.Their excuses were changed from time to time, and the refund team leader, \"Tom Jung\", continued to make excuses.At first, they lied that the system would automatically pay in installments,Second, it will be refunded soon, so sending $1k first is the refund signal.Thirdly, they said that it was a holiday period and they would return it all within that period,They didn't complete the refund after all, even after the holidays.It was all just a joke on their comedy.With these examples, we indirectly realized that the top exchanges in the industry are fraudulent organizations such as ftx. As this appears to be a sign of a huge financial scam that will affect many potential project owners,We decided to proceed with these warnings to prevent numerous damages.I sincerely hope that many people will sympathize with us, join us, and root out these social evils.We will soon share the okx listing reservation notarization promised by the project team, detailed information about the okx China refund team, and submit evidence of the trading account tracking, revealing that this is the truth.We will gather all the evidence soon and update it.We will also share this with the numerous social and scam reporting communities we know.* Evidence such as the okx listing contract will be shared soon.",

It works like multi-level stake sharing.So it will take months for them to return all their money, or financial fraud will result in them refusing to refund it.Those preparing for the project should beware of these financial scams by OKX.What do you mean by return? Are you a token owner that list on the Okx?You should clarify your statement on what kind of return you are expecting because listing fee is none refundable and you should read carefully the contract before paying the fee. In case that you are pertaining on the return in terms of token price growth then you should clarify this to the team during your initial conversation.I believe you are just expecting what the OKX team didnâ€™t promised you in exchange for paying the listing fee based on your current statement.",

You should add more evidence here, so that it is easier for crypto users to understand why not to do business with this company. So try to make this thread more informative, so that it is easy for everyone to understand.",

Do you mean the official OKX platform, or have you dealt with another domain impersonating the same name? Your topic seems somewhat vague, how much was the listing fee? And why did you want them to refund the fees? Was this part of their contract and agreement with you? Where did you message the platform team you mean? You must provide us with screenshots and PM/Chat Logs of the conversation so that we can understand the topic clearly. Also, do you have a currency? What is the name of your currency? What is your role in the currency project? I hope to answer my questions, thank you",
