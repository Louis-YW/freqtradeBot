Tools can only assist you a bit but final decision must come from your own mind. Its also very unfortunante to see how people are using new inventions like ChatGPT, students are using it to write essay for them while some canidates are using it to pass interview questions etc. Such tools should only be used as secondary source of info primary must be your own mind.",

To be honest, I didn't bother to read it or check whether these predictions are correct. When there are headlines and articles about it I guess some people are already using ChatGPT tips for trading, but I am not sure how accurate those predictions are... I tried to find some stats about it, but nobody published anything about it yet.",

      "body": "So instead of asking the people in this forum, why not ask ChatGPT itself?   ChatGPT is not a fortune teller that predicts the future on speculative kinds of stuff like the future price of bitcoin or who wins a fight between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk. But in the near future, it may give limited answers but based only on specific indicators. For example, ChatGPT in the future might answer your question on the bitcoin price trends in the next few days based on Fibonacci and other trading indicators you mentioned in the question. That would be very cool as it saves us time and effort while freeing us from possible human errors.",

I can tell you that there has been a few attempts by the \"trading bot\" community to build AI related stuff, basically machine learning and it hasn't been that awesome. I used to sell Gunbot and it did exactly what you tell it to do, which is great if you are a good trader, if you are a moron like me then its a useless product, and they worked on AI for a while too, meaning machine learning, yet it didn't really made it that much better to be fair.",

If there's one thing an A.I. can help you, it's by asking for a script that you can use to automate your trading based on your strategy. And you can only do so if you are proficient in programming, have a trading strategy in place, and know how to trade.Trust me, that chatbot is pretty good in providing source code that only needs a few tweaks based on your liking.",

If they could be used to replace people, perhaps their inventors would have become rich without having to sell them for our use. Whether it's ChatGPT or any other AI, it only aids and helps us get more information, it can't replace us. It's strange that people believe in an AI that operates machines, and don't believe in their own abilities.",
