I'm a trader myself and I can surely say that trading is a very risky thing for most people, and the main reason for such risk is that people want huge profits in short time which isn't likely to happen. If you really want to have better profits as a trader then you'll have to be patient and give proper time to master a trading strategy and once you master it then only make trades according to that strategy. The investors simply invest in an asset in this case (Bitcoin) and wait for at least 2-5 years before selling that asset to earn profits. The longer we hold the higher will be the profits and that's why people say HODL your Bitcoin if you want to have a life free from financial worries.",

Investing which you called long term and which involves low risk also may provide low profit compareed to the commutative profit of trading which will be comparatively higher. But the trading involves not only higher risk, but also higher capital in order to make good daily profits While someone who does not actually understand the market very well can invest and yet make good profits, someone who doesn't know about the charts and doesn't understand day trading will only lose all their capitals.Another consideration is the amount of time you want to give cryptocurrency. While a day trader may need to make trading their full time job. Someone investing will only make passive profits and still have time to do other things",

He just has to spend a lot of money and time to learn though. Training yourself to trade is gonna be fun but also horrifying once he experiences these I guess he can decide which route he wants to go.  To me its easier to just become a trader during a bull run and just be a long-term holder in the bear market. Just keep busy while waiting for the bull market again by becoming a gambler.",

My personal opinion is that trading means investment whether it is long term or short time trading. But in the case of short term trading, I think trading skills are more necessary, especially in the field of technical analysis. Moreover, here you have to keep an eye on the various updates related to crypto currency. So considering these aspects, I think short time trading is a little more harder than long-term trading. I am not saying that analysis is not required in the case of long term trading, but in that case, if you know some fundamental things, if you follow a DCA strategy and invest, there is a possibility of getting a good profit later. So I will tell you if you are new then start investment by managing a long term DCA. Also, if you are interested in short-term trading, then also learn about various technical analyses.",

Although you need to have some basic knowledge about Bitcoin investment, it is not as complicated as trading. The most important knowledge you need as a Bitcoin holder is how to keep your coin safe since you will be keeping it for a long time.

Both methods can be profitable if the right strategy is adopted.Which one is better if I want to invest and trade bitcoins.You already knew the difference and the risk involved in both. So, how it is still so difficult for you to decide, I think you love your money so much that now you don't want to see it moving into another form, either making you lose or profit. Well, if that's the case, then first you have to stop doing that, and should make up your mind first. What is your time period, in which you wanted to make a profit, what is your capital, because in holding we might start with lower capital but in trading, we need more money to start. In my thoughts, if I were in your place, and I have little knowledge of investing and trading, and my aim is to make a profit out of my $1000 dollars, then I would definitely go for holding, at the current moment, because the market is moving up and making trades in this highly volatile market is so the risk for a newbie. And for start doing trading, you first have to learn a lot of strategies and techniques, means, learning to trade is harder than learning the basics of Holding. Besides all this, I would go for holding, as the current market is in favor of doing holding. Let's say, you have $1000 dollars and you want to do a lump sum at the current market rate, you will get 0.03218 BTC and if you hold it till BTC reaches $100,000 or more, you will be able to make $2000 profit on your $1000 capital. This is good in my sight, but you can definitely make more in trading but you have to be careful and I don't think you can make that much money if you select the BTC pair. Maybe in Alts you can make it.",

But the experience of learning and observing the risk and on-field experience was really good. The time to learn, practice, and memorize the basics and lessons of trading are too difficult but I would say they are not that difficult and worth it.
