  "content": "We have read several information about how Bitcoiners should protect their private keys as your bitcoin security and protection remains the most imperative part of your Bitcoin life and assets. It is not overemphasized to always sort for more knowledge on how you can protect your bitcoin private keys as they are the most delicate alphanumericals that you can ever protect.Once someone is able to hack into your private key, it becomes easy to sweep your account within seconds. This is unlike the bank account passwords or Gmail passwords that will probably require some factor verifications.Never store your private key in any centralized or decentralized online data storage, none can be 100% trusted but the most salient part of this post is to bring our minds into this topic especially why it is important for you never to say your recovery seed or private key aloud because spy devices could be planted near you and will steal your information ASAP. Trust me when I say this isn't a satire as it is possible for Bezos to pick your private keys by using Alexa to record your keys, lols.Realize that self-serving voice activated services or microphone database such as Alexa and Siri amongst others can log everything and once someone is able to penetrate or hack into Amazon or Apple, your information could be shared into the Dark web or on Clearnet.So it is very important never to say your recovery seed out loud since you just can't figure out in this age, who's listening or watching you whilst you're alone in your bedroom with your gadgets. Don't mention your recovery seed in a phone conversation with a friend or family,  even when you're calling through end-to-end encrypted applications such as WhatsApp.Your gadgets could be the spy agents too.Lastly, whenever you work on your recovery seed, put your mobile phones in another room, put a tape over your webcams as an added security measures and never do anything with your Bitcoin in a public space like McDonald's or Chicken Republic that is full of listening devices. Don't be carried away.A photo of Mark Zuckerberg's computer Webcam covered with a masking tape will go a long way to solidify my claims.Source: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/mark-zuckerberg-puts-tape-webcam/story?id=40040340",

Some wallets are suggesting iCloiud or Google Cloud, but manual backup offline on a paper or metallic sheet like stainless steel or titanium is the best.",

Using a wallet in an online device is a practice that should be discouraged because it is the fundamental that brings all these ways of exposing keys and seed phrase. You can expose your private keys and seed by downloading the wrong applications and malware, you can even download the wrong keyboard on your devices and when you have a wallet installed in it, the chances of becoming a victim will be high.QuoteSo it is very important never to say your recovery seed out loud since you just can't figure out in this age, who's listening or watching you whilst you're alone in your bedroom with your gadgets.

Don't be carried away.What you don't know will kill you slowly without knowing where it's coming from, the best way to avoid this is to never use a wallet that's connected online, this is what most centralized exchanges do all the time, it's better to buy and used a hardware wallet or an air gap device to manage your seed phrase, private keys and sign transactions. There is no amount of peace that comes with when you do the right thing than taking a cure while doing the wrong thing.If you value your privacy, it's even better to use a hardware wallet than a coin that is coming from a centralized exchange because these days, the bitcoins are KYC and that is detrimental to your privacy, anyone can spy on what you do and how you spend your coins.",

So it doesn't matter that we hear about keeping our passwords and seed phrase safe and secured every time, the information should be ever green in our memory. One of the essence of holding bitcoin, is to safeguard it in our wallet, and if our the wallet address is lost or compromised, then the bitcoin is at risk of been lost forever or stollen.The first wallet that I ever opened, which I ignorantly misplaced the piece of paper where I wrote the password that very day without knowing, and the seed phrase that I saw later wasn't complete, I still have the coinomi wallet and the bitcoin inside it, but I can not send it. I only use the bitcoin inside the wallet to see price fluctuations, nothing more. It is a very important and bitter lesson for me anytime that is open it. Now that bitcoin price is pumping, I can only watch it grow without selling it, probably forever.",

Some people are showing off and that makes many issues for them. If you have bitcoins are you are investing in cryptocurrency then why you are talking loudly in public or with friends just to get attention or feel dominant in your friends? Maybe after doing that someone spies on you and uses a small microphone or Seri or Alexa to get your information. My suggestion on this is to not say a single word to anyone about your Bitcoin assets or phrase and the best thing for you keeping your phrase safe is to note down it on paper and keep it in locker when you need to collect it.",

Some time hackers may also pretend to be helpers to some people and in a bit to get a lost account some people have given out their seed phrase not knowing that they are giving it to scammers I believe these are the only ways people give out their seed phrase to other people I doubt if someone can go about doing otherwise unless such person is sick.",

Mostly newbie when they create some wallet and when they got some new account in any exchange then if they have some problems in the account or transferring some funds to another account then if they didn't know how to do,  then they give their recovery phrase or their passwords to other. Which is completely wrong and in this way most of the users wallet has been stolen and they was in loss.",
