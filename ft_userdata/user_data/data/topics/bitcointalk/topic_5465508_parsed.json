Even some loaning apps that still takes informations from their customers still experiences defaulter not to talk of one that they have nothing to lose from.

No nothing like that.

NO NAMES OR ID NO KYC. Yes it's great project !It sounds great to have loans without collateral but I still think that how can you provide those loans? Do you need any proof from the owner of a wallet or you need some other details in order to proceed the loan? Because it seems strange to me that if we have funds in my wallet then you'll give us loans of 5-10% and that without any names or KYC verification. I think you haven't explained in detail that how this type of loan scheme works. I don't know about others but I have noticed that you have some difficulty to explain things in detail and because of that I think you aren't fluent in English language. I think it would be better if you can explain in detail that how a system like that works where a bank or entity gives loans to users who have funds in their own wallets. I believe if that thing is true then you may get scammed many times by offering a service like that and the ones who took loan from you can run away with it without any issues. Explain in detail about your scheme so we can understand fully that how it works.",

Again, for there not to be a collateral abs the consequences of defaulting loan is not getting another loan is a pure red flag. In the other words, the project is sounding like, accumulate plenty coins in your wallet, apply for a loan so that we can have access to the funds in your wallet.",

And why not give users returns using USDT.Will the user get the full value of the loan, or will he get 10% first?If the deposit is in Bitcoin and he will get a loan + 10% in USDT, how can you guarantee that he will repayyou  back?",
