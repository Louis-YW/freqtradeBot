Quote from: Awan putih yang cantik on January 17, 2023, 03:36:21 PMis it too late to invest in bitcoin?because I saw on the internet that bitcoin is currently experiencing an increase.There were people back in 2015-16 who said we missed the boat when prices were very low so this is not a new concept but for me when you think of investing in it it's the best time keeping in mind you have long term holding without selling in future dips and that will be profitable for you.You must be aware about the market risk and invest what you can afford to loose a friendly advice to you.But keep faith and patience you won't regret it.Even if you have invested at $20k and holding for 5+ years you will get lot of returns say we hit the ATH of $68k also then also you will gain much out of your investment so don't think too much.But remember investing is one part and keeping it securely for all these years is also hard task so best is to use hardware wallets if you can and read about them here or non custodial wallets like Electrum which don't save your keys.You need to backup your seed phrase on offline storage safely which is key to unlock your funds and must not be shared with anyone ever.So remember these things after investing as there are lot of people who keep funds on Centralised exchange like Binance but don't do such mistakes and keep funds with your custody.Quote from: Awan putih yang cantik on January 17, 2023, 03:36:21 PMand whether my decision is right or not, to invest in bitcoin?You won't regret it once you make the choice of investing in bitcoin",

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile; their price can fluctuate greatly in a short period of time. It is important to do your own research and understand what those risks are before making any investment decisions. Since you are new to the world of cryptocurrency, it is best to start small. You do not need a lot of money to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies; you can get started with just a few dollars. As your knowledge grows and your confidence builds, you can increase your investment over time. It is also important to invest only what you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio, that way, if one investment does not work out as planned, you will not lose all of your money.It is ultimately your decision whether to invest in bitcoin or not, but it is important to be well-informed before making any investment decisions.Welcome to the forum, by the way.",

Ones gender or qualifications has got nothing to do with how an investment in Bitcoin will turn out. Good return comes from good strategy of investing which can be learned upon much observation from other users and the market news and trends itself. It only takes one who has more experience on the subject matter to consider buying during bear or bull seasons. It is okay to invest as long as it won't be an issue or discomfort for your husband/spouse. Also, waiting for everything to normalize before investing is one uncertainty to look out for.
