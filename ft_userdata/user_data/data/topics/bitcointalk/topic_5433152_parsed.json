This is not about the management of keys, this is likely a result of poor security by that hospital in romania..",

Such news is always spread and publicized by mostly anti-Bitcoin forces that want to justify their opposition to the currency. If this hack happened in my country, the government would ensure that this news makes the cover page of all leading newspapers. The CBN governor would immediately hold a press conference to discuss this issue and to tell the populace how Bitcoin is a currency of criminals. These hackers gained access to the Romanian hospital server because their security is compromised or not advanced.",

Security is everybody businessWhy do I have the impression that this is about bitcoin? Based on what the hackers are demanding, anyone who has a negative perception of bitcoin can easily and proudly claim that bitcoin is a tool that facilitates crime because criminals use it to conceal their criminal activities. Any other currency can be used to demand money, which in my opinion is a bad thing because it will cause some kind of black ash in the world's adoption of bitcoin. I hope they improve their security to avoid similar hacks in the future.",

Hackers were able to get into the server of the hospital, is due to their poor cyber security. Your bitcoin keys have nothing to do with this entire incident! It's a shame that bitcoin is getting associated with almost all hacking incidents happening in recent times. These kinds of incidents actually give more reasons to the enforcement agencies to push for a ban. But looking at the ransom amount, I am quite sure that the hackers are new and most probably collage students. professional hackers will not ask for such a small ransom!",

Which can drastically limit features and functionality.Zero day exploits are a huge factor with these types of hacks. While there are bounties paid out for finding and disclosing zero day vulns on the defense side. The market purchasing zero day vulns for offense pays out considerably more money. The result is most quality zero day exploits being sold to the highest bidder with a motive to use them for attacks.IT security in the current era tends to be a low priority from a budgeting perspective. There is also a shortage of personnel in the IT security industry. There are a number of factors which converge to make things like this possible, or perhaps even commonplace.
