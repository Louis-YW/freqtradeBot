  "content": "These coins were issued by submarine sandwich shop “Which Wich” which has a live value that tracks bitcoins price ( either up or down ) to be able to be used to redeem food in their shops through April 2024. This was a one day promotion. I actually tried to buy some of these coins from local shops (didn’t even know I had one a few feet away from my work) as well as corporate but they refused to sell me any, and were strictly adhering to their one day only deal. A few popped up on eBay and so I was able to get one and thought I’d share with everyone. Really neat thing if you ask me. Coins started off with I believe a $15 value and currently have a value of $10.08.

Someone posted about them in our discord chat and I just immediately thought it was a really cool idea.Sone interesting stuff to note, they seem have trademarked, or at least using the ™️ symbol next to “Backed by Bitcoin” and “Cryptocoin”. I’m not so sure they can actually trademark these phrases/name. Anyone have any idea how that works ?",

Ha, I'm not surprised, you two always find the neatest one-offs out there, after all!   As for trademarking, you can look up USA TM's here - https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/searchMore general (good) info here - https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks I don't think it's difficult or expensive, you probably just have to read up on it etc etc..  Edit - I did not search the db for them sorry!",
