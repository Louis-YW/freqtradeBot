By the way, why it is important to recover your account if you weren't using it for this much time ?",

      "body": "I once had a similar problem when I accidentally deleted google cookies and could no longer log in to Gmail, even though I had the correct login data, and I also did not have a backup e-mail/SMS set up. Fortunately, I was able to fix the problem by restarting my modem and with a new IP address I was able to log in.You are in a much more difficult situation because you obviously don't have access to the location/device you used before, and according to what I found online, the chances of getting your account back are really minimal. Maybe someone has a lesser-known method that really works, but if you haven't already, I suggest you read what is written on the following link :Quote from: https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/2307038/account-recovery-google-couldn-t-verify-that-account-belongs-to-you?hl=enThere are a variety of potential questions the account recovery process may ask, but most of the them are based on having a pre-configured recovery e-mail address and phone number on the account.  If these are not available (never configured, gone out-of-date, changed by a hacker) the number of questions available may be very limited making it hard to prove ownership of the account. In summary, if you can not recover the account using the provided process, it may be lost.  There are no other account recovery options available.",

I think someone else might have access to your account [without you knowing beforehand]. Maybe not right, but when I try to identify your problem, then that's the answer based on the google account help page.Take look at this image, and read carefully, or please visit Google's help page for more.",

      "body": "When you try login and use different method to recover your account there’s an option to contact google support. It will take 3 to 5 business day but it’s your best chance to recover your account. There’s also a Q&A portion when you go deeper on the account recovery that will require details of your account that you input during your registration. I’m on your same situation before when my old phone lost while my sim intact on is the one that I use on my email. Luckily my email is still login on desktop which makes me recover it. I believe contacting google support is best chance to recover it since all recovery method requires mobile device, recent gadgets which your email connected or sms to recover it because this is google way to counter hacker of the account. Only answering all the account details input during registration will prove your account ownership.This is a long shot recovery men.

Also from 10k bounty it seems this email contains a recovery seed for a wallet. If someone sold it to you then it is a scam. But if it is yours then do not allow other devices to login. Use same device and same location for recovering. Also try to put same number you used before to receive code. If there is no number added then you should try to somehow contact support of Google.

Unless there's important information on the email, otherwise the fee offering seems to be too good to be true.I had the same issue in the past and was able to force Google into returning the account back to me, so it's definitely possible to recover the account.But I'm worried that OP won't pay the fee after the account is recovered.",
