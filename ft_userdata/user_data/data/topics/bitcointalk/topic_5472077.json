This coin has the FREE token symbol, and the topic author offers a coin with the Truth token symbol. I don't know what this coin is, I couldn't find any information about this coin. Can the author of the topic give a link to the description of the coin he is selling?",

A shitcoin is a traditionally defined as a coin that had a premine. I want to encourage you to do some research before just calling a True Freedom Coin a shitcoin. True freedom coin is actually building on the foundation that Bitcoin and Litecoin set and aligns itself with Bitcoin's whitepaper. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472277.msg63081088#msg63081088If you don't want to bid bid on my truth it's your free choice. But I have been to enough auctions to know that whens someone says something is worthless they want to see if you will come down on the price. I also think the OP's plan to undersell me is working against my favor here  Because I am not coming down any lower than 1.75 BTC....",
