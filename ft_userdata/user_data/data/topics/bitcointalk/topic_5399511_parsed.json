  "content": "We are heavily mining filecoin and chia, but you know the current situation of these two, so we have to mine some forked coins, so the hard disk can only mine these, I hope some forks can be before, we have dug a bunch of forked coins, if Someone wants us to airdrop to everyone, the first one is cryptodoge.cc, this is a fork of chia, it looks like memecoin, the good thing is that its currency has a game to play, leave your XCD address, I will give it to you 10,000 airdrops。",
