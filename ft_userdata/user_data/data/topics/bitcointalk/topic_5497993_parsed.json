  "content": "Speculations:Payout to Creditors: One plausible theory is that these BTC were moved as part of the ongoing efforts to repay Mt. Gox creditors. The bankruptcy proceedings have been lengthy and complex, and these movements might signal a step towards resolution.Market Manipulation: Another theory is that the BTC were moved to take advantage of market conditions. Large movements of Bitcoin can impact the market, causing price fluctuations that could be exploited for profit.Security Concerns: Some believe that the Bitcoins were moved as a precautionary measure to enhance security. Given the history of hacks and thefts associated with Mt. Gox, this might be an effort to protect the remaining assets.",

I will not give any benefit of doubt until they actually start making the payments.As for the other options, they cannot possibly be trying to manipulate the market with other people's money and who would spend such an amount on security, is that coming out of the pockets of the victims of the hack?They can just disburse the recovered money and not have that problem to worry about.",

Gox creditors repayment thing, which has been dragging on forever. Or could it be someone trying to play the market? I mean, big Bitcoin moves can shake things up and be a way to make a quick buck. Then again, with Mt. Gox's history of getting hacked, maybe it's just a precaution to beef up security. Whatever the reason, it's definitely something that could shake up the crypto scene.I doubt that could shake up the crypto scene as it is looking quite stable right now the crypto scene and with Bitcoin and also alts not moving I doubt any news can shake the market.In fact even the hacking of a huge exchange would not shake the market,the market is used to this type of moves now,also the latest scandal with FTX and his CEO did not impact that much Bitcoin market,or in fact only little bit,just some time and the market recovered itself pretty well so I don't know what we need in order for the market to shake,I think we are in a very \"bad\" stable market from quite some time now and I doubt any we will see any change soon.",

Since 2019 there is always speculation on preparation to payout the creditors who were hit by the hack, this is rumoured every year but never happens. I will not give any benefit of doubt until they actually start making the payments.Hmm that's true Mate!Everything they do is plan to return the funds to Mt.Gox creditors, but nothing appesars to have happened. But anyway this might be happen. But this time I think it will really happen i.e., Mt-Gox will refund the stolen Bitcoins to their creditors that were stolen from them through a trap in 2014. But as far as I know, this time Mt-Gox is going to pay its creditors because if we dig deep, the Mt-Gox exchange wallet has transferred 43,000 Bitcoin to the new wallet which is worth approximately 3 billion dollars. And the interesting thing is that this is the first time that Mt-Gox Exchange has transferred so much funds from its wallet.  So it means to ssy that this time maybe he is going to do something; that is, from this transaction, it seems clear that he is giving payment to his creditor, but anyway he can change his mind in the middle like the previous one.",

They have fear that it's unrealistic to think people who got bitcoins stored on Mt.Gox before its last hack in 2014, will have diamond hands now and not sell their bitcoins 10 years later.Bitcointalk history of MtGox and how a Bitcointalk post caught the MtGox hacker.",

Gox, market manipulation is the most stupid thing that they can do and it would be a really crazy thing for them to do this because this will be another litigation against them. That's all there is to this movement of bitcoin, returning it to the creditors is the best move, now after that, it's all up to the creditors what they plan to do with their bitcoins, some will definitely sell them to make a huge profit, of that I can guarantee that's going to happen. Hopefully we can get some more news about this ongoing story of payment for the damages.",

They both overflow.So despite being able to move back an forth 1 million litres, just one poured without 1 taken out made them overflow.That's the difference between value and market depth.Look here:https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/BTC/fusd volume is right now 5 billion, but it would take only 4 million to reduce the price by -2% (market depth).Volume might be misleading, it takes only 3000 coins on Binance to get below 55k right now and then straight out of the order book.Of course, it's nearly the same thing upwards and it's probably impossible to have all the sellers dump at the same time but I would not count don't the volume t be able to process nearly the same amount  Ibit bought in 3 months that triggered the ascension by 30k without a hiccup in reverse.",
