  "content": "Bitcoiners and cryptonuers are like warriors against Government and the banking system of today.I believe Most of us here do have passion for Bitcoin.These current monetary system has failed because Government e.g  FED, SEC Regulates and sets monatary policies ( lowers or hikes interest rates), Using these great depression for Instance and super hyper-inflation currently in place that is leading to the collapsing of various economies, Therefore , FED has been hiking interest rate even up to 75 basis point as at on Wednesday 15th June last fed meeting, Which I do think maybe is the highest since 1994 (28 years) ago , Which could futher lead us to economic catastrophe as so many people have warned about the looming economic resection and stag-flationary inflation , insane right?.So with this policies they almost control all your money,  it can be seen just like a metaverse where they can control your whole reality by controlling your money using these monatary policies they set.Therefore, having our dreams come through for BTC's wide adoption involves our collective efforts.Despite the fact that the market is currently on the  down side and as we continue to wait for the future market recovery which is for sure, will bounce back. The bear market shouldn't bring some kind of doubts into our minds if BTC is gonna recover or not , A lot of  people here has been in this journey and can testify that this isn't the first time we've had this kind of Bear market,So when there's a crash there's equally opportunity for  people to become rich if you do recognize the opportunity and utilize it.As a Member of the largest Bitcoin Community which is established by Satoshi, (the  creator of BTC),  You have access to much info than most people out there do.However, we should be doubling our efforts in helping Bitcoin become a success.        Since you've got to know Bitcoin, •  How are you in your own strategy contributed or Trying to contribute to Bitcoin becoming successful in the future in your Area    ( become Bitcoin ambassador) and  fighting to win these war for our freedom ?                                                    or•  In your little effort what value could you add in helping the growth of these forum?  I do think these are questions we need  have in mind as beginners when coming into this platform because it's meant for discussing   issues around Bitcoin.                My Journey and little countribution to Bitcoin's success in my area.Back then, I heard about Bitcoin around 2014 but didn't pay much attention to it as that time, But later in 2016 I started  researching on Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology, Studying how it works by going through BTC's white paper and seeing the problems it has come to solve in the financial system, Therefore later embraced the technology  that very year.From that time to now • Have been advocating for the success of Bitcoin by teaching people the purpose of  creation of BTC.• By Bringing in new people into the ecosystem and to invest, • Teaching people how to trade BTC volatility and transact using BTC.• And I'm currently working on carrying out Seminars on Bitcoin to many people across the states in my country to educate and re-educate them that there is more opportunity in Bitcoin than in other asset e.g real estate ( BTC has  more Liquidity than the real estate)and other asset where you can't immediately liquidate your asset due to no instant buyers.It was the passion I have for BTC that actually brought me into this forum and so far I have in my little way have shared my trading experience and knowledge about BTC in the forum.ConclusionTherefore, My little advice to fellow beginners here though we might have different reasons of being here Is,Don't because of the side income that comes from these forum and defocus on the purpose why  BTT was created \"Which is making Bitcoin a success\" FREEDOM , look at what Satoshi did solving decades of economic financial problem , you too can contribute to the future success ,if you play your own part and • become creative,• have quality contribution and• Focus on the fight for BTC , because Bitcoin is the only freedom form of money and power we have in the world as individuals.Therefore fight for the success of Bitcoin and you are ............• Fighting for your freedom and power• The freedom of your Children and unborn children.• Freedom of your siblings• Freedom of your parents and• Freedom of your friends #BTC is \"freedom\" and Power to speak freely, cheers!.This thread is open for suggest and correction.",

Making sure I have a local community to exchange coins so that I don't use third party apps and have more p2p exchange4. Making reasonable posts on the forum for newbiesThat's the only thing that I can think of from the back of my head but I do think as a whole the forum might be the biggest contributor towards the growth of Bitcoins as a whole.",

      "body": "local based plans to have.think about a local location to meet up like minded people, maybe a coffee shop or a function room of a pub/bar. meet-up to discuss or help people learn about it. get more people involved, socialise and trade between each other face to face.ask the local crypto people you meet, what retailers they most use, focus in on the main retailers that majority would use and seek to get that retailer involved. knowing that there is actually local desire for that retailer(actual potential customers that would use them). i have seen some(and done some myself) where fiat is up-front paid to the coffee-shop/bar as a 'prepaid-bartab' where all the request is. if anyone asks to pay with btc is to calculate the drink bill, divide it by X and show them a QR code and tell them to pay X. then simply take the fiat out of the bar tab to put into the ePOS system(retailer gets paid fiat and the organiser gets the BTC) that becomes the intro into how easy it is to accept bitcoin and still get fiat. (then further discussions about getting them to set up their own system if they are interested to keep offering it)..howeveri have seen a few people go it alone and try to go door-to-door like a commission based salemen trying to push bitcoin and do so in a heavy sales pitch manner with no understanding of the retailer or if there is enough local demand to even supply this method of payment.this has had less success then my first described method. sounding too pushy, or sounding like a door-to-door salesmen actually in-of-itself makes people less interested, some see it as thinking that the 'sale-man' must be on commission or somehow involved as a middle-man thus its less about the product/service and more about the guy just hitting target and getting paid. some think they are being ripped off by accepting offers from strangers that knock on doors. so again. the first described method at top works better than a solo door-to-door education/recruitment method explained after..do things like meetups first, and organise yourselves, make your own face-to-face exchange by finding out which people mostly buy and which people mostly sell and match them up with each other. then knowing which retailers are best to approach rather than a random approach. dont push the retailer. instead just ask crypto-minded people at the meet-up to casually just say \"do you accept bitcoin\" to retailers when they normally by things from the retailer with fiat...separate thing to think aboutjust giving yourself a title like 'advocate' or 'ambassador' is meaningless unless you have things planned, organised and can show experience of success in the field you are titling yourself as. dont be afraid to have meet-ups and find someone that knows more then you. dont fear giving them the local title and give yourself just an \"assistant/deputy/vice/sub\" title.dont fear other locals. dont think of it as a local competition where you fear someone stealing your title. other local knowledge is not a competition. its a tool. use it, not compete against it. let the title be a badge of honour (like employee of the month) earned by whomever knows the best way forward locally. where people work together to raise the standard of local knowledgesome groups have done so well they have managed to turn their boring town with no identity into a tourist spot for crypto people. which helps the local business with extra foot-flow and free advertising, which they reaped the benefits, which other retailers see and jump in on too",

      "body": "well for my country's case and the following:until a few years ago I avoided talking about bitcoin in my country, because my country's society was still an ignorant society in terms of making money on the internet, so if I talked about bitcoin to them and they invested in bitcoin and then lost money, they would accuse me of deceiving them and that would definitely not be good for me because even my own life could be at risk. But after a few years (this in 2019) I started talking about bitcoin to my neighbors and for that I spent bitcoin in front of them because it was the only way for them to quickly realize about bitcoin, I didn't expect that later everyone in my neighborhood would start to use bitcoin because of my action",

They either don't take it seriously, and dismiss it regardless what's said or they take some interest, sound like they start to grasp the idea, but then a week later or a couple of weeks later when the discussion comes up again, they've forgotten everything, and revert to what they previously were saying about it. I don't know how many times I've told people around me that Bitcoin can be exchanged like any other currency, and they know that I've also taken some of my Bitcoin to pay for trips, and what not. So, it's pretty frustrating which has ultimately led me to not engaging as much as I used too. Maybe, I'm a bad teacher or maybe its just small talk rather than having genuine interest. I'm not entirely sure.",

It's just hard too convince someone who hasn't had any problems with banks or their money being inaccessible, because they don't appreciate that Bitcoin can't be censored by a third party, whereas your fiat definitely can. I've given up for now, but I do know the questions are going to be coming my way again with the price tanking, and of course they hear about that. I'm not interested in being right, I just wish I could explain in such a way they could retain the information. Up to this point I've failed in convincing many people that Bitcoin is a better alternative to fiat currencies.",
