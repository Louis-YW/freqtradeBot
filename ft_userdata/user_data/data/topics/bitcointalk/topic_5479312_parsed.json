  "content": "What brought you to Bitcoin? How much of it have you accomplished? For me, it is the desire to earn a living off the internet without the encumbrances of a 9-5 job and having clients from all over the world pay me for my services without the limitations and regulations of fiat (a pity Bitcoin is being fiercely regulated too). I wouldn't say that I have accomplished that since I still support my earnings with \"regular\" jobs. I like the liberty of being in control of my time and how I work though I still have not gained that liberty completely. Nevertheless, I believe that with the plans I've implemented, being completely free from a 9-5 or \"regular\" is possible in 2 years.What brought you to Bitcoin and how much of it have you accomplished?",

      "body": "A lot will say that financial sovereignty and freedom are what bought them to Bitcoin, or quickly became a goal after learning about how to use Bitcoin/joining the ecosystem. Sovereignty is easy to achieve, freedom not so much. While Bitcoin can help some to achieve financial freedom, it's not the primary purpose and I think this lets a lot of people down. It can teach a lot of lessons along the way that may increase the chances of achieving it in the future (which we may not have learned in the traditional system without Bitcoin), and it may increase chances with the appreciation of price, but overall it is not a surety.I digress, I joined Bitcoin looking for a new trading medium outside of traditional systems, and I did achieve that, as can anyone who learns how to use it.",

I am not near my 40s so I have a lot of time to still accumulate a lot of Bitcoin and I promise to get some for my unborn children too.The reason why I am into Bitcoin is for financial freedom sake and to also escape inflation problem that have plagued the fiat currency of my country, it sucks keeping my money in bank accounts and it keeps loosing it's value. Also some people are starting to report how banks are logging them off their account whenever they have over $30,000 in the bank, few banks will even call the cops on you, until you explain how you make the money, and I have a lot of money in Bitcoin that I won't even dare to exchange to my fiat currency and send to my bank account.",

Before COVID I was struggling to get customers for my online business, post COVID it has been a dream come true. Now every small or big business wants to be on the Internet and want to be on the first page of Google. Since I do not work for anyone else and work for myself at the comfort of my office things are somewhat similar to what you have mentioned for yourself.Bitcoin for me is a form of alternate investment and the forum for me is a form of gaining knowledge and learning with the ability to earn Bitcoin through a signature campaign. I cannot let go of both opportunities that I have been blessed with due to my habit of being inquisitive. For me, Bitcoin is also a second source of income and investment option which is quite good for anyone who is living in a third-world country.",

In my country some bankers act as spies to criminals, they could give this criminal information about you finances since they have access to your bank details. Another attraction is the ability to engage in financial transactions without any form of limitations. The government of my country sometimes place limits on bank transactions which has affected individuals and businesses negatively. But Bitcoin has broken these barriers because you can sens and receive any amount of money at anytime. However, the financial benefits of investing in Bitcoin is also my motivation. I will say that I have achieved some of these goals, while am still gunning to more of my intentions.",

It is really a long journey before reaching this far where you are already knowledgeable enough and experienced, there's a lot of processes as you would lose money, the motivation to keep going, etc. Being involved with Bitcoin for such a long time has already helped me in many things especially financially, it has been provided like paying the bills, funds for emergencies, and the future as well. I have bought also some essential equipment like a laptop and motorcycle, but of course, it took a lot of time before reaching it since Bitcoin is still volatile so accumulating and holding till the bull run is a must. One thing I have observed is that having a stable income plus investment can help you achieve financial stability.",

To become winners, people must know how to hold their bitcoins and wait for bull run to take profit. They must know to store their bitcoin in non custodial wallets, not on centralized exchanges.They must avoid trading because when they join trading, they will use leverages and futures. If they only trade with Spot, they can enter, exit and chase small profit but will lose a big bull run because Bitcoin when runs, will run very fast and they will have to buy up the higher price, then get less bitcoins.",
