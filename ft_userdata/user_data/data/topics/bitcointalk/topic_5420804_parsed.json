Take a look at the female children that are more like their father than their mother; they always have a distinct attitude and behavior. Given that he is the leader of the family, fatherly affection is uncommon but crucial in every household. He should therefore love everyone.",

You've said it all, op.  But in our society these days we find that it's not all men who actually show 'love' because it's not in their set up. Some believe that providing the necessary needs and being there when the going gets tough is the definition of love. Meanwhile, there are men who always are vocal about their feelings and this is what is most people think is love.",

There are many men out there who don't show care or take it upon their selves to provide for their family but their wife does it yet same time care for the family. You know, women will only believe a man has met the necessary requirements when he's done these three things: protection, attention and affection. Like I said, most men are not built to openly show affection sort of, (but that doesn't mean they dont) but they do it in their own way. There's no scale to weigh the love of the both parents towards the child because they do it the way they know how and although it's believed by society that the mother cares most by virtue of harboring the babe for nine months, it doesn't mean the father didn't do something too.",

Women and men show their love differently. We can express our love better than most men can and it easily seen, but it doesn't mean that men are cold and without any emotions especially for their offspring. The sacrifices men make for their families, going out of their way for us their wife and their children can only be out of love. If you don't love someone you can't make sacrifices for them.",

This is the answer. Women and men show their love differently. We can express our love better than most men can and it easily seen,Correct. Women love mostly from their emotions. That is what makes the difference. And this is why men who show emotions in love are looked at as women. The society believes that men are not supposed to show love emotions or cry in public. It is not true that husbands sacrifice because of love. Most husbands do not do all that you described because of love or that they are still in love with their wives. They do it out of responsibility and commitment to the institution called family.",

They must ensure the play their roles in order to raise a balanced and well grounded children. Recently I have seen families crumble because the woman feels that it is the sole responsibility of the man to provide for the home and if he cannot for some genuine reason, then he doesn't deserve respect and love. I have also seen men that insists that it is the responsibility of the woman to take care of the children and do the domestic work.This might not be the total truth because marriage should be based on mutual love, shared responsibilities and sacrifice. Like you rightly  said marriage should be a team work. The woman and the man should be willing to assist each other and not to be rigid in assigning roles or responsibilities. The mothers deserve all the praise because they are more emotionally connected to the children more than the men. But some men are also doing very well in the process of connecting to their children emotionally.",

You are right but you will agree with me that 60% of women in the world today spend more time at home with their children than men because men are seen as the breadwinners in the family so they are always not seen at home with their children unlike the women who have more preferential treatment even at work than the men who may experience more late time in closing from their workplaces. It was during the pandemic period that most men spent time with their children at home because they were working from home but regardless of this I agree with the fact that a man and his wife can decide what happens in their home and their decision stands.",

Did you conduct any interview or survey to determine that? Even with the figure, I guess you are only referring to the underdeveloped nations because in first world countries there are no gender barriers. Everyone who can work earns and are breadwinners. This believe of women not  working was the case in Africa ten years ago when our mothers were called housewives. Today, it is not that way. Most women now have paid jobs they leave their homes to do. And most of these women are now breadwinners too.",
