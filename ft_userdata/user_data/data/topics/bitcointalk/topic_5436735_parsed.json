For now, I can't suggest if it's better to buy Bitcoin to hold it for a long time or Stay mining since you said you lost access to cheap electricity it won't make any profit but still depends on how expensive your current electricity rate is.Do you mind telling us the current electricity rate in your area?If it's too expensive or above $0.13 per Kwh then it won't make any profit. You can also hold the miner and wait for this machine's price to increase in value to resell them at a high price or hold the unit for a few months until we see the price of Bitcoin rise again until mining with this unit is profitable again.",

There is possibility that we could go below 20,000$ again but that's your decision to make.",

However, for those who are interested to generate passive income through mining Bitcoin, it may be a viable option only if certain conditions are met such as living in a region with low electricity costs or having a personal solar system to power the mining setup. Additionally, it's important to consider that mining requires a significant upfront investment in equipment and requires a consistently cool environment to operate efficiently, which may not be feasible in some locations.",

Agreed, profitability of Miner mainly depends on electricity cost , which is higher in many countries due to higher oil price, as many countries generate electricity from fossil oil, in such situation it makes sense to sell your ASIC miner, if it is  no longer profitable. As far as buying Bitcoin is concerned, it is important to consider market conditions & accumulate Bitcoin by using( DCA (Dollar cost-average) strategy. This can help to mitigate the risk of buying at a high price & minimize the impact of market dips.",

Efficiency is more important than raw TH, its what leaves more profit in the end.From my data provided by users, lowering the chip temperature is also a key factor.There is even a 104T jpro doing 104T at 24 J/T at vanilla 65°C.The best is a similar 104T jpro doing 64T 20 J/T but at 38°CSo think of this like this (with the magic of buying two): 128T 2686W. (at 15/T its $1920) vs one XP 127T 2731W (at 28/T would be $3556).See the pattern? That jpro 104T is a good buy, the 100T is decent as well.",
