Better if you should post a sample article that everyone can see. If anyone chooses your article then they may reach out to you, otherwise, there will have too low a chance.",

      "body": "True I thought of it later once I posted it  I didn't know what topic I should take so I just made something about bitcoin energy consumption.The energy usage of the Bitcoin network is a contentious issue. Some people believe that the high levels of energy consumption are a major problem, while others argue that the benefits of the network outweigh the environmental costs. One possible solution to this problem is to transition the Bitcoin network to use renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. This would reduce the carbon footprint of the network and make it more sustainable in the long term. Another solution is to explore alternative consensus mechanisms that are less energy-intensive, such as proof-of-stake. Ultimately, the best solution to the energy problem will depend on the specific needs and goals of the Bitcoin community. It is important for stakeholders to come together and discuss the issue in order to find a solution that is both effective and sustainable.",
