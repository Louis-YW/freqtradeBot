Does anyone speculate that the price of BNB might dump back lower than $100?Also, in the article. It mentions of another article from Reuters where it alleges that Binance processed transactions worth $2.35 billion of funds from hacks, illegal drugs and other crimes from 2017 to 2021. It appears CZ might need to buy shares of another mainstream media company again heheheheehe.The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether Binance Holdings broke securities rules when it launched its BNB token in an initial coin offering (ICO) five years ago, Bloomberg reported on June 6.The BNB ICO took place in July 2017 on several platforms, during the height of the so-called ICO boom, and the Binance exchange opened just days afterward. According to Bloomberg, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, at least one U.S. resident claimed to have taken part in the ICO, which could be a crucial fact for an SEC case, if the agency chose to pursue one. The SEC has claimed most cryptocurrencies are securities and brought cases against a number of ICO projects.Source https://cointelegraph.com/news/bad-day-for-binance-with-sec-investigation-and-reuters-expose",

For sure SEC people are trying to drag down the price and for them its still expensive to enter at this price.The only four coin(token) need to drag to make the market fall down are btc, eth, bnb and usdt.  Eth and usdt are done fudding by some greedy buyers. Now an issue on binance is next, we all knew that these top fpur coin could affect the general market trend and they are trying to exploit an old news for it to happen.",

Its quite possible but I have a hunch that this is more related on market pressure. Its been a long time and now they are pushing this issue at a time where the market is bleeding. So for me, its obviously they wanted the price to drop further. This sec news isnt new anymore here. A hidden agenda is behind those trying to barge down binance.",

I do not know the agenda of SEC though, but I do not think like that, that SEC wants price plummet of cryptocurrencies. If we remember the Ripple case with SEC and many other of their allegations, some happened during bull run. Like the ripple case happened during bull run, when the price of ripple was furthering to decrease at the time, the price of other cryptocurrencies were increasing at the time. I think this kind of allegation can occur at any time.",

The article was arguing non sense thing about binance. Indeed. SEC is a big market manipulator. They are doing this just so they can buy them cheap coins. Elon hates the SEC for a reason. It is because the SEC is competing with Elon and they have the law behind them which causes an unfair advantage for the SEC over Elon. BNB will probably survive but those who bought them coins from the top will have pretty hard days ahead. Just remember to hodl with diamond hands and drink lots of water because the weather is pretty hot during these times of the year. Remember: \"No pain, no gain.\"tldr; FUD, yes.",

I'm curious about what the conclusion will be in the coming years.I am not certain if this was one of the catalysts because it appears the market has been dumping on any type of negative news recently hehe. There are people who speculate that Alameda Research is the one manipulating these market movements. There is no proof to prove it, however.In any case, Binance published their own article to deny everything that has been written in Reuter's article. It appears CZ will not accept this without a fight. This is a long article which also shared Binance's email exchange with Reuters. Last week we published a blog that debunked the myth often pushed by adversaries of our industry that crypto is a “haven” for illicit money laundering. Sadly, our industry has to continue addressing these issues over and over again as interested parties continue to spread disinformation or purposely mislead the general public by leaving out critical context, such as how much more effective crypto is than the traditional banking system at casting sunlight on illicit activity. Sadly, we have seen these types of misleading articles seep into more esteemed media outlets on occasion. One author who has published a number of these “breathless pearl clutching” articles ran another piece today. And like their last article, which was brutally fact-checked by multiple third parties including the centerpiece of their story, this  latest iteration is rife with falsehoods, massive leaps to conclusions, and relies on poor data that could have been fact-checked by reaching out to one of the major on-chain analyst firms, like Chainalysis or TRM. We highly suggest you ignore those authors and pundits who cherry pick data, rely on conveniently unverifiable “leaks” from regulators, and feed into the cult of crypto paranoia for fame or financial gain. Instead just look at the facts. Neither our industry or Binance is perfect, but we have grown by leaps and bounds over the past three years. Crypto is a completely new innovation. And just like many regulators and policymakers, we’re still working through what an appropriate regulatory framework should look like.
