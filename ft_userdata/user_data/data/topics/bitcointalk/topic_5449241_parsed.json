Data from DefiLlama reveals that DEX trading volume surged to $133.1 billion in March, marking the third consecutive month of growth.How are they decentralized exchanges? Can you trade bitcoin and other main coins like that on Ethereum Dex, Binance Dex and other smart contract decentralized exchanges? If truly they are decentralized, people should be able to trade all coins. Or if not all coins, it should not be in a way that you can only trade single main coins with just its tokens.

The only one that I have checked before is this one that makes use of bnb as its main coin which is the Pancakeswap. There are others too. On Pancakeswap, BTC leverage is up to 200x. You know what that means for liquidity or how it is directly proportional to liquidity?You have not explained the meaning of TEX, read what is in your post and notice that you have not even explained what it is. You are only talking about the importance. Without the meaning, you can not jump to the importance. You register and login on TEX? So what makes it differ from CEX?Mention some TEX exchanges?",

Know that there is nothing like a transparent exchanges, you are just a centralized exchange that wants to use decentralized means to mislead people.#TEX is a new concept which people believe it also need some time.but for your mentioned thatÂ  it just a centralized exchange that wants to use decentralized means to mislead people. That is wrong, #TEX experience is same as centralized exchange, but the basic smart contract is the same as decentralized exchange, because that transaction data is open and transparent. All data is on the chain, everyone can supervise and check. And users manage their own funds instead of handing them over to exchanges, which is the most important.The dev is developing the product,you can test it when the beta version is online.",
