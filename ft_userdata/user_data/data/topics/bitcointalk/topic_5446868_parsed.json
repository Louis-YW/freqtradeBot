I just wanted to know how many posts you can do everyday and no other intentions.Lately I have noticed lots of complaints regarding burst posting and spammers, IDK what do you guys think about a burst poster or a spammer, but I have an average of 8-12 hours a day staying in the forum and with a 15-30 minutes post gap I should say I can make at least 15-20 posts a day depending on my mood. Though for sure there will be people here saying depending on a topic or \"you don't care about the topic as long as you can post\" thingy.Considering you have followed all the rules and you are on topic, what is your average number of posts?Additional question: For you what is the acceptable time gap during/while posting in this forum?Ps. I have created this thread knowing some of you would literally refer me another existing thread, or some kind of thread containing rules about posting. I  created this because I know you guys have different perspective on what is a spammer or a burst poster. I just want to know your perspective individually.(Edit. If someone happens to give merits to this thread, I'll be using it to help our local section Pilipinas to generate merit cycle. As it happens that our local section is active but the merit cycle isn't, besides that, we also don't have merit source due to various complications. Thanks in advance)",

I did this because I know for sure that you are well aware about some campaign managers who are strict with the campaigns they are managing and usually what they required are 5 posts a day and if the posts are consecutively done, are they still choosing from those consecutive posts? for example they are done from 3-5 minutes?

I am aware that everyone on this forum have different standards when it comes to posts quality and posting patterns, this is one of the reasons why I made this thread. Also it is relatable to merits since veteran members here would say that merit is subjective, it should also be a part of their criteria to consider how do you perform as a member here on this forum and the quality of posts as we can see in every signature campaigns here that they are strict when it comes to their rules like posts.",

So that depends on the campaign manager and it is up to them how much post they'll be counting per day as long as it won't exceed to their limits right? Anyway, that's good to hear coz most of time my posting gap would average from 15mins or more. IDK but ever since that was really my time frame.",

      "body": "In my opinion, I think 15-20 post was already a lot in a day but I guess it would still be allowed as long as there is a 15-30 minutes gap between those post. Plus all of those posts are constructive and not just some sht posting on the forum. For me, 3-8 posts per day would I think will be the reasonable maximum post that you could do in a day. Considering if you are on a signature campaign posting more than eight I think would be spamming and probably on some campaigns lower than eight would be spamming or will not be counted as a post.The way I see it is as long as you're doing or posting some kind of useful topic here in the forum the posting count would not really matter, but of course, it is impossible to create a constructive post or topics here if you posting without a huge gap since you also need to do some research on your topic or post unless it was just simple advice, plus it's suspicious that he doesn't get tired posting so he probably just copy and paste it that would be plagiarism and maybe use AI on that post, and probably it was some spammer who wanted to increase their post count or post for signature campaign.",

It saves a lot of trouble.

I do not think there is any campaign or manager out there that requires 5 posts per day. My guess is that some managers set a limit of 5 posts per day as a maximum, which is a whole different ball game. They do this to motivate campaign participants to stay engaged throughout the week. But let me clarify - this does not mean you cannot post more or less than 5 times a day. It is totally up to you.As for burst posting, that is pretty obvious to detect. You cannot make substantial posts about different topics with a time interval shorter than what is required to read the opening post or the post you are responding to. Meaningful engagement requires taking the time to read and understand the content of each post before responding in a thoughtful manner.",

      "body": "It depends on the time you spend on the forum. I usually make about 20 posts a week and maybe 3-5 a day? I've been doing that for years, sometimes being in a campaign, sometimes not. My posts are usually done in 2 hours max because I have other things to do and can't spend 6 hours reading and writing posts every day. The way I see it, it doesn't matter how much time passes between your posts, because there are people who think and write fast, who open 2 discussions all at once and participate in both at the same time. There are also very active threads. A good example is wall observer that can go crazy when there's a sudden big price action and every few seconds there's a new post. It's really easy to spot if someone is a spammer and time between posts is a secondary or tertiary indicator. You can write a post every 5 minutes and not be a spammer, because you're participating in an active discussion, or write a post every 30 minutes and be among the worst bot shit posters here. If you get kicked out of a campaign because the manager thinks you're bursting, try to talk it through. Ask the manager to review the content of your posts and get him to tell you what the minimum required interval is. I can't help you here because I've never been warned about posting too fast, or too much. Personally, being a manager, I wouldn't care if someone posts a lot and fast, but I would care if my campaign participants were making the required 7 day quota in 2 days. I'd probably also care if they were real spammers, writing gibberish in broken English, necro posting, quoting OP in every reply, posting oversized images, and so on.",

I have created this thread knowing some of you would literally refer me another existing thread, or some kind of thread containing rules about posting. I  created this because I know you guys have different perspective on what is a spammer or a burst poster. I just want to know your perspective individually.Spammers and Burst Posters are 2 different things (at least for me).Spammers - those people who are just spamming worthless junk of texts just to increase their activity (and hoping to get some merits as well). Sometimes these people's post isn't constructive at all, and just posting a bunch of text with no context or meaning at all.Burst Posters - these are the ones who are posting many times in a single day or a single week. I mean from the name itself, we can define what it is already. However, for me there are 2 types of Burst Posters. One who is posting many times in a single day or week, but his/her posts doesn't have any thought or meaning at all (considered spammer), and the other one is that, one who is posting many times in a single day or week, but all of his posts have meaning or have context.

You might be right that he might be considering signature campaign as his job already because he's spending the same time as an employee working in an office. On the other hand, there might be a chance that he might just be AFK while working in an office? Or he spends his first hours after waking up visiting the forum and then his remaining hours on the night browsing again, but still I don't know why OP is spending that much time while I'm only spending at average or 4 hours a day I think.",
