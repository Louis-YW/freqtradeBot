But here on the forum, no one cares about how you feel if you are criticized or insulted. No one will even care to ask about you if you decide to leave. On this forum, if you decide to remain quiet, it would take no long time for people to forget about you, so you must be productive in the ideas you share, and when you get insulted, just shrug it off and move on.",

Anyone can actually teach and correct any member who also finds himself or herself lost over something or makes a mistake in a certain situation. Not everything dropped by higher-ranking members is always correct and the right thing; just because they are higher-ranking doesn't mean they can't make mistakes, and when you detect any mistake, you are also free to redirect them in the right direction. One thing that helps members grow so well in life and anywhere they find themselves is to always be open to learning, accept and take correction where necessary, and when you have something to contribute, you should do it without the fear of getting punished. Not to forget, abiding by the rules, like you have mentioned, is a primary thing to do.",

Nothing is instant in this world because everything needs a process for us to achieve, many people will share knowledge and the initial process when they get to know forums and the best way so that you can focus more on learning about forums is by \"reading\". Criticism is not always considered negative as long as it gives direction to anyone, because with this criticism we will add to our knowledge, so there is no need to be allergic when dealing with criticism from people who have experience in forums, because in fact it is the impetus that will make us grow.All that needs to be done is to read more and study something that you think can provide insight into the knowledge you want to learn, nothing is difficult when we are consistent in learning but unfortunately many people are inconsistent and in the end give up and hopefully you are not included in that group.",

We are not perfect and mistake is necessary so we can learn from them and improve.For OP he was lucky to have someone to encourage him but them what about those of us that don't , that probably came across the forum by coincidence of searching for bitcoin related informations, that's where you just got to be your encourager by focusing your mind on the goal that brought you to the forum and how you can creatively achieve it. The underlying factor about this whole talk of encouragement is, never allowing anyone's opinion have a torn on your flesh cause that's has you start getting discouraged.",

These limits will be reduced to the point where you shouldn't usually notice them after you have participated in the forum for a few weeks. If you are on the forum to talk, then that's all you really need to know about rank. Don't worry about it too much, and you will eventually rank up.If you want to maximize your rank, then you need to increase two statistics which are listed on your profile:Activity, which is maximized by posting once per day on average. Posting more than that is useless in raising your activity.Merit, which is gained by making good posts.If you make ten thousand posts in a week, your activity will be capped and you will still be a Newbie. If you make ten thousand useless posts over any period of time, you will gain zero merit and you will still be a Newbie. You can rank up only by making good posts consistently. It's quality over quantity.When trying to write quality posts, a lot of people act as though they're writing a book report for school: putting facts that we already know into their own words. Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors. In trying to write a quality post worthy of merit, you should offer new ideas, personal experiences, or perspectives that other forum users will actually find new and interesting.QuoteCriticism: there are constructive criticism that tends to correct a newbie by setting him or her in the right direction. using myself as an example, I was corrected by one of our senior colleagues here on the need to use punctuation marks where necessary in all my writeup since then I have been very careful in other to avoid the repeatation of such in future.Writing tipsBitcointalk posting etiquetteTopic title style guideMake your topic title, posts more attractiveQuotemaking more detailed research of what we don't know before bringing it to this forum and also where we don't understand we ask question so that people that know more than us can put us through.Searching tips[Guide] Searching effectively",
