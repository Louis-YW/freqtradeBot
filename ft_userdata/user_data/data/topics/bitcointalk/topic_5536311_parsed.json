This will make the stock exciting again and im sure that all the shorts are going to be scared when they understand this play and look at how powerful it could be for the ticker when you look at MSTR.They options play on this will become interesting in the following months. If there is a BTC bullrun to 150k+ then all the GME shorts are going to be covering and a potential gamma squeeze is at play which means the price may run up in a slingshot fashion. It is going to be also interesting to see how they try to stop trading this time considering that they cannot stop BTC trading and the stock will be powered by it now.",
