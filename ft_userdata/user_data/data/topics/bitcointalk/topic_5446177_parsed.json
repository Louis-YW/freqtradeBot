I don't like to engage in such conversations because those who doubt that gambling can change someone's life are usually those who have gambled and failed multiple times or those who don't really know gambling strategies. Recently, a Uganda pastor who won 100million shillings decided to shut down his ministry. This left me with several questions in my head, such as ' Do religious leaders gamble? Is it right for religious leaders to gamble? Knowing fully well that most of them preach against gambling in their religious places.

No exception for any religion. so, in my opinion, in answer to your question:Do religious leaders gamble?Of course, this could happen. Not just in Uganda but in any country will have one or two doing the same things.Is it right for religious leaders to gamble?Gambling in any religion seems to be judged by wrong actions, so if there is a leader who gambles, of course this is wrong. But if he shilling to people to join him to gamble its not acceptable. What are the ethical and moral implications of gambling, particularly in the context of religious practices and beliefs?If a religious figure gambles, of course it will be considered immoral and unethical. This is no longer just about faith, but because of the individual will of that person. Maybe in some religions, a religious figure who gambles is considered not to have good faith. But, if it comes to closing churches, or other places of worship, this is beyond common sense.",

Maybe a religious leader does that because he doesn't have full faith in religion, so he prefers other ways to make money by playing gambling. If asked whether someone can earn a living in gambling, I would say no because it is possible that the victory he gets is just luck and will not be repeated afterwards.",

There have been thousands of religions in the world and we don't know if on that actual religion that you've mentioned if the teachings there is if gambling is allowed or not.But since the pastor have gambled and won such amount, only two things from that result. It's either he's really teaching that gambling isn't allowed and he violated it or it's the opposite. Regardless to say, a true pastor won't leave his flocks and will attend to their needs for the words that his teachings.

The problem is when the religious leader preaches against gambling in public, but adopt this activity for his life in secret, on his private life.I say this is a problem not because gambling should be considered wrong or immoral, but because this person is an hypocritical and manipulative one, therefore he shouldn't be trusted and followed by anyone who seek the truth, honesty and balance in life.A religious leader who acts like this must be acting against the words he preaches in other aspects of his life as well, so be careful.",

Everyone should be judged for their own good and evil. If a religious leader does something bad according to his faith, it should only be binding on him.

Indeed, basically no one blames anyone for playing gambling, but maybe for everyone who looks at the morals of the behavior of religious leaders it is not an ethical thing, but maybe my perspective is like that because of the teachings that I received so that when talking about religious leaders gambling sound bad.And again the religious leader that OP was talking about, his goal of becoming a religious leader is just to earn money, not just to convey teachings, which shouldn't be a problem without pay.

I can say that not every priest or leader will play. Every human being has the freedom to gamble if he wishes. I haven't heard any such news but this is not incredible. Moreover, if those priests play, they will never be revealed their gambling activities. They will never want to lose their credibility by publishing all that information.",

This has trigger so many evil deeds by pastors to make fast money and they involve themselves in various means to get money.
