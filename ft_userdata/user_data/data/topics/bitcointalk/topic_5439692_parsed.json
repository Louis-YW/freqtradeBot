Expecting the price to be around $10 million at the time. https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1111f9w/bitcoin_could_hit_10m_in_9_years_but_more/QuoteIf Back and Finney’s $10 million price prediction becomes true, the BTC market cap will reach approximately $200 trillion.Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $10 million by the end of the sixth halvening in 2032, as long as Bitcoin layer-2 technology and wallet infrastructure improves.Bitcoin was less than $1 before when it was created, the price increased multiple times and now at $21800. If anyone told me that time that bitcoin price will get to $20000, I will not believe. As the price of bitcoin is increasing, the more money pumped can not make its price increase up to when the marketcap was low, this is the reason altcoins with low marketcap but with low money pumped into it had more effect on the price. This makes me think this time again that can bitcoin get to 10 million in 9 years to come?I look at the history of gold marketcap which is the highest among all assets, I was surprised about how significantly it has been increasing, but gold marketcap as of today is still $12.344 trillion. This makes me think bitcoin marketcap can not get to $200 trillion in just 9 years to come, but I know bitcoin may get to $5 trillion market cap as it gets to 1 trillion in the last all-time-high. I am not expecting the price to be that more than $1 million or less.",

For bitcoin to defeat gold in terms of marketcap, I'm pretty sure money should be in people from the current generation's pockets as people in the current technology-filled generation are highly more likely to buy BTC, not the boomers.",

Personally, I think that the price of $10 million for 1 BTC is excessive, regardless of how many sidechains have existed and what will happen in the next 10 years.The only thing that would lead to such a strong increase in prices would be the decision of the most powerful countries in the world to start buying Bitcoin, and I don't think something like that is likely, especially in countries like the US, UK, EU, India, China or Japan. Of course, maybe a few more countries will follow the example of El Salvador, but globally this has little or almost no impact on the price.",

So i believe that Bitcoin have to do gravities of demands in annual, and when you cross check Bitcoin market you will notice that the market always get increase every year. So it's believable that the market can get to $1m before the stipulated year if possible.",

One of the things we need to get familiar with about a decentralized network like bitcoin is the fact that it is very volatile, the price can change anytime, if we can look into the history of time from its inception since 2009, bitcoin has been very volatile rising and falling and despite that the value has always been found increasing along side, all hope is not dashed out about believing if in few years time bitcoin can arrived at this milestone, remember when we are talking about bullrun, if takes speed within a short time frame to rise sporadically in price, who knows maybe after this $68k ATH we are heading towards $200k or beyond and so continuously with every four years after or before halving, we can continue to having something big in pushing the price to ATH till we are close to the said rate as thought by OP.",

Bitcoin itself is enough to revolutionize money. Sidechains are just increasing its efficiency at best, though with good enough scaling upgrades then what's the point other than more niche/private purposes for them? Sidechains aside, the fall of a global reserve currency and a race to take its place (presumably lead by Bitcoin) can lead to this kind of meteoric rise quite easily under the right circumstances. The only variable that might put a speed bump in the process, is war. I don't think people factor this (likely) variable into the equation while making predictions like this.",
