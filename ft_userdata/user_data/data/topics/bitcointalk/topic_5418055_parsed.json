Is it because you are too greedy? don't want to work but still want money, or do you want to get rich quickly?... you should read all the rules when using any app or social network. Don't try to blame others when it's your own fault. I think you should sue apple, google and microsoft for licensing telegram to work on their platform. Without the permission of these tech companies, the telegram would not appear anywhere. LOL",

Telegram is a free to use social and it doesn’t promote scam. They will obviously delete or mark them as scam if the group is reported and proven. Blaming them for the loss that people themselves did was a lame excuse to justify poor judgement and wrong decisions on participating to groups like this.",

I don't think investors get forced to put in money into a coin. When you are asked to buy, you can choose to or not.Why belonging to such group in the first question? Someone that is looking to get rich quick is greedy and a greedy person can take what is not their own. Realise that while trying to get what is not rightfully your own then you can be hooked.Telegram not the only social media that having call group or followers, tweeter, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit have some account that are followed for investment. Your legal chase can be stopped on the road for no justification, losers are not force to but they decide to belong to such group and not want to leave.Quote from: S-IT on October 23, 2022, 01:26:35 PMWhich of my words did you fail at?

If you have something against the groups what about developers of shit coins that give open opportunity for the pump and dump of the project. If they have good coin pumping is difficult. How much do you need to pump bitcoin and how much do you need to pump a low value shit coin, so you can see the difference.",

Discord seems to be doing a better job at handling scam DMs (at least from my experience). My most recent encounter were all automatically marked as 'likely spam' and had their content hidden.I am also able to join crypto groups without worrying about scam DMs as there's an option to block all messages coming from non-friends (whitelisting some servers is also possible). Telegram has a similar feature called \"archive and mute\" that automatically sends PMs from strangers to a chat folder but apparently, it will only show up if a user has received too many messages from unknown contacts....I can't see what you're trying to do as anything but extremely tough battle so good luck.",
