Assuming that exchanges don't have wallets with a balance of <1 BTC, then if this number starts declining then it more or less means that it's going to exchanges, or otherwise alternatively people are breaking up >1 BTC wallet quantities to domination >1 BTC. If you simply want to know about the amount of coins on exchanges though, then CoinGlass is a good place to start.As someone else pointed out, in the same way it's quite common Bitcoiners to break up 1,000 or 100 BTC into smaller amounts, it's also possible that users with say 10/100 Bitcoin are breaking them up into dominations of >1. As it's generally recommended to split funds across different accounts, even if ultimately the private keys from the same seed phrase.",

Which is nothing we didn't know in 2021, that was already said then and the price behaviour since then has been quite disappointing. It is clear that demand will tend to grow over time, and supply will tend to decrease, so the price of bitcoin can only go up, but I do not trust that it will do so very quickly, especially given how the price has evolved this cycle. When the market cap is large, it is more difficult to raise the price and we will not see the returns of the first couple of cycles again.",

I like what Adam Back said, \"Should the existing trend continue, BTC price growth would soon make buying it not only a luxury but something altogether unattainable\". Because I think what he said one day will indeed come true. Because even with the many bankruptcies that have occurred in large banks in developed countries. I think this will drive faster and more bitcoin adoption. And yes I agree that nowadays it seems that people have started to realize that keeping bitcoins for a long period of time is the best.So if more and more people choose to keep their bitcoins for the long term and have no intention of selling in the near future. then buying bitcoin one day will become something beyond luxury because it will indeed be increasingly difficult to obtain when people have started to choose to be Holders more.And are you aware of the recession issue? and what makes many economists make statements from the results of their research that a recession can indeed occur. And a recession can occur due to people's awareness to save more and become higher. And the current economic crisis has actually had an impact on all of us thinking that we must start preparing from the beginning so that we can avoid a return from an economic crisis that may be even worse one day. So that people's awareness about investment and savings is currently increasing rapidly.Now when awareness about the importance of investment and savings is increasing in everyone. and coupled with the many banks that went bankrupt, guess where they will go in the end to choose a place that they will make as investments and savings. My answer is Gold for savings and Bitcoin for Investment.When this happens the $200k price for BTC is likely to be reached sooner than expected.",

      "body": "Well I agree with getting to 1 BTC will very soon be unattainable for people. Except for those no-coiners with high incomes who get into Bitcoin soon, or for those who are already most of the way to 1 BTC, it's gonna be real hard for anyone to accumulate 1 BTC from now on. In a year the price will probably be double what it is now, and next bear market the price may bottom at double today's price.So maybe there is 12 months left of <$55k-$60k price, and that's it. And after these next 12 months, maybe there is only another 18 months of under <$100k price after that (when you count time it'll take to from May 2024 until it goes through 100k during bull market, plus time it spends under 100k during the next bear market). So we're talking likely only ~2.5 years of total time from here on out that the price of 1 BTC is under $100k, and most of that period it's gonna be over $50k. At $50k - $100k it is already very hard for a middle class person in a rich country to accumulate 1 BTC over the course of years. At over $100k price it's gonna be near impossible. At $200k and up there will basically be no new whole coiners being added to the community outside of wealthy no-coiners who finally pick up some Bitcoin.It's crazy to think about but there will probably never be more than 2 million whole-coiners at any point in history. There might one day be a billion people with 0.01 BTC and another billion or two people with less than that, but only a million or so people with 1 BTC.Anyway, as to the hyperbitcoinization. Maybe one day, but I'm 40 and I don't expect to see it in my lifetime, or anywhere close to it. If it happens I think that is a far off future thing. Hyperbitcoinization means living on a bitcoin standard essentially. It means Bitcoin being the primary money. Maybe in a number of generations fiat currencies of today fail so badly and Bitcoin remains so strong that hyperbitcoinization happens as the only alternative to the failed system, but it ain't gonna be in the next few decades. I mean hell, it'll probably take at least a decade before its even easy to spend Bitcoin on a fairly regular basis and before most people think Bitcoin is something other than a pyramid scheme.",

The world is still too selfish and too centralized to want to adopt a decentralized currency as the \"default value system\". Not to mention that for the foreseeable future majority of countries are going to push their own centralized fiat (both traditional and CBDC).Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on May 19, 2023, 11:02:14 PM~ said that HyperBitcoinization is coming soon, he went on to say that \"Should the existing trend continue, BTC price growth would soon make buying it not only a luxury but something unattainable altogether\".Maybe the definition of hyperbitcoinization is different, but if we define it as \"increased adoption and high price\" then yeah that is going to happen. There is a lot of reasons for it too. We have the current centralized financial system that is slowly falling apart with banks that keep going bankrupt and the fiat currencies that are being printed nonstop causing high inflation rates. It is bound to push people into thinking about alternatives like bitcoin.Regardless of the current market situation the onchian analysis shows that the adoption is rapidly increasing.",

Even if Bitcoin has to hit $100k in the coming Bitcoin halving and bull market, it's not so much that people can't buy, and even if it's so, the bear market will come and the price will still go below $100k.

      "body": "That's truly an amazing thing to hear but I think most of those addresses belong to the whales who have bought Bitcoin in its early days. Many of those whales prefer to keep their Bitcoin in separate wallets for the purpose of safety and for security of being untraced. If a whale puts this whole bitcoins in single address then there is chance that someone can penetrate it when it goes online. They also won't keep the Btc in one address because they want to hold it secretly to avoid taxes at the time of selling. The HyperBitcoinization is currently a term and it will remain in that way for a long time. Although, I am also among the lovers of Bitcoin but I don't think that we can see that thing as a reality anytime soon. The governments are trying to create their own cryptocurrencies that should be purely the digital version of their own fiat currencies. Although, there is a possibility that Bitcoin might be used as a reserve for those fiat crypto-currencies, but still no body knows that yet.I think that Bitcoin's price will be too high for a normal person to buy it. Only rich investors would be able to purchase it if its price crosses over $100k, but still poor people can still buy some Satoshi's and that's enough for them. I know that even this day there are thousands of people into crypto world who can't afford to own a whole BTC, so tomorrow there might be more people who desire to own a Bitcoin, but they wont be able to.I believe that soon Bitcoin will enter the bull market and the day is not too far when that will happen. I think this bull run will bring a lot of investment in the cryptos and many people would love to own their share of coins in the sphere of cryptocurrencies. I'm very positive that Bitcoin will cross $100k in 2024's last quarter, and if it does then the next bull run might make it to reach highest peaks that we can even dream of. I think after halving things will be different form today. I'm eagerly waiting for that day.",
