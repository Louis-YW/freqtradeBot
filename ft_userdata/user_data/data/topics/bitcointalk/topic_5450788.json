  "content": "If you guys are working on a spreadsheet and didn't have time to check the Bitcoin price on the exchange or other flatform, you can use it in the sheet while you work. It's just a tutorial, and I just make it easy without a ticker or any tool to check the price.1. You have open your Google spreadsheet and write the code:=GOOGLEFINANCE(ticker, [attribute], [start_date], [end_date|num_days], [interval])For example:Code:=GOOGLEFINANCE(\"CURRENCY:BTCUSD\", \"price\", DATE(2023,4,20), DATE(2023,5,1), \"DAILY\")so just simply like that, you can be modified the ticker you want like currency (Euro, GBP, etc), and also the date you want.let's have fun.cheers.",

Yes, I agree, each people have a different point of view to see something, For me even if it is more complicated, it's enough simple to check the table price because I bookmark it and I just copy-paste the code. And, the spreadsheet looks like accumulates all prices from the exchange source, so there is an average comparison when the trader wants to calculate sell and buy. If using a spreadsheet, we can also use a filter, day by day, and price to price, so for me, it's enough simply to learn self-taught trading without a special teacher.",

I just find if we can check Bitcoin prices using Microsoft 365 subscription also, I don't try it, but when I read the resource, it's easier to use because there are already tools on the data tab,There are already 5 cryptos listed which you can tick differently at the same time.Bitcoin (BTC)Ethereum (ETH)Litecoin (LTC)Bitcoin Cash (BCH)Ripple (XRP)but, I think Google spreadsheet is better because Office 365 doesn't automatically refresh the price data when we want to change a specific interval time.https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/blog/cryptocurrency-prices-excel",
