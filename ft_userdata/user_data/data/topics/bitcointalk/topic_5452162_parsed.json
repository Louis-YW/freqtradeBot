Do you have more to add to what the researchers have discovered about this?Among all of these, one thing that I truly like is that true happiness comes when you give to others and they are happy and appreciative of what you've done for them; without that, there will be no actual happiness, no matter how much money you've earned. Seeing people pleased for your sake will motivate you to do more. Researchers and other people might have a contrary opinion to what I see as a way of true happiness when you spend your wealth on others to benefit from. People will definitely spend money the wrong way in order of pursuit for happiness while others will say, anything that will bring you happiness is worth spending on and you shouldn’t be regretful of earning the happiness that way.",

Whatever you spend money on may satiate your hunger or thirst into something, but IMO it isn't happiness if it doesn't make you feel contented. It will, at best, just make you hungry for the better, more advanced variants of what you bought in the long run which will be a never ending cycle.

As a person i would like to see other’s happiness rather than mine. When I help people i feel so happy and satisfied.

In this case, buying material goods is more feasible if they know about the ending.In conclusion, everyone knows how they should be happy.

Money can really buy happiness but if you spend more than you earn just to be happy that is a wrong way to pursue happiness. Contentment is the only way to achieve proper happiness and also helping others the way you can without suffering excessive spending of money. The principles you had shared are just right and I agree with that. Always remember that you should spend only that is beyond your budget and do not overspending to avoid debts.",

I never think like that if I help someone, that makes me happy until I give alms to local beggars and orphanages.

Although there must be some kind of a universal basis for happiness, when it comes to money, I guess it is not the be-all and end-all.A month or two ago, I attended a gathering. At some point, the discussion came to money. And it was argued by my former boss that money can actually make you happy and that the old adage money can't buy you happiness is wrong. I nodded in agreement, but didn't care to elaborate. Deep within, I thought money could indeed make you happy but poor is the man who depends on it for his happiness. So it's not even about how you spend your money; happiness could be there without money.",

Sometimes people buy luxury things because they think they will be happy because they have things that can make them more appreciated by others, but that is also sometimes wrong and doesn't work as expected, because I've done it and it turns out I'm still unhappy.So happiness is very subjective, everyone will be happy in their own way. But for me, it is to enjoy every part of life that we are living, it will be better so that we can be grateful and happy even in difficulties, and money is not the main factor for happiness, it is only a support, and it should not be the main goal of humans.Even though you may have been wrong in seeking happiness, it must be accepted as learning and you can be wiser in managing your finances and live better.",

How we can earn and spend is up to us, as long as we feel satisfied and happy. We don't have to follow the advice or what the textbook says, we can't force everyone to do the same thing when everyone is different.Recently I have bought some necessary products for my work and needs, many people say that I am quite wasteful when buying such expensive things.
