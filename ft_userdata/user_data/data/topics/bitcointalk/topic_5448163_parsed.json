What else can I possibly do? Give me ideas. I am totally new to this.Take a look at the pre-configured nodes in a box like umbrel or raspiblitz. See what they can do and the features they have.-Dave",

Using https://bitnodes.io/ usually is easiest way to do it. If https://bitnodes.io/ can't reach your node, it's possible your ISP use CGNAT.Yes, my ISP indeed use CGNAT. My node is unreachable through bitnodes...Running bitcoin core with outbound connections only, is it ok? I mean, do I help the network? and if so, how is it different than a node that has inbound connections too?",

Allowing incoming connections is just even more helpful, because in comparison with outbound-only (which lets you make up to 8 full-relays), with incoming you can establish up to 125 connections. If you want to help even more:Allow Tor, so that you can have mixed connections with both clearnet and anonymous nodes (and act as bridge between these two networks).Setup an anonymous SPV server, and let the rest of the peers find you.Run a reliable lightning node.",

Please consider I am totally new to this, so my questions may sound silly. But I am trying to learn. An I read as much as I can.So, what does my node do now? I am only allowing outbound connections. Does this mean that my node \"sends\" the current blockchain (and mempool) situation to other nodes, to help them validate new transactions?",

Your node downloads and verifies blocks whenever you're notified there's a new chain tip, and uploads blocks to whoever requests them from you. In fact, you can open up and see yourself how much data you send and receive by clicking on \"Help\" -> \"Debug Window\" -> \"Network\".",

I don't have this window, at least not in this path (perhaps because I don't run the latest Core version). I can see the network traffic under \"window\" -> \"network traffic\". In fact there is column called \"totals\" where I can see a received attribute and a sent attribute.
