If you didn't know, you need special ranks to wear things like personal avatars or signatures, and even then you have certain limitations (i.e., max image size 120x80, signature can't contain images). That's because, apparently, as you can see yourself, we nearly all wear advertisements-- which as you understand promises an income.

In the \"Forum Profile Information\", there will be no column to input the signature.Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PM-snip-Users of Newbie rank cannot post images or wear signatures.

The higher the tank you get the more restriction is lifted but in some cases, the restriction is lifted right away up to member rank which is by buying copper membership. By ranks, Each rank have different maximum character.E.g, Hero Member rank - 4000 CharactersQuote from: Cuda911 on August 31, 2022, 09:05:33 PMYou already have 31 activity, with one merit you will rank to jr member and you will be able to wear signature codes, you need to improve your post quality to get merited. That's what OP needed now since activity points are already enough for ranking up to jr. member which is now have the permission or no longer restricted to add signature but signature designed for jr. member rank are mostly in text with a little bit of small symbols unlike full member rank to legendary rank can add designs or style or buying a copper which will remove or lifted the restriction but the copper membership permission when you buy is the same as member rank.",
