  "content": "Hey guys! I have been mining Aleo since the past week at https://aleo.zionodes.com/, and they have been dispursing about 8-13 credits per day (for 10,000 c/s). By the end of my contract, I should have over 320 credits (roughly) which would be converted at a 5:1 ratio to the coin. So, I should end up with about 60-65 coins by the mainnet launch. While I think the upside is massive, how much do you guys think each coin would be worth. As per current forecast, It is expected that each coin would be worth at least $40, to about $60. If you guys already have researched on Aleo like I have, how far do you think the project would go? FYI: They have raised around $290M from investors already.",

Pancakeswap, the biggest DEX on bsc with millions of users have similar marketcap.This is what I initially thought, anyhow I'm not familiar with it, but usually the forecast might be balloon as well by the people behind. So it might end up at $4-$6 dollars instead of what they have estimated.In any case, it seems that the OP has made his mind already, deep already on mining.It might have raised that huge amount of money, but it might be equal to success as we are very much in the hear of the bear market this 2023, IMHO.",

Pancakeswap, the biggest DEX on bsc with millions of users have similar marketcap.You have really made a valid point, how were they able to raise such huge amount of funds in this bear market. Or perhaps they have some institutions and VC who inject huge amount during the fund raising process, if that is the case, there is most likely going to be a dump. Better for anyone who is interested in investing to go in with small amount. There is something fishy about their supposed raised amount.",

Therefore, I am confused about how zionodes are offering mining services for Aleo on the mainnet through their infrastructure. I did a quick check on Aleo's official Twitter account and couldn't find any information about any cooperation between Aleo and zionodes. Have you thoroughly researched and verified if the mining services offered by zionodes for Aleo on the mainnet are legitimate and trustworthy?",

How has your experience been so far, and how many credits can I expect to earn per day (with 30000 c/s)? No idea on when the mainnet launch is (maybe month end?). Like I said earlier, listing gains are definitely high for miners (especially since we have a market uptrend right now). Leasing servers here is quite easy and convenient, and the customer service team is also quite helpful (so are the admins/moderators on discord/telegram even if you DM them). About the credits per day, this is where you can get a rough idea about how many credits you would earn: https://explorer.hamp.app/calc. Oooooo, I see",
