  "content": "What happened:: I have seen the post in the local language on a signature campaign. So, I doubt the account has been sold. Then I noticed that there were several neutral trusts regarding the account sold. And later saw another post where asking how to join that campaign. It made me clear it is a bough account and now spamming.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=231174https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400828.msg61614253#msg61614253Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400828.msg61614206#msg61614206Additional Notes:Now should s/he deserve negative trust?Edit:Quote from: shasan on January 18, 2023, 10:01:11 AMQuote from: Rikafip on January 18, 2023, 08:09:24 AMI don't see any change of email address and to me is unlikely that the new owner wouldn't change it as the old one could easily overtake the account.It may happen that they are friends. If they are friends or known people then they do not need to change anything and also their local language should be the same. On proof of authentication, I saw a different telegram username.

The email is not changed, but the password did. They're just clever enough to let it sat for a while so forum's internal system didn't mark it on their trust page. Unfortunately, BPIP did, happened roughly last month, on 13 Dec 2022.As for the change of ownership, I am somewhat believed this is the case too. Going back through just three pages of their post history, I found they enrolled on several campaigns and safe to assume they're well versed on bounty hunting, it's quite strange for them to ask as such [translated by google]:Quote from: Texac on January 18, 2023, 07:29:17 AMКтo-нибyдь мoжeт cкaзaть мнe, кaк пpиcoeдинитьcя к этoй кaмпaнии?translatedCan anyone tell me how to join this campaign?There's no proof in the change of post quality yet as they just made three posts since the password change --and presumably the change of owership-- but the writing style is somewhat changed. After flipping through their posts, both in the Cyrillic and the Latin, I see that the OP used to wrote neatly in one paragraph, like this one I randomly took,Quote from: Texac on January 15, 2022, 11:04:25 PMwhat's going on with this project?  Is it developing or can you forget about investments?  the token failed so much that I lost almost everything.  at least, there is not even a normal exchange.His latest though, separate each sentence with a space,Quote from: Texac on January 18, 2023, 07:43:08 AMeh, what makes you think I bought this account?I just need money and want to join campaign.By the way, can anyone tell me how to join this campaign?As for tagging with negative... I also think it's better to wait and see if the account shows a drastic decrease in post quality or shows any other signs of detrimental actions.",

It should have been easier to determine if he changed it or not.Password and email changes are shown only for a month on Seclog. That's why the information is not available there. And the password has been changed for more than a month. That's why we can't see that information on secog.

And nothing wrong if you give 200 merits on this merit or I give you two hundred merits. But the question arises when that is annoying for the community or if there might have any chance of being scammed. We are talking about the account which probably changed ownership. And now using to spam. It is not possible that a hero member not know, how to join a signature campaign.When ownership change we may see different thing like:Writing style changewallet changecontact info changeand many more.A buyer can do all of these or any of these.",

Upon checking him a little bit more I do agree that his behavior looks suspicious and posting style seems altered, but I will wait a little bit longer as the more he posts in English, the more obvious change of his posting style will be.",
