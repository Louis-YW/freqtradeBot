It happens with gold, USD, etc etc.Even if they do not get your coins when they kill you because of your password that is coins out of the system that makes their coins worth more.And have we cured ALS yet or are we still using hashrate on mining currency over medical problems.https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-robbery-torture-cryptocurrency-netherlands-a8807986.htmlhttps://futurism.com/robbers-tortured-man-drill-steal-cryptocurrencyhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gun-wielding-crooks-torture-crypto-143143087.html",

They may have that \"hashrate advantage\" for a brief period until the next adjustment but there will be new miners that would still emerge around the world and they cannot stop that from happening so it's like a waste of resources.",

It is not a guarantee but it increases your odds to win the lottery. In the future it will be cheaper to blow up miners than to buy miners, it already is.",

Don't you think that this would be completely out of sence?Competing with a fellow miner is a norms as every miner would want to increase their mining profits. But I don't think it would be necessary to start a fight just so you can earn more. Why not get a more powerful mining hardware instead of stressing your self out.Quote from: hsdjkahskjdh on April 24, 2023, 12:38:45 PMWhat would be a way to prevent miners from killing other miners?

But why fight over digital asset, when you should be looking out for ways to increase your hash rates.and mining profits.",

It is and as time goes on be even cheaper to do. They don't even need to get the person just the miners that are normally in one place.",
