That's all you can explain? Don't you even bother to proof-read the paper, that literally serves as your business proposal, before publishing it? Shouldn't you do it if you really care and put a lot of effort on your project? Well, at least that's you being honest.If we talk about team... how many people in your team, again?",

From an investor who currently in the middle of their DD? I think they'll find it useful and someone nicely pointed things out. From the perspective of a project with questionable quality? Yeah, I can understand why you don't like it when someone pointed out crucial flaws of your project, and spelled it out how it translated to incompetence, and how likely the project gone missing in a very near future.You don't want to be criticized and your mistakes pointed out? I suggest next time when you have another shady project, make sure you re-read your whitepaper before publishing it.",
