A closer look at the Twitter account of the scam social media account shows that the account was created this year and it has fewer followers than the original account. I prefer to get information from the website of any firm or wait for emails from them, social media scam posts like this are easy to put up by scammers. Paying close attention to details is important because there will always be little lapses that can give a warning sign about these scam messages.",

What they are always after is how to use a trending issue to fill their pockets. If they are looking for people who have lost their money as a result of the hack, then they should try contacting stake officials themselves because I have not seen any complaints yet about any users losing their funds. As stake has said, there is nothing for users to be afraid of as their funds are entirely safe, just as a user stated above. Now it's just a post on Twitter, but later we will start seeing emails sent to suspected victims, even if they are not sure of the mail. Any mail they come across might receive any recovery form of scam email.",

      "body": "I am sad to hear this bad news about the huge amount that was hacked from the Stake platform, but I trust Stake that it is able to withstand and constantly face security challenges, In the words of the Co-Founder of Stake, to calm the community, Stake keeps a small portion of the crypto reserves in hot wallets to address any issues at any moment. What Stake did, a few hours after this hack occurred, by stopping its services and handling the matter, is a sound decision to reveal the effects of the crime and to protect the users’ funds. The next day, it resumed its services, and deposits and withdrawals were processed for all currencies, and the interruption of service did not continue. The Stake did not give the hackers time to continue spreading their fraudulent schemes and exploiting this incident, so if you look at the fake account of Stake, you will find that its name, image, and phishing tweet have been erased. Therefore, I see that things are back to normal now. It is the responsibility of every user of any casino, whether stake or otherwise, to put casino social accounts & websites in the bookmarks and ignore any other sources and any complaints or compensations are made through their live support and their official links only and not through phishing domains/accounts promoted on Twitter.",

At first, they create an account with the name of either some model, actors or others, get some followers and then change it to another name. But they write the handle for a targeted audience, for example, @stakerefund in this case. Then they delete old posts made a couple of hours ago and start posting their scams!Things could be different in this case. I don't know how these posts get engagement if those followers are fake. Of course, some real followers believe their scams and engage with them. Or it could be their alt accounts who are sharing those posts.",

On the other hand, I feel bad for those who already fell for this scam. I just hope that they will learn from this. Is there any way for X (twitter) to prevent this type of scams on their platform?

I guess their goal is to get hold of stake customer detail through phishing link and make every attempt to empty their accounts,  because their are already aware that the hack on stake does not effects players' account. Only a gullible set of people will fall for this scam attempt because the game is somehow clear for anyone to spot the red flags in all of this,  and this could only succeed unless and if the customer is not a frequent visitor to the casino.",

Twitter is the number 1 hotspot now of scammers due to this new privileged. Twitter is more garbage now compared to facebook. Btw, I think Stake user will not gonna bite this since all the users money is safe and they can withdraw now. Their account balance doesn't turn into zero but rather only the hot wallet got empty which can be easily solve after Stake refill the hot wallet.",
