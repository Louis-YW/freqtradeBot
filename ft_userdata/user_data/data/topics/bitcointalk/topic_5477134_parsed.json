Do you share the same perspective or not?Definitely, odd makers specially coming from Las Vegas already knows what the opening line will be either ML or those handicaps. And that's why most of the time that odds are not that great because they know that the chance might be higher for us to win.But as a gambler, that's where we take our risk, if odd makers says that X team, in case of basketball will win by this -1.5 for example. We might go and risk as base on our own analysis that X team can win by more than that points, so we might be looking at 1.7x or higher odd instead of the usual 1.6x or lower they are going to put up initially.",

Technically analysis of the game will determine exactly if you will win or not, where the analyst of team start, it starts from the features and start checking the loophole of the team that contribute for their down fall or not, I don't know how you play your own game but I know that before you win any game as a good gambler you have to take your time to analysis the game before you can book any game because without analysing the game you will not have a strong belive that you are going win or not, a statistics is very important to me because of it what will give you that confidence to have a bold standing to confidently stake your game",

Do you share the same perspective or not?For sure, the bookies and the gambling sites will give you odds after seeing all these aspects of the sports and the game which is in question. If you are a regular gambler, you won't see that gamblers are being given higher odds for the teams that are likely to win. Similarly if a certain team is handicapped or less chance of winnings, then you will usually find higher odds for them.Quote from: Renampun on December 09, 2023, 05:51:37 AMI don't have a friend who is a bookie so I'm not really sure about this perspective (that bookies have very strong analytical skills and already know which team will win),  I do not think that bookies will know who can win the match, they only play with probabilities, where the probability of a team is high to win, they will give us less odds for that and where the probability of a win is low, they will give more odds to us. We have to have a plan and bet on them using some money management techniques.Betting lines and odds can be used also to determine who has more chances to win the match and it is more useful if someone does not have the idea of sports or team he or she is betting on.",

I'm beginning to reason that out too myself, probably they understand it could be a likely easy outcome and so they rather make it unavailable. Probably so, and gamblers have no option than go for other options without choice. This could be likely so, that bookmakers are really at work to read the minds of gamblers on likely outcomes of predictions.",

Do you share the same perspective or not?This is my speciality in gambling, at least when I am fully prepared to bet to make money, sportsbook have been my thing.The main point is for you to find the right sports that you fully understand, and look for the satisfactory odds as I don't just bet on sports too, I make sure that the odd makes sense and no matter how sure the game is for me, if the odds are not \"something to write home about,\" I will never go for it.After all, it's about money and risk must be involved. So, the risk is the higher odds that I go for because if the game is so sure for my option, they wouldn't have apportioned such an odd to it. I love 2.0 and above, but I can still do a little lower than that. On the contrary, I do not think that the bookies are powerful here, you just find the right odds for yourself, and if they beat the odds down (where they only have power since they can't rig it), it's your choice to go for it or not. As for me, I will look for the ones that would fool them so as for them not to beat the odds down. This has been helping me for long.I also make sure that I play independent games in sports betting.",

They have the odds in place and in most cases, no matter which team wins or loses the bookies are in profit. Since bookies give less odds to the favourite team, so even if bookies have to give money to the gamblers, it is not that much because the odds are low. Although it requires a little bit of math to understand, but being a bookie is a profitable business as compared to being a gambler. but not everyone can become a bookie because it needs a lot of initial capital which the ordinary gamblers do not possess.",

It may not be the only thing to consider for you but personally I can already make a decision without checking the stats by just looking at the betting lines, because I believe that Bookies are not missing any information that could give its bettors and advantage to result a betting on one side only, at least most of the bettors. I guess we have our own srategy but I tell you, experience will tell us what to do to make our job easy.

      "body": "In sports gambling, following analyses is great, until the game ends in a score contrary to our predictions. Some people follow a historical approach, but it's not 100% accurate. During the Arsenal and Luton town games, many people played Luton to win Arsenal, because they've read that, in the history of football, Arsenal never won Luton in Luton's home stadium. Along the line, it seemed like Luthon would win and they felt so happy, then in the last 1 minute Arsenal changed their predictions and they lost. The bookmakers also added more odds on Luton to win Arsenal. While it's good to analyze games, following the recent changes in the league is crucial. In the premier league for instance, instead of playing a particular team to win, it's better to bet on both teams to score. Or bet on more than 3 goals to be scored in the match. Because smaller teams with low chances of winning, can defeat a big team with all the possible facilities needed to win; fit players and many consecutive wins. If you watched the Luton game, you'd notice that Arsenal almost lost the game. And the same thing had a tough time with Liverpool. Who would ever believe that Luton town would be a turn in the flesh of Arsenal fans and players that day? Analyses work but don't play a particular team to win another. Play based on the results you noticed within the past few games. Premier League games are easier to predict regarding goals predictions; goals, 4 goals to be scored, etc, but more difficult when we predict a particular team to win. Unless you won't watch the game, it makes me uncomfortable.",
