But they can't force their valuation on the owner of it. The owner values it as he sees fit.Now, I know that you might be upset with Trump, because he wouldn't give money and armament to your beloved Ukraine. So, you like it when you can steal money from the American people without looking like the criminal that you are!Incredible...There is something you continuously fail to understand: Being elected President does not grant you unlimited powers, is exactly the contrary, you power is strongly restricted.- No, as president you should not \"take control of the government\" beyond your constitutional functions. e.g. replacing general attorneys and the like. And you certainly do not get to self-extend your mandate just because you think you won.- The democrats won the election. There is no proof of illegal wrongdoing. If there is, you present it to the press, the judges, etc ... but that did not happen, because there isn't.- Sending money to other countries removes it from your economy, thus may reduce inflation, but I do not think that matters much.- You can brag about the price of your properties in the golf club, but real state has an objective evaluation when you go to the bank to ask for a credit. If you say it is double it is fraud. This is not about \"the price you'd sell it for, it is the market valuation (dude, capitalism 101).- We do know because he is stupid enough to lie in written, in official accounting documents, right below where it says \"All the information provided is true, I understand that if not I may be committing fraud\".If you have any sensible argument this is a good moment to express it. Otherwise, do a favour to this forum and stop blurting shit.I am not upset at Trump, I fear that if what he does is Ok, the US is no longer the government of the people, but of the mobs.Re your accusation of me being a criminal, I request you to present any evidence or remove the insults. You will get a reputation thread on that one.Blah, blah, blah... You totally miss the point. Creating new money to give to other countries (Ukraine) doesn't do anything at all if the money is never spent by Ukraine. But when it is spent, it causes inflation in the country that is the main user of that money.If you are a recipient of the benefit of the US money that is sent to Ukraine, you have stolen value from the American people... and should be ashamed of yourself. Of course, you may not have any choice in the matter. But if this is the case, perhaps you should consider immigrating to Russia so that you don't partake of stealing from Americans.I am not seeing here a withdrawal of your accusation. I understand that you believe that is ok to call someone a criminal without a proof - that is why you support Trump - but it is not. Prove or withdraw now.What you call \"bla bla\" is called arguments in the rest of the world.You have tried several times to provoke me into providing personal information on where I leave and who I am or who I deal with. Again, you will need to do much better and in any case is irrelevant to an argument based conversation - again, I understand why are you a Trump supporter (from China perhaps).<-snip->BTW if you were a true bitcoin supporter, inflation would be irrelevant to you, even a good thing in fact.",

I noticed that a lot of famous trolls turned to the darkside when they got majorly screwed in some way or another, and they never recovered. Notbatman, for instance - creator of the famous Flat Earth thread - lost thousands of dollars attempting to buy Black Arrow miners, which turned out to be a giant scam. Losing the money and not being able to mine cheap BTC affected his sanity and he withdrew into a dark place. Looking back at BADecker's posts, however, reveals that he's always been a religious nutjob. Over the years he withdrew from any type of normal discussion to pursue trolling full-time, but it was a gradual transition.",
