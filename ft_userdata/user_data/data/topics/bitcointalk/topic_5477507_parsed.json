  "content": "First of, let's define the meaning of spreads. QuoteSpreads are among the more popular forms of sports betting.The spread essentially levels the playing field for gambling on a sports contest, introducing a so-called “handicap” for wagering on the game or match.Let’s say the Kansas City Chiefs are hosting the Cleveland Browns, with the Chiefs as a significant moneyline favorite. As an alternative to betting on the Chiefs at significant minus odds, you can bet on the spread so the margin of victory or defeat comes into play.Spreads can be frustrating because last-second plays that don’t change who won or lost can still sink your wager.You can read more in here ; https://www.forbes.com/betting/sports-betting/what-is-a-spread/For the sake of discussion, let's select one of the games today in the NBA.

      "body": "Most of the time, I prefer the smaller spread because it only takes one or two possessions to cover the spread, and it's almost close to a moneyline or match winner bet.The bigger spreads are what I try to avoid because teams are okay with losing a few points when they've already guaranteed the win, and underdogs would sometimes give their best until the very end, even though they're down by double digits.",
