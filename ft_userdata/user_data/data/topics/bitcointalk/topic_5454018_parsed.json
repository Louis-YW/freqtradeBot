I have clients buy crypto through Zelle/Venmo/Cashapp daily I need many people to receive payments as there are daily, weekly and monthly limits on each account. I would have you receive payments with Zelle/venmo/applepay and put the funds into crypto to complete each sale.

Keep off from such services. Yes, it can't be than easy to win $500 - $2500 per week: there is no such a thing as a free lunch. If you receive payments, you have to know where the money comes from and the reason, you could be subject to mandatory KYC, and also to taxable events. If you don't know where you're going, you better not go.",

Would you have that confidence in whom ever that is advertising such a product after checking their profile on the platform they belong and you discover them to be new and with no reputation. Will you be ok doing business with them? Will you take such risk engaging them? I know your answer would be obvious so no need answering it. Your conscience will reply you the right answer.  Welcome to bitcointalk platform.",

I recommend you to stop scamming innocent users because at the end you'll be the loser not those innocent people. Shame on people like you who have no morals and they take advantage of the ones less knowledgeable about technical things. What will you get by scamming those people? After you have done your fraud you'll flew away like a mosquito and leave those innocent people behind to get arrested by the police and other governmental agencies.Isn't it better to live a life with morals and do hard-work to earn money rather than trying those black-hat methods to scam innocent people? How long will you be able to earn from the scams? Trust me one day every scammer has to get caught, and if you don't want that to happen to you then stop the game of scamming and start earning money by learning a skill. Earning money is hard in start but with time and experience you'll be able to earn enough per month to live a better and peaceful life.",
