Crypto-currency is still trying to become a global phenomenon so it's a gradual process so right now in my country many day to day needs are most likely to be gotten in Fiat.So right now I think I am a person that earn in crypto-currency and only converts to My local Fiat when I necessarily have to do so.",

Mostly i don't earn my local fiat rather trade cryptocurrency to fiat for my final consumptions.The most funniest part is that i can't barely cope with any other hard job without being a computerized job, such as data tabulation, analysis and many more. It has really shaping my nature of living and working as well.Bitcoin to the world!",

When you have money and exchange it for cryptocurrency, you often incur small loss.
