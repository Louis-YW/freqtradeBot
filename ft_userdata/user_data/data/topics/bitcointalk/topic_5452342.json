  "content": "GM, I've been thinking for a while about the crypto situation nowadays. Yesterday we saw the US government selling 9,4k BTC... Days ago I found the KASPA.org project. It solves Bitcoin trilemma... Did you hear about this one, KAS.In the meme-coin field, PEPE was amazing but logically buying before no one, was obvious. I will consider buying Dogelon mars (some dollars) cause in the future Elon goes to the moon it will pump hard. At least I will lose the same as going out for dinner. Have you found any future gem (x100) with strengths and good fundamentals...?Nice day",
