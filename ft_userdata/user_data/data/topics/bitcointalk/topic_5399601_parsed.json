Maybe only global moderators and admin can see user's email both in reports and in their profile, maybe a global moderator will tell us about it. If this is true, then i think the message users get if they decide to make a report should be changed to specify this.",

Is there a way to put it off that the moderator wouldn't see your email address, for people who do not want their email address revealed OR can moderators see your email address even without you making a report, or is it only the admin that has that power?It's a very sensitive observation and question your asking with the fact that, our mail addresses are hidden by default except you chose to make it public and that's entirely up to you. Having the knowledge that some actions can lead to exposure as a privacy concerned individual can result in mixed feelings. Although, you've got to have faith in the forum and it's moderators to be of integrity and I can't say any have given us cause to be alarmed yet and that's to the best of my knowledge.A moderator is the best to answer this question and I can see a few have responded yet from what is obtainable at there end. Perhaps this counts towards that notation in trying to file a report because, its sure not to apply in every case. Just my thought though  but, this works to the later.Quote from: SFR10 on May 23, 2022, 11:41:26 AMQuote from: Pmalek on May 23, 2022, 08:53:22 AMBut then again, maybe Xal0lex never saw the email addresses in the first placeConsidering that Xal0lex moderates the Russian board and what \"mitzie\" said back in 2015, if that was still the case for some of the moderators/staff, Xal0lex would've gotten those:Quote from: mitzie on January 18, 2015, 11:24:57 AMOnly the specific board moderator(s) can see your email when you report a post.

Best advice, you don't have to use an all too official mail in your detailing on the forum. Mail addresses are editable and should it be of concern, you can edit to a less official but active mail address.",

Although, it's probably best to assume that the email you have registered with will be seen, and to be cautious with that, since the forum could be attacked, and data leaked, like a few years ago or simply admins might be able to see your email. The good news is you can prevent the former by changing your email now if it connects you in anyway to your meatspace identity.",
