This is same via limit order on spot by buying and selling on your desired price. I don’t see it as an arbitrage trading since you didn’t instantly liquidate your asset via P2P instead you still place an order and wait for someone to buy.But your method is still effective in your case if people is will purchased above OTC price when they use card directly.",

      "body": "So you want to get more tips, but you also know a very great strategy to earn profit with arbitrage? I don't know man, sounds like you're just here to shill your paid group.Anyway, I do know people who are dealing with P2P arbitrage. Most of them don't really do it for long though, unless you're using bots with a payment gateway that is quite fast. As far as I know, some of them buy some BTC when it is cheap, and then resell it when the price is pumping to guarantee more profit. Basically, P2P arbitrage doesn't seem to be their preferred strategy. I second the opinion that Wise is not the best choice for payment. I recall reading how people's accounts got blocked because they used it to buy crypto on a platform that is not registered in the UK. I used them in the past to liquidate some of my holdings through my local exchange (direct deposit), but I won't do it again after their ToS gets updated. It is a pain to find a UK exchange just to avoid getting blocked. CMIIW.",

First of all I can not contact a newbie, that has not gained any reputation in the forum, and this being his first post here in the forum. So coupled with what experienced members have said about his post, I'd have to have doubts about the genuineness of OP intentions for asking that he'd be contacted on telegram. Maybe he's genuine, but I'm always skeptical about contacting people or groups on telegram and WhatsApp, for business purposes, because of fear getting scammed, unless their highly recommended.",

If OP wants to sell his scheme as a service, he should do that in the service section. Then again, if you can make that much money on your own, then why you are willing to sell your secrets for pennies? A magician never reveals his secrets. If people can understand this, then figuring out this will be much easier for them.",

Golden rule. As soon as you see someone saying 'promise' or 'guarantee' avoid it as a scam.Second rule to remember, majority of traders lose money. So put in only what you can afford to lose. Expect it to lose in fact. You'll lose money trading no need to lose money to scammers.Nothing wrong to learn. But paying shouldn't be in until much later. For services for tools never for strategies that 'make money guaranteed'.",

I've even been a P2P user since the beginning of P2P on Binance, and this kind of P2P crypto arbitrage strategy is quite outdated and everyone is familiar with the price game.The price difference is far due to everyone's mistakes, and although they provide the cheapest price to buy and the most expensive to sell, it is just a trap and will never be in the process. I once did this kind of Arbitrage, But in the end it will only have a small profit, and it is not as easy as you say. Even more orders were canceled in the end.",
