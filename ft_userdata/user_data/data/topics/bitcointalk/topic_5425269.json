That would actually make lot of sense in many ways. I totally understand that this isn't a popular idea as everyone would like a recovery and new bull run as soon as possible.Second (bullish) possibility is (if you are elliot wave fan) that correction waves ABC were obvious and bear is over.",

Even so, will investors let them complete it easily?That causes a rumor that ETC will be a victim, not ETH because CFTC and SEC will attack ETC which will bring less lawsuits against them. ETC is the original ETH and it is what was used to run crowdfunding years ago. Anyway it is rumor and I only shared it to you. I don't say it is true or untrue because I don't know too.",

We were from 68k to 20k by that time when FTX happened, so all it could do was another %20 or so give or take, maybe %25 but that's about it. You can't just expect something to go from 68k to 20k and then another big like that to 4k or something, that would be too huge. Plus so many people are buying nowadays considering how low it is, compared to Luna period. Which all combined together means that the news wasn't small, it was a huge news but at the same time the period we are in is already as low as it can get, we can't really drop that much further down.",

And with that, I'm still not sold that ETH included, will not suffer from the impact of negative news and FUD.For btc, I think its bottom is already hit last time but for eth I am not really sure if it hit already or not because I remember that eth had a good performance last time just before the eth 2.0 happen but its value only decreases after it. I think it only lose some of its gains last time and it haven't been in the actual dump state neither reach its bottom.The ecosystem is already fragile and shaky so you're right that any negative news that can hit anytime soon are going to cause another fall. There's no need for you to panic or sell because you do not look like a newbie in here. The best thing that you can do is to continue hodling and you can also buy more.",

Gox, but from more than $20k to $15k is already huge drop because of the FTX fiasco. There might be someone entities or even average joe to just buy around the $15k region and probably waiting for like $18k-$20k to sell and make profit. If that happens that then price could still be lower for BTC and ETH.ETH is like -74% from it's last all time high, it might be pushed to around -80% or even -85% as final capitulation, in my opinion.",

Lot of things must be tested many times, debugs to make sure when an update is launched, it won't create a big chance for hackers to exploit their blockchains.Both coins have same chart pattern and recent months, we see dead cat bounces from mid and low cap altcoins. In the same time, top coins are very boring and silent.Ethereum must wait for Bitcoin rally to recover itself. In a next bull run, Ethereum must have a big upgrade to start its new bull run and to make community feel excited about its future.",

Sure it had all that PoS stuff and all, but it is moving with the market by the looks of it, which means that if you could end up buying it now, when the market goes up then ETH will go up as well and you would be in profit.I know not many people are fond of that, but it would be something liked by everyone. All in all, it is the greatest thing that we could talk about in the long run, and it would be a lot better if we could just stick with ETH type of big names. Bitcoin and ETH are the two biggest coins out there, and not having any trust on them, or having dilemma about it is not really that much acceptable.",
