The art, the artist, and the story all in one!The story behind the artSome heroes are made, some heroes are born, and some heroes are chosen. But our hero emerged out of the cry for universal emancipation, in a world system shrouded with the darkness of injustice and oppression. At a very young age, full of determination like one with the spirit of Joan of Arc, she brought hope with the illumination of her sword leading many into a brighter future. And with her golden shield, she defends all who come under her protection to secure their destiny. As she travels all-round the continents of the universe to bring hope, joy, peace, and unity in the lives and hearts of all who come in contact with her. She was not born to die, but to cover the earth like the stars of the sky and to shine brighter and brighter into a glorious future.Raretoshi community member:‚ÄúThe art, the person, and the story, perfect NFT bro! ..‚Äù - Original #1/1 (135x180cm)  1 BTC + (US $ Shipping ) + (EU ?$ Shipping ) offer 4500$(btc) declinedFirst #1 - #12 if the price ticker is not loading then update the link BTC= + (US 50$ Shipping ) + (EU 35$ Shipping )Second #13 - #24 if the price ticker is not loading then update the link BTC= + (US 50$ Shipping ) + (EU 35$ Shipping )Payment address: 3E1iNDeRsziytX1rkJhRk1sb6swubD5G3Y1.

Some people are even dropping a few satoshis on a couple of my artworks just for fun. Because if the owner doesn't destroy the artwork, there's no way to access those bitcoins, which only makes my art more valuable. With NFC, it's easy to check the balance of the artwork.

      "body": "This is a very important artwork, the largest 1-of-1 print I‚Äôve ever created. The original sketches for this piece were sold to a company in London. This artwork holds special meaning for me because it was one of the first where I truly began exploring myself as an artist. During its creation, I spent a lot of time learning and studying Joan of Arc.From the very beginning, I decided the price for this artwork would be set at 1 BTC, no matter what fluctuations happened with Bitcoin prices. Since 2018-2019, the price has always been 1 whole BTC, and it will remain that way. I might add a few more touches to the artwork in the future, but for now, let‚Äôs see where this journey takes it.",
