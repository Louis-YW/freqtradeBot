      "body": "If you still have anything left in that wallet, move it to a safer place first before looking for help; the hackers might come back to revisit the wallet again.I'm so sorry for your lost tokens; it's really heartbreaking. You just have to make yourself strong. If this is a hack from some airdrop scammers, I believe the tokens might have been far gone by now, so I will advise you to try as much as you can to move on and take this one now as a lesson not to make such a horrible mistake again in your life. Because the chances of you getting those funds back are really, really small. This is one of the reasons why newbies are always advised to limit the way they search and rush into some airdrop, especially those that require users to connect their wallets, and even if you can't take your eyes off them, then create a separate new wallet and go with that one. It will really be less risky that way as there will be nothing in that wallet for hackers to make away with.Edit: Just check your wallet above now and you still have $1,688.77 worth of Shiba Inu and $100+ of GMT token. I will advise you to move that out now. The wallets share the same phrase, so those funds in other chains are also not safe. There is enough BnB to cover up the transaction fee. Create a new wallet and move that out.",

This incident reminded me of an incident that happened to me on 2k22. help needed I got attacked by hacker???It's like same cases. A lot of funds from transferred by hackers of my own wallet which was connected. I caught mine by being a victim of phishing while downloading the cracked game file. Here I think if your matic and others coins transaction are complete then I don't think there is anything else to do.So the things are to do now is, I quoted their suggestion given to me on that timeQuote from: PowerGlove on August 18, 2022, 05:54:41 AMI would consider your current machine compromised. Follow these steps:Unplug/disconnect it from the internet immediatelyBackup any important data onto an external driveStart again with a fresh OS installationKnuckle-punch yourself really hard in the eye for downloading and running random executables from torrent sites!Once you have a safe machine again, you should also probably do a round of password changes on all of your online accounts...Now I want to tell you that I have overcome from that situation. Everything is fine now rather better than before. So don't be crazy, be cool buddy",

I know it hurts to lose your life savings, but suicide is not the only option. If you kill yourself, will you be able to get those funds back after life? No, the best thing is not killing your self, but you should pick your self up from this and try to man up, it's okay to feel hurt, it's okay for your to also feel as if you have lost everything, it's okay for you to start thinking where you will start from, and it's also okay for you to start thinking of all the years and time it took you for you to accumulate all that and have them saved, all it cost you the time and things you deprived your self of just for you to be able to save that up.  But I must tell you this: don't allow those taught to push you to take a hatch decision; don't allow them to make you feel less human; you are still alive and you can still acquire something back; you just have to wipe those tears out. Take this as a lesson that will make you stronger; try to increase your security in your wallet; reduce the sites you visit, especially with the device with which you have your funds; and, for the main time, always don't stay alone; look for family and friends to associate yourself with; and try to forget about this. Please don't ever see suicide as part of any option; it's never a good one, and it will never be fine. It might take time for you to heal, but believe me, you will use today as an experience and as what motivated you towards what you will achieve in the future.",

Are you sure you really took all the security threads seriously? There is nothing wrong hunting for airdrop but you should only do that with a wallet you have nothing inside. Most of the hacks is connected with airdrop and giveaways, this should send a signal that it is not safe connecting your wallet to the website. I wish I can help you but I don't really know how. Maybe some other forum members who have the technical skill can assist. Sorry for your loss.",

      "body": "Sorry about your loss mate.  It is unfortunate that such happened to you. This made me curious to be also wondering that  as a senior member who should be guiding newbies here is still falling for scam site. You should have the knowledge and idea that it is not safe connecting your main wallet to a website and allowing access to your funds wether you grant access or not do not think they would have access to your funds only just allowing access without granting permission for transaction. Hacker these days have sophisticated ways of hijacking wallet and stealing from them. It baffles me that a senior member would be having such experience. Anyways it just might happen to anyone and it takes vigilance and alertness to be able to remain safe while dealing.What can be done now is just to report that wallet so it could be flagged by the chain developers while you go to the comment section of the chain explorer to make comments there as regards the wallet address activities calling on anybody who cares to know and do away with transacting with such wallet.Lastly of you still have anything left in n that wallet do well to move it away because I checked and I saw some reasonable amount of Shiba Inu still remaining and it would be good you create another wallet and move them there. Committing suicide will not bring back your assets as they are already gone. I know the pains you are going through right now losing your life time savings to scammers. It hurts bad. Next time you should learn not to save your assets in one wallet. Learn to spread your assets across different wallets for your safety. Of you had done that I think the lose would have been minimal and would not have bothered you alot. Suicide is not the best option mate. There are lots of people who lost much more than this and are still alive doing just fine. Life is not duplicate but one. If you commit suicide what would it profit your? When you can work it out to getorw money. Think positively Nd refrain from doing such mate. You will recover all you have lost.",

For airdrops, you should consider using a separate wallet where you don't store your coins, this will help prevent scam activities just incase. A lot of newbies will have to learn from this.

Depression can lead him to think abstractly. I'd add that Op should not see himself as a complete failure. He can start all over again, and see better rewards in his life. He fell victim to some coin sweepers that gained control of his wallet and took everything in it. What a bad experience, yet it's not the end. Good opportunities still awaits Op if only he can withstand this few months of suffering and stress.",
