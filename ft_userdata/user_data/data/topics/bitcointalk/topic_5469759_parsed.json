Do we keep gambling to win so we can cover up previous losses? or stop and work normally and leave gambling? Or do you have other suggestions?The first mistake is chasing losses, it will only make you lose more and will not achieve the goal of returning what was lost. Because in gambling, generally when you lose, it means you give up all the money you have left to spend. It seems like you are the type of gambler who can't control your winnings, you are always ambitious even though you have doubled your profits. Not having management is already the second mistake.So the solution is not to stop suddenly, because I'm sure that won't work at all. Start planning to reduce your spending on gambling. Then during times of the week that are usually active 7x, maybe try forcing yourself to play 3x a week. This takes too long, but if accompanied by the determination to stop, I think there's no harm in trying. This is not good advice, but at least you should know how important financial management is in gambling.",

If you lost a lot of money gambling, that just means that you are in too deep and might require help from people that will intervene with your activities. You'll never get to get your money back from gambling 100%, but you can get it through other means like working for a job or selling stuff that other people might find useful. I don't really get it why gamblers still want to justify their activities to other people, when in fact what's happening is that they're just digging a deeper hole for themselves if they continued gambling after a massive loss thinking they can get back the initial money they have put in.",

I have done that recently and I enjoy gambling more than what I did before which is betting at medium risk with the prize ain't that big. But, if you cannot control it anymore then it's better to just stay away from it. Like you said, we will just keep on losing in this industry and the winning part is very slim unless we can control our emotions and get out whenever we have a little profit. Gambling ain't for the weak heart, it will just be the start of stress and worse suicide if it cannot be controlled. A stressful environment can be the start of many types of sickness and you don't want to be in that position. When you keep on losing and you are not getting over them then it's time to stop.",
