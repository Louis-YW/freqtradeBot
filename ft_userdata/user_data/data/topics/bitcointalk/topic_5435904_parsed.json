Thanks!Why would you send USDT to BitcoinATM and pay more fees and mess around with shitcoin wallets, when you can just send Bitcoin directly and get cash?Some BitcoinATM can ask for verification so I think it would be better if you use p2p trading and decentralized exchanges like Bisq to trade BTC for cash.Your face will probably be recorded when using BitcoinATM so better be careful with that even if there isn't any kind of official verification.For best exchangers and p2p trading website without verification check out kycnot.me website.Good sources to find BitcoinATM near your location:https://www.coinatmfinder.com/https://coinatmradar.com/https://shitcoins.club/https://coinmap.org/",

Thanks!Cross-chain Bridge Aggregatorshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5389259I have used this aggregator many times and have always been satisfied with the result. But there is no TRON ecosystem, but there are all the popular Ethereum ecosystems. You don't even need an email. Try several exchange operations with small amounts.https://rango.exchange/",

I'm talking about an exchanger without any kind of registrations (other than email), verifications and whatnot. Thanks!There are two things that I would like to say1. You can directly send bitcoin to a bitcoin ATM. You don't need to convert it to USDT for transferring to a bitcoin ATM.2. Many bitcoin ATM has some kind of registration. May be KYC or photo verification. So you can't escape from registrations any way.If your motive is to get cash without any registrations then you should go for a P2P trade.",

Fortunately, with phone number, you can use 'burned' phone number for Bitcoin ATMs. You can buy and sell Bitcoins with Bitcoin ATMs so you can deposit your Bitcoins to the address given by Bitcoin ATM to sell your bitcoin. Sending it from Electrum wallet is easy.",

Once I have access to the ATM again I'll withdraw everything. Thank you so much for the links, guys! Take care <3",

Thanks!First of all you can't convert the USDT to fiat in a Bitcoin ATM unless it supports multiple cryptocurrencies. So keep bitcoin as it is if you really want to convert them into USD fiat later.to convert BTC to USDT without any registration and no email at all via forum trusted traders, you can use the escrow service if you want but in case of dealing with trusted member and moderate amount you can go first and complete the trade with no hassle.",

Both allow you to exchange cryptocurrencies with minimal registration requirements. But, you know, always be cautious with these services and do your research before using them.So, once you've converted your BTC to USDT, you might face another challenge with the BitcoinATM, as they usually deal with BTC and not USDT. I mean, you might need to find an ATM that supports USDT or convert it back to BTC before using the ATM.",

The number of bitcoin ATMs that accept bitcoin is higher than USDT and the fees are not supposed to be higher, perhaps the only advantage is the speed of withdrawal when you use this option.",
