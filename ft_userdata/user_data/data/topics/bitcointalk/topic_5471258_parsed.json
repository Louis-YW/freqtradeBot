If what you are looking for are short term profits then you need to look at the volatility of your favorite coins and pick the one that shows the highest level of volatility you can find.And this can be done by using some of the indicators which have been created for this express purpose, however it is important to mention that doing such a thing will increase the risk you are incurring in a dramatic way and you should find a way to counter this tendency, since if you were to fail at achieving this goal the volatility could end up playing against you.",

But still on still we have to limit our level of involvement and how much we risk on such coins since we are just speculating the short term ability and don't take it long term risk and potentials into account.",

      "body": "For short-term speculation, I'd suggest keeping an eye on what's trending now. Over the recent weeks, several major coins have shown remarkable momentum.Solana and Chainlink are the two examples. They have shown great price action in the past week, their bottoms are probably in already and they might keep going up until they hit the next big resistance. Be careful though if you want to get in now as the first leg up has already happened. But still, I'd look for dips to increase allocation on these.As for meme coins, I've mostly stayed away from them. The risks and the gas fees (for those on Ethereum) aren't compatible with my style.",

If i may go by in giving you my recommendation here, you can choose ethereum, doge, litecoin, these are the three altcoins i know has a better future prospect on investment if you can hodl, there are a number of digital altcoins recently introduced as well but i cannot take the risk in those currencies for an investment because we don't know what may come after their speedy performance within a little time unlike those that have been consistent despite market challenges.",

What altcoin is the best for short-term speculation,  some of my friends offline have speculated people but then I don't have much faith in meme coins. BNB would be a better choice for short-term trading as its price nowadays is not too high. I'm also doing trading in BNB as day trading because holding it is also better, you can hold it for a long term. I think it is the coin that is better for day trade and also if someone wants a big profit he can hold it for the long term. As we know its price is swinging very quickly as we have seen too many times, the only quick I have seen so far is that we have seen its price daily change very quickly. Similarly, there is another option for you is Ethereum, should also invest in it for day trade and quick trade which will be also profitable. As the market is quite good now, I think both of these coins would be better to invest unless it is too late. Now is a chance for a better investment plan regarding these coins.",

So for that, I believe holding such a coin for the long term is no different from holding a stablecoin since its volatility rate is very low and the possibility of a big market Lumb depends on Bitcoin.",

Now that there is a massive moved of Bitcoin few days ago that gave many altcoins price to start displaying green light to alert short term and long term investors to get set for the massive bullish that is going to take place soon, and it will help short term investors to make a good income.

I still understand that they have potential, but initially it's just hype. It's been a few weeks since I last visited Friend Tech, and I was actually quite surprised with the interface changes as well as seeing a lot of exciting activity on it, but besides buying the KEY, perhaps need more time for them to upgrade the product.Quote from: tokeweed on October 24, 2023, 12:32:14 PMAnother thing that could happen is after the run up on BTC and alts get saturated, it could happen like the last time and a lot of the money went in NFTs.  Better start window shopping if you missed getting in the alts.I hear a lot about this too, but some of the categories I'm looking at in terms of L1, NFTs, P2E, and even memecoins are all responding quite well to the bitcoin movement.

I mean if it is more volatile how could be better if it fails suddenly, we can say it is crypto but we should already have some precautions for it through which we could take a step forward. The main thing a person should do is he has to look at the coins which didn't have more changes in them. For example, if it is changing its price faster I know it will give him more profit in the day trading but if he goes to loss then also it will give him a sudden loss which will be not a good idea I think in this case. For sure, coins in the market are more volatile in between some of them but there are also some good plans to buy them before they change their nature.As indicators would be a better choice to take control over the prices I mean to get possible notifications about these coins from time to time and then take a step forward for better investment.",
