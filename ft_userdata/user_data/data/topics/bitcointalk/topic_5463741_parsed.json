  "content": "Hey guys, I run a small product/pool & need kawpow miners ASAP. I can pay out in BTC (or any major coin) @ nicehash fixed spot price or whatever your favorite calc price + 2% on a PPS basis (I assume most miners are looking for stable payouts but I can offer higher, but more volatile payouts). I'll pay highest for up to 50 GH - show me your paystub from the highest paying pool - I will beat it by 2%. I have software to monitor hashrate, I have no problem using a trusted escrow service & paying up front on an hourly/daily/etc basis -- please contact me if you run a GPU farm - - thanks!",
