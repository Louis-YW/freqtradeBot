That is one of the reasons it is hard to find the right shitcoins. There are many shitcoins that do better in the past, they increased significantly and nearly all of them are now back to the price they were in 2020 when bull run started. If need be, I can name many of them and their prices. So people that are smart gamble with them, make money and convert to bitcoin. To hold bitcoin is better. If you hold bitcoin and you are having unrealized loss, you do not need to bother to have losses which is unrealized and not that significant like altcoins, you just leave your bitcoin holding alone and the price will increase and get to all-time-high and you will make more money. Holding bitcoin is better, but some people use low amount of money to gamble with altcoins while the largest bag they hold is bitcoin which can be more than 70% of their holdings.",

You should begin right away; this is the right time. We are all anticipating a bull run, so it will be simple to earn more money with it right now.

Quote Many turn into shitcoin investor. After knowing about Bitcoin. Unfortunately it didn't work out the way they thought.I am a tipical example of that. when I heard about Bitcoin how it started from $0.01 to thousands of dollars I thought shitcoin also has that potential. I was working and was investing in valueless coins thinking dey will be like Bitcoin. but never did as Bitcoin. all gradually disappeared. And that made me regret no investing it on Bitcoin then.  Many people fail to understand the characteristics of Bitcoin or do not look at it at all, after hearing about Bitcoin they just rush to make such investment. That is what I consider misconception, you also misunderstood the meaning and orientation of Bitcoin that is what lead you to such mistake and sorry for that experience. That wasn't the intention for you to know about the success of others in Bitcoin. You know, shitcoins are considered to be shit because it does not have a clear vision on what to really impact or offer, this shitcoins are ideals of individuals who on the cost of looking for what to create they have to build an invention on another person's invention. Looking at most of the shitcoins they do not have a Blockchain technology of their own, they relay on other chains inorder to work. Which means it is not strong enough to make a good progress most other successful coins you see now have their own blocks, the stress of create a Blockchain is what most shitcoins avoid and making it very much useless to some point.(for instance: if I create a coin with out much investment in it, just created it on another platform. What ever happens will be non of my business after all I didn't put in my money so I have nothing to loss ) that is a typical language of shitcoins developer.I hope I have made something clear to you now? Quote so I would like you guys to shear your ideas on this an the possible solution. Like your topic said (never invest in shitcoin) avoid shitcoins it can rub shits on you and your career entirely.Don't engage your self with anything that has to do with shitcoins if your knowledge of cryptocurrencies is not enough to engage.",

But shtcoin might be easy to manipulate causes for the market to be highly volatile, but it's actually good to invest in them for the short term. I actually do this, some shtcoin might be literally sht but some of the projects have potential to invest with. But it's not recommended for the long term, you will have to sell it for a quick flip. You really need to research the projects like their roadmap how they will benefit the holder something like that. They don't need to stay away from it if they are newbies, they could invest with a small amount first so they could experience the difference of Bitcoin to shtcoin, but it would be best if they already have the background and knowledge on a certain coin/token.",

Then, we will come to only one or a few possibilities, which are they made those profits with Luck or they did a better analysis than you and did not take shitcoins as BTC. Because that's the first mistake you made there. If you really think BTC is the King then my friend there is only one king and that is BTC as we all know it covers half of the market dominance of the overall crypto sphere. So for a shitcoin to compete with it, needs a hell lot of attraction and trading volume so that its market cap would surpass Bitcoin's.

The presence of so-called \"shitcoins\" is intended to provide alternatives, but their projects typically struggle to sustain themselves over time, resulting in a greater risk associated with shitcoins compared to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Bitcoin far surpasses shitcoins in terms of quality. This implies that those who profit from shitcoins often merely perceive themselves as fortunate, perhaps due to certain individuals artificially inflating prices, allowing investors to capitalize.To date, for serious investment purposes, I have never recommended shitcoins as a solid investment instrument.

Even me I would say it is quite hard to do proper research on shitcoins because almost all of them look decent from onset and usually generates large community. Some of these things are part of what one will check to see if the project is a legit one but along the line they would still dump the token after scamming users. So the best thing is just follow this your pattern and only invest an amount that you can afford to lose. Also one thing I notice about shitcoins like you have pointed out is that whenever they start dropping in price avoid investing in them thinking they would raise again because most of them do not probably because it is a rug pull by the team. This has usually been seen after every bull run where you see shotcoins showing potential turn to dust because it’s team have achieved their target",
