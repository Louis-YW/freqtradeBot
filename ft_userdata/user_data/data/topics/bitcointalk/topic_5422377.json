      "body": "Can you buy things anywhere in fiat without someone somewhere comparing it to the Euro, Krona, Pound, Dollar, yen, yuan or all six before they've set the price? Does this mean anything?If fiat disappeared, bitcoin would organically be able to take over much like anything else people chose as currency/being valuable.If you buy something made in China and you're not buying it in yuan, someone's done a conversion somewhere. If you're buying something in an airport in currency not accepted in that country it wouldn't be possible under your own aspects. Most companies that handle crypto conversions at the moment deal in fiat because it's what they want to collect or to remain competitive. Most things are priced arbitrarily, it generally doesn't matter what units they're priced in as long as a company can make a profit overall.",

Gold and some other items have been used as money since centuries ago and they are still money. What is more important is that only fiat price is controlled, but the money in the past were all just like bitcoin which their prices are because of their demand and supply.",

That said Bitcoin is created as currency meaning it can do the same function as fiat currency but at a more transparent and censor-free transaction.  Bitcoin doesn't need any third-party financial company to create a transaction so in short, how can a more advanced currency system need an almost obsolete fiat currency system?Quote from: Obari on November 20, 2022, 08:30:21 PMcan Bitcoin be easily used and spent without Fiat?My answer is NoWhat's your opinion?My answer is yes. You can send bitcoin without fiat, and that's it.  It is different when people force a subject to accept Bitcoin when it does not really accept Bitcoin.",

They do not have to force it to happen because that will mean they are fighting for bitcoin to remain relevant but are forcing fiat to die off. If things are seen that way it will be partiality, not just only with bitcoin but every other aspect of life. We have to allow this things happen naturally so we can pick the best among them.",

For instance, you wanna lodge or book a reservation in any country, your arm should be if such place do accept bitcoin and if yes then it would be possible to deal with. Fiat is just like units to show value of what you wanted.. lemme say you lodge in a hotel room worth $500 per night and how do you pay is via fiat that which has represented the value and quantity of what you want same it's with bitcoin which might likely be some fraction of bitcoin to represent such value. In general fiat comes in wherever they don't accept bitcoin in any areas you find yourself, and if it happens that bitcoin is acceptable then no need to move and deal with fiat.",

For now, like it or not, fiat is the king of money and will remain in use until the government intends to phase it out. Although it has a lot of problems, we will never be able to stop using it. As for bitcoin, it is actually becoming an investment, an asset, a commodity rather than a currency so comparing it to fiat is not correct.",

And also some of the companies do accept payment with Bitcoin instead of converting it to Fiat currency before making any purchase, with this kind of acceptance of cryptocurrency to this extent, i think fiat have no much impact to play. So from my perspective, what's hindering bitcoin to not be value without accompany of fiat currency is massive adoption.",

It's not that Bitcoin needs fiat, the protocol is designed without any fiat systems in the loop, but Bitcoin is not adopted enough to replace fiat in daily life. That's why investment is Bitcoin's biggest use case, instead of payments.",

We still live in a FIAT world and bitcoin won't replace it any time soon. Heck I believe FIAT can't be replaced by anything... Not by bitcoin, not by gold, not by any other asset. The greatest weakness of FIAT is also its greatest strength which is getting printed at will. Believe it or not, somehow we need an asset that loses its value over time.
