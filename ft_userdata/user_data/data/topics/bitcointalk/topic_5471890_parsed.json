      "body": "You are totally right that we should not limit ourselves to something by saying that we might not gain anything from it. You joined the Utopia campaign, and to make a review, chatted with the AI bot, and then came to know about the Cryptography Mailing list. This was before this forum, that's why that chat stated in its reply, translation is: QuoteSatoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, does not have his own official forum. However, Satoshi Nakamoto actively communicated with the Bitcoin community through a cryptography message board called \"The Cryptography Mailing List\" in 2008 and early 2009. There, he discussed and detailed his ideas and concepts about Bitcoin to people interested in cryptography and digital currency. After the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto gradually disappeared from the community and public communication, so his identity and real existence remain mysterious to this day.As you can read, it says, it was used before any forums. He shared the idea of p2p bitcoin in that mailing list in around Fri Oct 31 17:33:09 EDT 2008You learned about the mailing list and shared it with us, and now I have come to know about it too. https://medium.com/xische-reports/birth-of-bitcoin-9fb451e00886",
