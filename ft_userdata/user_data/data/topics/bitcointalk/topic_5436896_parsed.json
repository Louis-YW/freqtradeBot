  "content": "I have some brand-able and premium domain names (blockchain/crypto/cryptofinance related) that I am wanting to sell. Some are low character, others are brand-able/premium names, others are the latter and aged. I will post a list of the age previews of the names to get an idea of characters and suffixes soon. I am posting this from mobile as an expression of interest for now. I am happy to disclose the domain names to those who are in the market and also to those who have a network who would are interested in premium domains. None of these domains have been used in any projects. I am also offering a commission from the sale amount to anyone who is serious about helping me sell these domains. The percentage/amount would be to be discussed and based on the sale. I am also willing to use referral links for marketplaces that accept cryptocurrency for selling premium domains. There do not seem to be many reliable ones. For sales that are p2p, an escrow is required. Thank you!-edit-I've decided not to sell for the time being. Thread locked.",

      "body": "Many people might not send a private message for the list. But if you post your domain name here publicly which you want to sell many people might be interested to place an offer or buy a domain from the list of your domain. So, it will be better if you can post the domain names on here that you want to sell.",

      "body": "I will post the domains when I am online next. The domains:- Are all 3+ years old (some 5-10)- Some are 3 character, some are short and brand-able- All of them are registered with Namecheap where instant transfer available and I am quite sure this is irreversible, though if there is a holding period I am fine with leaving this in escrow. I will only be taking offers for the time being unless I am able to be in touch with someone who has provable domain valuation experience. I can assure that I am not basing my expectations on godaddy/free evaluation tools. I am very sure of some of their value.",
