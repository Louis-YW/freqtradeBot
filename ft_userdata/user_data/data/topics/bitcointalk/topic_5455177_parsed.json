I think this is the best one for you and it most common.Fedora is only for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). With this you can not be running software for profit.Kali is more powerful then these other 2. It is used for information security tasks.",

      "body": "Well, let me tell you, choosing the right Linux distro is like picking the perfect pizza topping - it's a matter of personal taste and what you're craving for! Ubuntu is like the classic Margherita, reliable and beginner-friendly. Fedora is like the spicy Pepperoni, offering cutting-edge features and a vibrant community. And Kali is like the extra-cheesy and intense Meat Lover's, designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts. It all depends on your flavor preferences and what you want to accomplish.",
