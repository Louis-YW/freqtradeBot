I was born in the USSR. Unfortunately. But now I understand better what evil is fraught with totalitarian regimes, where rights and freedoms are an empty phrase.In the USSR, nominally and \"indicatively\" women had the same \"rights\" as men. But besides the fact that in the USSR people did not have rights, there was always a rather arrogant attitude towards women. No, of course there were women - \"exhibition specimens\", but in 99% of cases, they were citizens who were rather limited in their abilities. All this was based on a historical \"habit\" that a woman is, at best, a housewife and nothing more. In the USSR, they tried to show that they had already got rid of the \"tired legacy of the tsarist regime\", but it turned out extremely badly ... Where women succeeded as much as possible \" realize themselves\" and reach some heights - there were purely humanitarian areas - kindergartens, schools, hospitals. And then with reservations. And these complexes remained even among those who were born in the 70s+.I am very glad that the USSR - the \"prison of peoples\" - ceased to exist, and people received FREEDOM and RIGHTS. Now in Ukraine there are a huge number of women entrepreneurs, owners of medium-sized businesses, in senior positions in large companies, etc.",

While women trend towards being more emotional and intuitive. Different mentalities and tendencies spanning genders have their pros and cons.The biggest obstacle for women being successful entrepreneurs is the lack of peer support. The closest thing to positive reinforcement most women have are lamebrained memes that tell them to follow their passion in business. Most women never see the hours entrepreneurs put in to be successful behind the scenes. Women love action. The mundane reality of sitting for hours discussing vaporware theories of business, finance and economics is something they might find boring. There aren't many women who would find those types of discussions interesting. Most men thoroughly enjoy that type of debate. The way that they enjoy analyzing and arguing over statistics in sports.Men's natural tendencies make it easier for them to pursue a future in business. Women have some advantages over men. But I think it could be safe to say most women get bored with the technical side of things.",

There are many areas in which we almost never find women. For example, the building and construction sector has no women investors at all, as well as mining and the production of solid materials. These are all sectors in which women have no luck without a valid reason.",

Some traits may just be more deeply ingrained in the two different genders, like women being less arrogant about the potential success of a venture or perhaps on the last statistic - they are more likely to keep pushing at one particular type of business until it reaches success than a man who might be more switchable (which can potentially be a positive or a negative). Being more confident in success is not necessarily a positive trait in men, because it can often breed unnecessary or extra risk taking along with more wasteful behavior.",

The rate of poverty is increasing and women has to work to support the men especially in countries that are majorly patriarch countries that originally didn't give women the chance to work and contribute to family financial challenges. Those countries that religated women to the background and kitchen for just cooking, giving birth and taking care of home front plus the husband. But now things have started to changed and thanks to the economic realities of the world.Women Emancipation is the major change that has touched the world and the first agent of that is education. Education has revolutionised the women in the society to seek for equal rights with the men and developed countries have since adopted women in their liberal minds.",

Yeah, the trend has been for women to be like men (and vice versa, if Hollywood is to be believed), which I find to be unfortunate--but that's another story.Men have traditionally been the risk takers, the pioneers, which is why so many companies have been founded by men.  Take a look at bitcoin's history, too: I haven't read about any early players that were women, and the creation and investment in cryptocurrency was an enormous risk back in 2009-10.But today?  Women have practically no barriers if they want to be entrepreneurs (or anything else for that matter).  Then again, I can't speak for venture capitalists and whoever else an entrepreneur has to deal with to get his/her project off the ground.  What I do know is that attitudes toward women in business have changed dramatically since at least the 1960s.  There are women CEOs, board members, managers, you name it, and companies are practically fighting each other trying to hire women.  Their reasons might be suspect, but that's the way it is.So yeah, I'd say it's up to women themselves if they want to do what men have traditionally done.",
