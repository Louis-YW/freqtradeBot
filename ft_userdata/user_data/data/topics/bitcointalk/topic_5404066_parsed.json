Was there any change or something is wrong with my browser?I have never had that problems before, but recently I have started using extension \"Vytal\" which manipulates geolocation data (https://vytal.io/). Could it be related to that?",

To complement jackg, as far as my understanding goes, this is mostly related with sessions[1][2] and in this particular case time based expiration. According to Wikipedia:QuoteTime-oriented approachesTime-oriented approaches to session reconstruction look for a set period of user inactivity commonly called an \"inactivity threshold.\" Once this period of inactivity is reached, the user is assumed to have left the site or stopped using the browser entirely and the session is ended.Quote from: LoyceMobile on June 25, 2022, 07:16:14 PMI've had them too lately, and much faster than it used to be.Perhaps Theymos tweaked the time for the session to expire recently? There doesn't seem to exist a consensus on time, so I guess it's up to whoever is running the website to decide how long each session lasts.[1]https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2731565[2]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(web_analytics)",

It's weird: a few times it told me my session expired just shortly after I clicked the link and typed a message.I've also had Merit links tell me the session expired, and those links don't even have the \"sesc=\" in the URL.Unless there's a strong reason to have session expire, it would be nice if it can be extended to a much longer time. I often take hours before I post something.",

So, when you press preview in this state, it wouldn't be saving in the drafts either. I've only ever run into it when allowing browsers to keep tabs open after closing, if that makes sense. So, when launching it back up, it'll revert to your last session, with all the tabs that were open. If you try to do any actions without refreshing, you'll run into the session invalid or expiration whatever the error message says.",

I'm saying something based on experience, but I don't know if anyone else has (LoyceV and Whales confirm no). It might be good to prove it here again in case I experience it again sometime.Anyway since it's not a very pressing issue then I think we can copy all the posts to paste back in the same thread for a different session. So it shouldn't be the server's fault.",
