Exit Bitcoin Core, change the wallet name, and load the wallet again.See Bitcoin Wiki for the wallet's location.",

Open it with any simple text editor. You will find something which looks like this:Code:{    \"wallet\": [        \"WalletName1\",        \"WalletName2\",        \"WalletName3\"    ]}Change the name of the wallet you renamed to the new name.",

The proper way to do this is to unload the wallet first in \"File->Close wallet\" menu while the target wallet is selected or unloadwallet command.You can now proceed to rename the wallet in the 'wallets' folder, then load it again in Bitcoin Core.If you have pruned your blockchain, doing this may trigger another full IBD as indicated in the pop-up message.",
