I can only imagine the face of this guy when he was a kid. He must have been bullied every now and then.  Who is he trying to protect from bitcoin? The people who want to buy bitcoin can do it without an ETF. Gensler simply wants to delay a bull run for as long as he can and he knows BlackRock pouring money into bitcoin would do exactly that. Gensler is politically influenced by the Biden administration, that's the truth. Maybe that bulling is why he's so socially awkward. His face expressions remind me of Zuck, but Zuck is even weirder. I'm not into bullying people, but you can see Gensler isn't the guy you love hanging out with. He's that weird kid that never joins on the fun and likes to tell on you to the teacher.",

And the US can not let that happen. Most definitely. I already know the hype is only but to cause little pump in Bitcoin and get some people liquidated. In fact, I already use this Dual Investment strategy that tends to get a coin at a low price and sell when it increases. So, if BTC gets lower boom I have set to buy it. Then again, I don't really look up to only SEC to decide what to do. I also haven't forgotten there are different Economic Impacts that could affect the market",

      "body": "The straightforward answer is \"NO,\" and the reason behind this negative response may not carry much weight. This is because the majority of senior members who have previously commented seem to share my perspective. Currently, the SEC has other priorities, and recent developments from the SEC suggest that they are leaning towards delaying the decision for another 120 to 145 days. Consequently, it appears that the timeline for ETF approval will extend into March.This is the most probable scenario. Additionally, it's worth noticing that the prevailing narrative driving the uptrend of Bitcoin at the moment revolves around the ETF. However, there will be an alternative narrative that is going to support the market until the ETF approvals soon. Nevertheless, based on current sentiments, it seems likely that the ATH (All-Time High) will be achieved following the approval of ETFs.",

Why would they move away the free money, I know the risk involved in such things is so high but the SEC and governmental organizations do know how to keep their hand clean and how to blame others and how can they seize funds if things go wrong path.

This is just a speculation and the SEC always has a choice to decline the approval or else they shouldn’t prolonging it already since it’s just a waste of time. SEC still have an option that’s why they are delaying it and those people that speculating that ETF approval is imminent are those people that involve with the ETF or people that hyping the community due to there personal interests.I really hate how crypto community paying attention a lot on the ETF approval. Don’t get me wrong, I like ETF to be approved but this decision time always cause price panic on crypto market which hurt the price growth.",

I don’t want bitcoin to be a boring boomer asset like gold.Exactly, that's why they are not accepting nor rejecting ETFs because they are waiting for more opportunities that are yet to come where they would buy more BTC and can fill their bags. Because once the kite leaves the ground and reaches in the sky, then it will be hard to catch it. I mean to say, once the halving started and then the bull run started. Then these organizations might not find another opportunity to fill their bags with BTC that's why they are doing it now, and buying at lower prices. Because the possibility of not seeing the BTC at this current rate in the future is also very low. Because the adoption of BTC has increased now, and after the acceptance of the ETFs, this will increase more. They are waiting for the right moment to use this card for their own benefit.",

And why do they keep delaying it, at the start this factor does make some impact on the market, by creating some hype and by playing an important sentiment role. But now, those who know what is happening, don't even care about it and leave all their interest at the end dates which are almost in the 2024 after or before halving, I am not quite sure.I did not mean to say that BTC price solely depends on SEC, instead, I was trying to say, why people are giving that much importance to a single entity SEC. while they can simply ignore it and use the BTC technology. I do understand Investors and other institutes have to keep an eye on the FA (Fundamental analysis) and have to make decisions based on these institutions. But I don't think that the SEC does need that much attention. If they are given that much attention, then they will try to manipulate the market as they know all eyes are on them.",

Actually approving Bitcoin ETF is not an easy decision and SEC need more time for proper investigation before pointed out last decision. currently 9 big companies looking for approvals including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Valkyrie Investments, ARK Invest and some others Full List Many members are thinking that SEC wants delay so that they buy the dip but I think something different. SEC main role is to protect the investors fund in better way and for this purpose the full review of each new application is required. Second SEC will be also looks for stability in the market , investigating fraud in crypto and proper way to solve this issue, how to meet application with legal framework of SEC regulations , review from stake holders which needs lot of time atleast six months so I hope we Will get something positive in the future not earlier",

The answer is very simple: because they know they have no real arguments against it and that's why they lost in court. Delaying allows them to increase time between decisions and a final negative decision may lead to another court case against the SEC. I also think that Gensler doesn't want to be responsible for approving it. He doesn't want it on his shoulders possibly because he's been offered something in return for not approving it. He knows he's not going to be the head of the SEC forever so he'll delay things for as long as he's in charge.",
