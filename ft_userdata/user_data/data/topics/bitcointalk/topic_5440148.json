      "body": "The major source of buying an altcoin is bitcoin over fiat. That is why you keep seeing the altcoin<>btc exchange rates and only few fiat exchange rates. Therefore the price of Bitcoin influences the price of altcoins. Again a change is price of Bitcoin is often indicative of marker panic that seeps into altcoins because they are similar assets under the heading of crypto. Because bitcoin has a huge userbase it's movements get nullified quickly because of the opposite side trade. Unlike altcoins which are full of distrust from its investors, situation becomes more volatile.I think these are main reason why bitcoin is the king is it's userbase who trust the system.",

If bitcoin continues raising they pump significantly and if it falls they dump depending on the dip. It depends on how good the condition of the team's trust and the quality of an Altcoin is, but what is certain is that the Altcoin price is very much influenced by Bitcoin, there are some good Altcoins, but they will not be able to touch and affect Bitcoin, so far Bitcoin is still leading and the graph has very stable power good, but this doesn't happen to Altcoins where they are unstable and make investors not too sure and there are so many projects in Altcoins, even though some of them are good, they don't know the future of the project.Quote from: I_Anime on February 17, 2023, 07:43:20 AM  Trying to get a good altcoin is always tasking and  after all the effort even if it reaches expectations, it's price still remains dependent on how Bitcoin is growing.

So in the End bitcoin still remains the King The reasons why Bitcoin remains the king are numerous. For instance, it was the first decentralized cryptocurrency payment system, and all altcoins were developed subsequently as copies. Additionally, it is distributed, which means that anyone can download their own copy of the blockchain and act as a validator. In contrast, many altcoins, despite claiming to be decentralized, are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. Last but not least, there is no identity behind Bitcoin; there is no physical person to whom one can go and seek explanations. In contrast, if an offense were committed, someone like Vitalik, who is associated with Ethereum, could be arrested, which could lead to the collapse of Ethereum. I believe that these are all crucial factors to bear in mind, as they contribute to the rise of Bitcoin.",

So in the End bitcoin still remains the King The real reason why Bitcoin is still at top is because it’s major holders is not weak hands compared to other shitcoins in the market. Satoshi and many old time Bitcoin holder holds the majority of Bitcoin supply and still untouched while Altcoin top holders usually belongs to the team wallet or exchange liquidity which often pump and dump the price.Bitcoin will never be replaced by altcoins since altcoins has a pre-mined or the majority of token supply belongs to the team that is still active on liquidating there tokens into fiat.",

The fact that it is mostly managed by an individual and companies those altcoins were dependent on how the Bitcoin moves. If there will be a time that altcoins can guarantee their investors that they will not be out of service then they can managed to have loyal supporters like how Bitcoin holders still doing UpTo now.",

Many people say bitcoin is old, slow, that's true but bitcoin is the pioneer of blockchain technology and bitcoin is also the most widely accepted. As for altcoins, they're introducing new, cutting-edge technology but what they're doing looks like a mess, aside from being used to create pumps and dumping, altcoins don't have any real benefits as advertised. No altcoin can last long, new technology that can't last is just trash.",

      "body": "The reason Bitcoin is still, and always will be king, is because there is only one Bitcoin and its extremely unlikely anything could ever compete with Bitcoin. It is unique and provides tremendous value to the world (value which is still only at the beginning of being realized).Every single other cryptocurrency is not unique and could easily be replaced. Even Ethereum could easily be replaced by numerous other smart contract platforms. People talk about Bitcoin having the first mover advantage, but that is only a tiny bit of why it is number one. Ethereum's advantage lays entirely on being the first smart contract platform. I'm not trying to diss Ethereum, just pointing out that it leads the crypto smart contract world simply because it was first and its network effect of being first is the only reason it is still first, but its possible if other crypto platforms ever catch on they could overtake Ethereum. While this is not something that could happen to Bitcoin because its value and advantages are entirely unique and nothing is competing with it.Bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency, it is the crypto that is money, it is the only open global secure and sovereign payment network and currency in the world. It is the only crypto that isn't controlled centrally by a founder or company or small group.Yes crypto price movements largely still follow the ups and down of Bitcoin, but that just dictates price direction. Bitcoin being king has nothing to do with that, Bitcoin is king because nothing competes with it and nothing can compete with it. It is the one and only thing in crypto that is unique and therefore the only cryptocurrency that is incredibly valuable. Smart contracts and whatnot as a whole are valuable, but that doesn't mean any single crypto is valuable, whereas with Bitcoin it is the only thing in existence that can do what it does so it is the one and only cryptocurrency that is singularly valuable.This basic piece of crypto education is lost on most in the crypto world who are just chasing gains and go around thinking random altcoins will replace Bitcoin or think Ethereum will take over from Bitcoin. This is why I always say there is Bitcoin and then there is Crypto. Two entirely different things. No matter what becomes of Crypto, or any specific crypto like Ethereum or anything else, Bitcoin will continue to be uniquely valuable to the world in a huge way. Because Bitcoin and Crypto are two entirely different things presumably eventually Crypto price won't just follow Bitcoin, and regardless of how Crypto as a whole does or how Ethereum or any single crypto does, fail or succeed, Bitcoin will keep growing. Bitcoin is one of the most important inventions of the century, while crypto is just using the tech Bitcoin invented to make a new industry of companies (that at least so far have pretty much just been fads that come and go every market cycle). That is why Bitcoin is the king. It is the only cryptocurrency that is 100% here to stay and providing the world with unique value.",
