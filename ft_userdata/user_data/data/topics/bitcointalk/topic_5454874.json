But how do we get stat from that country that they are actually accepting bitcoin because I believe what ever information being shared here are hardly to be known, maybe anyone from that same country can attest it to be true. But nonetheless, this number is really encouraging meaning if we could have something like this across the globe then nothing stops bitcoin from being legalized because I know too well that even the government that refuses to legalized it are directly or indirectly taking part of it but may not opening say they are involved.",

The thing is cashback isn't given in Bitcoin but rather in LVGA as Yogee stated.  So the marketer is hitting two birds in one stone here, marketing Bitcoin and at the same time giving their Payment system apps an exposure.  If anyone isn't familiar with LVGA coin here is a brief description.  More or less this is a wallet application advertisementQuoteLVGA are a local stablecoin. They can be purchased within the MyLugano app and collected through the cashback while shopping at local affiliated shops. Unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin LVGA can be used only in Lugano and once obtained they cannot be exchanged or traded for other currencies. LVGA are not subject to fluctuation being \"pegged\" to the Swiss franc. Thus, they have no speculative intent but exists solely and exclusively as a form of incentive for local spending in Lugano.And you can find more information in this site: https://my.lugano.ch/en/Quote from: avikz on June 02, 2023, 04:50:59 PMToday morning someone argued that BRC-20 tokens are going to help bitcoin adoption.

At the current state of the Bitcoin network, I also don't think BRC 20 token give a positive effect on Bitcoin adoption.  No one wants a congested high transaction fee cryptocurrency.  If the high fees and network congestion continues, people will look for an alternative.  BRC-20 is only giving benefits to the miners but gives problems to Bitcoin users.",

From the source i have they are working with crypto payment facilitator GoCrypto to help the merchants accept BTC lightning, Tether and LVGA transactions fast and conveniently through their pos terminals. Nevertheless, it is not a bad initiative, and it is good for crypto adoption, this is the link [1] to read more about it:[1] https://gocrypto.com/blog/get-onboard-the-crypto-payment-train-in-lugano-switzerland",

I have seen these kinds of promotions, although in fiat but in the end the company gets their money back eith huge profits. There's always a loop hole somewhere the business owners are utilising unknown to the public. Meanwhile, who pays for the transaction fee. Let's say the 10% cashback covers for the transaction fee. It's all fine and a good win for cryptocurrency because the offer is  not exclusively for bitcoin.",

I do not think that Switzerland has established an automated system to monitor these transfers, nor do I imagine that Switzerland is tolerant with those shops, even if it is a crypto-friendly with regard to individuals.The application of these discounts at a specific rate to all stores raises many hypotheses as well, which remain ambiguous. In addition to all the issues related to privacy and how these attractive offers can enable the regulatory authorities to track the financial activities of both individuals and small companies (Shops) .",

Give me your identity and private information and get a chance of getting a 10% discount on all your purchases using your identity, because that's how it seems to me.If they want to promote crypto currency, then they should do it the other way around, since the bonus is to come from the LGVA payment only. Since they are able to create a working and functional token that could be used as a means of payment, they can still use that method, which increases the usage of the currency, but this time no KYC should be mandatory, and such a bonus should also be applied to every other currency used as payment, provided that it's being paid from the appropriate app.Anyhow, it's good to have businesses actually recognize the use of crypto currency, no matter how little it shows that adoption is rapidly growing even if all payments are not directly Bitcoin-related.",

This week there is one young person who accepts payments using crypto has to deal with the police and the person concerned has also been detained at the police station. It's a very surprising phenomenon that our country is not playing around in cracking down on bans and it's just one person trying to accept bitcoin as a means of transaction and imagine if most do that?Lugano is a city in Switzerland and mostly accepts means of payment using bitcoins, but actually in that city not only accepts bitcoins as legal tender but other cryptos can also be used to a large extent. So it's no wonder that what they are doing is an important aspect of providing an effective service and this has been going on since 2022, this program is also believed to have a positive impact on business growth there.",

They are a Pizza store and take advantage of Bitcoin Pizza day to attract more customers to their store.Like in Bitcointalk we have Bitcasino.io with their $50 give away to anyone who order pizzas and make proof with photos. They will pay back $50 to those users directly in accounts on Bitcasino.io.I will like more if the pizza store do cash back in Bitcoin. You come to our store, order and eat pizzas and get 10% cash back in bitcoin, not in cash. They can use Lightning network to do cash back in bitcoin.
