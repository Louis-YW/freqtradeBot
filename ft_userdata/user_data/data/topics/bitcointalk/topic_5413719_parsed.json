Version 2 is a Dogecoin, funded with 1 Doge. Looks to be multi colored enamel coated, also in Ebay.. but more difficult to source. There is a direct site that would be cheaper.

While my OCD did not allow me to NOT get one I feel the exact same way. This coin screams “scammy” to me even tho as far as I know it’s a legit coin….

There are definitely worse coins out there, with a much higher retail (premium) price, with NO Crypto attached....but it's always a good thing to be informed. You bring up a good point about the small amount of satoshis not being worth redeeming.  A lot of people who use Bitcoin don't understand how coins work in their wallet and how transactions are built.  I would say it's worse than people not being bothered to redeem.  There's a good chance they couldn't redeem anything from this coin if they wanted to.  The small amount still takes up space on the blockchain for the transfer, and you have to pay for that space.  This amount would virtually be eaten by transaction fees.  This is why a lot of exchanges or other coins that hold value don't bother with these small amounts and have thresholds for transactions.  I'm always up for buying silver, but this seems like it's an attempt to lure people into overpaying for a coin because it has what amounts to a worthless crypto attachment.  Collectors will collect though.  There are certainly more overpriced coins you could buy.",
