  "content": "Hello everyone, I found my old pc I used to mine bitcoin around 2009/2010. I already read several topics about the way to try to recover the wallet but I'm having issues.Specifically for one detail: after a few days of mining, noticing that the profit was few pennies per day (lol), I gave up on the idea and unistalled the client (I think).After the unistall process, the pc was being used i'd say for another couple years (might be useful to know for the search of deleted files). Since back then i was using both this pc but also my dad's laptops, and since it was more than 10 years ago, I'm just going by memory. Here's all I know:- I mined btc for a few days and i was making few pennies per day.- I think i unistalled the client due to the size of the blockchain you had to download to run the client.- I didnt do any backup- I have no bitcoin folder in the appdata folderUnistalling the bitcoin client (which means i have no bitcoin folder inside appdata folder) makes the whole recovery process impossible? Is there any way to check if the bitcoin client was indeed installed on any of the hd I have (both pc and laptops)? So i can narrow the research to the one hd that matters(I checked in all hard drives inside the appdata folder)?I found and tried the keyhunter phython script but it gives me syntax error (windows 10 python 3 and i also tried with python 2.7.3)I tried hexworkshop and searched for the \"magic bytes\" but couldnt find anything.Please I need some answers so at least i can let this whole thing go for good.",

Please also make sure you're not mixing up things, since I don't think that the altcoin worth the effort.About the altcoin, no I?m not mixing up because I remember mining on my dad's pc because I didnt have one for myself until 2011 when I went to university. So the range is 2009 up to sept 2010. I remember I was making few pennies per day so i could be 1/3 btc if i mined in 2010 or maybe 50/100 if i mined in the 2009. But i dont remember anything other than \"few pennies per day\"No partition because the pc hasn't been used for years after the 2011. It still has windows xp.I would like to find someone to explain me how to use the keyhunter.py script since I have no coding knowledge. I did an image disk of the hard drive to avoid more data corruption but then I simply can't make the script work. What I did was to download python 3, I run cmd in the image disk folder(first question which folder? I have windowsImagebackup>desktop-name>backup2022-07-28 which folder to put the keyhunter in?) installed pyinstaller with \"pip install pyinstaller\", made keyhunter executable with \"pyinstaller --onefile keyhunter.py\" then run the script with \"python keyhunter.py\" and it says syntax error for missing ()I saw the same issue in the keyhunter github saying you need to use python 2.7.3. I did that but same thing.",

I did the research but 0 wallets or keys were found. Unlucky.In order to put the final nail on the coffin and let this whole reseach go, is there any way for me to see the history of installed software in windows? I would like to have the confirmation this is the computer i remember using. Or if there's any new file that the bitcoin client creates or overwritten file. Some trace left even after the unistall of the client?",

Some trace left even after the unistall of the client?Bitcoin Core's \"data directory\" wont be deleted even if the client was uninstalled, its default location is in %appdata%/bitcoin.%appdata% in Windows is in \"<Drive letter>:/Users/<Your_Username>/AppData/Roaming\"You need to enable 'hidden files' view to find the appdata folder.Before giving-up, you might want to try the other tools.But in my test, pywallet -recover can definitely recover keys from a deleted wallet.That hd has windows xp installed so this is the directory i checked C:\\Documents and Settings\\YourUserName\\Application data\\Bitcoin but there was no bitcoin folder.Isn't another way to check? I read online that I could use the eventlog to check events, but it stores up to a certain numbers of entries so it might be too far back in time. But even that, how should I use the eventlog to check on an external hard drive? Any idea?",

Maybe you can get a deal that they only get paid if the find the private key. If you use the computer and the keys were deleted there is a large risk that the computer overwrites the deleted keys with new data that you produce. Because if you deleted stuff it is simply labeled as \"can be overwritten\" and is not actually deleted. SO if you produce new data it will actually be lost and a professional user can remove the \"can be overwritten\" label.",
