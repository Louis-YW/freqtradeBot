Is there a minimum bet or a fixed amount of bet for us to win the prices you listed? I'm just curious that's all.",

Most likely bettors will fell that the game is rigged or something that's why they are not willing to risk their money on this kind of game.And yeah, that's another thing, gamblers are impatient, if they put a pet, they wanted results immediately and not wait for days.Best of luck though, might be really hard pressed to get someone from this community to take that risk, IHMO.",

Would you care to show us how safe and transparent your gambling site? How do you pick winners, how can we verify if that number were fair and where did you get the $1M prize pool  Not unless you give explanation on how your system works or explain how safe and transparent it is, people wouldn't dare to invest or buy any ticket in your website. Also a typo in your website \"$1000,000\".",

It seems it hasn't been fully developed, I would love to see the developed version.It looks like their website will be completely ready after 2 days, it can be seen from the countdown they made on the homepage. But do you really believe in them? they seem to have recently developed their project, even the members on their telegram are only 4 members. Apart from that there is no other information that we can see from this project. Playing lotto is the same as gambling, instead of having to play on a website that currently doesn't have more information, it's better for you to play at a crypto casino that already has a high reputation on this forum such as Rollbit, Roobet, Duelbits and Stake.",
