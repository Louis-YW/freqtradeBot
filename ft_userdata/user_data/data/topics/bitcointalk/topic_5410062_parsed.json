As far as i know that litecoin was so weak compared with another token that you have mentioned above. litecoin didn't have a lot of utilities and it may surge but actually depend with bitcoin as the thing that can it be pumped so hard. Litecoin price movement was alwaos following bitcoin and i didn't even think if it can surge a lot and i just remind you that if litecoin is half privacy coin for now. You must also know about the risk to invest in the coin that involved the provacy protocol on its blockchain. It's more riskier compared with investing in ordinary altcoins.",

LTC, out of the 3 altcoins you mentioned, I think if the market keeps going up then maybe LTC is the slowest rising altcoin, that's my prediction.Such is the fact that Bitcoin is still a benchmark for altcoins and we can see when Bitcoin goes down then other coins also go up and vice versa,even so not all coins are like that and talking about LTC indeed before Bitcoin went down the coin also developed quite slowly,so it looks like it will come back the same way",

You should have some analysis on why you think that they'll be the highlights of this week. I'm optimistic about BNB and LTC as I hold them and also use them for transactions.Also, I'm bullish for BNB and that's why I am holding it for long term so, I don't mind whether it's on the pick of others for their list of altcoins for this week or not.",

Your thoughts guys?Draw support in your conclusion as technical analysis or any fundamental analysis that can be the reason for the surge in the price. It might BNB have potential among them all, but remember the price of these altcoins will always vary on the price of Bitcoin, and we noticed that it will swing upon the price movement of the Bitcoin.Â  Expected there's a drop in the altcoin price when Bitcoin dumps the price and it will go up, expected altcoin price will surge too in the market. However, you picked good coins which is the potential can make a profit there.",
