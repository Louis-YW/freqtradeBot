As I checked different sources some say September 19th but there is no finalization about it. I am expecting they will keep on moving the date just to be sure it will be perfect. Demand is soaring but I am not riding it anymore. I am glad about what I have. FOMO for new investors.",

Why bad luck, you miss it because you don't trust the market, you fear things will go bad? There is good news concerning ethereum, the cryptocurrency has hit some FOMO levels and I am glad that the price of ETH has risen to $1400 today. But we are not out of bear season yet and things are still uncertain even though all coins are green today. Don't get too excited when you see green, always be suspicious and careful with the market, there are always pitfalls lurking around us.",

You can still grab it right now. Ethereum is still undervalued caused by if you are seeing the history of crypto and then the ATH of ethereum was around almost 5k USD. Anyone is still having the golden chance to accumulate more and more ethereum these days, It will become very expensive coin someday later. Ethereum is having a big gain for weekly movement and bitcoin is also slowly climbing again. Im sure that a small recovery will be coming very soon. You must have prepared yourself for another big event that will come very soon. I have been accumulating more ethereum since it was trading below 1k. The bearish trend will always become the best chance.",

Some investors would not care if there is a bad market now, riding the big boat comes first as it may get them to higher profits once the big day comes. I am optimistic about it as I am one of the supporters of Ethereum but never have I thought it would increase this high when they release the news about the finishing process. Kind of curious what will happen to other currencies that was being supported more during the time Ethereum was hybernating with fees so high and transactions slower. Can they survive once it is back and dominate the altcoin market?",

Ethereum can be surging more than bitcoin now, but let's not forget that all altcoins are dependent on bitcoin price.The launching of Ethereum v2 is long overdue. The promise of launching Ethereum didn't start this year. I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way or the other to prolong it(September 19th). We should remove our focus from that day",

Back in March 2022 no one could have predicted this outcome, but bad tokenomics caused the collapse of this coin. Although, if they hadn't launched their UST algorithmic stablecoin, maybe nothing would have happened.",

Today closed maybe above 15% because currently the price it continues to increase a little more at $1600, whether tomorrow it will continue with a new increase?",

I think the merger hype is what drives the price up. Ethereum will have a better way of consensus which might improved the overall feature of Eth network including speed since it will use sharding method on PoS. This news announced few days ago which can be correlated to the recent price trend. I doubt that this will continue in the long run since global economy is not doing well.",
