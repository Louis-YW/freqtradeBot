  "content": "Do you also think that Crypto and Blockchain made the wrong move?Â  Good uncle Nakamoto did not create Bitcoin to give a few new leverages or a new menu of trading tools: he wanted everyone to have access to the economic benefits of a borderless planet, giving everyone the same opportunities.I think so: today only 0.001% of people can access Projects that can offer the best earning opportunities, because large capital is required to invest. And I don't like this: I want anyone, even with only $ 50 in their pocket, to have the opportunity to have and take advantage of the same financial advantages as someone who has $ 1 million to invest.Are you wondering how?Easy answer: divide the cake, make smaller slices and many, many more people will be able to party with you.This is the Project I ask you to believe in, this is the real opportunity: a Platform created to give everyone the opportunity to participate in important Projects, on the Assets that give more advantages and security, and it is by tokenizing these that we can create thousands of small shares, but capable of giving the same satisfaction as a 1 billion dollar investment.The money that arises from NOTHING (as you recently saw) disappears very quickly in NOTHING: we use Digital Finance to work in the Real World. Leave with us.Leave now.https://www.edrivetoken.io/ Your best opportunity.",
