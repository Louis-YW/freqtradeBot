It doesnt matter since its his money then it would really be just that his full rights on whatever he would really be spending.Its none of our business on how much he would be spending on such team on betting on it.",

That's not true. The reason is that once you do not have this money, you always think that you will take care of that money and be a responsible gambler but things will change when you have that money in real.When you have a million dollars, it means that your lifestyle is changed altogether, you have a business that is making you a million dollars and maybe more and then you think ok i have a lot of money and I can bet one million dollars and have a feeling of a lifetime. Yeah, you and I do not have that one million dollars now, so we can only think that we won't risk that money in betting.",

That's when I realized I was reacting.  Now, imagine if u stake a large amount of money, no matter how hard I try not to lose my cool, I wouldn't be able to hide it, now I wonder how this man has the courage to bet a fortune, this is gambling abuse.  Unless the guy launder money through gambling, I don't think any sensible person will bet $10M on a game, it doesn't make sense. Why has he not been trending like drake because anytime that guy stake 800k to 1M, the internet especially the netizens go high and says a lot of things that he will go broke, this and that's but this guy don't, or maybe because he is na celebrity.I don't know how big money is to some people but to be honest, $10M is too big to be use for gambling, amount that can buy a startup company, I don't want to say how much that amount is in my local currency but if I have such amount and I decide not to work for 40 years, I will live good life.

Yes, you are financially capable but on the time that you would really be engaging with betting then betting up millions could be possible since you are financially capable then you would really be having that kind of behavior but we know that if things turns out to be a loss in consecutive manner then it would really be surely be hurting your bank or pocket.It just really turns out that these known people wont really be showing that they have been affected but deep inside then it is really just that hard to resist that you arent hurt.Somehow since you do have other income source from your investment then that would really be easing out that kind of stress but pretty sure that you would really be having those kind of learning along the way.Some would be able to realize but some would really be continuing just because they are really that confident when it comes to their financial status and on the way that they do spend.",

I've never heard of him, but he's indeed deep into gambling. And coming from a big industry, furniture. He won't suffer for losing at all. Because he'll keep generating enough money to cover for his loss.  Look the huge amounts he stake on a team, that can boost the validity of the team. He's a very rich gambler. His winnings are too enormous for most people, but can be a pea nut to him. A gambler with such an amount may not be able to stake smaller amounts like 2k dollars. They'll be targeting 1m dollars. To generate higher amounts and profits. That'll be able to interest them. A millionaire winning few thousands in gambling won't have a complete happiness, compared to when they win tens of million, from staking huge amounts. With such amount the risk increases. And may be on a brink. Win or lose. At that stage of life, 5m may not be enough to retire you. Because you've been gambling with over 70 million. lol. Would anything lesser change your gambling habit, like stake 10$ or quitting gambling after losing such a huge amount. You'll see that gamblers must have a strong bounce back from a different source to keep rolling higher. A person can't get 75 million without have a sustainable business, that'll still fetch them more funds. What we'll say to do with such an amount will be very different from what we'll actually do with the money. It's like a gamble I can't predict. It's possible I'll play responsibly with the millions or wager it like a millionaire.",

I don't think I'd ever bet millions really since I have a pretty solid understanding of how much money works in the lower class (where I'm at right now) so it's kind of off-putting to suddenly spend so much if I actually ever had one, especially on gambling. I'd maybe spend it on other stuff like buying consoles, furniture, drawing materials, and stuff like that, but gambling? Nah.",

So they have no qualms if they lost these million-dollars today and win the next day.But on this note, regular gambler should not imitate their lifestyle because you can go broke in one bet ruining your life as well as your family.",
