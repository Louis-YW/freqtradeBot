Simply because the request is coming from the real Elon or Vitalik account? People need to wake the hell up, Vitalik created Ethereum, and because of this he won't dare ask me to provide my seed phrase, hell NO,  what the hell is wrong with people? Apart from the fact that it's hackers at play here, even if the real people ask for your private key you will give them? It seems many people don't even understand crypto. Satoshi can not wake up today on the forum and send me message to provide my bitcoin wallet key, I will tell him to fu*k off, because this is the right way to protect my fund.I am really sorry that many people lost their funds to hackers who hacked vitalik account on Twitter but we need to discuss this, it's for your own good when people on here tell to stop seeking for free stuffs, because if it's free you are the product. The best ways to stay safe in crypto space now is to just DCA, stake if you want and enjoy your life, nothing comes easily anymore, there is no free stuffs in the world, those who want to give up free stuffs want something else too.1. Avoid clicking links and claiming freebies online, most especially giveaways on social media.2. Do not hook up your wallet to websites you don't know. 3. Air drops are not even safe too, most from social media are scam, if you are a Airdrop fan, please dedicated a separate wallet for Airdrops only. I as a person stay the hell away from every freebies and that includes airdrops too, because even if they are legit the amount isn't going to be much anyway, why waste your time? Hackers are increasing their standards every day, make sure you are increasing yours as well, even Vitalik Buterin and Satoshi himself is not safe, if you get messages from them, even if it's the real them, and they ask for your key, my brother and sisters RUN.",

Any such request should raise immediate red flags, as they're typically scams or phishing attempts. Alot of people falls for such petty tricks and forget the fact that just because they were blinded by greed. These days, social media has turned into a market where scammers fish for possible targets. They use all kinds of means and more ideas pops out daily. They won't stop there. The only possible thing we can do is to be vigilant and stay away from any thing that looks too good to be true, because it isn't.",

If you joined Arbitrum speculation airdrop than many users Recieved 2k$ airdrop just by doing some transaction in their mainnet while 10k$ was high reward claimed by users and that's was totally free. similarly Aptos 1k$ and sui sale profit 2000$. you cannot say low to these amounts but we should research what project is worth to join.",
