  "content": "I am listening to People - LibiancaThe reason why I listen to this song on a loop while I work is the lyrics that clams me down as there is too much pressure to perform in my work area and this line impacts me every time this line comes up \"Cause you see people...... they do not really know you\". This song always makes me realize that it is me who has to take care of myself and no one will check on me.   Tell me which song you can listen to on a loop and why?",
