      "body": "It is important to understand what Bitcoin is and what is the point of Bitcoin. At this point in time, El Salvador is treating Bitcoin as nothing more than a quick get-rich scheme by publicizing what they're doing with it at every single opportunity that they get. Obviously, most people aren't buying it and rightfully so. Bitcoin shouldn't be treated as a precious asset for hodling and not for spending.I think the whole point of mass adoption is obviously not just about the government recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender and for their own reserves. It is important to encourage businesses to adopt it as an alternative payment and adopt sustainable practices over the long term. It cannot be a distraction from the issues that the country is facing. Adopting Bitcoin while fulfilling an alternative agenda is just a farce in general.",

One thing is clear that they need to educate people calmly over it since it's not a very easy thing to understand for people who are old and quite young. The bitcoin atms should charge adequately which means they shouldn't overcharge as compared to the wallets that we use and at the same time they don't have to be distributed just around the center, it would be wise if they were around the whole country and easily accessible.",

It will cause a problem especially for old people or retirements, but AFAIK El Salvador doesn't force anyone to receive their paycheck with Bitcoin, they're free to choose to receive fiat or Bitcoin. I feel the protesters have such personal hate against Bitcoin itself.Reducing Bitcoin Transactions in El Salvador based on this thread, Bitcoin usage in El Salvador are around 20% which is quite high IMO.If my country will accept Bitcoin as legal tender, I wouldn't use Bitcoin as daily payment since it has better purpose for store of value, so there's not much change for me.",

El Salvador is a developing country, rampant with poverty (coincidentally as high as that of the adoption rates as you've mentioned). What Bukele has done is essentially gambled with the country's money, which for a country that is so reliant on development aid, is quite a poorly calculated choice to say the least. The country's reserve is especially important because they are essentially the country's worth.There is nothing wrong with accepting Bitcoin, and there are bound to be people unhappy with this. However, if you see large-scaled protests for something as insignificant as this, something is wrong. Purchasing Bitcoin while doing nothing to address the country's pertinent issues and just tweets about Bitcoin seems quite counter-productive, don't you think?",

      "body": "IMO, the approach might be failed but the adoption was been helped by Bitcoin that have given awareness to the people. It might be expected that there's always a regulation in every country under each jurisdiction, though they have their own wallet called \"Chivo\" but due to awareness and being knowledgeable, people can still use non-custodial wallets for storing their Bitcoin. Maybe our government still studying Bitcoin adoption but fortunately, they recognized it as an alternative way of payment or alternative to our local currency.  If one day it will happen that they will announce Bitcoin legal tender, IMO, I'm expecting that they will also create their own wallet the same as El Salvador did.",

I'm fine by my real life transactions. What I want is to be able to pay with bitcoin online, in more stores. If that's going to happen with a legal tender law, then so be it.

My point here is not about Bitcoin as a bad investment, it can be a good investment. However, if you notice for any funds that the government holds, they are accountable for it and generally they do have a certain risk allocation to the percentage of funds that they're willing to risk. I don't think that any governments should be refraining from Bitcoin as an investment but having such a high asset allocation into a risky investment vehicle (such as that of crypto) is not indicative of good governance.",

      "body": "Perhaps it is not surprising why in the end El Salvador was judged to have failed with bitcoin adoption so far because in my opinion they are not completely focused on adoption but may be divided on private and group interests in government. From the very beginning the pros and cons about adoption are the reason why we can think that there is a problem they have to solve regarding adoption and maybe now it is starting to come to the surface after there is research on their adoption success.If my country adopts bitcoin, I'm grateful because it's a great start to something different about the financial system. I don't want my country on behalf of anyone to invest heavily in bitcoin if at the same time they neglect other things like infrastructure development, job creation and economic improvement of the country in various sectors. They have to do something different from El Salvador although I hope in the future there will be special wallets promoted by countries like Chivo in El Salvador if adoption does happen.",

What I am going at is that if a country has a lot of economic distress, social priblems and huge wealth gaps (poor countrys in general / developing countrys) will likely fail with the adoption because it will not cure the underlying issues. The better the economy of a country, themore chance it has of making it happen.",
