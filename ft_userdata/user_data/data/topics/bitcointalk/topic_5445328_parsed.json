Quote from: Black susano on March 17, 2023, 09:39:14 PM7- Don't follow the crowd Sometimes this is a good option but at most times, this isn't really going well. I guess there's a better thing for following the crowd so, don't follow crowds blindly. Because if you do, you're bound to losses just as what the others have been doing as they invest blindly. The thing about going with the crowd, you get as much information as you get but the downside of it, you're prone in shilling and greedy by how they encourage everyone to hold this and buy this and that.",

This is trading, not concerning anything harmful or illegal.Quote from: blockman on March 17, 2023, 10:56:00 PMSometimes this is a good option but at most times, this isn't really going well. I guess there's a better thing for following the crowd so, don't follow crowds blindly. If you make analysis and if that is the direction the crowd are going, that does not mean you are following the crowd, it means you still follow your analysis.",

      "body": "I would say I agree with almost everything of you’re advice, most especially number 9. One has to separate his emotions of always earning profit from trading. Every traders aim is to make profit but once you highlight it out that every day isn’t for earning it you tend to be comfortable trading rather than jumping from coins in search of profit. It is also important to sometimes follow the crowd because part of the research technique for cryptocurrency is to check the community strength but blind following the crowd mostly social media hypes is risky",

If the trend is going up then you go with the trade. If the trend is going down and you don't go with the trend you will always lose.because trend is your friend.Quote5- Block out other announcements Sometimes you have to keep yourself aware of the surrounding situation as there is a lot of news coming in the market which affects your trading a lot.In trading, should always keep an eye on what is happening in the news, national and global level, a single tweet or a single piece of news from somewhere can shake up the market.",
