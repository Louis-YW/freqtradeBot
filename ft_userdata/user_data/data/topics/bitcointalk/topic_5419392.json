Also there are few who oppose the matter, that Satoshi Nakamoto must not reveal his identity. I am so much confused regarding matter. So I think, it would be better to arrange a concensus about the identity of the Bitcoin and Blockchain inventor. The members of this forum can vote for themselves and it will be helpful for Satoshi Nakamoto to make a correct discussion. What is your opinion ?",

So I think, it would be better to arrange a concensus about the identity of the Bitcoin and Blockchain inventor.What would a consensus do here? Satoshi is not a programme who will reveal his identity after the consensus! Everyone wants to know the real identity of Satoshi because that's it's mysterious. But honestly I think it won't be good for Satoshi himself it he reveals his identity. I strongly believe that Craig Wright is a setup by FBI to lure Satoshi out of his excile which failed miserably! There's no need for consensus. If bitcoin has done even a little good to your life, respect the decision of its creator.",

It's an attack vector in a sense that whatever information is known/revealed about Satoshi can be used to socially attack Bitcoin.
