It's better if you are avoid to deal with this kind of token rather than become a new victim from the scammers. Tesl token was unpopular token and it's not even listed on CMC and CG. This garbage token is not even worth to buy. You must be careful. It can be seen from its name.",

So, the money I invested - gone?Yes, it is. Gone.That is a classic scam technique, to ask for more funds in an attempt of withdrawal, and I'm sure they will keep doing that if you somehow obey what they tell to you to do.I've tried to open the site, and all the look is pretty freaking fubar. How could you believe those things?Other than asking for more funds, you stated in OP, that you are being pushed. That in a sense is an urgency, which is another thing of a classic scam.As of now, there is nothing you can do but learn from it. And try to comprehend some of the threads that gives you some advice about how to protect yourself from being scammed here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364418.msg58120908#post_point151",

Always remember one thing in the crypto space, \"if that sounds very profitable, then it's likely a scam\".This forum is a place full of good people to teach you a lot about crypto, I hope you can use it to avoid similar losses in the future.",

Thank you all for your opinions! If anyone else has anything additional to say - please, do. Sorry bro, about that. That's good positive thinking though, you learn from experience. Keep that up. Don't give up. That is the risk of buying new cryptocurrencies especially when you are looking for a gem in the broad number of altcoins. I suggest not putting too much effort into these new coins, buy what you can afford to lose but put a higher percentage of your capital into the known and trusted cryptocurrencies particularly if you are a long-term investor. That way, you save time and you save yourself a load of money in the long run.",

If Tesla decided to go crypto and issue their own token, world news would be buzzing like a huge bee hive about it. When you have opened their webpage, did it look suspicious and cheap to you? Didnt the page cause you doubts, that a company with billions of turnover could make such a poor looking page? This is an obvious scam.",
