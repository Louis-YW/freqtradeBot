      "body": "Simply because the 'centralisation' some are spreading as FUD isn't an issue for bitcoin.As I already said in a thread on that topicQuote from: kano on August 11, 2023, 09:53:11 PMTo put it simply, either they follow the rules or they fork to a new coin.If they fork to a new coin, then that wont be Bitcoin and the miners will leave.As for transaction bias, well as long as you stay away from braiins pool who is actively promoting transaction bias,for other pools, if the pool itself stops allowing all transactions, then yeah, people will just go to another pool that will give a better return.Complete lack of transaction bias ensures a maximum return on mining, which is bitcoin by design = allow all transactions, highest fees get confirmed fastest.The main option available (ckpool) also has a few rather egregious issues with the public version.Rather amusing that someone is about to release a miner that will use it.e.g.It doesn't do block identification directly, just a floating point approximationIt reports 'luck' incorrectly as Diff/NetDiffIt's reported hash rates are quite off under certain circumstances.It doesn't follow the bitcoin rules for block timestamps and thus can allow a miner to produce invalid blocks.It allows mining when bitcoin isn't in sync with the network = guaranteed rejected block.Then there's the issue of running your own pool at home, without a high speed worldwide network block distribution, that means a higher risk of losing that 'one' block you might find.",
