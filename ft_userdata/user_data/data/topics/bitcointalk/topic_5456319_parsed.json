I've also tried adding my XPUB to another wallet where you can add fees, but that doesn't work either, XPUB from Blockchain unfortunately doesn't work with most wallet programs, who can help me. I'm willing to pay for that too.",

My Suggestion is please wait for the lowering of mempool it is the easy way for you. If you want to go for the Acceleration of the transaction you understand the possible risks as no one can guarantee the transaction confirmation in the next block.For the rest of the problem as you cant see in the transaction details on other Blockchains I think it has something to do with the Synchronization and indexing in this case as well you can possibly wait only. I am wondering how you got stuff but it's not a rare thing as well sometimes it happens, Did you try custom fees ?Sorry I haven't experienced it as much so I can say you should wait, otherwise my Senior Fellows can guide you on it.",

Problems with your transactions.How your wallet worksQuoteYour Backup Phrase is made up of 12 random words, and is an encoded version of your master seed (and an industry standard). It acts as a backup and allows you to access your bitcoins and ether regardless of the wallet software you’re using. In the event that you lose your password, or choose to use another wallet provider, your Backup Phrase is all you need to regain access to your funds.Quick tip: You can find your 12 word Backup Phrase in your Security Center after creating your wallet.

No need to wait for days, hours or few minutes to sync your wallet like Bitcoin Core.Electrum uses Simple Payment Verification technique.QuoteSimple Payment Verification (SPV) is a technique described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper. SPV allows a lightweight client to verify that a transaction is included in the Bitcoin blockchain, without downloading the entire blockchain. The SPV client only needs download the block headers, which are much smaller than the full blocks. To verify that a transaction is in a block, a SPV client requests a proof of inclusion, in the form of a Merkle branch.SPV clients offer more security than web wallets, because they do not need to trust the servers with the information they send.Reference: Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System",

But wondering how it is valid on blockchain.com explorer while not valid on other blockchain explorers.The fee rates used are high, over 30 sat/vbyte. The last transaction was on 13th which was just yesterday, while the first transaction was 10th of this month, four days ago. The mempool has not been that congested some weeks ago. I do not think the transactions dropped, but OP is trying to do something not possible, or maybe the fault is from the wallet he is using. He should import the seed phrase into Electrum wallet instead, spend the coins. He should generate new seed phrase on Electrum and abandon Blockchain.com seed phrase.",
