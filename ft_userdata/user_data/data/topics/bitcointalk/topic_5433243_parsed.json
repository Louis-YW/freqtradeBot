      "body": "The Federal Reserve is now watching the markets closely, and the continuity of withdrawing liquidity for a long period will accelerate avoiding deflation. It is easy to pump liquidity, but it will make it difficult to reach “healthy” inflation during the current fiscal year.I am afraid of what is happening in China. The last thing we are waiting to see now is the return of  COVID19 with a good mutation, which means more health restrictions.And the war that is taking place in Ukraine and the lack of control over it.The energy crisis and its problems, especially with the European economy.So we have enough problems to fear deflation",

MAXIMUM ORDERS OF BRRR-MONEY PRINTING. Prepare to experience a big surge for Bitcoin like it was 2015 - 2017 I think for most people deflation would be a very welcome and pleasant reversal of the recent inflation over the last couple years. Inflation was getting carried away so a couple years of similar deflation would actually just return some level of stability and hopefully more competition between different companies that will ultimately bring the price down for end buyers. As long as it doesn't turn into stagflation which Japan suffered from for a long time, which is probably unrealistic because they had a lot of economic factors conspiring against them to create that unique situation. In the ideal world the war in Ukraine would stop and allow food supplies to slowly improve, along with Russia being able to sell energy again to Europe and improving all sorts of logistic chain pricing.",

MAXIMUM ORDERS OF BRRR-MONEY PRINTING. If US inflation is 7% annually.What effect will it have on 30 year mortgage loans?I think the fed will be forced to raise interest rates on loans. Which could incentivize markets to seek alternative sources of credit and liquidity. In a best and worse case scenario, crypto based sources of credit and liquidity could gain higher demand due to them supplying credit and liquidity without the rising interest rates.Raising rates could reduce competitive advantages of conventional bank loan markets. Opening the door for crypto to take prominence. Although recent history has shown markets and regulation trends have swung in directions which are far from linear. The feds alleged brrr money printing is something I remember complaining about back in 2012. I've waited so many years for the fed money printer to go brrr. That I've reached a point where even I have a hard time believing the feds money printing might actually have an effect. Another thing to consider is the feds money printer might go the opposite of brrr. Which could lead to credit and liquidity shortages. Those conditions might actually be worse than most of what we have seen so far.",

So I checked  them out on various rating companies.I did this last Dec 2021. and they were rated 45% chance to go bust in 2022I did further research and found all the companies 14 of them with 3 trillion in assets had bad ratings.Why? they make bank in the bond market and the bond market sucked in dec 2021well guess what. these companies rated 40 to 50 % shot to go broke in 2022 gained 500 billion due to bond rates rising.they are now rated 30 to 40% to go broke in 2023....My guess is at least 2023 with rates going up then flat. will add 250 to 300 million to these companies. and maybe we see a slump in 2024.2023 interest up inflation persists.maybe light at tunnels end in 2024.be like JJG just DCA!@ franky1 you must have laughed out loud at this op title. \"deflation in 2023 !\"",

Although that is mostly just a guess. If accurate statistics were always available then all those involved with Bitcoin over the years would never have experienced losses, I mean for trading and holding. If we think in general then it can be seen that when the price of Bitcoin skyrockets, the common holder or people don't have that much Bitcoin. and it's not just you, there are many others who wish they could hoard some bitcoins for a chance like in 2015.
