Are you making your miners mine BCH or other sha256 low difficulty coins and pay them in BTC ?I had a look at your site and Telegram yesterday, but it didn't give me much more information.I'm not casting stones, I'm simply pointing out that risking a one-chance-in-life reward with an unknown pool is not the best thing to do when you have pools that have been proving their worth for years. Ckpool doesn't put anyone at a disadvantage, everyone has an equal chance of finding a block in proportion to their hashrate, just like with any well-configured solo pool.",

I have been working with Open Source Miners United on the Bitaxe project as well as Bitmaker and Nerdminers. I had determined that a new solo pool that is super easy to setup and run for yourself would be a great contribution to the community. I am currently hosting a small competition for nerdminers and so far we have over 2000 participating. The project is very young and nobody has mined any mainnet blocks but I have successfully mined testnet blocks.While you can't verify vkbit is running the published source code you can verify the Coinbase transaction being sent to your miners and I have helped them get it deployed.Don't trust, verify.",

I won't lie, I like how you present yourself, and if it was you vs another forum newbie who posted some shit using Chatgpt and stopped responding, I would choose your pool over his, but you are up against CK, Kano, and Viabtc (probably a few more well known and established pools that offer solo mining) so give me one fucking good reason why would I use your pool over the three I mentioned above?heck, I can't even justify 1 day's worth of reward mining to a PPS pool I don't know, let alone risking a whole block.",

So 6.25 btc is not enough coin for me to leave my wife and my home of 30+ years. To escape to an anonymous location.  I can recall mmpool.org leaving this site after dishing out 20 + blocks yet they claimed they were hacked. They left after last block and did not pay close to 200kI can recall at least 1 solo pool hit just 1 block and by by so long farewell.So 6.25 btc = 150k plus.It is too much for any of us to risk when  there are at least 3 good solo pools to play.Cksolo pool is a known payer.kano pays his blocksand viabtc pays their blocks.The op is an unknown with zero KYC and no history of handling funds. It is a killer for most of us that have seen a lot of funds vanish.BTW while I have trusted mikeywith with 3 and 4 k in coins and gear purchases I do not know whim well enough to risk 6.25 btc when I can do it with ckpool whom has paid me 3 solo blocks",

I personally wouldn't do that, let alone trust them with a whole block.Also, if you could buy the same gears from the guy next door, pay in cash, and pick them up, it would make no sense to trust me even with $100, unless the price difference was really justifiable, this solo pool case is NOT justifiable, I see no benefits in ditching those pools and using this one.",
