They said why im create a lot of account? I really confused with that. I am always claim and make statement, please check your system might something went wrong, I never create account rather this one.

      "body": "Hi, OP maybe you are ovum in blackjack.fun, right? If so then I am aware of it from the blackjack.fun team. They showed me some info like how many accounts are connected with this user. Yes as I have seen the system detected several accounts are connected with this user. Not actually several, maybe it was more than 10 accounts. Now you guys can tell me that their system could be wrong, Then I have to share some more info that they showed me a few months ago. One of the users has also the issue of multiple accounts. The user asked to close all the alt accounts and keep the one that he was talking with. Then the team asks for all the emails/usernames of his alts. The user shared all the account information he created, and all of them were detected as multiple accounts on their system. So If you say straight about the system doing wrong then it would not be perfect I assume. Maybe the user used a VPN or public wifi at some point then the IP could be matched. But who knows!In this modern world by using only VPN if someone feels no one can catch the connections, it's really funny.Btw OP you are saying that they are a scam, But they shared with me that you never make any deposit with USDT, But you already withdrew more than 250 USDT (without USDT deposit), Right? Where did this come from? Of course from their giveaways and some other free money campaigns, right?Recently we have seen there are lot of scam accusations against popular casinos with brand new/ newbie accounts. They are using Bitcointalk as weapons. and some guys always think The project is guilty most of the time and support the scam accusation creator. But as I can say from my experience basically the popular platform does not go against their user if there is no guilt from the user end. If we continuously support the guys (who are using bitcointalk as weapons despite their own guilt), the New projects will not come to promote them here in this forum. Already I heard due to spam scam accusations some projects stopped their journey here. We should always give fair justice. Note: Someone could have a question why blackjack.fun shared the info with me, I was their signature campaign manager from the beginning and still run some campaigns in games and rounds. So they always try to notify me if there are some cases like this. btw I will ask the blackjack.fun team to check this issue again and solve this issue ASAP. Thank you.",

I think he refers to some tipping, and the likes?Quote from: JackpotRacer on November 18, 2023, 05:23:06 PMin short you are totally wrong with this statement. you should start to take some fair glasses and try to walk in the scammed user shoesWhich part of my statement is wrong, if I may ask for clarification before I said anything further?Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 05:26:33 PMQuote from: holydarkness on November 18, 2023, 05:07:39 PM[...]Bro... Nothing serious. Information = I meant a story. Like how some guys are abusing bonuses with alts. So The representative also shared this story a day ago. As a third party, I don't have any right to see any sensitive information. And I believe no team will share any sensitive issue with a third party. Ahh... ok.Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 05:26:33 PMBtw I will not make any other comment here. It looks like the thread is being hijacked . This is not good. Better to ignore. Before you leave, I've reached to Blackjack.fun's represenative through PM and inform them about this issue, but suppose they're not answering, do you mind if I reach you to be a Hedwig, relay some messages and urge them to come?",

Already I heard due to spam scam accusations some projects stopped their journey here. We should always give fair justice.Some casinos have created a negative impression on the forum by not replying to the accusations in a timely manner. The forum member doesn't go against the casinos usually. Most of us want to get an explanation from the casino side when someone creates an accusation with enough evidences. The OP hasn't provided enough evidences here, except the email logs. And I'm wondering why he is unable to post the deposit tx id. The tx id can be easily found in the wallet or any other service from where the deposit was made.[/quote]Finally a fair and square posting! and exactly this what is missing here as any casino owner if he has nothing to hide would show all proof and has a clean shirt and everyone would applaud him and go there to play and have fun even if he loses some",

Doesn't mean winner of bonuses have no right to withdrawal. I am banned as farming account, which name? which date? how? And you still have no proof for public, cause Im not do that, you're totally big of liar. I'm still stand with my statement, I never create multiples account. you system poor and that is fall. it is 2023.I never trying changing or IP but, at my country that is called as IP Public Dynamic, can someone share about this things? I am explain how that IP works at my ecosystem here.I believe got bonuses 250-500-1000-4000 usd at contest,quiz,rain,giveaway doesn't mean that is wrong, You campaign for public also with your wagered or not is your terms and withdrawal able.You good in farming of lies, you said I never deposit. I am few times did deposit why you posted only in usdt? your bonuses is usdt doesn't mean I never deposit crypto. Example : Jhon deposit BTC and with some bonuses USDT at quiz,tournament,bonuses,rain, tip, other.Doesn't mean Jhon are bonushunters.Since you has choose to not disscusion, you choose your company is fall with 117 unpaid/notpaid/notable.I am open here as public, might this could be your consider. I am not taking votes who is on my side, I know you are paid as manager, signature campaign or has paid by that company, please do some empaty.I am not committed to hate or blackmail. They are not able paid my withdrawal(deposit and winning) then slander as farming account. Here is my care for community, I hope you are not next one.Quote from: electronicash on November 18, 2023, 03:45:00 PMnot to discredit your claim but for 117USD balckjack will do that?  its embarrassing for them. unfortunately we have no means to really see what blackjack is seeing under your account but we have seen enough accounts claiming they did nothing that violates the casino's term and then still get the same treatment from a casino. scam or not, its just between you and them whos telling the truth. about your discredit, I am trying for take solutions with team, please double re-check. There should be something went wrong.I did KYC means, I do not wrong things. If I did violates why I send them my data ID? is suciede.as conclusion on my mind is, they campaign taking about loses.for my side, they scamming me and his mind know the truth.Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 04:15:57 PMHi, OP maybe you are ovum in blackjack.fun, right? If so then I am aware of it from the blackjack.fun team. They showed me some info like how many accounts are connected with this user. Yes as I have seen the system detected several accounts are connected with this user. Not actually several, maybe it was more than 10 accounts. Hello, sujo..Yes Im Ovum over belong of blackjack.fun If you are claim more than 10, it's your time to make them as public how your system is works. Open your claim as transparency more than 10 account.Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 04:15:57 PMBtw OP you are saying that they are a scam, But they shared with me that you never make any deposit with USDT, But you already withdrew more than 250 USDT (without USDT deposit), Right? Where did this come from? Of course from their giveaways and some other free money campaigns, right?Your logic is flawed. I am deposit with other crypto you given bonuses as USDT. Why we should deposit in USDT?So for those winner should deposit of USDT?Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 04:15:57 PMRecently we have seen there are lot of scam accusations against popular casinos with brand new/ newbie accounts. They are using Bitcointalk as weapons. and some guys always think The project is guilty most of the time and support the scam accusation creator. But as I can say from my experience basically the popular platform does not go against their user if there is no guilt from the user end.  Belittling others based on rank is a crime.Quote from: sujonali1819 on November 18, 2023, 04:15:57 PMNote: Someone could have a question why blackjack.fun shared the info with me, I was their signature campaign manager from the beginning and still run some campaigns in games and rounds. So they always try to notify me if there are some cases like this. I'm not talking about your farming good words here. It's out of topic for scam accusations.Given donation doesn't mean they are good.Quote from: holydarkness on November 18, 2023, 05:07:39 PMRest assured that we always tried to give it here, like repetitively mentioned by members who frequently overseeing cases on this section, \"this board runs on evidence\", so as long as every side give their piece and backed with a fact, we don't judge with prejudice [well... most of the times, LOL].This is also why I invited Blackjack.fun's representative here, I'd like to know how sure they are with the accusation. When they come here, I am intending to inquire if they're sure with their data. As OP already submitted his KYC, it'll be easy to be sure if he's indeed multiacc-ing by matching his documents with the database.Now, a separate issue, the fact that they... share some information with you, it's not clear whether the data they share are \"merely\" IP address, emails, and the likes, or something more serious like the KYC documents, I hope it's nothing sensitive, although even so, I am not sure if it's a good idea, for a company to share such a private matter with a third party.Thanks holydarkness, that's perfect judge here.My case is my case. Let me know how they are represent based their side. Stop to do some farming or politic or how kindness you are.Quote from: Mahdirakib on November 18, 2023, 05:15:21 PMSome casinos have created a negative impression on the forum by not replying to the accusations in a timely manner.

The tx id can be easily found in the wallet or any other service from where the deposit was made.You should being my side to understand this. not able access the account now, even if im able their system is not able to show history in tx id. you can try deposit then find out where is tx id.Im never deposit in USDT dont mean I didn't deposit cryptos, you are just eat bait from farming never deposit to judge me.",
