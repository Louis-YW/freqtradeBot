It has marketcap of $227 million and up 3,700% in the last 7 days. This can not last a lot of people will regret going into this 'get rich quick' memecoin. It is called 'The first Solana Dog Coin for the people and by the people' but we have seen this before with memecoins that go on to lose value and fast.",

Yes they release an airdrop and we all knew how it will excite the community and solana could gain some positive on that thinking that there will be more free money on that side. Yes bonk gauranteed profit for airdroppers and some are gonna get rekt with the hype. They are still holding on in the midst of a bear market situation.",

At least more people will be interested and know about Solana because of the hype of the meme coin. But it is not always good. People will invest in Solana, the hype of the meme coin dies, the price of Solana starts to drop, newbies make huge loss and they will end up calling the whole crypto market a scam. Same goes for investing in that meme coin. And it's more weird that a meme coin is causing the price of Solana to go up. Wouldn't that affect the reputation of Solana negatively?",

If you get in with this game, make sure you are ready to sell even if it doesn't hit yet the ATH base on RSI because it will take a nose dive.Memecoins are in every platform but there are memecoins that didn't really make noise despite their huge leap.

Just a meme coin causing this boost instead of some solid news like good partnerships or adoption in some company. We just need to take a chance at the beginning and not fall for it when the hype has peaked. the benefits of buying meme coins are indeed quite tempting with fantastic increases. Some of my relatives bought them and indeed at this point, they have taken advantage of them early before disposal occurs. The meme coin itself is identical to the hype which is futures so it won't be profitable forever even if it can be thrown away at any time so it has no value in the market. It's a double-edged sword, as it's advantageous for early buyers and those exposed to the hype should be wary of disposal at short notice. Hype is still hype or indeed this is more of a coin meme gambling that has happened a lot everywhere. In the end, nothing lasts.",

At some points, Solana blockchain even stopped working that is not a good history.The hype of meme tokens on Solana blockchain caused $SOL price to rise a lot.

Not gonna say anything about solana but those that are investing in Bonk and think that it's not going to fall anytime. Well, honestly this is the time that you should be worried if this is the time you want to get in.It's likely that the peak has been reached and the fall will start to happen anytime soon. We're done with meme coins or should I say not yet and they're building it up on the different networks so that it's going to be sort of something new for most investors.But this isn't the way for me to invest, I'm avoiding most of these meme coins and the hype that it creates.",

And how do you know if this is just a short or long term hype? There has been many cases when some altcoins have rised during the overall bear market. And BONK is just few days old. It's given free to active solana NFT projects, which i love as fair distribution.Sure, rising 4000% in one week raises eyebrows but there can be many things that justify it.Only thing i hate about this is their logo forced to look like generic 3d plastic blob made by cheapest artist ever.",

We have gone through many meme coins even on the Solana network also many meme coins have been launched. Hype is definitely not the ideal sector for investors to play with big money unless they don't understand how long term investing works.1 coin hype meme if I'm not mistaken $BONK, has attracted many fraudsters to launch the same coin and that's where Solana will become a hotbed of destruction. I mean just in a week or maybe 1 month it can last but in the end the Solana network can't fix its mistake in one night.",

Not a surprise as meme coins are just hype and can't be trusted when it comes to long-term investment. But, I don't say it was a mistake investing in Solana but be sure to sell them when it peaks otherwise, regrets are really gonna happen in the end. But if we are looking into something that we can assure the safety of our investment, better to avoid meme coins like Solana. The hype will never stay long and many investors had failed to make a profit because of thinking more (greed), and I don't want you to suffer like that.",
