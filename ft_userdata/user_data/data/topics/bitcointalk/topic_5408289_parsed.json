  "content": "Have a nano ledger s and i know i can install litecoin app into it to send/receive.  Reason why i don't want to do this is because i stored several apps already on my nano ledger s already so i don't want to use any more space on it even though i still have space left for litecoin. But the important thing is, i will only have a small amount of litecoin stored in the wallet... think like to 20-50 dollars worth only.  Will request somewhere between 20-50 dollars worth of LTC only from a site.  Then i would make a small LTC transfer to someone.So because of that, what litecoin wallet would you recommend?  A while back, i had stored litecoin in Electrum LTC but that program isn't on my windows pc anymore so i need to reinstall it.  This would also mean needing to verify the software which i do not want to do.  Also considered using my waves exchange wallet since you could store litecoin there but then i see the fee to send LTC is 0.01 LTC as the fee and that can't be changed?  Remember the fees were much less on Electrum LTC.  Does anyone know what are the current fees to send LTC with nano ledger s or Electrum LTC now? Any litecoin wallet you can recommend for this?  Have windows pc and an iphone.  Also i want to be able to control the sending fees because i heard litecoin fees are very cheap and fast and believe fees are only around3 cents a transfer?  But using waves exchange wallet to send would cost a dollar?  is this accurate? But i could just use nano ledger s with ledger live and coin control and that would work?So you can use coin control on ledger live with litecoin?  So say i receive 50 dollars worth of ltc to nano ledger.  Make few 5 dollar payments and my ltc balance is now around 25 dollars.  The person who i been sending 5 dollars multiple times can always see that balance right since they see i use the same sending address?  Now when request ltc from another site but want 5000 dollars worth of it to store and hold, does ledger live generate me a new ltc receiving address similar to how it does with btc?  So then whenever i send that person 5 dollar ltc, always coin control from that same address?  But what if say later need to combine some ltcbecause the original 50 dollar ltc balance is low and only have say 3 dollars on it... how i send the other 2 dollars without exposing the 5000 dollars worth of ltc address?The other thing is this.  Let say i only make one payment to that person and thats all.  Then i get 5000 dollars worth of ltc to a different ltc address.  So have around 5 dollars worth of ltc on that payment address and 5000 on the other address.  How do i make payment in future to prevent my address from privacy issues?  Generate a new ltc address and send say 50 dollars there?  But they see that it came from a 5000 dollar ltc balance.  But would they know that is your ltc balance or if its an exchange unrelated to you?",

      "body": "Just use electrum ltc or an exchange to do it - or any multicoin app.I think you're overthinking what you're doing here anyway. If you have so many apps on your ledger already, surely you've got one with a low fee crypto you could also use? Bitcoin and eth were expensive, I don't think anything else is and I've not checked bitcoin fees recently (it might be cheaper now).",

Then click Continue.         Enter the Amount you want to send.        Select Fees > Advanced and type in your desired Fee amount.        This website can help you choose the most optimal fee for your transaction.Quote from: jerry0 on August 01, 2022, 05:56:58 AMHave a nano ledger s and i know i can install litecoin app into it to send/receive.  Reason why i don't want to do this is because i stored several apps already on my nano ledger s already so i don't want to use any more space on it even though i still have space left for litecoin. You can unnistall an app and install ltc app in literally 30 seconds.This won't break anything, and your device was made to support such add/remove apps.Those apps have about 30kb size.It is safer to do that than to install another wallet.",
