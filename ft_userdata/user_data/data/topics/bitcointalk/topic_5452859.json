You can't be sure of things unless you start to see changes or something unusual with your device. Sometimes you can't notice them at all. Maybe its a scam where you have to call the number but what if they take it up a notch and make the pdf contain a malware also, in case if the phone call attempt fails. Maybe running an antimalware is a measure but I don't think its gonna fully work. Best thing is to reset the device where you have run it after making a backup. Another thing, turn off the remote desktop on your device.",

No matter how tempting or intriguing that attachment may seem, it's better to play it safe and avoid clicking on it. You never know what they might be hiding in those files and cybercriminals are known to use email attachments as a sneaky way to distribute malware or launch phishing attacks.

You are very correct mate, if we were still in the days when airdrops thrived, like in 2016/2017/2018, this strategy would have been an easy way to get airdrop participants and some would eventually fall for the trick..We are indeed no longer in the days when miracle money was believed in(as you put it), at least, back in 2017, I had an experience of what miracle money really is and feels like when I received storm tokens worth over $800 into my wallet, I remember they did an airdrop back those days but I didn't remember applying for the airdrop, how it happened I benefits from the airdrop, I don't know, but I jejely sold it and put the money in bitcoin, and I made a lot of profit from it that same year during bull run.",

He said he can send an attack via email, text message, and various other means; the attack could be a picture, a link, or just a PDF, and if the person that is being attacked clicks on the link, he will gain access to some information on his device. So what I am thinking now is that, as you never can tell, that PDF may have been an attack from some scammers; the email might look stupid, but the mistake people make often is clicking on any link, image, PDF, or other external file that is attached to the spam email.To be safe, never even respond to any email you are not expecting to receive. Just my advice, though.",

And also tell us if also received such a mail before, what action did you take?. Yes, this is a classic scam being perpetuated in the other parts of the globe.a. the email will have the phone numbers that you have to contactb. if you call them and you said that they you didn't initiate the transaction and they will said that they will refund you the money.c. and then the next step is that they will ask you to download a software than can access your PCd. then obviously they can take over your system, if let's say they want you to login to your coinbase account because that's where they are Â going to refund you, thru bitcoin.Other methods, saying that your Paypal has been limited so you will have to follow the instructions on the email.a. the email that you will received with Paypal has a link, so if you click on it and you are not careful you will be redirected to a fake Paypal websiteb. once you enter your login details, including your password then your account is compromise already.Next one, same as the steps above, the only difference is:a. let's say you wanted to refund $100.00 only, and after giving them access, they will edit something using Developers tools to looks like they have made a mistake of refunding you, and they made a supposedly deposit $1000.00b. So they will ask you to give them back the $900.00.c. Ask you to go to a store and buy Amazon Gift cards, it could be in bunch of $100.00 or $500.00.d. Then obviously, ask you for the redeem numbers so that they can redeem it for themselves.",

Your instinct was right. PDF files can contain malicious codes and become a Trojan, and by downloading and running these PDF files on your devices, the malicious code they injected into them will run, and they will be able to hack your devices easily. And if we assume that these PDF files are not injected with malicious code, they can contain links to scam phishing sites by clicking on them or placing your credit card or any critical data; then they will undoubtedly steal you. As for me, I receive many of these phishing messages constantly. It contains PDF files and many temptations, but I ignore them as if I have never seen them. Also, not only PDF files in the mail are dangerous, but any free PDF files available for download on the Internet can contain a Trojan, so what I see is a safe solution for me I open these files are on cloud reading platforms such as Google Drive, and I do not open them on my main devices.",
