You must to wait for bottom confirmation to response to the market. It means you will buy at a little higher price than absolute bottom price but you will be safer with this approach.Don't time the market means don't predict when the market will reach to its bottom. We are aware that the crypto market has 4-year cycle but it does not mean each cycle will last exactly 4 years. It can start or end sooner or later than previous cycles.",

For the moment we are sure the trend is still down and I believe this month is going to close before a contrary prediction will be seen. I can say maybe we can see more bear to $12,705 but this is just for my personal consumption not an expert advise , trade or hodl consciously.",
