That I got when I created the wallet.  I've installed the app but it only gives me the option of creating a new wallet.  Any info on how I can make progress recovering the 2017 wallet much appreciated.",

      "body": "Since it is an electrum generated seed I think this process will work. First make sure you have the correct wallet installed and properly, then proceed with create new wallet and click next and proceed to the type of wallet if it is not a multi sig or not a 2 factor authentication wallet, just click on the  create standard wallet and proceed with next. It will take you to create new seed, just click on I already have a seed and proceed, this goes to where you will type in your recovery seed and if it is correct you can just go and create a password and I think that should actually work.
