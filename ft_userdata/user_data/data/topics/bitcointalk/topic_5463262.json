This is only one month before Satoshi's last post on this forum, and there were plenty of other miners involved in bitcoin by then.So it's almost certainly just some early miner moving their coins.

I read the news that 400.000 BTC were transferred from old wallets in August!What is so suspicious about old addresses, likely miners from that time, moving their balance to another addresses? Sure, they might sell some of them, but it is not like that is a malicious thing to do. Just a few days ago there were news of a 1000 BTC being moved, and you'll likely see more of them in the future. Doesn't mean they are satoshi though.",

Although some found themselves in a panic, I believe that there are many who know how to appreciate moments like this - so I have nothing against FUD continuing, and the old proverb says \"who laughs last, laughs the sweetest\".",

I read the news that 400.000 BTC were transferred from old wallets in August!There is nothing suspicious about anybody, even Satoshi, moving their coins, as long as the coins are theirs and they have the keys, they can move it anytime they want. You guys should stop looking for conspiracy theories in everything, if Satoshi is still alive and wants to return known to the community, they know what to do, but until they do that, allow them some privacy.",

I read the news that 400.000 BTC were transferred from old wallets in August!There is nothing to be suspicious of, friends, for transactions that occur at that address. Each address owner has a private key, entitled to make transactions on his coin.joniboini and Z-tight have said that it is normal and from o_e_l_e_o response it can be a reinforcement that there is no need to be suspicious because at that time there were other miners who might be doing the activity and I don't agree if it was directed that it was satoshi who did it.What I suspect maybe the OP meant to create this topic to tell everyone that this is one of the reasons behind the drop in the bitcoin price.",
