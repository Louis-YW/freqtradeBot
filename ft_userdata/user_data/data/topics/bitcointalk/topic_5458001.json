  "content": "Hi there, I'm selling 3 2014 Cryptonic Monero physical coins as an one time offer for 0.0815 btc (~$2500 at the moment). The offer is active until the end of this week, July 2nd 23:59:59 Amsterdam time. The first person who accepts the offer will get the coins.One coin is pure silver and 2 are silver plated. The 2 silver plated ones have a couple brown tarnish spots on the side of the coin, I tried to make a photo of them but it's hard to see on the photos. All coins are unfunded.The coins are the first physical Monero coins ever produced and they are very rare, there are only a couple auctions of these coins found on the internet. The only similar succesful trade that I know of is that someone bought a 2014 Cryptonic pure silver coin for $1700 in 2017.I am the original owner of the coins and can post the e-mail I received when I ordered the coins from Cryptonic, also the owner of Cryptonic posted on my trust page.Photos:Coin 1, 2014 Cryptonic pure silverCoin 2, 2014 Cryptonic silver platedCoin 3, 2014 Cryptonic silver platedPlease limit posts to comments/questions about the items up for sale.ESCROW: If you want we can use a trusted escrow on this site, you will have to pay for escrow fees.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC, can also accept ETH, XMR and USDT if that is fine with the potential escrow too, if you want to pay in another cryptocurrency we can discuss that.
