Imo the fact there are multiple democratic systems makes all of them stronger already (the rejection of dictatorships seen in Russia and China might also do that too).",

This is the reason that must be maintained at all times, there is no control from any party over the survival of Bitcoin today or in the future. But the capitalist and globalist countries have a very hard struggle against. Their technology can be easily monitored and manipulated within finger reach. The forces that prevent Bitcoin from moving freely are being eroded. The global support of people who believe in Bitcoin should be unified, but the problem is that they are under government control. It's hard to limit large holdings when companies and popes are actually born to people who have power under the government.Russia, China and America are countries that have a strong role. All three are still struggling in the field of power struggles. Economic and political influences easily distort facts. Bitcoin must remain independent and there must be no control of the three.",

Russia's shameless war (no special op fantasies, sorry) doesn't help anybody. Russia's war made the energy (and life) more expensive and that's all.China's (so called) ban on bitcoin mining was the kick in the ass that helped the miners move forward towards decentralization, Russia has no merit in that.For decentralized bitcoin we need dirt cheap energy everywhere on the world, no energy war. So no, Russia didn't help. Russia made the things worse, making miners in many countries struggle.",

      "body": "The idea is basically correct. Any forceful influence of large states on weaker ones negatively affects the established democratic principles, the level of rights and freedoms of citizens, and this, in turn, affects the state of the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, over large states, as well as over all states, there should be international representative bodies that would quickly and effectively resolve all contradictions and conflicts between states.As the current full-scale military attack by Russia on Ukraine has shown, in our world the system of collective security is extremely ineffective. The UN is unable not only to stop the outbreak of war and curb the aggressor, but also to resolve smaller issues, such as the blockade of Ukrainian seaports by Russia, as a result of which Ukraine cannot supply grain and other products and goods to the world market, which threatens to starve in certain countries.I just can't figure out the title of this thread. \"Why is a Russian sting operation good for decentralized bitcoin?\" The war of conquest unleashed by Russia, and not a special operation that has been going on for the fifth month and has led to hundreds of thousands of human victims, cannot have a beneficial effect on bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole.",

Bitcoin is (and will be in the future) decentralized regardless of what happens in Russia, China or the US, and your idea that decentralization is paid for with death and destruction is more than disgusting - no normal person would want such a bloody Bitcoin.Instead of writing nonsense, you could hurry a little because your time is running out, and you haven't even pushed the price up to $25 000 yet.Quote from: Ucy on July 01, 2022, 05:11:46 PMSomething I have decided to do Have decided to move it up to $25 000 to 40,000 in 1 to 2 weeks time. I'm doing this without expecting reward from the work of moving it up. The current price of Bitcoin is about $19,500 is archived: https://archive.fo/0aVIp  Date: Friday July 1st 2022I will move the resistance to $40,000... And I may stop supporting the price at $25 000 to 40,000 level if people still do not appreciate.",

      "body": "I am trying to understand how independence of nations is related to Russia's war against Ukraine, but I must say I am struggling. You're saying China, US under Trump, and Russia are strong Nations, which fascist globalists want to weaken? Well that just shows lack of knowledge of what fascism is. Bitcoin is against central power, it's against the idea that one thing is strong and the rest are weak. Russia is an imperialist state which has precisely the ideology of being strong and thus entitled to take over smaller nations which have their own national ideas and agendas. This is not a good idea for Bitcoin either. It's the opposite of freedom, the opposite of democracy, the opposite of decentralization. If we have 3 centers, it's still centralization, and it's better if we have a multitude of countries, a diversity of policies and attitudes in the world. Oh, and while Putin is sort of not against Bitcoin, Trump, with his America first shit, was not crypto-friendly because with America first comes the USD first. And China is not crypto-friendly either because Bitcoin is a challenge for a state that seeks total control.Ukraine, on the other hand, is a crypto-friendly country (more crypto-friendly than Russia) with a roadmap of becoming even more pro-crypto in the future. And what Russia is doing is trying to stop that (and many other things an independent Ukraine can be) from happening.",

The problem here is that independent nations aren't really independent in the real sense. All of them do think of welfare of people but despite that are heavily reliant on revenues and therefore become selfish when it comes to Cryptocurrencies or other CBDC, which means they are not interested in giving these currencies a free hand to trade. They want currencies of their respective countries to be at the top so they can earn most of the revenues.",
