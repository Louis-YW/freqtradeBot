This made me more curious about your identity and the possibility of this account you put up here for sale. Are you the real owner of this account? and why would you want to put it up for sale? Such an account with that number of followers can be used for other purpose that would generate income much bigger than the amount you are putting it up for sales here. I am beginning to get more curious about this account stuff of a thing.",
