      "body": "Op I don't know how you understand the forum and I understand that you didn't not read the rules of the forum and only interested to advertise and promoting your token which is very bad. Assuming your coin appreciated in the future and you have a forum for it and people disobey the rule of the forum, what will you feel? All the threads you created concerning this token can be discussed in one thread and there is no need for multiple thread to discuss the coin. Like this thread, I have commented, others will comment and ask questions then you answer the questions then communication continue with the free flow discussions so what is the need for multiple ANN and others. The way you create threads on the coin will even make people to distrust the coin. \" ObedientÂ  is better than Sacrifice\".",
