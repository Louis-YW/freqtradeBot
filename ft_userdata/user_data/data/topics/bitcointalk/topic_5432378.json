They can easily obtain everything they require. My mix amount arrived on time and cannot be traced. So far, everything has gone pretty smoothly. Funds were received in less than 6 hours, which I believe should be improved. I know it's already on the website, but we'll be receiving mixed funds in 6 hours. However, I believe that time should be reduced further. Why should a user have to wait 6 hours to receive his funds? Everything else is fine to me. I hope you will consider user feedback to improve your service. I tried with min amount 0.005 BTC.",
