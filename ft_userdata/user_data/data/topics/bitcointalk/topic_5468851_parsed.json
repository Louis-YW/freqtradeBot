  "content": "I would like to address the esteemed community with this question: \"Are posts-reports in the \"Report plagiarism...\" thread stupid posts?\"The background of my question. Recently one user, let's call him \"someone\", called my posts-reports in this thread stupid. That, they say, plagiarism on the forum - this is strictly the business of moderators. That it is not our, ordinary users, business.I would like to add that this user has a shallow mind, because in my person he called the posts of all those who write such posts-reports in this topic stupid.It turns out that Mr. LoyceV has created his own thread for stupid report posts and everyone who posts there (and DT1 members also post there) writes stupid posts. And also get merits for those stupid posts.Oops, but what is this? Mr. LoyceV even said thanks for my stupid post report. And even gave me a merit. But how come? For a stupid post?Quote from: LoyceV on September 22, 2023, 05:56:35 PMQuote from: light_warrior on September 22, 2023, 03:31:50 PMMadmax678Thanks for finding this! I've reported his post too. This bounty spammer has 6 deleted posts already in modlog, now all he needs is a ban.So still, is there a need for such posts-reports? To make the forum cleaner and to help moderators. Or all those who post in this thread are wasting their time and doing unnecessary work?What does the respected community think?",

That, they say, plagiarism on the forum - this is strictly the business of moderators. That it is not our, ordinary users, business.Reporting plagiarism is the work of anyone that is interested but moderators are the ones that have the power to make the final decision to delete the post and ban the user. Moderators do appreciate those that are reporting unwanted posts on this forum and it makes their work easier.Quote from: light_warrior on October 02, 2023, 06:19:41 AMI would like to add that this user has a shallow mind, because in my person he called the posts of all those who write such posts-reports in this topic stupid.It turns out that Mr. LoyceV has created his own thread for stupid report posts and everyone who posts there (and DT1 members also post there) writes stupid posts.

Moreover these reports are reference to the pliagrized member why his account banned. So I think doing this is great work and should be appreciated",

I can say that cleaning the forum is the job of everyone but there are only few who takes time to report these posts. But the reporters should also learn that some of their reports could be bad, so they shouldn't expect the moderators to act in their favour always.The essence of the report plagiarism threads and other related threads is to help the moderators assemble such posts they will likely take action against.",

It also helps other users by being active in reporting plagiarized content so they can be noticed by older/long time members of the forum which in my opinion is a good thing because that means that you're active in the forum and not just a mindless post spammer.",

Therefore, I would not call such a way of attracting the moderator's attention stupid, but perhaps in some way unnecessary considering the way in which every plagiarized post is dealt with.Sometimes it's not so easy to explain in several words why do you report a post and you need to show a plagiarism pattern from plagiarism detector or make some other explanations. So right, the post with plagiarism will be deleted by report, but a report can have a link to a post with explanation why it was reported. It is firstly.Secondly, having this topic should demotivate people from plagiarizing: they see that it's not just something in the forum rules, it is something real, others will see a post with plagiarism, it will be deleted and plagiarist will be banned. If it will demotivate even several users from plagiarizing, well, IMO then it's good enough to keep such a topic.",

That's good enough for me. And I don't care about what that smug \"somebody\" says anymore. Thank you all for your comments. Believe me, they're important to me.I'd like to say a few words about the post-reports. I personally do them for a reason. Imagine if we report about plagiarism to moderators like thisor thisDo you think the moderators would be in the business of checking plagiarism themselves? Follow links, look for phrases or paragraphs in articles that have been plagiarized? I think that in the best case in such a situation the moderator will simply delete the plagiarized post, and the plagiarizer will continue his dirty work. So I create a post-report first, and then when I send the report to a moderator, I include a link to my post-report in the comment.Yes, I understand that such post-reports are a matter of trust in the person who creates them. Therefore, anyone who doubts the veracity of such a report post or just for the sake of interest can always check the veracity of the report post. And in the case of a false post-report, accuse the author of such a post of forgery, with all the consequences for that author.Thanks again, everyone.I think the topic can be closed so that it really doesn't turn into a discussion of some imaginary drama.",
