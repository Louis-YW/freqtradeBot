  "content": "Introducing Bitcoin Forum NFTsImmortalize your forum profile on the Bitcoin blockchain!Nope, this is not an April Fool's joke.A Bitcoin Forum NFT is a Bitcoin-based NFT (non-fungible token) created using Counterparty, an 8+ year-old protocol for tokenization on the BTC blockchain. These are one-of-a-kind collectibles that can be stored in any self-custodied BTC address and used to commemorate your participation on the Bitcoin Forum. You can trade them for other forum tokens using the Counterparty DEX, show them off IRL using the token.art app, sell them for BTC using the Dispenser feature, or even wrap them via Emblem Vault to put it up for sale on OpenSea!How are they made?Bitcoin Forum NFTs are created as Counterparty subassets, meaning they all begin with the name \"BITCOINFORUM\" and end with the Bitcointalk user name. For example, my NFT is named \"BITCOINFORUM.nutildah\". It can be seen and its information verified using xchain - a Counterparty-enabled block explorer - under the following entry:https://xchain.io/asset/BITCOINFORUM.nutildahThe methodology for asset creation is as follows:1. Custom field information is collected from purchaser (PGP short ID & quote, both are optional).2. JSON file is created using the purchaser's forum profile information and uploaded to Arweave (example file here).3. Token is minted in Counterparty using link to JSON file as reference data.4. Token supply is locked with a purchaser-specified quantity of 1-100.5. Token data ownership (a Counterparty-specific property) is transferred to burn address, making it immutable.6. Token is transferred to purchaser's provided BTC address.What blockchain does the NFT use?BTC. This is the Bitcoin Forum, so naturally these NFTs should be minted on the Bitcoin blockchain.Why use Arweave to host the JSON?Kind of like IPFS, Arweave is a decentralized way to store files for the long-term. Files stored on its network can always be accessed via permanent URLs. They are also immutable: once uploaded, they cannot be changed. As creator of the NFT, can't you still change its image or data after it has been purchased and sent?No. Transferring token data ownership to a burn address ensures that nobody can change the data embedded in the token. However, you can change the image displayed in the xchain description for your token by simply changing your profile image on the forum. This is because the token points to your forum avatar to draw image information from. (Member rank info is permanent, however, and will not update when your rank changes. Same goes for the custom message & PGP info).How do I access or move the NFT?The best way to do this is to provide an address created using a Counterparty-enabled wallet. We recommend either Counterwallet (web wallet) or Freewallet (desktop wallet). Both are highly-secure BTC wallets currently used to hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC and Counterparty tokens. Bitcoin Forum NFTs are stored just like any other Counterparty token (in a BTC address), and are transferred just like any Bitcoin transaction (from BTC address to BTC address, paying the usual tx fee).Will you be minting NFTs of non-active or non-participating profiles?No. Bitcoin Forum NFTs will only be minted for willing participants who have paid in advance.How much do they cost?- The first respondent to this thread will get theirs free as a Proof of Concept.- The next 3 respondents will get theirs at a special price of $25 (payable in BTC, LTC, or DOGE).- The price for additional respondents will be $40, except for accounts registered before Dec. 31, 2015, in which case the price will remain $25.How do we place an order?Please post your request here or send it to me via PM using the following format:Code:PGP field text (PGP Fingerprint, [url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/84280/short-openpgp-key-ids-are-insecure-how-to-configure-gnupg-to-use-long-key-ids-i]Long Key or Short Key ID[/url]) (optional):Custom Category text (optional, up to 52 characters):Quantity of tokens desired (1-100):Preferred payment method (BTC, LTC, or DOGE):Delivery address (Counterparty or self-custody BTC):You will then be contact with an amount & address for payment. Note that if you are not using a Counterparty address, you must possess the private key of your BTC address in order to move your NFT!Also, you can only request an NFT of your own profile.This method uses standards adopted by modern Bitcoin NFT projects and is the result of thinking about how best to do it pretty hard. If you have any questions not covered by the answers here, please feel free to ask! Thanks.Proof of Counterparty wallet and PGP ownership can be found here.",

But I will let buyers choose the quantity of token they want minted, up to 100.Do you want to be my trial subject?Quote- The first respondent to this thread will get theirs free as a Proof of Concept.I will let people decide the number of tokens they want minted.

Just enter a receiving address and amount to send and click send..On a bitcoin wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain..Their is also a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the bitcoin blockchain.. (did you know that?)You can list them for sale on the books of the DEX just like any exchange, except you can create any exchange pair you want.. Just place an order..You can place a buy or sell order for them for bitcoin, XCP, or any other asset/NFT that has ever been or will be created..Just like any exchange except you can create any market pair you want with a couple clicks..Or you can P2P trade them for whatever you want..It’s really very nifty and more people should be aware of this..This is Bitcoin!Quote from: dkbit98 on August 26, 2022, 03:19:45 PMAnd can I create NFT only for my own account or I can create them for any account I want, let's say satoshi, theymos, Hal Finney or anyone else?Yes you sure can! And yes people could try to scam with fakes, but it’s pretty easy to prove/know which the real originals are.. It is on the bitcoin blockchain after all with full TX history and which assets were created by what address (addresses you can sign) and all..It is bitcoin, just different little pieces of bitcoin, and bitcoin had to be burned to create them..So they are basically different little pieces of bitcoin that get labeled as something specific..This is how you can put the seed to your property on Bitcoin, the title of your car, or even shares of a publicly traded company, right on the bitcoin blockchain..Quote from: dkbit98 on August 26, 2022, 03:19:45 PMSomeone could probably create multiple NFT of their account with changed avatar, Rank, text, etc.We could easily tell if someone tried to make, sell, or trade fakes, just like you can tell if someone sends you a fake TX, or can tell if someone even has whatever they claim they do..It’s all right there..Check out my profile addy for example..https://xchain.io/address/1vvSrTFiQY7akwbsv3iYPPe9mR3DsEbffYou can see what assets I have created, own, what orders I have open, what orders have filled or not, everything I have sent/received/traded since the beginning of time..Just like regular bitcoin..Nutildah is more skilled in the technicals of all this than I am, but I have also been heavily using this for a very long time (in bitcoin time)..p.s.

However, your NFT won't start with \"BITCOINFORUM\" as I own that asset. (I tried to get BITCOINTALK but somebody already registered it years ago, then abandoned their wallet).For what I'm offering, you can only order mints of your own account, with a quantity between 1 and 100 (up to you).",
