Plus having to accumulate eth is by setting up node and not into mining anymore. Holders of eth might probably thinking of this but with the current situation of hacks and some stolen funds. These investors are also inline to keep it away from those guys.The only thing I dont like is the linkage on government since they might use this to use on their personal interest.",

It seems like that decrease of tx fees in ethereum blockchain caused by the demand was going down. So many people have been migrating to layer 1 and 2 blockchain. I think that scalability problem never got solved. Did i miss something?

If they are withdrawing their ethereum and it would not be 64% of ethereum owned by cex. The government didn't need to give even more strict regulation. Government was focusing in AML and taxation. I see no problem for ethereum for sure. It's still good as investment and why not? the price is jumping a bit last days due to the bitcoin small pump.",

Recently, Vitalik Buterin also announced further updates of ETH to fix the remaining issues and he also mentioned that he will solve the ETH centralization problem that people are concerned about. What he said, I don't know if it's possible with a model like POS, but if you are an investor who doesn't care about privacy only cares about profit, then you can still invest in ETH. I still believe that ETH will remain the king of altcoins and continue to grow in the future.",

Centralization is crucial part of Ethereum to boost its performance, There is a pros and cons but that doesn't they are not trusted anymore because all transactions is still recorded in the blockchain and regulators is already watching on it so it's not dangerous as it sounds compared before that everything in crypto is not being watch by regulators.Ethereum just did the dirty job for Bitcoin on handling larger tps by sacrificing it decentralized feature.",

It can be trusted and still it is good for investment?Since its inception, ethereum has been centralized, like all other crypto projects (except bitcoin). Therefore, that at the time of POW, which is now at POS, nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of centralization. If you think about what will happen to this project in the future, then I think it's the same as with all centralized projects - sooner or later governments will find ways to influence them. And as is usually the case, when the government interferes with the functioning of any project, it doesn't benefit the project. I don't think that this will happen any time soon and you need to get rid of eth urgently if you have it. No, on the contrary, ethereum may still be a profitable investment vehicle, as it was for many years before, but I think that you need to keep an eye on changes in the crypto market in order to always be ready for unpleasant surprises. In general, as with any investment.",

Although a lot of projects chose BSC over ETH if you look at the top projects, large projects still chose ETH at that time because it was decentralized and more secure than BSC.

It can be trusted and still it is good for investment?Ethereum may be turning centralized, but other coins are faring worse (with the exception of Bitcoin). I believe that what's happening now is only temporary, since \"The Merge\" is in its very beginnings (it's only been around 2 months since the upgrade materialized on the ETH blockchain). Give it some time, and you'll see more validators hop in. I think with the upcoming scaling upgrade (which will integrate Sharding into the ETH blockchain), the network's centralization problems will come to an end.I'm hopeful that will be the case for the good of \"De-Fi\". It would be quite disappointing to see ETH turning centralized, after being the pioneer of Web 3.0. After all, ETH always promised to be the platform for \"unstoppable applications\". That could only be a achieved with a decentralized and censorship-resistant blockchain. Many competitors come and go, but I believe ETH will last thanks to the solid foundation built upon it. The future is unpredictable, so we can only hope for the best. Just my opinion",
