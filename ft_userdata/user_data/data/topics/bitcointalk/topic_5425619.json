  "content": "QuoteItaly is to use more cash and fewer credit cards, bucking a global AML trend towards electronic currency, after Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, dismissed card payments as “private money”.Meloni, who was elected in September, is finalising her first budget, which is due to include a rule allowing shopkeepers and businesses to refuse cards and demand cash for payments up to €60. The rule would raise the current limit of €30 and includes permission to sell and buy goods worth up to €5,000 in cash, up from €1,000.Meloni has an unusual justification for supporting banknotes over plastic. She told parliament: “The only legal currency in Italy and Europe is the paper notes issued by the European Central Bank. Electronic money is not legal currency.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cash-must-be-king-giorgia-meloni-tells-shoppers-02crzx7rg....Most EU nations are pro AML (anti money laundering) regulation.

Some say this encourages the underground economy, and indeed it does, but it also respects the privacy of people who do not defraud and do not want to be monitored. Quote from: Hydrogen on December 04, 2022, 10:59:06 AMCash is one of the best options we have atm.I agree, but I would point out that for low amounts it is the best. If you want to move 1 million pounds or euros, the best option is bitcoin, but for day-to-day payments with privacy there is nothing better than cash, because with cash you pay everywhere (with some rare exceptions) while the options for day-to-day payments with bitcoin are very limited.",

And She must have seen it coming that banks are going to run in the next few months along with digital currencies so if one has many on the bank will lose them all. Accepting cash alone and having cash on hand makes sense. Though they may still be devalued, bank notes will not disappear in an instant.",

It sounds totalitarian, in my opinion.Ms.Meloni has proven herself to be already a controversial figure within the European community, mostly because things she has said in the past, I did not expect her to go against the plans of the developed economies on implementing digital cash or CBDCs. I can only speculate she wants to reduce profits taken by the banks in Italy, for some reason, credit is not free.",

The global debt crisis are built on \"credit card\" use and how easy it is to swipe a card. People seem to spend less, when they have cash in their pockets.... because they physically handle the money and they can also see how their wallet are drained, when they use it. I still use \"cash\" a lot.. and only use online payments when I pay for some of my expenses, where I have to stand in a queue to make the payments.

You've got this wrong, she didn't say a thing about money laundering, her position was that raising the limit slightly won't affect money laundering that much since it will still be low enough and still comparable to other EU countries. She focused on the other aspect, that you're forced to use a credit card or a debit card for payments over 60E even at a chain store, which is a bit stupid, to be honest, I'm in the EU and I can still pay my groceries in cash far higher in value with cash at any store. Now switch from groceries to a night out and you're out of luck since it's highly improbable to come under those 60 euros for a dinner for two persons, so basically, everyone would be forced to have a card.It's one thing to encourage, but it's completely a different thing to apply unseasonable limits, the limits in Italy were the lowest in all of EU and even increasing them they would not be the highest at all, Germany has no limit and is just planning to introduce a 10k one, double the one Meloni is aiming for.Quote from: kryptqnick on December 04, 2022, 02:47:01 PMSome countries are just bad at digitalizing, and you often need cash there to get by.

CBDC are not the devil you think it is..however there are many pitfulspaper cash is in the pocket. it doesnt have \"battery low\" problems of your cell phone. nor hacker fault from downloading other apps to phone.paper has advantages over CDBCas for the KYC, yes most including china have a 3 tiered wallet. low mid hi tiers low tier is for personal spending amounts these wallets have no kyx and mid tier (business/mid income/middleclass) have basic kyc and the top(corporate/rich) has full kycCDBC has more ability for commercial banks/payment services that service the customers(note not the central bank) to monitor the mid top tier and report suspicious/tax evading to authorities. meaning it can strengthen the tax revenues from the mid/top tier group. while the small spender group dont get hassled much unless they upgrade to mid/tophowever back to the pitfallsdigital only works if you have cell battery power and cell signal. or within a brick&mortar store to pay them using tap&pay/qur code face to face. (though these wallets do offer all 3 options of payment from wallet(wireless, qr,tap))losing your phone or dropping it means immediate access is lost. but you can use recovery seed on new device to regain access.",

Money in banks and other financial institution are constantly rotated. Meaning, they don't just sit there in the owners account or something, they are constantly invested to make more money. If more people start using cash, then you're only creating more room for leakages because not all of this cash will find it's way to the economy's financial institution and if this continues for a long period of time, the financial institution might not have enough money to invest. And one way these financial institutions invest is by giving loans to individuals and businesses. So when these businesses don't get the required funding they need from financial institutions it affects the economy because they can't expand and be involves in more investments. This single policy if not well regulated can be a serious problem for an economy in years to come.",

At the same time, quite conscientious people are very easily tracked for the purpose of further manipulation. This should not be forgotten and this should be a priority. And to track the criminal, this is the business of law enforcement agencies. They have special powers for this and a certain mechanism of influence.
