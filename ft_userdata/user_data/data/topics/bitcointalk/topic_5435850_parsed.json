  "content": "Introducing the world's most scalable layer one blockchain! Arcology is a revolutionary solution with ability to processmultiple transactions （Arbitrarily complex smart contract calls）simultaneously. It is a parallel blockchain with EVM compatibility. Arcology provides Solidity APIs to help contract developers to take full use of our parallel design. We have successfully parallelizedsome applications like CryptoKitties and DSToken using these APIs.Problem StatementThe scalability issue is still the single biggest for Blockchain. Parallel processing is an effective wat to the problem. Doing parallel processing is challenging on blockchains because of some unique requirements (determinism in particular).  There are some solutions but they either have to give up composability(L2s), EVM compatibility（ATPOS）or something else. Arcology NetworkArcology is the only blockchain that brings the best of both worlds. Arcology has the followings revolutionary features.•   Deterministic Parallel Transaction Processing•   Concurrent and Parallel Smart contract programming•   Event driven microservice-based architecture support•   Full Composability•   Full EVM compatibilityIntra-node horizontal scaling Arcology is a platform has intra-node horizontal scaling. Unlike other blockchain platforms that are limited by the capabilitiesof a single server, our platform allows users to harness the power of multiple servers to run their nodes. This innovative technology allows users to run a single node on multiple interconnected servers, providing unmatchedspeed and scalability for blockchain networks.DemoTo demonstrate what Arcology can do, we parallelized some well-known smart contracts using our concurrent APIs and got some pretty linear speedups.CryptoKitties: https://github.com/arcology-network/parallel-kittiesDSToken: https://github.com/arcology-network/parallel-dstoken VerificationWe have completed a 3rd verification with the digital technology and Risk Practice group.
