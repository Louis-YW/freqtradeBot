  "content": "Hey Guys, So this is my 500th post on here. Wow, seems like such a milestone (kidding, I need to pump those numbers up lol). Mile 500 guys. Idk where you are at with your bitcoin journey, maybe you're a newb on here, a modest coiner, a shrimp, a fish, a shark, a Whale!!!! It could be that you're mining, or have some kind of crypto company, maybe you're posting about bitcoin on here purely for fun or campaigning or just wanting to learn more about this revolutionary change in money that just so happened to occur in our life time, lucky us!!!¬† If you're reading this, please comment a little about what your goal is on here and what you're most interested in. For me it has to be all of the intense discussions on current events in the space, I sure do love to get everyone's take on here and its fun getting involved. I also do love the collectibles section. The best part of all of this though has to be the people behind these screen names. On the forum and off the forum. I had the privilege to meet with some of you at a bitcoin forum pizza meet up outside of the bitcoin conference on day 2, what a joy that was meeting all of you- comment if you were there!!!! We are truly a remarkable group of people and have found a commonplace in BTC & crypto which is truly enriching and just loads of fun. I just wish I could have had a better chance to meet and talk to everyone that was there (and also not there), with 21 of us there total (how awesome is that right ) it was hard with so many people in such a short amount of time to get to know everybody! I have to give a shoutout though to all the folks that I've come in contact with in my time on this forum. Its an absolute privilege to be on the forum here with you all, and I look forward to what the future has in store! Thats all I really had to say for this post for #500 I just wanted to say THANK YOU EVERYONE, for being you!Cheers, TREAD93",

You also haven't found out that there is a thread that tries to concentrate all these \"achievements\". So congratulations on your 500th post but you still have to learn a lot of things.",

He won't help forum grow in anyway, even if he decides to quit forum, the forum will still remain informative. Op, you made 500 posts only for about 5 years.

If no, making a min of 20 posts per week should get you much more numbers than 500. What really happened?",
