Newbies are expected to make minor mistakes and learn from them as they progress in the forum. That's why there are moderators here.Lastly, all of us are here to learn about Bitcoin and make money from it.

Unfortunately, there are countries where the salary is very low or there is not enough work for everyone, and I can understand that some people are looking for a lifeline in places like this forum.A win-win situation is when someone actually learns something during the discussion, passes that knowledge on, and maybe also earns something by promoting something in his signature.Quote from: Onyeeze on June 08, 2023, 10:27:06 AM~ Engage in a conversation mostly related in bitcoin. Although the name of this forum says \"bitcointalk\", there is also an altcoins board, and although I personally have no interest in that part of the forum, it was different in the past. Therefore, I think that beginners should explore all the boards and find the ones they are most interested in.",

We will have more upgrades in future and Protocol will be upgraded too.Altcoin protocols are joke and altcoin developers can change their protocols if they want. Because altcoins are centralized in hands of CEOs and developers.",

This includes business owners. Also, keep in mind that some people don't have enough time to rank their accounts here, I'm talking of business owners and individuals who have talents but want to provide their services here. That's why there's a copper member.I have seen a lot of people who started selling their services here, as newbies but later reached a higher membership.So, what I'm saying is that this forum might not be an office for you but it's sure an office to someone else. Also, don't be obsessed that all newbies who post their services here are scammers because that's not true. That's why there are escrows here to ensure that every transaction is conducted safely.Yes, you are a member but that doesn't mean that other people's daily life revolves around here to focus on ranking their accounts under 6 months.",

Imagine in the offline world, a company that pays salaries in front of everyone (employees, associates, casual passers-by...) and clearly emphasizes how much someone earned. Crazy, right?",
