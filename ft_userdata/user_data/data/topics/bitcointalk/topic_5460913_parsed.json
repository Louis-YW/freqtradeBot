Do you have any previous screenshots of your bet prior to these ones? It's hard to believe that a platform will be so blatant about cheating their players, especially with Stake whose reputation is already cemented in and out of the forum. I'm not doubting your screenshot, nor your claims whatsoever just because I am advertising Stake under my signature, but what you're saying is taking a step further on the usual claims that people have been throwing at the said platform.",

I don't think a million-dollar gambling site like Stake's going to cheap out on customer experience by letting these \"bugs\" as you put it roam freely on the site. And here I thought you have a serious accusation too lmao. Next time be very careful when you're making bets and don't bet on handicaps if you want to bet on match winner. Plus you're literally asking for money right away and we don't even know who you are. You're literally bullshitting us right now if I'm being honest. If you have a complaint with Stake, best to put it to their doorstep and refrain from asking people money when we don't owe you anything at all. And if you're that crazy over measly 75 pounds, you might wanna stop gambling altogether as you're definitely not in the right financial disposition I reckon.",

OP is feeling the heat already for loosing that amount and you can clearly see it from his/her post.Quote I wont never gamble here again and probably in any site.Gambling is not something you rush into if you don't have the mind to let go of your lose and that's why you are always advice to gamble responsibly with what you can afford to lose. It's obvious that OP is regretting his actions and wiling to reverse the moment if possible to cancel the bet but it is too late. Seeking donation here and there is not the right thing to do after you gamble excessively with caution. In case, you need to bet in the future, go through your selection and picks thoroughly before you click on bet to submit your ticket. It's not your way but glad you are willing to give up early after this lose. What a bad experience for you",
