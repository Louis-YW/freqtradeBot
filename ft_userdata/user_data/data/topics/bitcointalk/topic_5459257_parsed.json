  "content": "In the recent world, investing in Agriculture may be a way to save oneself from poverty and also relieve ones country from recession. Countries like China, India, Brazil and Indonesia have used agriculture to improve their economy in recent time. Almost all aspect of agriculture is profitable if done in the right way but some may be more profitable than others. This also depends on ones interest and ones country unless one plan to export its products. My choice of agriculture is vegetable plantation. Here is my tomato farm Although I'm starting small but I have a great dream to feed the nation with my agro business.Here is little about tomato farming:What Is A Tomato?Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a fruit vegetable that is widely cultivated for its edible fruit. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to South America but is now grown worldwide. Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals and are commonly used in a wide range of dishes, including salads, sauces, and soups. They can be consumed both raw and cooked, and come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, including cherry tomatoes, Roma tomatoes, and beefsteak tomatoes.Benefits of Tomato FarmingðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Economic opportunities: Tomato farming creates economic opportunities for farmers, traders and other players in the value chain, contributing to income generation and poverty reduction.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Nutritional value: Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals, which are essential for a healthy diet.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Health benefits: Tomatoes contain antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, which have been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Job creation: Tomato farming creates job opportunities for farm laborers, processors, marketers, and other stakeholders in the value chain.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Export potential: Tomato can be export to other countries and beyond, contributing to foreign exchange earnings.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Diversification: Tomato farming can be integrated into other cropping systems, providing farmers with options for diversification and risk management.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Community development: Tomato farming can contribute to community development by promoting social cohesion, employment, and local economic development.Step-By-Step Guide on how to start tomato farmingðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Land preparation: Select a suitable piece of land and clear it of all debris, rocks, and weeds. Then, plow, harrow, and level the land.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Seed selection: Choose the right variety of tomato seeds suitable for your local climate and soil type. Buy high-quality seeds from reputable sources.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Seedbed preparation: Prepare the seedbed by mixing soil with organic matter like compost, manure, or peat moss to improve soil quality.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Planting: Plant the tomato seeds in rows, following the recommended spacing and depth for the variety.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Irrigation: Water the plants regularly, especially during the dry season, to ensure proper growth and fruiting.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Fertilization: Apply fertilizer to the plants at regular intervals to provide essential nutrients.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Pest and disease control: Protect your crop from pests and diseases by using appropriate control methods such as crop rotation, biological control, and chemical control.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Weeding: Remove weeds around the tomato plants regularly to prevent competition for nutrients and space.Pruning and staking: Train the tomato plants to grow upright by pruning and staking them.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Harvesting: Harvest the tomatoes when they are fully ripe, and sell them at the market or process them for export.Reference: https://startuptipsdaily.com/tomato-farming-business-nigeria-africa/#:~:text=In%20Nigeria%2C%20tomato%20farming%20takes,season%20when%20irrigation%20is%20possible.CONCLUSIONApart from this tomato farming, I still run a poultry and a piggery farm as part of my agro business. Agriculture is lucrative and comes with alot of opportunities for both youths and adults. Invest in one or more Agro business today and save the world from hunger as well as to rescue your country from recession.",

I already said in the article that am starting small so I'm running the farm on a small portion of land. So those debris, rocks and plastics are packed during land preparation at a corner. This might has mistakenly been spread by some of my workers. I never even observe it till the moment this snapshot was taken. Thanks for your observations.",

If you're one of the biggest producers and farmers in your region, it's no doubt that you're one of the big contributors to your economy. But even not that as big as I am thinking, as long as you produce your own food, you're not just helping to keep up with the economy but also you're securing your food and lessening the problem that you have to deal with. At the same time, not just being secured in food but you also have to produce and sell it within your region and much better to export it in country's that has a lot of demand for crops, tomato and etc.",

Quite a lot of people going into agriculture think it is easy and would fetch them a lot of money once they get into it. Subsistence farming is a whole lot different from commercial farming, and when you get into the latter your cost rises rapidly, as well as the chances of failure despite the amount spent, thus look at things critically before you decide to 'grow' your 'agro business', it is not a walk in the park.",

Invest in one or more Agro business today and save the world from hunger as well as to rescue your country from recession.That's great and the same here too, and I'm thankful that I was part of a signature paid campaign that can able to sustain my capital on this kind of investment agro farming. Â IMO, I find vegetable plantation and livestock farming to be my preferred choice in agriculture because it offers a range of opportunities for profitability, given the increasing demand for fresh and healthy produce. Â By adopting effective cultivation techniques, efficient resource management, and market analysis, the vegetable plantation can be a rewarding and sustainable agricultural endeavor. Â Aside from that, did you know that all kinds of farmers in my country were supported by our government, just like giving soil fertilizer and hybrid seedlings.I tend to agree that fact, agriculture has the potential to help a country overcome a recession by providing employment opportunities, generating income, and ensuring food security. Â By creating jobs, particularly in rural areas, agriculture can address unemployment and boost the overall economy IMO.",

Problem to some countries, is that governmenta are more focused with importing from other countries than having ideas of exporting their own. Land properties are there but they are not making use of its potential. Creating your own agricultural trademark as a country won't be easy but atleast in a long run it would be a great tool not only for profit potential for country but also with utilizing it to local markets as a resource.",

But only the rich are in control because the wages here as a farmer are very small and only enough to eat for a day.

Agriculture is not a general solution to recession, it can be done if your area is geologically supportive.But indeed there are places that are deliberately forced into fertile land with the support of the use of modern technology and excessive chemicals, while in a state of recession some of these supports become scarce and expensive which results in agricultural financing swelling than usual.",

I know you are willing to work hard to achieve that dream, even sacrificing your time, energy and possessions in order to reach that dream so that it can be achieved. You have proven that starting a business does not always require new and sophisticated equipment, you only need to use an empty plot of land to turn it into land full of plants that have a sale value when they are harvested. Involving the people around you is also a good strategy, because inviting the people closest to you certainly won't make too many demands on you. You must have a strong belief in running a business, today your business may still be small, but who would have thought that in the future your business will grow much more than before and be able to employ more people.Good luck mate.",
