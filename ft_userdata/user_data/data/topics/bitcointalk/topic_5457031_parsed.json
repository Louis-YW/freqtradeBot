  "content": "There is so much ongoings in the crypto scene with one of the major exchanges, Binance, for reasons that might see it relinquish some of the power and jurisdiction it has. Binance U.S, under investigation by the SEC came at a time when the bearish season is speculated. Rumours and gist on social media has it that same U.S is launching its own cryptocurrency exchange called EDX. This project might well be one reason why the news on cryptocurrency is hot topic now, mostly as this new launch saw huge amounts poured in by big time investors, Citadel securities,Charles Schwab and Fidelity Digital Assets.The EDX exchange set to launch in a few days, is said to allow trading of bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash.So, this is the heck of the issue which is a cause of the ongoing FUD and truth revealing moments with Binance, Kraken and other exchanges and decentralized platforms that has been under fire lately. Any thoughts?Source link: https://twitter.com/bitcoinlfgo/",

Because it depends on how they will treat their customers.Binance earned their reputation throughout the years, it is not an overnight task for the trading platform.We can say, let's see if they will attract customers and offer competitive services. We can't make a conclusion yet as they don't have clients yet in the first place.",

They want to be in total control of the token.This kind of exchange is what I will definitely advise anyone who wants to be free from control to avoid. It might not be a scam exchange, but we should expect something like everyone being taxed properly, users being closely watched, how you make your deposit being closely watched, and they also keeping records of where you send your crypto and where it goes after that.This will be another financial system controlled by the government. Whoever cares about their privacy and security will definitely avoid that exchange.",

It really is not funny that if they want to launch their own crypto or exchange, they will put an end to other successful CEX like Binance, and least of all, citizens should be allowed to use their choice and preferable means of accumulating their Bitcoin or other coins. I am not yet sure, but I know that this their CEX that is planned to be Lounched is going to require KYC, which is just the bigger trap for crypto users in the US (LoL). Users can just wake up one morning and your account is frozen, and you will be asked to make yourself available at the CIA's office the next day. Yea, probably that's what it's going to look like in my guess, even if I am not very correct about it 😬 😃. Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺It is clearly going to be much regulated by government even if they claim in the end to not have any influence over it.It is one thing to be introduced to an idea like a decentralized system and crypto currency, it is another to want to own it and control the idea like it was ours originally. That's what the U.S is majorly good for and why most countries now copy their theatrics and use it to control its citizens, like the launch of certain CBDC's by most countries. It failed to exert what the country needed, hence why SEC in the U.S and most other nations are hell bent on latching a control on CEX.",

I hope they aren't just fudding Binance just to launch their own exchange, it's literally sounds like it was the case and it looks like they just want to monopolize the market with this. That wasn't a coincidence I guess that after the hot topic with Binance and a heavy regulated exchange like Coinbase there would be a new crypto exchange that will enter the US markets.

From which side, is what I can't really understand, because the competition in performance just got real. Binance changed or updated their terms. They want to do better. Other exchanges can witness the lawsuit against Binance and are ironing their sleeves and employing services to resolve congestion issues, huge fee rates and security protocols.  Other exchanges are doing same. The lightening network is an upgrade to this effect. Such FUD is necessary to affect the market, else how do traders earn big. The whales are moving. We got to brace up for what's to come.Any plans to monopolize the market would lead to a crash. The competition is healthy and I encourage new exchanges to come up. Unlike shit coins, would such new exchanges like EDX stand the test, like what Binance is facing, and still stand?",
