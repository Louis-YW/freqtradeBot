There's a recent attack on-chain poisoning on ETH and BSC chain, it's a serious problem since victim that doesn't know this kind attack will get robbed. It's better if Vitalik Butterin to solve this attack first rather than focus to develop ETH new update.",

Ethereum's Chain is all over crypto platforms; gambling, nfts, and even projects as well as with third party wallets which makes it I think, bigger, than any other altcoin. In this industry wherein there are hundreds or a thousand of tokens ofcourse we would see one which has higher value than the 'big names', one with higher market cap or token supply. But determining the largest or biggest could be on the size of its community. That depends on how you would interpret your comparison in the first place.",

Now multiply that 0.00000000032 USD with GELDC supply which you can find at their whitepaper at https://Boerse.website/WhitepaperGeldCoin.pdf or directly here at the ETH blockchain explorer: https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a2e92f57eb9aedf260d091c314a7f52ef0461a1 and you come to the biggest marketcap number of all coins and companies combined, because they have only a few trillions maximum quadrillion (quadrillion comes after trillion) marketcap, which is really low, I mean really very small and low.No coin and no company can beat top 1 marketcap coin GELDC.

There was no chance on its ecosystem but only some people who were leaving from the ecosystem caused by they were following the miners to create a new shit scam coin called ETHW. ETHW itself is no more better than ETC. ETH was largest altcoin based on the marketcap valuation but not for the another statistic.

Bitcoin will have done another halving at 2024. It may reach even higher price compared with last year price. It gives ethereum huge impact too",

It is undeniable that Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform, its market value is second only to Bitcoin, and it also has the largest encryption community.
