All we can do is speculate based on available data on; supply, trading demand, previous price action and adoption rate.With the current rate of adoption and the gradual shrinking of supply pump, I am fairly confident we would hit $100k, I can however not say if it's within the next year, or next ten years.As said above, the value of Bitcoin remains the same through market cycles, so if you're confident in the network, it's easier to hodl.",

Let me give a brief price history of the low and high price of bitcoin sicne 2017, you can go as far back as 2013 and see how it has been like, it is like the price history is repeating itself every four years but getting to all-time-high in each four years. Price high 2017 $19700BTC Price low 2018 $ $4040BTC Price high 2019 $ $13970BTC price low 2020 $ $3800BTC price high after 2020 halving $ $69000Now at $30000Let us hope that bitcoin will reach all-time-high after the next halving, let me assume it to be 2024/2025. But this is just a guess and hopefully bitcoin will reach all-time-high around that time.Quote from: 100bitcoin on May 19, 2022, 06:18:00 PM1 BTC = 1 BTC1 BTC = 1 BTC, but the value of bitcoin is compared to the value of fiat. The reason some people are holding bitcoin is because it is an appreciative asset. If bitcoin is compared to bitcoin, then it is not, but it is compared with fiat which makes it (bitcoin) to be an appreciative asset.",

The current situation is a slap on the face of reality and a reminder that crypto investment alone is not an assurance to wealth, you also have to have other investments and not bank fully on crypto. The current market situation is temporary and it is safe to say that we are still on the path to $100,000 mark. So don't get discouraged OP, Hodl on.",

Likewise, we believe that the next price increase will always be indicated by the value above. Bitcoin is a worthy investment, it is clear that Bitcoin is the only one that is much more viable than any coin. Will it reach $100,000? let's think that in the future Bitcoin adoption will increase, demand is everywhere even in the future you will find restaurants near your home that accept Bitcoin payment.",

But it will not go to 100k dollars at a time. Crossing step by step then maybe reaching within 100k dollars However, it is estimated that Bitcoin will reach $100k.",

Bitcoin goes up until it doesn't. And Bitcoin also goes down until it doesn't. There's a good reason to believe that on average Bitcoin will keep increasing in its value over long period of time. It's not 100 guaranteed, it is based on the fact that there's a growing demand for Bitcoin, while its supply is limited and predictable. So it is worth investing and holding, just have patience.",

The world is transitioning into a cashless world. You can argue it will happen gradually, and that is good, but it is happening. Bitcoin will be one of the key technologies that help us along the way. It can be argued that it is still in its infancy. But the potential of bitcoin to be the currency of the future is obvious. Bitcoin is an opportunity that will not come around again. It represents enormous untapped potential to revolutionize commerce, finance, technology, and beyond. Just think what the Internet and smartphones did to communications. Let's harness this opportunity.It is impossible to predict when Bitcoin will achieve mainstream status. I think we will see it move from niche to mass-market in the next 10 years. But before we reach that point, I expect many developers to be releasing new coins and variants of bitcoin. But again, they are unlikely to have the mass market appeal of bitcoin.  Hence, the $ 100k price target for bitcoin is probably very conservative and likely to happen. More likely, you will see it rise to a multi-hundred thousand dollar price as the net result of more people using and investing in bitcoin.",

So what worries you is that it won't hit $100k in the future and it's not worth the investment. You should remember that no market goes up forever without falling, current volatility is a regular occurrence in financial markets in general.
