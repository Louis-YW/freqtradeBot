According to forum rules, how to post it is legalBasically if you want to post a job posting in that language then you go ahead and post it on their local: Local > 中文 (Chinese)And using the translate to English feature of my browser, this sub is their flea market: 跳蚤市场But I think you do understand some Chinese characters so if your target and potential hirees are Chinese then go ahead in there and then when you're done, as said by Cantsay given the Service section, you can also post it in English language including all the details of it as many Chinese people also do understand English language and might read that thread you'll post there.",

      "body": "I think you already tried to make one before making this topic. But that Topic of job posting got removed by moderators for violating the board's rules. I think you should convert your Chinese-language job posting ads into English by yourself or with the help of someone else. And then you should post your service offer in the Service section.ServicesService AnnouncementsI hope, you would stay here for longer period of time and could grow. And the only key to success is consistency and being legit all the time. Try not scam other and also try not to get scammed by others too. Welcome on this board!",
