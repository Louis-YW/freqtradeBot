It's clear that they're not afraid of anyone, but it seems like OP thought they were concerned about Ratimov. So, my point was, it's going he was going off-topic because he link the post to DT. Handling this issue should be the responsibility of the moderators, not the DT. (That's what I meant to convey.)",

I think of it as a preemptive strike, and a bit of lazy.If they do start tagging and perhaps they do somehow get some people adding them to their trust list it might become and issue.So, since it seems they are on some sort of bizarre vendetta, give them the ~ and add to ignore and you don't have to worry about it later.Perhaps not the best attitude, but if they do turn out to be a useful member it's simple to remove the ~If they create a mess, then other people may have issues that they did not need to have.Just my view.-Dave",

Ignoring is the best optionYou can guess that this person is very familiar with what happened and is happening on the forum. I'm sure he has a second account from which he writes good posts so as not to stand out and not be accidentally flagged for the play of emotions that he stirs up from another account. This behavior is common among many people. At home, a person presents himself as a dictator, but in society, he is an obedient gray mouse. His attacks on Ratimov are just envy and recognition of himself as the most ordinary mediocrity, rather cowardly, since he does not dare to express everything in person and hides behind a second account.",
