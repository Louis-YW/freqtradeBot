Usually in this kind of scam, the scammers gives you a wallet or exchange that has the 5k btc in it but is locked. And they ask you to pay a fee to unlock the bitcoins. Scammers are only successful with gullible people. Have you asked yourself why would a total stranger want to gift you that huge amount of money? Someone who wants to gift you $5k btc still needs you to send $100 worth of bitcoin. How is that not a scam to you?",

Bitcoin transaction is direct and no condition such purchasin minimum amount just to show up on your wallet. In the future, Always ask for transaction ID for the transfer to guarantee the authenticity of the transfer. All transactions is recorded on blockchain and no one can change that records once it receives 3 confirmation or above to be safe.Use blockchair, mempool and other block explorer to verify all transaction ID and make sure that your Bitcoin wallet address is listed at receiver for the transaction. Keep safe!",

Make sure that no legitimate plan will ask you to send even one dollar in exchange for receiving a larger amount. If the matter were legitimate, then logic says that these fees could be deducted from the amount. Also another point regarding this plan: Didn't you ask the question: Why would someone think of providing you with financial aid without prior knowledge of you personally? All of these are signs that it is a pure scam scheme. Beware of offers that are too good to be true. No one will give you free money.",

If you pay that $100, you have been scammed. Avoid what looks too good to be true and do not expect easy money from anymore, the money that you do not work for. They are just ways scammers use to attract victims to pay them money.Quote from: SatoPrincess on September 29, 2023, 10:07:48 AMI guess they have upgraded the scam a little bit.But there is no upgrade to know a scam.

Why do they pay you 5000 when they cannot deduct it from your balance? Tell them to withdraw the $100 from that balance and send 4900. Believe me, they will block or ignore you. These services are not scam for money but for data, so be careful of phishing messages that may be sent to your email address you registered and do not provide any personal data to them.",

When you encounter offers that seem too good to be true and promises of a large sum of money in exchange for a small upfront payment, consider it a scam. This is what's known as an advance fee scam. A legitimate transaction won't require you to send money in advance to receive money. It's sad to think that cryptocurrency is being used in these ways because of its anonymity, making it difficult to trace. This is indeed the preferred method of use by scammers.",

It has been prevalent much in the fiat stage and has eventually crept up in the crypto space too.The idea is to trigger the would-be victim's greed by the big amount and then tempt their logic that the loss of the teeny weeny amount would be much small since they are getting a huge amount in return. But the second one is never going to happen, nobody is going to send you free money for anything.That 100$ you sent would be the scammed amount. So report that person and move on.",

Again thank you guys.That's good that you've got that gut feel that it was a scam because it was really a scam. Remember that no one is going to give you free money for no reason. And when they ask you to deposit certain amount of money for you to claim it, that's what the scam is. You just can't receive xx amount of money and then you'll have to pay xx amount for you to get it. That's the logic of scam, they're making you feel you're obliged to pay what they're asking for that money out of thin air that's actually just air and there's no money at all.
