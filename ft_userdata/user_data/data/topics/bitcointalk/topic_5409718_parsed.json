Few direct tweets from CZ:https://nitter.net/cz_binance/status/1557117356652085250Quote from: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1557117356652085250Curve. finance had their DNS hijacked in the past hour.Â  Hacker put a malicious contract on the home page.Â  When the victim approved the contract, it would drain the wallet. Damage is around $570k so far. We are monitoring.https://nitter.net/cz_binance/status/1557117359168659463Quote from: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1557117359168659463They use GoDaddy for DNS, which is insecure. No web3 projects should use that. Very susceptible to social engineering.Isn't there was also another cryptocurrency platform/project that got the same DNS hijacking by GoDaddy? I can't recall.https://nitter.net/cz_binance/status/1557956979275988992Quote from: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1557956979275988992Binance froze/recovered $450k of the Curve stolen funds, representing 83%+ of the hack. We are working with LE to return the funds to the users. The hacker kept on sending the funds to Binance in different ways, thinking we can't catch it. ðŸ˜‚#SAFUAnd that is the one where it got mentioned in the article. It is fubar that the attacker keeps repeating the same mistake again and again, well it is surely a good thing, though.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on August 13, 2022, 09:54:05 AMsoon the authority will uncover the identity soon.It might not come easy, it is probable that the attacker is using stolen personal identifications.",

This move by CZ is also a good publicity for Binance at the same time because it will boost there reputation which leads to user increase confidence on using there exchange. I knew CZ is doing this for a long time since the Luna crash occur that start this crypto dump. CZ main goal is too boost crypto market by protecting its user on fraud.",

I wonder what the hacker was thinking doing a direct sale on binance! i soon the authority will uncover the identity soon.With new like these, those hackers will learn not to trust any CEX. I'm not sympathetic to those hackers but with what CEX are doing today, they could actually just accuse someone are then hold the funds with them until they find something to link the funds to.80% is huge. Authorities can never get it without CEX help. Good job for Binance. Little have been said about recovering the funds and who are behind it of course so Binance kept their names private, they only will make it public if necessary.",

They can control and monitor all criminal activities if criminals use their exchange. This is one of the good points of centralized exchange.KYC sometimes they can circumvent the law by buying other KYC accounts but they cannot transfer money out of the exchange.",

Unfortunately I can no longer find the tweet.The conclusion is that every time we make a deposit or withdrawal, we need to pay attention to the address many times and as much as possible ensure the appropriate initial, middle and end digits.
