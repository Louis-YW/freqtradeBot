I was wondering how they could achieve over 100% on ROI just within a short period of time and even after seeing this some greedy fellows will still fall prey of such scheme. Thank you for calling the attention of members here and raising a flag as well. I think that would serve them better as this platform is not a place where such scheme would be promoted such easily with the intention of scamming members of their hard earned resources.",

Now flagging them leads to non-logged in users also noting the big red warning on top and they are immediately cautious about proceeding.Anyway, very little to discuss here because if someone has the ability to make 250% in 10days, they would sink the economy - something that is just not possible. This is why a questioning/scientific mindset will mostly be able to steer clear of such scams.",

In fact any member who got scammed by this site should be tag because why on earth would he go investment with this site knowing too well that it's a pure scam and more of a ponzi scheme rather than investment platform. The only people who could be tempted to go investment in this platform are newbies who don't always want to work or wants to seat their ass in a place to learn and work how the whole system are being operated, this sets of people are easily being carried by greed and selfishness.",

I'm sure they don't just spread on this forum, maybe advertise on other platforms or maybe offer to beginners who don't know what's what, what is clear is that the ponzi scheme is now too classic but somehow there are always those who are trapped by this investment.",

So scammers do not invent anything new, but simply adapt it to today's realities.The secret to the survival and continuation of these Ponzi schemes, from my point of view, is primarily the greed and naivety of investors who want to obtain unreasonable profits over short periods without adequate knowledge and research. All those who fell victim to this scheme imagined it as a treasure chest and viewed it from the outside as if it held a treasure based on the returns promised by the investment plans. However, after they opened this chest, it became clear that it was a trap, and they were wiped out.I hope that investors will get rid of their greed and think things rationally before engaging in any investment. I will now support the flag and report this Ponzi to the domain's registrars. Thank you, OP.",
