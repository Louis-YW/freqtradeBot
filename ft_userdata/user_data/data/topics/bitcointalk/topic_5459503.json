  "content": "Last night I met an old friend who I haven't seen in a long time because he worked overseas for 5 years and dived there we never communicated, and before he went overseas we used to hang out together and I still remember him hating bitcoins . mainly because it's not real and that's how he talked me out of getting involved with bitcoin for fear of being scammed, and also he always booed bitcoin when we met.and at that time i just kept quiet and also nothing changed for me as long as i was involved with bitcoin, and i said look at me a few years later but he has gone overseas. And after a long time we didn't see each other last night he came to my house and I was surprised, and he was also surprised but not because he saw me, but saw my house that had been renovated and also saw several motorbikes and one of them was a big motorbike and I see he hasn't changed.and he straight up asked me what job or business made my circumstances change so drastically, and all i can say is have you forgotten that you used to make fun of me for being involved with bitcoin and trying to keep it away. And I'm just saying this is proof of the results I got with bitcoin and I still have a lot to tell you about the benefits I got from investing in bitcoin and I was able to make it happen and change my life, including the cost of my marriage and the birth of my child. And in the end he apologized to me and he also heard a lot about bitcoin out there but he still wasn't interested.and after we talked at length he finally started to get interested after I told my story when investing in bitcoin, and even though I have a salary from my job, but 90% of everything I have including home renovations results from bitcoin profits and he becomes increasingly interested. But I didn't want to teach it until he asked for it many times, and he came back from abroad for 5 years only bringing money which maybe if I want to compare it with the present profit is much bigger.and he admitted his mistake at that time, but that was also my motivation and I had to prove it and he also felt sorry, because he was not involved with bitcoin at that time and instead mocked him.Do you have the same story, I mean a close person, relative or friend who used to dislike bitcoin, and they became regretful after seeing a significant change after meeting again.",

      "body": "I'm happy for you, op, that you've managed to profit enough from Bitcoin to change your financial circumstances significantly. That not only requires believing in Bitcoin, but also patience not to engage in panic selling.It's also not common to hear people admit that they were wrong and apologize for making fun of one's decisions.I think that in my life people who were against Bitcoin are still against it, but some shifted from being against it to being neutral because they can see that I'm doing okay overall (and they expected me to lose a lot because they thought Bitcoin was a scam). But I haven't done anything impressive yet, anything that would make people change their mind. And also, I don't really care about proving anyone wrong. I'm more focused on my life and my beliefs.",

      "body": "At least at the very end your friend said sorry for mocking you, never judge someone's hustle especially if you don't have any idea on that industry. It's actually good to work abroad if you think you will have a good salary, but working is not enough if you don't have any investment. For sure, you wouldn't last long working whole your life so you need to have investment as much as possible for you to have a secured future. In my case, is to my friend, this part is about NFT since I've also tried investing or minting for a quick flip. I told them the basic knowledge on how you could profit by finding a good project but he kept disagreeing that is not good investment. Which is in my case I'm just having a quick flip here of course I am still hodling. I show him how my $100 turns into $500-$1000 by just clicking. Yeah he was hooked that time but when he's gonna try it, NFT is not a thing already.",

      "body": "The story is not similar to mine. But it is similar to my college teacher. My college teacher invested in Bitcoin around March 2020. My teacher's elder brother did not agree with the investment.  At that time, the exchange rate of Bitcoin was 5 thousand 304.15 decimal dollars.  Then, in November 2021, its price rose to a maximum of $69,000. As a result my teacher earns a lot of money from Bitcoin.  Seeing my teacher's success, his elder brother became interested in investing in Bitcoin. Even I started investing in Bitcoin with the support of my teacher. And will keep investing for a long time. A few days ago, Standard Chartered Bank's foreign currency analyst, Jeff Kendrick, said that the price of Bitcoin may increase by 20 percent to 120,000 dollars.",

Tell him that he should not see price decline as something that should cause panic, that he should continue to hold. DCA at a time like this is good. Investing at a time like this is also good. With what is going on, bulls will wake up by 2024/2025. One of the perfect time to invest is now.",

But not everyone is a diamond hand, maybe he will invest with all of his money when Bitcoin price is $30K. Let's imagine if Bitcoin price slowly declining to $25K, he will ask why Bitcoin price is declining. When Bitcoin price is keep declining to $20K and he have hold for 6 months, he might say you've scammed him.You need to be ready, your friend would be active to communicate with you in terms about Bitcoin price.",

It's even my real brother, not my friends or any outsiders. He was always booing and criticizing me in 2017-2018 when I invested in bitcoin and lost most of my fortune. He always tells me to stay away from scams like bitcoin if I don't want to lose everything. But after the bull season of 2021, I recovered all my losses from 2018, and not stopping there, I made a significant profit.Now I am teaching him little by little everything about the market. But after all, I have learned that it is useless to give advice to others if you do not have any proof. As long as you have proof, you don't need to explain or talk too much to them, what others need is results, not just clichés.",

Then his eyes fall on the change or quantitative value you show. So, let's go back to when you still found Bitcoin quite cheap a few years ago. Right now, your friends are getting interested and trying to invest, but will the results be the same? certainly not. Because the current opportunity is different from the moment when you used to start from scratch.Not a few people I used to meet are now also interested because they see what I have achieved, but that way I can emphasize to them that the type of investment may be the same but the momentum will not come twice. We are in an increased adoption phase.",

They think that Bitcoin is purely a \"scheme\" like a \"project\" like those ICOs you can see around crypto space.Kinda disappointed that there are still close-minded people these days, smh.Quote from: bitzizzix on July 12, 2023, 09:38:56 AMYes, I am also very hesitant to tell this problem.
