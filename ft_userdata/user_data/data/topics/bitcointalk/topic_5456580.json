It is not right to see a newbie account with 2 activity and zero merit advising people in the forum on the right investment to choose while investing in bitcoin especially when making the first post here. Even though you have knowledge of cryptocurrency before finding your way to the forum I think you ought to follow the due process by learning more about the things of the forum instead of teaching things you no nothing about, the forum is a place of learning no one is forcing you to teach things you don't have ideas of so don't worry about wanting to be noticed rather strive to learn faster so you can be noticed when you come out with your quality post.I decided not to include links to some funny post of some newbies because some of them will take it as an insult instead of a motivation and I am open for any correction if I have gone too far trying to encourage them.",

Even though you have knowledge of cryptocurrency before finding your way to the forum I think you ought to follow the due process by learning more about the things of the forum instead of teaching things you no nothing about,It is certainly a good advice to be well knowledgeable before one intends on empowering others with that knowledge because an in-depth understanding of a topic will only lead to spreading of wrong information by the person. But I am also against the idea that you must have some certain number of merits or posts before marking a contribution. When you are actually experienced on a certain topic and you feel the forum needs that advice then it is not bad to create a thread on it even if it is your first post. I will give an example of a member here; PowerGlove, he created the thread on implementation of gotcha with splits keys which was actually is first and was a great addition to the forum. Although the user is quite different. Other members that jump into creating almost meaningless are just after merit fishing and they feel creating threads is the way to that.",

It’s either giving mediocre advise or creating a made up story about Bitcoin that involves their personal life is the common way of newbie nowadays to fish for merit. I’m not saying that this bad too but this newbie is just finding a way to use this for their advantage even if their contribution is not authentic or legit.They are just chasing merits tho.",

Well, it's good, but at the same time, it's wrong, and some people may not find it funny, while others will see it as nothing. But by right, when someone comes on the forum, I think the first thing to do is read through the rules, contribute to other conversations, ask questions where necessary, and maybe create a topic on some past experiences and what they think about them. They could also ask the community what they also think, but coming on the first day to just create a topic like \"how to make money in Bitcoin\" will be a very weird thing.",

Through their contributions,if they are wrong,immediately that person will be corrected and from there they have learnt something. It is easy to contribute on advise of getting merits,because if you have checked all the topics on how to get merits. you will notice that it is the same replies that is given over and over again by different forum members. A newbie can read through posters contribution and from there understand what to write but in his own pattern,because he has seen that it is the same information that is given in different writing. If they only learn without contributing,how will they earn merits. However,some newbies just post off topic to farm for merits because they have known that merits have benefits attached to them.",

That is why they will go online and look for some instructions with the intention of bringing them here for credit and recognition, not realizing that quality engagement in discussion, as well as asking some attractive and essential questions, can gain them some merit.Although some of the beginners are really good and have valuable contributions to the community, they are recommended to stay and learn about the forum before offering all of the tips they believe will be useful.Understanding the forum is essential for success in this forum, as being active will give you the confidence to interact in it.",

I usually encourage some newbies that come up with interesting topics. One of these newbies even confirmed that he has been studying the forum for a long time without even logging in or trying to respond to any post. And from his post content, it was clear he has done a lot of reading.Like OP said some newbies have zero knowledge about what they are talking about and this can be discovered by the content they post. I have seen one that wants to lecture members on how to create quality posts will the post was so badly written. Newbies need to know that until you learn you cannot teach. Some of them are driven by the desire to make their first post and earn some merits. The newbie stage should be a time of reading more and writing less. This forum is like a school that has different levels and until you show that you have learned in your present class you cannot move to the next class. Newbies need consistent learning and patience to succeed on this forum.",

Instead, newbies should learn to improve their own knowledge first and develop their own skills before they become reliable and reputable in sharing what they know to other people.

We shouldn't just picture Who the advice is coming from but what is important is to capture what the content of the advice is, if it is write or wrong. Even in the real life the people who give advice about life and even about marriage does not have or practice what they give to the public. So it doesn't mean that they should be looked down because of what they teach does not work for them, what is just important to just pick up the important information and learn from it.But some beginners still needs to learn first before they give out what will be helpful to other members of the forum, because good knowledge can only be give out by learning. Since the forum is a discussion forum it doesn't restrict newbies from sharing their opinions, it is possible to come across who have not learn enough and want to share their ideas about the little they know, doing this it can also help them to learn more from senior forum users that will correct their wrong ideas",
