  "content": "RociFi has come a long way before appearing before you! 🧐About us: RociFi is the Under-collateralized credit protocol on Polygon, which offers retail borrowers a loan with reduced collateral. The criterion for assessing the user and the possible risk of default is our NFCS credit rating (which analyzes the user's activity in several EVM networks, taking into account his history and interactions with other credit platforms). We also have our own logic of machine learning and analysis of fraudulent behavior. Right now, we're only working with USDC and WETH as collateral, but new types of collateral and stable pools will be added to V2. Today we can offer 70% - 85% - 110% collateral when applying for a loan if the user has a sufficient score, but as we develop we plan to reduce the collateral in the first pool to zero.  Reputation in the network is already playing a huge role, and in a few years it will be the best indicator of solvency! This is a completely different credit etiquette with liquidation blocking and other benefits for the user... Seed: RociFi raised $2.7M from the following funds and campaigns: Arrington XRP Capital, Golden Three, Block Venture, NEXO, LD Capital, Signum Capital, SCC investments, Skynet Trading.Testnet: We completed the 2 phases of the testnet, after the first phase there were two audits from Chainsulting and Certik. We eliminated the vulnerabilities found and tested them in the second phase of the testnet.Mainnet: On July 28, we launched in the Polygon network and have been working steadily for more than 3 months! Immediately after the launch, a bug-finding campaign was held on Immunedefi! During this time, we have minted more than 22,2k NFCS and issued more than 3,3k loans (More than 1,3k of whom were under-collateralized), TVL ~100k. We are partners of CyberConnect and Polygon DAO and have already integrated our NFCS into their dApp.  The development of the ecosystem for NFCS is a primary goal, as other projects can get deeper into their audience to the NFCS API and conduct more targeted Airdrops, waitlists, and analyze how authoritative the wallet address interacting with their contract is.WEB: https://roci.fi DAPP: https://roci.fi/app/marketsJoin the RociFi community:Twitter Discord Telegram Docs Blog Github Link3",
