And the question is: \"what will happen to your account when you passed away ?\"Will you pass it on to your children? (Is it legal in this forum ?)Or will everything end there?Then  Can't we see the good deeds from these big reputed people's account?",

You are also not wrong that people should not see this as a permanent means of earning.",

Rather than do a thing like that, if your children are somewhat interested in Bitcoin like you said, then let them register on the forum and join in the discussions about Bitcoin and other whatnots that go on here. There are more important things i'd worry about passing down to my children than my account. This thread should be in meta in my opinion.",

For instance if the forum was like YouTube that keep paying for the contents you have created until the earning privilege is disabled them you this discussion would had been useful bit since it isn't the discussion become useless.If you have business hosted on the forum that can be actually passed down to your kids then don't restrict them to just your account, excluding that and you're just relying on the signature/bounty campaigns earnings then go get a life.

Let me give you a picture. Imagine you are living in the gold rush period and searching for gold in some backwater of the Wild West. Well, I bet for some members this forum is like they discovered gold, and it is new territory for them. Everyone is rushing around trying to get some! What if you could leave your gold mine to your children in the event of your untimely demise? That would be nice, right?",

Usually DT just give a neutral feedback for change of ownership to mark that the account change hands. You call it internal hence, the status to this transfer is most likely to be unknown so, how how the DTs go ahead to find out and proceed with a trust feedback. Of course the post quality might change but that's not enough reason still.The truth is, one's reputation doesn't proceed another and as such, they can't or shouldn't be traded, neither can it be transfered fron persons to persons. Best option would always remain that the account be left alone and if your completely sure your never going to be back, you could notify the forum in a thread on the reputation board and lay it to rest.",

If I or someone else would sell my account, it would betray my memory and reputation, and also reflect negatively on the forum - after all we assume that users that we interacted with all these years are the same, and not different people who only post to make money.
