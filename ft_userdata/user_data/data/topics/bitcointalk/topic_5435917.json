  "content": "Governments and countries around the world are working hard to implement CBDC as fast as they can and they are getting serious about it.I won't name all individual examples but I will post one website who is keeping track of all worldwide news and status for most countries.There is currently WEF forum in Davos and they are advertising CBDC currencies that are going to be protected by Interpol, and in same time they announce catastrophic cyber attack, removal of cash payments, and concern about Bitcoin One website for tracking CBDC projects is called Cbdctracker and it is showing world map of countries with more information: https://cbdctracker.org/One more CBDC tracker posted by tbct_mt2:https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/What can you do about this?You can write your local politicians, complain, call them, visit them and demand from them to stop working on CBDC crap.I also found interesting project called @NoCBDC that created cool stickers that are pro Bitcoin and anti-CBDC in the same time.You can print out this stickers, share them in your local areas, send them to friends and spread the word while we have time, or you will wake up in nightmare scenario one day.Bitcoin vs CBDC - What should digital money look like?https://bitcoin.rocks/bitcoin-vs-cbdcPrint or make your own stickers and follow @NoCBDC on twitter:https://www.dropbox.com/s/rr5jea5n35fqybl/%40NOCBDC%20sticker%20sheet.pdf?dl=0",

The interesting point is even if governments lie, they still promote blockchain technology.CBDCs will contribute to blockchain adoption in generally by exposing more people to that technology.",

The desire of governments to control our lives is obvious in many countries and anyone who is yet to come to that realization would not do so cause of some sticker.We cannot boo away CBDCs or sign petitions against it, we can only avoid it and stick to decentralized medium of exchange on the blockchain. And hope others would follow suit.- Jay -",

Politicians rely on the ignorance of the citizens to pass laws they want which will favour them and their groups on long run, without any kind of uprisings from the people. The conscious minority who protests is just going to be ignored by politicians, since they don't really their votes to be elected. If the three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) want to approve CBDC, they are going to do this here without any setbacks.I hope in your countries you have more luck fighting it back.",

All the mainstream politicians have been bought already and will do what their masters tell them to do. This total control thing has been set in motion long time ago and I don't think that anything/anyone can stop it, expect maybe nuclear holocaust that would reset the things.Maybe this is true, but I certainly won't give up easy and follow all their crazy future scenarios, because they need 100% of people to participate for this crap to work.Their plan won't work even if 10% of people reject this change and make up their own economy outside the narrative of WEF and their operators, maybe with Bitcoin, produce, salt, food, and everything else people used to trade before.I never had negative frame of mind despite all the dark scenarios and prognosis, but people are wrong if think they will be able to use Bitcoin normally after this creeps introduce CBDC to all countries.",

They also don't want to get rid of all their rich banker friends, so there's still a role for traditional bank accounts in their plans. And they want to add the ultimate control to their token.But none of it matters. It's just another form of inflationary fiat money, controlled by unelected people. Same old, same old.",
