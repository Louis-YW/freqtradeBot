Block Size Limit Controversy was a byproduct of this. This gave us multiple BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) by multiple experts. Below is a consolidated list of those all...BIP 100 by Jeff Garzik, Tom Harding & Dagur Valberg JohannssonBIP 101 by Gavin AndresenBIP 102 by Jeff GarzikBIP 103 by Pieter WuilleBIP 104 by t.khanBIP 105 by BtcDrakBIP 106 by Upal ChakrabortyBIP 107 by Washington Y. SanchezBIP 109 by Gavin AndresenOut of all these, I have always voiced in favor of BIP 106 on BitcoinTalk. Second part of the proposal, i.e. Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee collected by miners, has always seemed most practical & effective to me.Now, as almost 8 years have passed and the scaling issue is still daunting us, what do you think about this proposal?",

As the subsidy is reduced, fees become more important. So at some point, full blocks will be necessary in order to ensure that the revenue is high enough to discourage a 51% attack.Changes that attempt to prevent full blocks would directly impact the security of Bitcoin.This is a very valid point, from a long-term perspective. It's true that once the block reward will be low, if the fees were low, we could see a decrease of the global network's hashrate - even if a 51% attack is difficult to consider today (because of 358.2 EH/s and the biggest pool -Foundry- \"only\" own 35% of the hashrate) doesn't means that it won't be possible in the middle/long term. So yeah, as I understand, with BIP 106 you remove the mempool's congestion problems, but replace them with a potential problem linked to fees that are too low, and therefore to a mining income that is potentially too low to ensure the network's security. Are there any other points that would make this proposal negative for the network?",

      "body": "Of course those who write that blocks must be often full for fees to be able to become a substantial part of miners' income are right. Nevertheless, I could imagine a variant of the dynamic block concept which could even guarantee a higher grade of security than the \"flat\" scheme.Some considerations:1) First, it's useful to define a \"goal\" of the algorithm. What do we want? Do we want to reduce fees? Or do we also want to guarantee an income from fees to miners and make spam expensive? I think the goal should be to find values where both goals can be satisfied to a certain degree.2) So we could approximate to our goal: We could say that we want blocks to be full enough to make spam expensive, but also that we don't want to reduce demand (harming adoption and thus, the price and market cap) that Bitcoin's competitive position with respect to altcoins becomes worse, because in this case, Bitcoin's position as \"the most secure one of all PoW coins\" could be endangered and miners could switch to other coins. (As for the altcoin competition, I'm not thinking about coins like ETH or BNB which are clearly another kind of asset targeted to another public. But we could imagine a coin as decentralized as Bitcoin, maybe even an 1:1 copy, which could threaten to compete for that position).3) As a consequence of 1) and 2), 100% full blocks would not be the ideal situation, but for example, an average of 98%, so fees can rise for some time in a demand spike, but if demand grows sustainably, then the fees should not increase so much that we won't risk to lose users (the well known \"only banks use Bitcoin\" scenario which was brought up to death by big blockers in the block size war). This 98% value is only an example, this should of course be investigated empirically. But the 90% mentioned in BIP 106 may be too low.4) We can thus fine-tune the algorithm so its \"goal\" becomes blocks are always, on average, 98% full. If the average is > 98% in a whole difficulty period, in the next difficulty period of 2016 blocks the block size limit could be increased a minuscule bit (e.g. by 0,1%), but not too much - we would otherwise risk blocks not becoming \"full enough\". And if it's < 98%, then the maximum block size would shrink.As a result, we would get an algorithm which can make blocks grow or shrink with demand, but slowly enough that the fee market is never in danger. Fees would probably become quite predictable, much more than with a static block size.I however don't know if such an algorithm realy \"is worth it\". It would bring much more complexity into the incentive model. But in a future situation where demand for block space really grows strong and sustainably (without spam being an issue), I think it should be allowed to think about such a model.",

Then, you can start producing some next block, on top of what you created, while other block creators will try to validate what you submitted.You appear to assume that other miners will wait to finish validating your new block before they start mining on top of it. That's not a safe assumption.Many (most?) miners will instead just assume that the new block is valid (expending so much effort on producing an illegal block is stupid and exceedingly rare) and immediately start mining on top with an empty block, while validating in parallel. Once validation completes they can then continue mining with a non-empty block on top.",

      "body": "Quote4% of total transactionsYou don't know \"the\" total transactions. You know \"a\" total transactions, because there is no \"the\" mempool, but there are many mempools, and each node has its own. I can generate 1 TB mempool using any deterministic algorithm, and then say \"we need 40 GB blocks now, because of 4% rule\".Quotenumbers are only for exampleIt doesn't matter, because if it would be any percentage, then it can be always bypassed by locally generating a lot of transactions.QuoteOverall, I don't see anything wrong with if we increase current block size.What about Initial Block Download? You can always decrease block size, but you cannot forget the history. It is always needed to create new nodes, unless you start making backward-incompatible changes. Note that if everyone will switch to pruned mode, then nobody can create a new node, because then there is nobody to connect to. You cannot sync trustlessly from a pruned node.QuoteIt's not expensive to run node today even if we double or triple block size and the demand isn't similar to the demand of 2010's.Total blockchain size is only getting worse. Improvements in technology didn't make verification much faster, creating a new full node often took me something around a week. If you have around 500 GB of history to verify, it will still take a lot of time, even if some soft-fork will now force to include nothing else than the coinbase transaction.QuoteThat's why they move on altcoins.Ideally, we should have sidechains for such things. Then, it could be possible to peg-in, create a lot of history, and then peg-out, finalize it on-chain, and drop everything what happened on some second layer, because it is then not needed for Initial Blockchain Download, and sidechain users don't need sidechain history for things that happened before their coins were pegged in (exactly in the same way as LN users can only store things since their channel was open, and they don't need all in-the-middle transactions from all other LN channels).QuoteThat doesn't make sense, unless such miner/pool have goal to bloat Bitcoin blockchain.We should assume that there will be some bad actors, always producing as large blocks as possible. We had times with congested mempool, including everything \"as is\" will not solve anything. It will only make Initial Blockchain Download longer, and people will still produce bigger and bigger blocks.QuoteWith such long verification time, it would hinder propagation where other miner could beat you since their block is far faster to be verified and propagated even though they mined it few seconds to minutes after you did.Even if some big block will not end up in the main chain, many nodes will still waste a lot of time trying to verify it. So, that way or another, there will still be some \"guessing time\", unless you introduce some protections, like \"after spending one minute on verification, stop it, and try another block\", but then any such protection will put some artificial limit on block size, just not measured in bytes, but maybe in seconds instead (and then many machines will allow different blocks, based on their computational speed, so you will then never know, how many machines accepted some block or not).Quoteexpending so much effort on producing an illegal block is stupid and exceedingly rareSometimes it is more common than you may think. For example, some mining pools have problems with counting sigops. And then, it is just another attack vector: if you know that there are some such pools, then you can create transactions with a lot of sigops, and broadcast them. Those transactions alone will be valid, and even included in other blocks, but some pool may produce a block that violates this rule.And then, the question is: how you can check if sigops rule is violated or not, without checking the whole block? If you start mining on top of not-yet-validated block, then there is a risk that finally, one of those tricky rules will mark it as invalid, and then you will waste your coinbase-only block.",
