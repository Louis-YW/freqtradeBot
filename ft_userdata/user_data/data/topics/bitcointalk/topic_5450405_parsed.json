It says max 1000 but I see one with serial above 1000I probably should put together a list of all my pieces. There are many, but for 2023 it looks like this.....Silver prototypes Â  Â 0001-0050Brass 10K Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 0051-0999 Â reserved through 0999Copper 125k Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 1000-1999 Â reserved through 1999 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  This hologram will be retired after holo #3000. I will come out with a new one after that and make any improvements if needed. If I need to make more brass 10k sat pieces, I will start them again with Hologram #2000  Fractional silver pieces will be coming soon and those will have different holos due to the size. doing a collaboration with another maker.

The latter would be too steep for me for just one 1oz of copper.Thanks! You should always save money if you buy in bulk. I have tubes of 15. Buying in tubes of 15 saves me 5 hours of work, which will save you money. : The price isn't steep though. Name one physical crypto bar on the market that you can get fully funded on monetary metal for a better price? These are under $100. The rest is just funding and shipping cost. I buy redeemed round alt pieces for more Â . But the answer to your question is Yes. I can lower the price if you buy a tube. Â PM for bulk pricing.",

I actually may be able to give you some pointers on how to make your own COBs. I've made some out of silver before its not too difficult with the right tools. I think you're onto something there m8, it really fits your theme too. Having the feel of a genuine shipwrecked silver piece or x marks the spot buried treasure. Not the same style of an 8 reale i'm guessing or gold escudo but something with the antiqued finish that you can hold would be a great change up from the plastic coin cases we are utterly scared of even opening in fear of ruining or damaging any coins.
