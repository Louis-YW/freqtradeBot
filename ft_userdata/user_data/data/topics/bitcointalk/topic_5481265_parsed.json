I see Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) performed very well in 2023... going up with 257.2% ....so imagine what will happens with the ETFs that were approved now.  In the long run we will have very good and strong results for bitcoins in terms of price and adoption, however many people were speculating that we may have a big pump right after the ETF approval news. That did not happen and many people are disappointed because of this. Many people see things in short term and this price behaviour of bitcoin may have disappointed them.I think the ETF approval was already priced in, even before the approval and now we may see gradually increase in the price of bitcoin as companies and people will invest in the Bitcoin ETFs.",
