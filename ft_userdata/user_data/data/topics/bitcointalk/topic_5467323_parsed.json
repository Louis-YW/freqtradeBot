      "body": "The reading is very good, normally a person cannot understand quickly what is said here if it is relatively new, I think I would use more colloquial words where it is not so technical, because I gave that reading to a friend and he told me that he did not understand anything Of course, it's not his person who plays a lot, he. He is only in the casino betting and betting without looking for other things, sometimes he makes sports bets, usually he is a person who lives by working but on the weekends he gives them to the online casinos, mostly making bets on football, But in football like the World Cup qualifiers, the Euro or something like that, he's a person who likes to make a lot of bets, it doesn't matter if they're crazy, but I've seen that he loses a lot and it doesn't make me happy. case, that's why when I saw this thread, I sent him the link to the reading, I think it's always good to put in evidence that for everything there is always an apparent risk, we cannot say that every bet is meaningless if there is no money involved, always There will be money involved to make it more exciting.So these types of things are what normally we as people must understand, for me it has helped me a lot, but above all it is a reading focused on novices, on those who are at risk of falling into addiction so that they can emerge vicotierously from those who are already in that problem, there is something that here at elforko is worrying me, it is addiction, I have seen that there is a lot of relevance in the issues that refer to addiction and it is something delicate, it is something that should not be taken at face value. light, that you should seek help immediately, to be able to get out of that, and personally I have always thought that things have to be done well, always try to do good for others, in which one can help others I think that that It is the best reward one could receive, helping someone avoid crazy things, that is what I would mostly do.",

      "body": "I agree with the first point, even though half a unit is still a lot for some gamblers because it depends on how much you divide your bankroll. Going smaller is recommended as long as the minimum bet limit allows it.The second point is difficult for a bettor like me who always prefers to go with the favorites. My alternative is going for teasers since I sometimes see other bettors recommend a few good underdog spreads worth taking and consistently covering when you put them under a teaser. If teasers aren't available, i'd look for the alt spread and parlay from there because there are times when the odds are better with parlays.",

This made me remember an unusual gambler who would bet a small chunk of their balance to round it up or down.One part that's missing from the guide is taking advantage of hedging through live bets. It might not be the best move for gamblers because it's -EV, but it doesn't hurt to cash these small bets out to secure a good chunk of profits.",
