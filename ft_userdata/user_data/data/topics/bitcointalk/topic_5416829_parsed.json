      "body": "You mean to tell you his trading position, not trading pair. Why not just go for copy trading? Know that you do not have to pay anybody for it. Anyone that says you should pay only want to scam you. In copy trading, know that a trader you think is good may have losses and it may not favour you, but just a good option for newbie traders. The best is to learn trading, use the amount of money you can afford to lose until you know that you are very good at it, which could take months 1 or 2  years.Using copy trading, you will be charged some percentage if the trader you are automatically copying trading from is making you to money from trading. Just that copy trading is the best you can do, but I do not recommend it.Avoid anyone that PM you, they only want to scam you.",

The reason I wouldn't mention their accounts is they're not a trustworthy user and there's no guarantee if their signal are correct. They just post random prediction on their channel, if the prediction is correct they wouldn't delete their post, while it's gone wrong, they can easily delete it to hide their mistake.If you want to trade, trade yourself with your skill, otherwise don't trade.",

I can't find these people Then you have a big problem, because if you can't find \"those people\", then you are definitely not ready to recognize if someone is legitimate or if they are setting a trap for you. Successful traders do not share their advice publicly but focus on their goals, and some indicators say that only about 5% of people who trade make a profit.If you are already going on such adventures, follow at least one rule - invest only as much money as you are ready to lose. Most people learn from mistakes, it's just a question of how expensive those mistakes are.",

All you need to do is to register on exchanges that support copy trading.Like on Binance, after registering, click on future (future trading), on top you will see the future derivative types like UST-M, Coin-M and option trading. Beside option trading, you will see leaderboard. Click on leaderboard and click on Tradingwagon and follow the remaing setup. But know that the trader you are following may also lose, you have to be careful. Use low leverage too.My best advice would be that you should learn how to trade though and never depend on anyone.",

You certainly know the type of Copytrade platform that will find many traders who share the results of their trading plans that can be followed and copied to join the trade and benefit from the results of the copy trading. Pretty easy isn't it? But about the risk of loss of course there is. You just have to choose a trader who has good recommendations and a high level of trading success. The famous Copytrade platform is Etoro which has been widely used by professional traders and several other copytrade platforms such as BingX, Bityard, Bybit, CopyMe etc. Some of the people registered in the copytrade are professionals and already have a lot of experience, it can be seen from the trading history and how much profit and loss they make. The use of copytrade is only an alternative for those who do not have full time to do analysis, this is only optional, you don't have to use it, just according to your needs.A good trader will indeed teach us how to fish, not give us fish. We are only given the bait and they will execute it.",

Always try to learn how to trade yourself by consulting people who you know that they have good knowledge about it, and by also reading some books on trading strategies and gradually you make improve.So don't be so eager to make it because cryptocurrency need patience always but are not patient you end up in hand of scammers.",

For me, I prefer most individuals with a particular need to trade but have no experience to just buy coin and hold for a long time while trying trading on a demo mode. It will serve you better other than having trier and fail experience as that would be you losing money and loosing faith in trading as the case always is after several failed attempts.The other sides to this is that, there might be a get out strategy or a plan B that wasn't shared and even if it were to be shared, you might not be active to receive it. Other issues could range from proper time to use the shared signals, your account size in comparison with the signal source and more of those. As your account size could determine how long you can stay in the market while waiting on a bad trade to reverse. You might not have that luxury as per account size but, the signaler just might.Just to add, sourcing out of this and being ready to pay could get you scammed. Exercise caution.",
