  "content": "What is the reason for the increase in the price of Bitcoin?The Federal Reserve is adding another $300 billion to their economy.  This is basically one of the main reasons behind the increase in the price of Bitcoin.  This news has affected the prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies everywhere.  In this regard, market researcher Holzer said, the central bank has added a lot of dollars to the economy, so the market is seeing so much growth all around.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank was the reason why the Federal Reserve decided to inject dollars into the economy on an emergency basis.  Banks borrowed about $150 billion from the Federal Reserve, the highest since the 2008 global recession.Adding dollars to the economy is not new, nor is it the first time that banks lend dollars at low interest rates.  During Corona in 2020 the Federal Reserve added dollars to their economy after which we saw Bitcoin rise from less than $4000 to almost $7000.  Many believe that the US will add more dollars to its economy in the coming days, which could push the price of Bitcoin to new highs.The former CEO of Bitmex said that the more currencies are added to the global economy, the more likely the price of Bitcoin will rise.  But the central banks of China and Japan are doing exactly the same thing as the Federal Reserve.Thanks Guyes.",

The collapse of 2 banks and FED injected more money in this year had no relation with the sudden pump of Bitcoin price. FED prints new money will make the value of the dollars decreased, but it doesn't mean it will increase Bitcoin price.[1] https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/13/21178457/1-5-trillion-stimulus-loan-fed-federal-reserve",

It is a common story in the past 3 years and not new with us.Do you think why Bitcoin rose to $69k because of money printing, assume it is true. Do you think why it fell from $69k to $16k, because of same reason money printing?Now you turned to think that it is rising and will rise more because of money printing.Is any logic in your thinking?",

These are the two injections that we're having to the market but that doesn't mean that bitcoin is solely reliant on it. These can't be avoided and it's them, the FED and US government that's deciding on this one. While the impact of it is really being felt by most of us, we're not just abiding with the negativity of it but as well as the beneficial part for bitcoin and the whole crypto market.",

Who knows, though, what is really driving the pressure to buy. I haven't noticed any significant good news, but it appears like Bitcoin simply started pumping up. But I agree with the OP that if money were actually injected into the economy, the amount of fiat in circulation might have increased. As a result, fiat is also being injected into bitcoin.

I believe the next bull market will begin this year and BTC will reach its ATH next year.It's still due at q2 2024 so I think that's probably not the reason but overtime that's what we're believing in. I'd say 2024 it may start and then reaching new highs will be at 2025 but yeah lot of more room to grow the next year, so it's not impossible to reach new heights. Not to be overshadowed by that narrative but in the long term it's really profitable if you have patience.",

But the one I know is when more buyers storm the crypto space then the price would increase and when more people sell the price will come down or decrease. From Economics analysis approach, FED injection of dollars to the system has nothing to do with the increase of bitcoin, yes there is a supportive hand to some extent but it is not because of the injection that make the rise of bitcoin. This has been predicted since last year that bitcoin will go up this and it will not be the ATH. The ATH will be in the year 2024 and 2025. So as for the increased not bitcoin in thus year is not a surprise to me. I was expecting it so I am okay well inform on it.",

If anything, it only ever lowers the value of the dollar down, not increasing the value of bitcoin. You can't attribute bitcoin's increase in value to the halving too, coz that's not due until 2024, and frankly put, no one's that giddy to wait for a couple more months when things aren't as appealing in the real world anymore. Simply put, we don't have a single idea why bitcoin is increasing in value, it could very well be previous SVB consumers and clients injecting what was left of their money onto bitcoin in hopes of recovering from the losses, it could be other things, and we can't stay thankful for bitcoin's increase since we don't know if it's sustainable yet considering how bleak the situation in the outside market is.",
