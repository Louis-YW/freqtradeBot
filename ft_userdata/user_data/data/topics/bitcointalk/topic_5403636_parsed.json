  "content": "Biden seems hell bent on trying to destroy America's financial situation over this pandemic.  He's already setting the stage for asking for more money for the next pandemic.  This while inflation from the last round of money printing is still heating up and the government doing everything they can to force a recession to artificially lower prices.  https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-says-there-will-be-another-pandemic/vi-AAYJKMG?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=4499a6570d9c484eb4d55e11b41c35ce\"We don't just need more money for vaccines for children...\"It absolutely sickens me...  While the country is experiencing one of the worst inflationary crisis in history, Biden is focusing on injecting 2 year olds with a vaccine that has proven to be 1% effective, has harmful side effects, reduces their future immunity over natural infection, and is unnecessary for healthy people under the age of 50.  Heartbreaking for our country, our children, and our future.",

      "body": "There is no way the recession can be reversed so what they can do is continue to find excuses and ways to portray the current events as an outcome of the global health crisis rather than the outcome of their own actions from within the last years, even decades.Problem is, this whole crisis is going to drop through our roof like a domino and I expect the WORST decisions to be taken during it.  I imagine they are going to do just anything to make sure citizens will not see them as the bad guys.  They do not want their asses beaten up so they would do whatever works to make the public lose focus.Things are going to be so much worse than a pandemic.  If this beast of a crisis rolls out in full force, we will see a disaster at a much higher scale than the pandemic was.As for the vaccine, I acknowledge and respect your opinion but to be honest with you, I will rather abstain from commenting my own view.  I found that nowadays you can not have an opinion unless it fits the general public's or mainstream media's.  So, to each their own.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "the recession was inevitable.. covid was just the excuse to blame it onwhats happening now is they want to pre-buy things now.. so that when its time to repay, the loan clawback is cheapimagine you had a $200k loan which at todays value is 100k loaves of breadwith a fixed rate meaning in 10 years you have to pay back $250k(doesnt matter how many loaves it equals)you buy a house.however inflation occurs.a loaf of bread becomes $5 but your loan contract still only wants $250know you only have to pay back 50k loaves of bread value. meaning you got a house half priceand now the house value is $500k...so thats what governments are doing. creating large QE(loans) building stockpiles/infrastructure now.. and when its time to paydown/clawback the money.. the real life cost comparative means what they pay back is cheapjust remember when they say debt is x trillion.. in decades time that x trillion might be just a few loaves of bread...here in the UK its the same thing in the last two years there has been a push to upgrade family doctors clinics(GP surgery) lots of diagnostics centres and genetic labs. new MRI and Xray centres, etcbecause when its time to repay the loans in 10 years. the real world cost equivalent/comparative value. of the money they have to hand back is cheap/discount.if you could get a loan to make a bread factory that cost a billion loaves of bread to make a billion loaves of bread, this year(if there was no inflation).... but due to inflation in 10 years you only had to hand back 200million loaves of bread instead. wouldnt you take that deal.the only concern i have is for the poor folk on minimum wage. i do hope that governments raise minimum wage just as fast as inflation to match and beat inflation",
