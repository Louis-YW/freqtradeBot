Imagine that during a financial meltdown there is a cascade of banks failing and closing. What would happen to the bitcoin price? Would it rise because of hyperinflation or would it crash because there is no liquidity to enter the markets?I have tried so hard to picture what the implications of banks and the global monetary system failing will be, the only answer making sense now is trade by barter. But is this possible in the present time given the explosive population of the world? On the role of Bitcoin in a time like that, well, there is no way Bitcoin will completely replace fiat because we are still far from mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, the bottlenecks such as high fees, congestion such as we have seen of recent and many others are still there. However,  Bitcoin price will be so high because people will prefer to keep their money in Bitcoin rather than the banks at least until there is some stability within the banking system.",

I believe we will never return to the barter system, and if the fiat system collapses then the system that might be implemented is digital currency or cryptocurrency.I'm not sure bitcoin is an alternative to replace fiat system, but if the fiat system collapses and is replaced by digital currency or cryptocurrency then bitcoin will have a positive impact because of it. So let's find out what the global elite has planned for new world order",

      "body": "Well, if we consider that Bitcoin mostly has been some correlation with the price of the stocks of the United States (specially those related to the technological sector) then it would be fair to assume that in the event of a major economical collapse in the United States of America, the price of Bitcoin would drop (together with the price of the stock market) but it would soon recover because people will try to find alternatives to safeguard their money away from the failed banking system which has collapsed. It is interesting the fact you mention there is not going to be a wide bail out similar to that one we saw back in the 2008, because this last year the feredal goverment was not willing to offer a bail out to those banks who suddenly ran out of funds, like the Silicon Valley Bank. President Biden was shift to day the clients of the bank would get their money back, but the bank itself would close down. Perhaps it is an anticipation or a clue on how the Federal government of the USA has changed their attitude towards banks and their imminent clousure when they do not do things right. Though, I doubt they would deny a second bail out to the banks in the case of another crisis, it would be in the detriment of the trust of American banking and the system of private Banking in that country. Not much to gain by allowing it to happen, in my opinion.",

      "body": "If it happened soon, like in the next decade or so, I think Bitcoin price would collapse because market participants would be too scared and would be trying to pull money out of everything. They'd be trying to move money as quick as they can to their bank account and then withdraw it for cash if the banks are failing. Because to the vast majority of people Bitcoin is still just some risky tech stock, that's literally what they think it is. Hell I still see articles online where it is referred to as a \"stock\" lol.Another 10 years beyond that though, and Bitcoin might be trusted enough that so that maybe there would be an initial crash but then people would be moving whatever money they could to bitcoin very quickly.Basically once the education of the general public is such that people understand what Bitcoin actually is, so that the narrative switches from \"risky tech investment\" to \"hard money, like gold but much better\", that's the point at which I think Bitcoin would ultimately do well in a major global monetary collapse. But yeah I'd put that state of Bitcoin acceptance at probably 20 years from now, maybe longer.",

Several things may happens and it all depends on the reactions of the financial sector and people.  If the financial sector and people put their eyes or attention on Bitcoin and shift their activity to taking advantage of the Bitcoin market and features, surely, the price of Bitcoin will surge since there will be more users and demands for the Bitcoin market.  But if the financial sector and people focus their attention on somewhere else, even with the banks and many other financial institutions collapse, it won't have any effect on the Bitcoin market because the money or funds that naturally flows on the banking sector is put on something else and not on the Bitcoin market.The financial meltdown that makes banks fail and close does not automatically means that people will shift to BTC since there are many options to chose.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on January 28, 2024, 12:24:00 AMWould it rise because of hyperinflation or would it crash because there is no liquidity to enter the markets?As I stated it depends on how people react to the situation.  Bitcoin will surge if they make Bitcoin as an alternative else different results will happen.",

There are 2 possible scenarios here: bitcoin will also collapse, bitcoin will rapidly increase. Based on these estimated forecasts, you can choose the appropriate investment behavior model for yourself. Or place a bet on bitcoin and accumulate as much as you can, thanks to which you will be in profit. Or, get rid of bitcoin, because the global crisis will also reduce the cost of your investments.",
