Trading turns some people into depression as they continue to trade and continue to lose money. Trading can be good if gotten appropriately, but many traders are losing. If you can be patient and not in rush to make money and learn about trading very well with small amount of money, you can get it right, but know that trading can cause loss of money than mining.",

Don't trust cloud mining, it's scam.Bitcoin trading require skill too if you're want to make money everyday, you can do short term trade by buy low and sell high, but it may take after 3 days, a weak, a month depends on the market.

As for mining it is not that profitable for an individual like the early days, you need special mining equipment like ASIC which are more expensive than the GPU used in the early days. So with more miners in the mining business today having a less expensive equipments isn’t profitable, that is why most People join cloud mining but still the percentage profits is not that high. Also mining requires electricity so you might have to look for a place that actually charges less for electricity. And if you are in a country that is actually against mining or bitcoin itself then it becomes a big risk to mine there as you could get caught. As for trading it also requires capital but the biggest challenge is having its knowledge. You need extensive knowledge about how stuffs like spot, leverage and future trading works. Also about financial managements. One risk about trading again is having to put your coins on centralized exchanges because they have more features in trading than the decentralized exchanges. The easiest way to earn in bitcoin without much risk is to buy and hold.",

On the other hand, trading platform is a very risky business. You can easily earn money from trading, but your chances of losing money are high in trading platform. Still if you can master the trading from the trading platform then you can earn money from it. You can't make money from trading platform very easily, to make money here you need to be very knowledgeable, be patient, avoid greed, have strategy, then you can make money from trading. Finally I can say that mining is much more profitable than trading. You can get hurt from trading but you can't get hurt from mining.",

Except you're fine to sell at lose.With knowledge, mining becomes simple. With knowledge, trading can be a way to lose money. Mining is better. Trading is good if it is done in a professional way, but most people learn but did not become professional, they will trade and lose. I too will prefer holding bitcoin, but the time for profit may take time, unlike mining. If you have good and cheap electricity, mining will be the best. But in a time like this when bitcoin price is low, investing is good too.Quote from: Zaguru12 on May 17, 2023, 10:58:32 AMAs for trading it also requires capital but the biggest challenge is having its knowledge.

But losses can be what that will happen because trading is very risky.Good traders should just trade without leverage. Leveraging is only for special times, like when the price of bitcoin has decreased significantly. The leverage should not be too high. 5x is getting too high.",

And you also need big funds to spend on maintenance so think about if you can afford all of this although I can't give any figures but you cam do a research on this.Trading you can start up using small amount but you also need some time to spend on researching since you need to get updated on the current events on crypto space. Also to many things need to learn especially on your emotional aspect so try to do some trades and you will understand how difficult to execute this especially the market is so unpredictable.",

      "body": "Since there are factors to consider before venturing into mining industry it will be safer for you to first go through all the stuffs required to start mining and calculate the cost of them if it's something that's affordable for you or not. Remember you can't just use any laptop or desktop to mine Bitcoin, mining Bitcoin requires ASIC which will also cost you some money and the electricity you're going to use will still be a problem for you if it's not stable and also if the cost of electricity is expensive in your location.Trading Bitcoin might be profitable but you'll still have to acquire knowledge of trading before you can successfully make it big in trading, which is not going to happen overnight and will also require your time and commitment to learn.What I'm trying to say is if you want to earn well in crypto you'll have to go through some process but if you don't have any knowledge whatsoever then you can consider buying and Hodling Bitcoin for long term.",

Mining requires a lot more than initial capital because it involves plenty money to be able to sustain and keep your mining profitable. As a newbie you may not need to be in a hurry to start any of them, just buying and keeping it can be good for you, but since you are in a hurry, you may feel that that is too slow.

Investing has no stress involved, you'll just have to buy your Bitcoin and hold. After it gets to your targetted price you sell and either reinvest the profits or do with it as you please. Both mining and trading are good means to keep the cash flow coming but I strongly recommended you shouldn't be much interested in cash flow at the moment. If you still want an answer between your options then I'll favour trading to mining. Starting up a mining farm is very costly that if you had invested that money into your trading account you would probably make more profits trading then mining (this can only be possible when you're good at trading). If you don't know how to trade then don't go for trading unless you're okay with learning before you start.",
