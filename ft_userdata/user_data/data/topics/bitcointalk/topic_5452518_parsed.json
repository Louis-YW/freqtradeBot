Anything you know or think will get your account into trouble just try to avoid it and in this case \"add the source link\" it's not going to take you more than 3 minutes to copy and paste the link.",

What comes out of a human brain and that of a machine are not the same ideas. AI-generated text can easily be identified and, at the same time, can be off-point in most cases. In this forum, information is considered very useful, and I myself consider it the best place to source original data based on human experience. People talk from experience, ask questions where necessary, and all this is done in their heads. Using AI is like the user wanting to use a shortcut to our smart forum, trying to tell the forum that they are smart, but they are actually not the brain behind their created content.",

Op most people don't get banned just from posting images because these images sometimes don't have a direct ownership. As much as we are concerned, images can be generated using Ai, so no body literally own such images. There are lots of images across the internet without due ownership so anyone can make reference using them.Quote from: Sim_card on May 12, 2023, 05:21:04 PMUsing AI generated post, which I know that is not encouraged in this forum, what will be the penalty for such action,is this the same as plagiarism ?I need clarification please, so that I can last long here.Gracia.Using Ai is definitely prohibited.

      "body": "In a simple understanding, plagiarism is the act of stealing another author's content and converting it to your own without referencing the real owner, and that also includes both pictures and articles. But in this forum, article plagerism is really taken very seriously than image. That doesn't mean that posting an image that is not yours is not also considered plagiarism. If you have to post an image that is not yours, it's good that you add the source link to the image. There is now this common trend among some users who are using AI-generated content in the forum. It is not as if those contents are plagerized, but the forum is not really in support of Chat GBT AI-generated content, and at the moment no decision has yet been made by my moderators and theymos.For \"AI content generator\" discussion threads, you can read:AI-generated post discussion thread: how to identify & reportbitcointalk forum vs OpenAI - ChatGPT",
