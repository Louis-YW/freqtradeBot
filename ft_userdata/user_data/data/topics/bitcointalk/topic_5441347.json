  "content": "QuoteCircle chief Jeremy Allaire has reacted to the recent spree of enforcement actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEX) and other agencies in the crypto industry. In an interview with Bloomberg, the Circle boss shared his views regarding SEC’s recent moves on BUSD stablecoin issuer Paxos.Circle, a Boston-based firm, is the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), with more than $42 billion in circulation. In the interview, its chief exec, Jeremy, suggested that USD-pegged stablecoins should be under a bank regulator.SEC Has No Business With Crypto StablecoinsDuring the interview, Circle’s chief executive officer Jeremy Allaire stated that the US SEC has no business with payment stablecoins. According to him, stablecoins are a payment system and should fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of a banking regulator and not the SEC. The executive seems displeased with the SEC’s recent moves on stablecoins. In his words, several countries’ governments, including the US, have a reason for addressing stablecoins as a payment system that falls under the responsibility of banking regulators. Although the Circle chief shares this view, his firm confirmed it has not come under the SEC’s radar. However, given the recent desist notice to Paxos and other ongoing regulatory activities, a move on Circle by the SEC is possible. Although the CEO was against the SEC’s move on the stablecoin, he favored the regulator on one thing. Jeremy applauded the SEC’s recent proposal on crypto custody to streamline exchanges who want to become custodians.In his words, it is crucial to have qualified custodians that can provide appropriate market control structures and bankruptcy protections. Therefore, a crypto exchange should not wake up and become a custodian without meeting the requirements. SEC Accused Of Pushing Enforcement ForcefullyAlso, earlier on February 23, Allaire concurred with SEC Commissioner, Hester Peirce, who said the watchdog should refer to Congress regarding legislation for crypto regulation and enforcement.In a tweet, Peirce commented on people’s reactions to the SEC and its moves on stablecoins. According to the commissioner, Congress is actively considering the issue of crypto regulatory framework and legislation, so the SEC should turn to them for answers. He also said the SEC and other regulators could hold public roundtables to discuss the matter. Pierce ended his note by saying there are better ways to make rules than enforcement actions. Allaire’s views align with many others who reacted to the SEC’s recent actions on the crypto industry. Due to the lack of legislation for crypto regulation, many believe the SEC needs to consult Congress before taking matters into its hands regarding cryptocurrency enforcement.Responding to the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and a former Coinbase employee, the Chamber of Digital Commerce lambasted the watchdog. The agency accused the SEC of using a back door approach to label crypto assets securities without legislation from Congress.https://bitcoinist.com/sec-shouldnt-regulate-crypto-stablecoins/....Interesting conflict developing here. Circle has its $42 billion dollar stablecoin (USDC) which could come under fire if the SEC continues to regulate the stablecoin market.The SEC claims all crypto assets other than bitcoin are securities. Circle's CEO claims that they should be regulated under the banking industry or congress. And that Congress must officially label assets securities before they can be treated as such. There is a long story and history behind all of these events. Currently the united states has proposals on the table to expand the powers of the SEC and grant it greater authority. BTW does anyone remember who circle is said to function as a subsidiary of?",

      "body": "This is another person trying to put things in disarray, the so-called Circle chief should just close his mouth, I don't know why people like to call a white a black. SEC is saddled with that responsibility, not the bank, or he would argue that stablecoins are more stable than fiat in which 1 fiat = 1 fiat. If SEC could regulate the trading of fiat, I don't see any reason why they should not regulate the stablecoins that are only using the principles of fiat, some of them are not even truly equal to 1$ as they claim.Aside from that, they are pairable and tradable, so why not regulate them? We should not be sentimental, regulation is not banning, and it will only help preserve cryptocurrency rather than some evil government clamping down on it.",

      "body": "I hope they understand what they are asking for. If you want to be regulated by Banking Regulator, the regulator will likely subject you to the standards banks are subjected to. And It will become almost impossible to operate the way true crypto should operate. And your customers will likely find it difficult to use the stablecoin like normal cryptocurrency. This is part of the reasons I usually advice against centralization of crypto or allowing it in a decentralized system to compete/exist side by side with decentralized ones. If for example the stablecoin companies all of a sudden are taken over by banks or operate as banks, people who deposited longterm thinking they have full control of their funds (considering the private/secret keys), could have hard time accessing their funds easily unless they are Americans.We need credible stablecoins that are really decentralized. They will most likely be self regulatory and/or regulated by decentralized network participants. Centralized ones normally should by regulated by countries that support them or countries they fall under their jurisdiction",

      "body": "So basically this guy(and other CEOs in the crypto business) claims that cryptocurrencies are actual currencies and the crypto companies should be treated as banks by the authorities. The term \"payment systems\" doesn't mean anything, if you ask me.The authorities are stating that cryptocurrencies are NOT actual currencies. The cryptocurrencies are financial assets/securities and the crypto companies should be regulated by the SEC.I don't think that a stablecoin should be treated as a real currency. Stablecoins are more like pseudo-currencies. They aren't completely crypto, but they aren't completely fiat as well.I don't know why the Circle CEO is complaining. The big centralized crypto companies must be regulated strictly. It doesn't matter which institution is going to regulate them-SEC or the congress.",

I’d be behind it if the SEC was doing it for the right reasons but they’re not. Look at their relationship with SBF & FTX for example.",

Obviously we are talking about something that is a bit more difficult to handle, it is not going to be as easy, or as acceptable for someone in the crypto world, specially for someone who is CEO in a crypto industry company.However, SEC will consider it as very important problems because we are talking about some random companies issue their own dollars and selling it to people, that's a bit weird. I mean if I just printed my own paper money, and distributed, and said \"this worths a dollar, if you need it come back to me and take your dollar\" would you buy from me? You do it from tether though?",

Really depends as you says, like Tether who has been in the limelight since 2018, and they don't want to be scrutinized or something. https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21QuoteWashington, D.C. — The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Limited, Tether Operations Limited, and Tether International Limited (d/b/a Tether) for making untrue or misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the U.S. dollar tether token (USDT) stablecoin. The order requires Tether to pay a civil monetary penalty of $41 million and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.  So this is going to be a cat and mouse game for regulators and stable coins in the future.",

I do believe that the SEC people are overreaching and it is damaging the space, SEC needs to come out with clarity on where they stand with some issues so that the industry can move on, the earlier they do, the better it is for everyone one",
