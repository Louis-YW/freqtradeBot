      "body": "The SUI blockchain itself is strange. After the launch of the Mainnet, a bunch of bugs. I couldn't open my SUI wallet. Therefore, I think it is very early to immediately launch coins, and even more so memes of other coins, even if it is SHIBA. Moreover, Shiba itself is, at its core, already meme coin. Then SUI SHIBA becomes memecoin squared, which is very strange. I would pass this token by.",

I would pass this token by.I am aware that the SUI team addressed a number of bugs months ago and began working to fix them. suishiba has such a strong community and devoted team that I see this project as being very hard to pass up.How do you know they have a strong community and dedicated team?I'm just curious that some so-called crypto projects that talk about memes can still work this way. At first glance it's not very informative, and is quite the clone of similar meme projects, if you were more honest about how you spread your message with this project I would be less curious. and just watch as this a passing information. Sincerely this project is unreliable from the idea as well as the way it works, don't stubbornly expect fomo or create your own fomo in the illusion, the meme is always less stable and like a multiplayer game, do not give out any information that is considered positive things around, few achieve success also do not consider it as the mainstream of the market, if you are not this project team i recommend stay away from it and invest time in researching the more worthwhile things in the market.",
