People wants a quick money and the answer is putting a degen on meme coins which currently have been trending in the crypto market but as always take profit when is happy because holding it for long is not a good idea at all.",

But if they bring up new flavor like enhance the technology with proper use case then maybe I would like to have them. I miss to know the existence of PEPE but at the moment I don't have any plans to accumulate since there ATH has already pass.",

I feel it all depends on the developer on how they market their project and make it big. There have been others which were just rug pulls.I am not a fan of meme coins, and I do not intend to invest in any of those projects currently making headlines. I feel it is just hype, and after a few years, it will die.\"",

An example is the Doge and Shiba coins that I already had and were profitable before. But if you want to invest in meme coins, you should be aware that meme coins have the potential to experience pumps and dumps. So you already know and can determine how much money you can use to invest in meme coins. Don't gamble too much with meme coins because there are many potential coins you can use as your investment.",

But investment is for profit, and I will not pass up any opportunity, including memecoins. I am here for profit, as long as they can make a profit, I have no reason to refuse. Cryptocurrency is a financial market, and the winner is the one who makes the most profit. So I advise everyone, don't follow the crowd, don't imitate or follow anyone, always do your own research and choose what's best for you. If your goal is profit and you are willing to take risks, then there is no reason not to try the meme, but if you like safety and accept low returns, bitcoin is the choice.",

I understand Meme coins have no use case but they have hype and that's what you need to make money. Apparently yes. Its not that they are useful or have amazing use case. But its price action depend on the community support and hype. Its like you are investing on them for a very short period of time then youll take profit once its realized. Dont love them like a typical L1 project on alts. Once they take off and the profits are good for you then sell it. Sometimes most memecoin are just doing rug so better be careful to choose which one youll ape in. But the trick here isnt doing huge money. A fraction ia enough since ita a risky one. Always expect losses with this. But once you hit jackpot then all the loses will be compensated.",

Why aren't people using it for payment when they've its option for payment. On the few occasions I had transacted using it, it was stress free and transaction speed was great. Look at what those of us utilizing Bitcoin for transaction have been passing through over a week now, with so many transactions still pending. This delayed transactions aren't doing Bitcoin advocacy any good at all. It will discourage many from investing in it if it continues.",

I often try to buy it, but it rarely returns my investment, meaning the value of the token goes to zero in no time.",

I don't like them because many misguided folks are going into it. The trend of meme coins have been there and it's like an unstoppable era. But, I believe that a time will come and it's going to be stopped soon. If you're good at spotting at these meme coins and you're making that much, you know what to do.However, if you don't know how to enter correctly on these meme coins and you're just also brought up by the hype. Then, it's likely that you'll lose money from most of them.",

Yes, the narrative of Meme coin is very short lived but it may give you 50x or 100x returns within no time.What i like about meme coins is the fact that they are not pretending to be anything else but i don't see them giving profits just because they are meme coins. They have often huge gains becausee they start from very low marketcap as they don't have big presales/icos. So they have easy room to grow 10000% and more with the right circumstances. It's unusual but it happens from time to time. However chasing them with a big investment is stupid as you never know what takes off and what's going to be another rug. As 99.9% of them will be garbage. Finding a gem from there and being in right time at the right place is like winning lottery. It's nearly impossible to pull off and you can count your blessings if you happen to be lucky enough to get in early.",
