Not all investors can gain exposure to bitcoins directly. For us regular investors, you can just log in to an exchange and buy bitcoins. Some institutions and enterprises cannot, they will go through too many legal hoops to acquire and store bitcoins like you do, they are the ones who would most utilize ETFs.Some other use it cause they do not want to carry the responsibility of holding their investments themselves, but rely on a third party.- Jay -",

Hodling actual assets is my preference, not ETFs.A common claim is that ETFs introduce Bitcoin to folks who are wary of cryptocurrencies. I know - comfort and familiarity. But isnt Bitcoin's main goal to bypass traditional banking systems? ETFs seem to dilute revolution.I think the desire for Bitcoin ETFs over Bitcoin may arise from a mistrust or ignorance of Bitcoin. Maybe its about security within the usual investment framework. Regardless, an ETF doesnt appeal to a Bitcoin enthusiast. I believe in direct ownership, where Bitcoin's actual value may be realized.",

But here you need to pay attention what you do, you can easily make your money disappear, if you misplace your private key or so....",

Note: My question stems from my miniscule understanding of ETF.Clarifications would be appreciated.  Many people are used to centralized platforms like banks and the stock exchange. They feel more secure to invest in sectors that the government has some level of control over. They trust that these platforms will manage their money more than themselves. Another issue is that many people don't also want to take responsibility for learning about the Bitcoin space because they think that it is complicated. So they prefer to use third-party platforms to help them keep their funds safe. There is also the claim that using ETF as security or collateral in accessing loans will be more flexible. Others also think that it is easy and less complicated to transfer such ETF holdings to successors. Most of these claims are products of ignorance. If these ETF investors knew more, they wouldn't put their funds in centralized platforms that cannot be trusted.",

Remember  buying ETFs is more like buying  share but not inform of a normal financial share , investors could hold for a long time if they want without any restrictions. Although,its sounds more of what a normal Wallet could do but I think people go for it as they could easily  follow the market trend  buy  and  sell at anytime they want without having  to deal with exchange .However, we should always remember this, so far you partner with a third party to invest or hold your coin , you still don't  have total control over your investment.",

Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/101315/are-etfs-good-fit-401k-plans.aspAre There Any Tax Considerations When Using ETFs in a 401(k)?In a 401(k), tax considerations are generally less relevant because contributions and earnings can grow tax-deferred if contributions are made pre-tax. For after-tax contributions, taxes are deferred until you withdraw funds from the account (i.e. when you retire).Quote from: https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/roth-comparison-chartTaxation of WithdrawalsWithdrawals of contributions and earnings are not taxed provided it’s a qualified distribution – the account is held for at least 5 years and made:On account of disability,On or after death, orOn or after attainment of age 59½.",

Note: My question stems from my miniscule understanding of ETF.Clarifications would be appreciated.  There are very little benefits that outweigh just holding BTC in a non-custodial wallet. There might be arguments that there is more liquidity from the institutions, or convenience, or maybe even insurance. Though I wouldn't call any of those theories any reason to hold or buy ETF Bitcoin over that of holding it in a wallet.You might be able to trade it with the most perceived trust as you can do it on a stock exchange, and the product is created by some of the worlds largest institutions...though this might only be a benefit to those who are trading or who are not looking to buy and hold. Even such, it is arguable to choose the ETF over a real spot market, like on Coinbase, or Binance...if you are looking to trade. Or moreover, using a decentralized exchange where you can trade with more control over custody. It can serve as a bridge for more awareness, accessibility and credibility for Bitcoin as a whole. Though I wouldn't call it a better instrument to hold or trade Bitcoin.",
