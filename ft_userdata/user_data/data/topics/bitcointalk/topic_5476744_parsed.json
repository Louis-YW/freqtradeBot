I have listed bitcoin in my Coingecko portfolio so it updates me of any significant move although I don't think it's going to be reporting small positive or negative moments but I can't be certain of that, I didn't tweak my Coingecko app too much.",

If it is the first option then I will suggest you not use such a thing for price prediction. When you rely on something other than yourself, it becomes complicated and the results are not going to be the one to your liking. People use bots or signal services but I never recommend anyone to use those. They can be accurate sometimes but not every time. And if you keep using those services, you will forget even the basics of trading in the long run. So don't use them. But if it's the second option, there are services available that will keep you up to date but you will have to do it manually.",

Trading bots, whether open source or paid, monitor the trading pair on several platforms over less than a minute, and you can program it to execute orders, for example, if the price decreases by such and such amount, sell or by such and such a percentage, or if the price changes in X exchange, sell in Y exchange.Everything you are looking for will be found in the trading bots, and you can set up notifications to be sent to you by email, and from the email you can view them on your phone or smart watch.",

And the amazing thing is you can use Cryptohopper platform that generates buying and selling action API that you can add to your Trading view or any other alert app. You can use Coingecko or coinmarket cap too but the experience is not good with both and the fun fact is they both show you the average price of the market, i.e. BTC.Therefore you might not get a good deal, if you are planning to trade only one one or two exchanges. The best practice will be to use a built-in alert system of exchanges that you are going to use for making trades because each exchange does have small differences between the prices and the average prices from coinmarket cap and coin gecko might no be of any benefit to you.There are bundle of alert apps but they don't work efficiently, I suggest you to use telegram bots like https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/bot/telegram",

I understand that there is a belief in some people that some other person could help you make a lot of profit, but those who could are not the people who want to and those who want to are not those who could.Meaning, people who are great at trading and could help you make money just like they do, are not the people who are going to help you since they are already making profit and won't bother helping you out, whereas people who do want to help you, are usually people who do not make a lot of profit from trading themselves so they want your money.",

Trustwallet notice system gives inaccurate and sometimes late results with long time intervals such as 10 minutes to half an hour, which is sufficient for the market direction to change from top to bottom and vice versa, especially since we are talking about currencies that have short-bump/dump trends.tradingview is good but altcoins and tokens with low market capacities are nonexistent.

If you hold coins in Binance or other exchange you can check with set up alert on that exchange and I sure they have alert feature when coins up or down depend on our set up price how much percent.

No app can tell you when a coin's market will go in which direction, but different apps or exchanges will show you the statistics that have already happened and what is happening now.
