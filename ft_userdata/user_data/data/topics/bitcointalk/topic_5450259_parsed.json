  "content": "Hi. The people on this site seriously need to work on their social skills so that they do not come across as the chlurmcks who they are. On this site, I can hardly have a decent conversation with anyone here because the people here are full of anti-intellectual hatred.1. If I am talking about how I have been working on a dimensionality reduction that takes a collection of n by n matrices (A_1,...,A_r) and returns a collection of d by d matrices (X_1,...,X_r) for some d<n, you should not say that this is stupid or garbage or anything like that because saying such a thing is a sign of your ignorance and hatred of intelligence. If you have an issue with what I have been doing, then you need to actually understand what I have been doing. If you do not understand what I am doing but yet you respond with ravenous hatred, then you will expose yourself as a chlurmck. Dimensionality reduction is a very important aspect of machine learning, and we do not need just dimensionality reductions of vectors, but we also need dimensionality reductions of matrices.2. I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics. That means I understand mathematics. Whenever I say that I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics, the people on this site automatically think that I am stupid. That is wrong. The only reason why people hate me for being educated and having something to say about cryptocurrency technologies is that the people on this site are a bunch of chlurmcks.3. People accuse me of being a troll on this site because I say something that people disagree with here. Um. Disagreeing with you is not trollery. What you can do.If you have a disagreement with what I have to say, then you should try to disagree at the highest level of Graham's Heirarchy of Disagreement.DH0: Name calling: This is how the people on this site often respond. I admit that sometimes I respond this way to people, but this is only because they have already shown their hatred and anti-intellectualism. At this point, I will have no more to say but to ignore these entities because the conversation is done.DH1: Ad Hominem: This means that you are attacking the authority of a person instead of the argument being given. With that being said, an Ad Hominem argument is not always fallacious. For example, DH2: Responding to tone: It is better to respond to the content of what someone is saying rather than about what you think they meant. Maybe they have the tone that they do as a response to what you have said. That does not matter. You need to respond to what people say because nobody is going to go anywhere or learn anything as long as you are only responding to how someone says something. Of course, it may be sometimes appropriate to respond to the tone, but in my experience, but if someone is acting like a total chlurmck, it is better to ignore such an entity.DH3: Contradiction: If you are contradicting what someone is saying, you are simply making a claim. A claim is good for letting people know what you believe or endorse, but it is better to back up such a claim with evidence.DH4: Counterargument: This means that you are not only making a claim, but you are giving a reason for your claim. This is better. But when you make a counterargument, make sure that your counterargument is free from fallacious ideas and is supported with sufficient reason and evidence. For example, if I say \"Cryptocurrencies should have mining algorithms that are designed not only to establish consensus and secure the cryptocurrency, but these mining algorithms should solve an important scientific problem\", then you may respond with a counterargument by saying \"But that has been tried before, and it did not work so well in the past. For example, Primecoin mining requires the miners to compute chains of prime numbers, but not even mathematicians who study number theory are interested in these chains of prime numbers. This so-called useful mining algorithm is not as useful as you would like it to be. I am skeptical that anyone would ever come up with a cryptocurrency mining algorithm that both solves an important scientific problem and establishes decentralized consensus because all of the useful problems that I see do not have the cryptographic properties that we need to establish decentralized consensus.\" DH5: Refutation: You refute a point that your opponent is trying to get across. DH6: Refuting the central point: In this case, you refute the main idea that your opponent is trying to get across. It is better to refute the main idea of your opponent than a particular argument that your opponent has made since your opponent may have several arguments in need of refutation.Joseph Van Name Ph.D.-Creator of Circcash",

      "body": "It is always educating to read posts from a learned scholar like you. Bagging a Ph.D. in Mathematics is a noble achievement and I have you in high regard. The summary of your post is that we can argue or disagree on certain issues but we shouldn't attack or insult members because of their views. We indeed have different views and perceptions on diverse subjects, hence we must allow people to air their views without intimidation or personal attack. I have been in this forum for a few years now and I have not been subjected to anti-intellectual hatred like you claimed. Sometimes some members overreact during discussions but this is not the behavior of most of the members. You have always complained of ill-treatment from members of the forum but you are also guilty of the same offense. This is because some of your posts contain abusive words or insults.Quote from: jvanname on February 17, 2023, 09:38:23 PMsuchmoon-You are ignored. I am not reading your reply because you are a Nazi who hates education and loves violence. Do the world a favor and ** **** *** **** * ****.Quote from: jvanname on April 17, 2023, 06:54:50 PMBADecker-The only reason why you are bringing politics into the discussion is because you promote violence. You are a chlurmck.Hispo-BADecker is just a chlurmck who is not worth communicating with.",

An inflated ego is a bad ally in pleasant conversations.Why do you even need people to talk to here if you have such a high opinion of yourself and such a low opinion of others? Talk to yourself. You don't have to answer me, we don't know each other, but I don't like you anymore.",

I seriously doubt that people around are are enemies of knowledge and scientific advance and I also doubt they may be mistreating you because you have managed to get a PhD in mathematics.  Actually, if you take a look at the technical discussion section, you could find interesting threads and discussions about subjects like cryptography, computer science and mathematics applied to Bitcoin and other currencies.  Bitcoin was built through science and knowledge as well, so it would not make sense people around here are stupid or against things as important as those.  Is there is a chance some those you talked to were newbies or misinformed people who are new in this community?

This is because the people on this site are low quality specimens. And the reputation section is definitely a place that I do not want to be. The cryptocurrency sector knows absolutely nothing about reputation since they worship Sam Bankman Fried and the thought of using cryptocurrency mining to solve the most important scientific problem. The cryptocurrency sector also has a very bad reputation, so you might want to think about that.Marykeller-\"Does it important if you bring your academic credentials to the discussion?

I have seen many threads in which you expressed your views and members accepted them and you even earned some merits from those posts.
