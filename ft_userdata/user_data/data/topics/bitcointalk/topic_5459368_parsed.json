It's kinda related to saving fiat currency and not touching it or use for gambling.",

Some people will do both trading, investing and gambling but I implied about pure traders, pure investors and pure gamblers.Gamblers are greedy and want to get rich quickly and see exponential growth curve of their asset with gambling. Asking them to wait months or years to get profit from investment sounds very stressful with them. Asking them to learn about trading, spend time in the market to get profit from trading is too much, they don't want to do so many things like such.You can only advise those gamblers to reduce their gambling and aim at stop gambling entirely but it wont't be easy and they only can stop gambling if they are very serious and usually after they get rekted by gambling.Gambling responsible is not easy to do for all gamblers.",

It's a good idea, but as I understand it, the main benefit would be that it will allow the person to leave the game and use or invest that time to earn money with bitcoin... as the colleague says GranArkansas : Quote from: GreatArkansas on July 11, 2023, 02:05:19 AMTake note also that there lot of gambling that use Bitcoin to gamble   (I can relate) but some of these people we can't call gambling addicts.          There are people who only play as a hobby but if that person is very deep in that world I doubt they want to get out of it, as you yourself say they are \"Addicted\", It is encouraging to see that you care about those who are addicted to the game and seek effective ways help. It is true that investing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can present financial opportunities, but we must also consider the risks involved, such as: Affecting the mental and emotional well-being of the person and could even intensify their addiction.          I think… in my opinion that, Instead of encouraging gambling “addicts” to invest in bitcoins, the first step is to provide them with support and access to specialized treatment programs. You may be able to overcome your addiction and achieve a healthy balance in your life with the help of these types of programs. Clearly it is not an easy task, but perhaps as improvements are seen or that addiction is overcome, it would be the exact moment to apply that excellent idea that you bring .",

Buying bitcoin in the long term is not going to take the gambler's mind off gambling, and short-term trading is too similar and can lead to the same type of addictive behaviour and to losing money just as much or more.",

Bitcoin may return great profits in a year or two but these people can’t wait that long. At best they can wait a week or a month but we all know that making an investment doesn’t work that way. Investors wait year, sometimes decades to get a meaningful return on their investments. I don’t see gamblers having that kind of patience.",

Gambling is a habit which forms an addiction. Just like cigarette is smoked when the body needs nicotine. Similarly, gamers need adrenaline rush, it's not always about making money.  So investing in Bitcoin can't keep them away from gambling in any way. So they will have to take it as an investment which may fetch them some income when the time is right. Don't expect anything else.",

Look at the what you said \"addicted gambler\" an addict are will always be carried away with his gambling activities and will use whatever kind of funds that he has fiat or cryptocurrency to gamble just to satisfy his emotion by chasing his loss. I have read of a forum member who out of boredom decided to kill time with gambling and before he knew it,he was unable to control himself and used all his bitcoin for gambling which he came here and tell us about his actions. This is how it will also happen to a gambler who is introduced to crypto,online casinos has made it easy for him to enjoy his gambling activities because they use cryptocurrency for gambling. It is hard for someone who is not a gambler to be able to hold his bitcoin investment portfolio for long,because that person is not used to savings or didn't plan a good strategy to enable him hold for long.

This is a cryptocurrency platform meaning people are very much aware of bitcoin, but trying to solve peoples gambling problems with telling them to redirect those Bitcoins to investments isn't practical as this just delays their gambling habits!But if we ask ourselves, what makes people gambling addicts? I think it has to do with fast profits that come from gambling 🎰  which can't be gotten from anywhere else and investments don't fit their money making profile as these take forever to be realized! But then again if you think about it, the reason we have too many people gambling is because of the ever advancing technology, these portable devices we have and the ease to jump on these platforms without much restrictions makes it a recipe for disaster and minors too are gambling...which is why parents and guardians need to be proactive to see what their kids are doing.Quote from: Assiduous on July 11, 2023, 12:54:07 AMI think they would have invested in Bitcoin and they could have made money from it.I beg to differ, this is easier said than done...investments are not an easy undertaking...people can have problems along the way that needs an immediate address and they can cash out these investments to sort out such issues, or price volatility can make one to bailout and try something else as profits won't be seen immediately... tbh investments arent meant for everyone !",
