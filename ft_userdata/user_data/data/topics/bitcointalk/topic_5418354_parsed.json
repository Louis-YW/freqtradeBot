  "content": "Nearly half of Gen Z and Millennials want to see crypto become a part of their 401(k) retirement plans, according to an October survey from United States asset manager Charles Schwab. Asking participants what they would like to see added to their 401(k) retirement products, the firm found that 46% of Gen Z and 45% of Millennials said they \"wish\" they could invest in cryptocurrencies as part of their retirement planning.It shouldn't come as a surprise, as the survey also found that 43% of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials are investing in cryptocurrencies outside their 401(k) already, which could suggest the group's affinity for the asset class. The asset manager surveyed 1,100 401(k) retirement plan participants aged between 21 to 70 to complete the 10-minute survey conducted between Apr. 4 and Apr. 19, 2022.Participants of the survey needed to have worked for a company with 25 or more employees and be current contributors to their company's 401(k) plans. Millennials generally refer to those born in the early 1980s to mid-1990s, with Gen Z generally born between the mid to late 1990s to the early 2010s. The results are in stark contrast to the surveyed Gen X and Boomers — those born anywhere between the mid-1940s to late 1970s — with just 31% and 11% respectively wanting to invest in cryptocurrencies through their 401(k), and even less being current investors in the asset class. Across the board, inflation was seen as the leading obstacle to retirement. (Source: Cointelegraph)",

Gen Z generations are more technological inclined than other generations. They understand the benefits of Bitcoin and how it can be used profitably. Inculcating cryptocurrecies to retirement schemes is not a bad idea at all especially if it is Bitcoin. Most country's currencies have lost almost more than half of their value and there is no hope or prediction that it would regain it's value in the future. Bitcoin might be volatile but there are reliable predictions that it's price would pick-up in the future and this has proved to be true over the years. I would prefer to have my retirement benefits tied to Bitcoin than our local currency because inflation has really destroyed our currency's value.",

I don't think all pension funds are invested in Bitcoin, it's too risky when there is a decline, even though we know Bitcoin is always increasing in the future and this is actually fast but it all needs to be considered when you are ready to retire at what age 60 years and over ?But that's all according to our needs, if I've known bitcoin for a long time, of course I will receive pension funds in Bitcoin but it won't be all or separated, it's much better and part of the fiat should be our savings, but about what inflation is related to later it might be better to consider starting from building a portfolio, emergency funds, other types of needs.Even if later when I'm old I will stick to Bitcoin and Fiat as a save for his old age.",

They're more technology equipped and inclined so investing in cryptocurrency would be easy for them since they got all the access. It's actually a smart idea because crypto as a retirement plan could assure our future and would guarantee promising profits as long as they're going to choose potential coins most especially Bitcoin.",

If you make 4% in dividends omin the first year of your pension or first year of holding the asset, investing that and just that into bitcoin would be a great idea that would mean you lose 4% of your entire pension (which could happen anyway with stocks pretty easily) or you gain an extra bit of diversification that could be reinvested. If you're not good a picking stocks too, 60% in a globally diversified stock etf, 20% in real estate and 20% in monetary value related assets (like bonds and crypto) doesn't sound a bad place to start if investing when you're young (and then taking down those percentages heavily as you get older and moving more things into bonds or shares).",

I don't think they know anything about how crypto works when it comes to retirement and their benefits for the long term. I think for them in their old age there is health insurance and hospital provision. Then the provision to enjoy old age is to have real assets that they can pass on to their grandchildren and children / Property, gold, land, and of course adequate education funds.",

We've seen so much of what good investments has the world to offer. We've seen the traditional investments and the modern investments. Choosing  Bitcoin is one of the best asset to have when planning ahead for your retirement, at least for your own comfort. But, I could definitely say, real estate is much safer investment for retirement more than anything else. Properties can be passed down to your future generations while you're continuously generating profit without lossing your asset.",

If we're talking about people in their 30s at most, the 'cryptocurrencies' they invest in in their retirement funds will probably all be gone by the time they retire. Just look at the changes over the years in CMC's top ten.As for bitcoin, I see it as a safer bet, but even over the long term, 30 years or more, we don't know what can happen. You also have to bear in mind that if you have bitcoin in a retirement fund, it will be deposited in a centralised entity, and you won't have the private keys.It is better to have your own bitcoin, having your own keys, apart from your retirement funds.",

It might answer many questions on why central banks have not made more of an effort to deploy CBDC. The biggest supporters gold and silver (and possibly CBDC) appear to be older generations. While by contrast the largest supporters in crypto and bitcoin appear to be the current youth demographic. This observation could be a foundation that will set the stage for our future market trends. There is a chance that our current youth demographic is smarter and more knowledgeable than they are given credit for being. I would be interested to know if this observation is accurate. It seems that many political demographics are banking on the future of the youth demographic swinging their way. The eventual outcome of many current conflicts could hinge upon the development.",
