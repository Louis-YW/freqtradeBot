Different exchanges, different traders, more institutions down the line (hence the strong correlation with spx), different bots set to move the prices, etc. You should never compare today's PA with even 2015 or 16 's PA.Quote from: mk4 on February 13, 2023, 04:00:18 AMNot only is listening to \"analysts\" a huge waste of time, but you're likely to get inverse results.I got a trick here. Why not listen to these analysts and do the inverse to get straight results ? ;P Jokes apart, I think its better to just have a few good sources (whether of analysts or not), to stay updated about the fundamentals and upcoming news which may be a catalyst for next price action. Nothing more than that!",

In the 2011 bitcoin price bearing was more than now but bitcoin was able to pulled through, I believe this time is going to far more better than we have ever experience.Analysis are just predictions with some math and evidences. Every analysis doesn’t need to be made true. Yes I agree that Bitcoins were able to pull from more drastic situation, and yes this time it is meant for Bitcoins to rise. If we forget all the predictions and analysis and just focus on the facts, then definitely we will see that Bitcoins will rise very soon. The reason is very simple. Bitcoins are limited in number, so when the time will pass, it will make Bitcoins more valuable and hence in order to maintain the demand, the price will go up. In the meantime, we need to just wait and be patient.",

A couple of weeks ago the same \"analysis\" was saying that \"price will go down to below $10k\" after which price broke the $20k resistance and started rising.

I think we shouldn’t let anyone’s analysis or predictions affect our judgement as we’ve seen lots of predictions over the years come to naught. There would always be different opinions on the price and value of bitcoin and we shouldn’t let people’s opinions sway us into doing something we would regret later on.

What I would advise you is that not all analysis are likely correct. Follow your personal judgement and make sure you have done your market research before you conclude on your actions so as not to make the wrong move. In as much as Crypto market is still in existence, there would definitely be price analysis from different analyst and I asked myself this question if they that claim to be good Crypto market analyst,  why is their price prediction not inline with each other, why some predict high and some predict low, their variation in prices will tell you that they have no autonomy as to good price analysis.  Do not be led by their analysis to put you of track.",

Against this backdrop, the value of cryptocurrencies may increase.Given that 2023 is expected to be a period of total rate hikes by regulators, such trends are likely to be expected no earlier than the second half of the year, when investors will return to digital currencies. The low cost of crypto will force many investors to invest in coins, contributing to their growth.Experts claim that it will take some time for crypto prices to recover. Previously, there were few professionals in the market. This contributed to sharp fluctuations and allowed large players to make money on the mistakes of less experienced cryptocurrency market participants. Currently, there are more professional players, volatility has decreased, and it takes longer for quotes to fall to significant levels. As a result, the recovery of quotes may be delayed.However, I believe that listening to experts will only make things worse for yourself. We have no influence on the bitcoin rate.
