(if you're a resident in a supported country):Quote from: https://wise.com/help/articles/2932118/incompatible-accounts-and-paymentsYou can receive money to your Wise account from a platform that deals with cryptocurrencies — as long as the platform is regulated and/or supervised in the EU or UK.I'm not entirely sure if trading on a regulated platform like Binance P2P would fall under this category or not since you'll be dealing with other individuals and not Binance itself, but If I would guess it's fine. If you decide to go this route, you should make sure to only accept money from users whose names match in both Wise and Binance, , otherwise, it would be difficult for you to later on prove that the funds are coming from Binance.",

These days I only make one big transaction and then wait for 3 or 4 weeks before doing another one again. My account hasn't been blocked for 6 months so far.",

If you are from any country where Bitcoins are illegal, then it will be too hard for you to cash your hard earned Bitcoins. If your country is not so strict about cryptos, then sell your coins to multiple sellers and do multiple transactions in low amount. That’s the ideal way to cash out Bitcoins through P2P trades. Also if you want to cash out big amount of money, then only Cash Transaction is possible, and yes remember one thing, while doing such trades, be careful when you go to meet the person.",

If you arent have much close person to deal off then use some third party trusted p2p site like Binance id they did supported your country. They offer as mediator or escrow for the transaction and make sure youll get your money or else theyll hold the seller tokens as collateral if they plan to scam someone.",

With SEPA transfer and Internal transfer of such neo banks. I live in France. And it appears that local banks are refusing to give me an account for this due to the regulation against the fight of the laundering of monney, at the moment you say \"Crypto\" they tell you \"thank you but no thank you\". Then i tried neo banks which was good at the beginning but really fast my volume of internal transfer (revolut to revolut, wise to wise) and the monney i was transfering to Kraken was too high (>250k€ per week) and they blocked my account.Now the only solution i see is to sell Crypto for other crypto in such localbitcoin or localmonero but on these ones u need to have a good reputation to have buyers..How do you do guys to make it possible to do it without getting blocked everywhere ?",

If it happens that you don't want to use exchanger, you only wanting to use a reputable member from this forum, you could bargain with him so you could provide different account to receive and send payments.Actually you need a \"Current\" bank account to carry out huge trade instead of using a \"Savings\" account although I believe those that from part of my country may understand this more better, btw I don't know of your country.",

I'm not sure what your problem is or how your bank issue is connect to P2P. I have been using p2p service with Binance for quite sometime now and even though most bank in my country doesn't support crypto related transactions I'm still able to do my p2p. All you have to do while transacting is to avoid the inclusion of anything related to \"crypto\" in the description of the transaction. If you check most ads on Binance p2p you'll see that those transacting in a country that doesn't support crypto will add in their terms Do not use any word related to crypto while making your payment.  that way your bank won't know if it's crypto related or not.",

I did not directly send my fund to the bank, it is a P2P exchange > e-wallet > bank transfer.However, I read that Binance has a p2p trading which is I think very simple to use connected to your local bank account but make sure you have aware of your bank terms. Otherwise, P2 decentralized platforms are the best for you, Hodl-hodl.",
