Help: A list of LocalBitcoin alternatives (P2P marketplaces)Though I haven't use most of them so you should do a little research about them before using any of them.",

And what do you think is the best option?Dropping the option to buy with payoneer might be the best option.Yes, there are currently only P2P deals available through which you can buy the Bitcoins.The reason for which I am saying that it is worst, is that buying Bitcoins with payoneer is very rare and you will get very less rate if you attempt to buy through a P2P deal.It will be really ideal if you can purchase through remitly or PayPal, itâ€™s better that Payoneer.",
