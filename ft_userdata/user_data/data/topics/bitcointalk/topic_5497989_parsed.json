The fee rate with the highest priority that I saw just now to send bitcoin is 11 sat/vbyte, which amounts to $1.05 if you are sending from 1 input to 2 addresses (2 outputs).The person used legacy address. Let us assume that the 3 addresses are legacy. The fee is for segwit address is $1.05. If the person used 2 times the fee which is $2, it is enough to get the transaction confirmed faster.",

There are already existing means of sending crypto transactions at a cheaper rate through the use of other alternative coins, just as MK4 highlighted. Although the transaction the Op shared is overcharged, if the person is experienced, it could have been avoided.  During the past weeks when the bitcoin network was flooded with those shitcoin transactions, we all saw how high the fee was. A lot of people discovered how cheap it was to run transactions using other coins like LTC, matic, and the rest among the few trusted once's the fee is cheaper compared to bitcoin network, but when it comes to trust and security, Bitcoin is still top notch.",

But about sending bitcoin to someone, many people do not have lighting wallets, that is true. But some people that I sent back bitcoin to told me they want to receive it on an exchange, I simply tell them they can still use bitcoin if that is the case and they sent me invoice for bitcoin lightning payment.About creating a channel, it can be hard on some wallets like Electrum, but it is newbie friendly on wallets like Phoenix, Zeus and Muun.",

Aside from Bitcoin having too many issues of its own, your points are also hinting at a few of the issues if you are sincere with yourself. This is contradictory, so why the write-up?What I appreciate the most about Bitcoin is the fact that it disgraced those top-world countries enjoying every benefit while people like us from developing countries suffer many restrictions in terms of cross-border payment and others, no thanks to them. Many of the cheap means were blocked due to reasons best known to them to the extent that we would have to use bank wire and some other payment gateways that are not cheap at all. But Bitcoin was introduced and solved that issue for us. But I am not going there, what I am trying to establish is that, that was one of the goals of Satoshi but this has been hijacked now by miners for selfish reasons.Bitcoin is way higher than an average digital transaction now, this is unless you are cleverly watching the mempool all the time before you can make a single transaction that will average $1, which is still reasonable now. But with little time, you see the transaction moving insanely up again and this is too rampant these days. Should we call that reliability in the transaction? No, it is not. And if the rich can afford it as you said, or should I say those with a high amount of BTC, what about the poor and those who want to send a few bucks? What I see here is no appraisal, my friend, unless this among other issues is fixed.This is only possible when the developers find a way to reduce the control of the miners to avoid fee exploitation the way we see it today.",

They will cost us huge fee + tax, but with BTC we have to pay lesser fee, while many people have to pay the tax even but still its cost efficient. BTW, there was a person, (he was businessman) who was finding a way to send money from one country to another in cheap way. And came up to know about BTC in around 2018, he then started to keep his savings in BTC and end up becoming a millionaire. Don't remember the details but you probably found him in this post.. BTC still cheaper for rich people but its not cheaper anymore for poor ones like me, who can meet the expenses of 2 o 3 days with the amount of  one transaction fee.",
