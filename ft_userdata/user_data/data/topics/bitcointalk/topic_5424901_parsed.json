      "body": "Like seriously dude?I was expecting that you would say something about 'em....like, atleast a description as to what Post you're referring to ...but nix.You got the balls dear... When I was a newbie, I'd never ask why my post gets deleted; after all,.who knows if it's some shitty wall of crap that I made? But it's different this days. You don't even sound like you wrote something reasonable there (cus I don't believe the mods would delete a meaningful post), except it goes off point or you eventually started a topic entirely different from the main idea... So just chill Â Edit: Quote from: mprep on December 01, 2022, 12:00:37 AMSee rule 1 in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0.This is just exactly the same thing I was trying to describe above.when you fail to read the rules and get acquainted with 'em, that's what you get. This one might even get deleted as wellÂ   Sandra ðŸ§‘",
