Is this normal, 8 are Full Relay & 2 are Block Relay.I don’t run as a Full Node so 0 incoming connections, which I am content with.I’ve just never seen 10 outgoing connections previously.",

Bitcoin Core is fully synced so it’s not that.Hm, not really sure since they are showing up once they are confirmed. Did you rescan the blockchain data after ur old wallet was restored to the newest version? This often helps when the balance isnt updating correctly or is showing a different value. To do so: Close Bitcoin Core, open ur bitcoin.conf and add this line:Code:rescan=1then restart it.As I said, I dont know if it fixes this 'problem' but atleast its worth a try.",

Given this, is it perhaps a problem with either your mempool settings or your mempool synchronization? Are you running any non-default mempool settings in your bitcoin.conf file?
