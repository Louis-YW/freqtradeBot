I no no how u dey take dey look the election but I no agree with you. INEC don fail Nigerians, dem don do their magic, imagine investing billions of naira in the BVAS machine and these machines were test run before election and given green light, when e reach presidential they could not upload result on their portal, party logo ommited in the ballot papers, reporting late or not showing up at pulling units... So how do you define coordination?",

Even our judiciary is a failed system where the law is been bent to favour this set of persons. Many youth like myself thought we are going to get it right this time, that's why a good number of youths were involved compared to previous elections. It just so pathetic that the presidential election was rigged.",
