  "content": "Many traders desire to begin their trading careers by becoming experts in the charts, as well as in strategies and other related topics. The problem is that this approach fails the majority of the time. So, I firmly advise that you have some form of reliable revenue flowing in before you begin your trading career, regardless of the method. A skill, a job, or a career, perhaps. It will be quite difficult for you to concentrate and actually advance in this trading adventure if you don't have that, which is why.  You need to anticipate that your emotional stability will be tested.This is why I urge that before starting your trading journey, you need to have a hustle that pays you, get a job, or learn a skill. Begin anything that generates income so that you can devote a portion of it to your trading experience. And many of us have made a lot of mistakes along the way, and this is the antidote to that.Start trading just after you are bringing in a certain amount of steady income. Take a percentage of this income, which could be $100, $500, or $1,000, and start your trading career. This will help your trading journey develop into a lovely experience in which you learn more quickly, peacefully, and at your own pace.You will be able to grow faster , and in no time, you will see that you will become a much more better trader than if you go all in and you expect to use trading to solve all your problems. It won't happen because trading is a very competitive market and the volatility is so high that if you do not find some sort of a balance , it will eat you up.1 www.lifehack.org/927411/digital-brain-second-brain2 www.forexstrategymaster.com/doc_index.php",

It won't happen because trading is a very competitive market and the volatility is so high that if you do not find some sort of a balance , it will eat you up.You mention percentage, you stated amount. It would have been better if you stated it in percentage, like trading with less than 10% of weekly income, or even less if someone just started to trade, because new traders are prone to fail while they will learn more from experience.Also it is good to mention that trading is not for everyone, if someone keeps losing again and again and again, the person should not trade again, or change to swing trading in a way that the market would have falled very well enough before he buys a coin or open long position.",

If we trade having other sources of income, we are not going to be affected by small loses or bad day that might influence out trading lifestyle. A lot of traders had been having a day trade because they solely depends on  trading as source of income which is nit supposed to be so. This will have a lots of effect on us and if not been too careful we might keep losing and entering into the market with fears.",

Someone may think that it's too much but that's the reality in trading, you may expect to get some profits in the future but you have to go through with a lot of pain before going there.And that's all about losing more, you'll have a lot of pains and losses before going to those successful trades.That's why before going there, you need to prepare yourself not just emotionally but also financially and that's the real thing in trading unless you only want to try it with little money.",

If you make 1% of profit consistently in a month then you may have made around 30% of $50 for instance and if you have been losing 1% of $50 in a month,you would have lost also 30%. The difference is how we can manage whatever capital we have and it is better for a new trader to start with little capital for the reason of mistakes and learning.",

However I agree more with consistent gains exactly as you say. Even small capital will continue to grow if we can get consistent profits. In my opinion, we should not be greedy to get big profits, because surely that will spur our ambition to make a mistake that will cost us later. So it's better to make profits but be consistent, than to get big profits but be inconsistent. But if we are able to do both, that's not a problem, as long as we feel we are capable of doing that, meaning that there should be no doubts that we feel.",

So for one to even think of of becoming a trader means that one has a source of income and what now matters is the percentage to set aside for the trading. Not everyone actually think this way, the narrative of coming into cryptocurrency trading that some people had is that one could get rich and doesn’t need a job or another business. This narrative made some people invest all their savings into it and also quitting their jobs to focus the entire day looking at charts. They even pay for lessons and classes or for signals. This has worked for some early traders and there current holdings doesn’t need them to find jobs but the problem is new traders having this same mindset is why we see people selling off precious physical assets to get into trading.Quote from: nara1892 on April 02, 2023, 05:23:07 PMIf we want big profits, then our capital must also support it.

A new trader coming should actually limits the entry price small let’s say 20% of his wage into. Someone starting with lower amounts could definitely be patient in making any moves during trading but one with a higher entry amount will be looking at getting his profit high and could lead to mistakes that could blow up the enter funds",

Trading is not for the weak but with implemented setups, there's high chance of gaining from the market but we should bear in mind that not all times we wins, there are tough times in the market were we make losses in a row, all these sections are parts of learning. We should be in a stable emotions before opening trade, most of us triggered trades with the wrong impression, getting revenge from our past losses.",

I've witnessed many that take a loan and do it for trading, they thinks they are chosen one that gonna score billions but the truth is they aren't that chosen one, it's always good to have some backup plan since trading and investing always could go wrong, having income will save you from being totally bankrupt, at the very least you could have the chance of retrying again since you've got that income flowing in. otherwise you'd have a really hard time dealing with fulfilling your basic needs if you've got no money left since the trading takes away all your money.",

We are excited and hopeful to make money not knowing completely how the market works. But that also means those guys who go trading without much experience are the bold ones. And Fortune favors them right when they learn  I'm sure the majority who did trading without income flow learned well from past experience. But if they learned from reading advice threads like this, they may be saved from unfortunate events.",
