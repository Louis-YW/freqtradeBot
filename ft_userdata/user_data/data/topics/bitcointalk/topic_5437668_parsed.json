  "content": "QuoteTesla recorded a $204 million impairment loss in 2022, according to the United States Security and Exchange Commission. Despite the loss, the electric vehicle manufacturer made a profit of $64 million from converting its bitcoin holdings to fiat currencies last year, Techcrunch reported citing the USSE commission. Overall, the automaker lost $40 million from crypto trading activities.In the first quarter of 2021, the company had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and stated that it believed in the longevity of the cyptocurrency. The company said bitcoin was a great place to store cash and still access it immediately, providing a better return on investment than more traditional central banks. In fact, after its initial purchase, Tesla promptly trimmed its position by 10 per cent, making the automaker a quick $101 million, Techcrunch report said.Elon Musk in March 202 said that Tesla would start accepting bitcoin as payments for Tesla vehicles, causing the price of the crypto to boom. A few weeks later, Musk and Tesla backpedalled on that decision, expressing concern about the amount of energy needed to mine bitcoin. The price of bitcoin then subsequently sank, the media outlet said.In 2022 when the value of bitcoin became better, Tesla sold 75 per cent of its bitcoin holdings and used it to buy traditional currency. As of today, the company has $184 million worth of bitcoin.Tesla, an automobile company was holding more than 1.5 billions in 2021 but lost it in the year 2022 when we had the bloodbath. Since Tesla had its image connected with bitcoin as well as reputed automobile industry it was definitely forceful decision to sell it all in the long run. But, they did it playfully and saved as much as 64 million dollars in profit when bitcoin shown its volatility waves. Tesla also trimmed almost 10 percent of profit from the company itself to balance out it. The important lesson: No matter if you are individual OR big company you have to have perfect timing for buying and selling. Moreover, you need to know proper strategy to play (no matter how many fouls it would do) but you have to save up your investments and make profits.",

This can be a costly mistake for the whole Tesla itself, but if they are still holding it I don’t see any losses on that in long term. Perfect timing and right analysis is the key to succeed here, doesn’t mean you have the money to invest you’ll not do your analysis anymore, let’s learn from this one.",

What a strange rollercoaster and example of how Elon's herd of followers, which has since been falling greatly, could be manipulated into buying anything that he wanted to hype at the moment. Bitcoin did benefit somewhat from his wild tweeting and getting Tesla involved in it, but he might have done more harm in the long run. Basically when Twitter started to signal (even if it was 3 months after the event) that they were divesting from Bitcoin, you would instantly see it followed by a wider exodus. If Elon had done his research beforehand on environmental impacts instead of coming up with a deceptive trading idea, based on getting people to pump it up due to his tweeting that was not covered by securities laws or at least not enforced at the time, he made some short term profits.",

But they are like us, they haven't sold yet, so this is only a temporary loss, not too serious. Like El Salvador, they are still holding their bitcoins, so it cannot be said that their acceptance of bitcoin as legal tender has failed. The market is unpredictable, buying high is not necessarily a failure, if you hold it long until bitcoin recovers, it is still a success.",

Everyone who experienced ecstasy because Mr. Mars once loved Bitcoin got slapped and should have learned a lesson after that, but they still think that the great leader will address the world again with some tweet of his that will start an avalanche. If you are among them, be ready to prepare the other cheek, because you deserve a new slap.The next time you think that Mr. Mars is a good man who changes the world, maybe you should look at the cobalt mines in Africa and ask him if he is proud of his work?Quote from: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11668015/Devastating-photos-cobalt-mines-Democratic-Republic-Congo-power-Apple-Tesla-more.htmlFor years, big tech companies like Apple and Tesla have assured the customers of their glossy stores and showrooms that all their goods are ethically sourced and sold. But a new series of images taken from inside mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 90 percent of the world's cobalt is mined and used to make the batteries that power our tech-led lives, raise uncomfortable questions",

He has done untrusted and irreversible damage to the crypto industry with his actions. I mean crypto was very good before that, and no one was thinking about shitcoins / memecoins before and all the investment was focused on the bitcoin or eth max. One day dude creates trail of tweets and also shows up on the Saturday Night Live to stop the heartbeats of millions of fans around the globe. What he does? Just few statements about the bitcoin and doge and just leave after cracking some jokes. That was the lesson actually, you should not believe anyone from your heart and make investments. Its money, it should be traded wisely.",

Of course, he did the research on this matter.    Then another thing is that he still has 184M$ worth of Bitcoin holdings which means he doesn't want to have any bitcoin holdings. And that amount, if I'm not mistaken, it's around 8000 BTC or more, and the bull run came and kicked the value of bitcoin hard by 200k$ each, he still made 1.6B$ in profit and he still lost to him when it happened that.",
