I want to test Bitpay with KYC byÂ  purchasing products more than 3000USD on my test site, but I only have 0.3 testnet BTC. I am able to test one time with KYC, but I think test one time unable to fix everything. Any idea/suggestion from the community?Any body has testnet BTC can donate? if need real money to exchange, please leave a message for consideration and let me discuss with my team.my address : tb1qnmjk4tmah8ylp9afa5x3n3ze5pyvq5rhpvn0n9",

For example one part is responsible for sending/receiving transactions another part is responsible for evaluating the value and deciding what to do with them. You can inject a \"mock\" of second part into the first part while testing and give it any value you want (eg. $3000 for production and $0.003 for testing).",

No one will give you tBTC if you can't return them back, even all the faucets encouraged to pay back the tBTC once you have completed the test. I'm a bit confused though what you are trying to test. I don't know how bitpay works. Who are going to receive the tBTC? Bitpay or you? Why don't you use a small value product to test?",

Create a product for 1000 sat, and you can test many times with the coins you can get in seconds from a faucet. Since you have 0.3 tBTC already, you can test it about 30,000 times. The whole \"$3000\" concept is meaningless in Testnet anyway.",

It's a service that treats bitcoin as non-fungible, and you forfeit the ownership of your coins to use it (as merchant), so it's kinda against the principles of bitcoin. Instead, check out BTCPay Server. It's open-source reputable software, non-custodial, and treats each coin equally. That being said, you don't need a huge amount of tBTC to test. The 0.3 tBTC you have is enough. Also, BitPay is not gonna tell you anything if you send testnet coins; it's the real money that concerns them.",
