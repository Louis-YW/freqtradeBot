      "body": "I'm failing to see how this approach can actually help with inflation. Gold is used globally by individuals as a hedge for inflation, making gold a legal tender would not necessarily affect spending or inflation rates; It is just sort of a reminder to the citizens that they can explore other hedges against inflation, while the currency collapses.It also comes as no surprise that the citizens are actually not bought into the idea of trading off their local currency for gold coins. The country has shown inability to maintain the economy over the years and has been unable to instill any sort of confidence in the populace, and even switching to USD and abandoning their local currency again would do little to change that.",

Adopting any currency because of the impact that has lost public confidence in the government's failure to deal with inflation will continue to have a long tail. Whether using gold or dollars, in fact for now it will only be temporary. The main task remains to restore the value of fiat to a better level. The government there is confused about where to start, based on the hampered economic movement, getting out of the zone of destruction can no longer be contained.",

With inflation spiraling out of control in many countries, people simply do not want it and cannot trust the Zimbabwe government to act responsibly. At least it has not reached the dismal lows of hyper inflation which saw trillion dollar notes created which lost value very quickly. One day it'll be nice if people don't step in and wave Bitcoin around like it is some magic bullet to every currency crisis, it simply is inaccessible to many people in poorer countries and cannot handle anywhere near the transaction loads that are required.",

I see it as a desperate move, no government will let its fiat disappear and adopt gold unless they did not had too much of a choice, however if was one of the citizens of Zimbabwe I will be incredibly worried about this, since I will not trust at all those coins are actually made of gold or if those coins actually have the gold content the government claims, so in that situation it is better to keep whatever dollars and other foreign currencies people got as this seems to me as an effort by the government to try to get some foreign currency out of their citizens.",

They had banknotes of trillions of dollars; we removed 14 zeros to our currency: 3 on 2007, 5 in 2018 and 6 in 2021.Our inflation has slow down significatively and thus we still use our local currency, together with USD, for example.And we indeed have quite an important volume of crypto-currencies and Binance is becoming a very common custodial wallet to pay for goods an services with stablecoins.QuoteThe use of gold will be good because they do not have an official currency, and therefore it will relieve pressure on the government, but how will gold be ensured? And how to ensure that fraud does not occur?In my oponion if they plan to literally mint gold coins for circulation, that could create a challenge when comes to preventing counterfeits. I believe it would be enough and easier to relauch the national currency, using bills which are extremely difficult to counterfeit and peg the currency to the gold within the national treasury.Crypto-currency as legal tender in such country with infrastructure problems and probably difficulties to access to internet sounds uneffective, at least for now.",

They have to secure themselves first with the main currency where they'll be known and such as Zimbabwe. At least for this country, they're trying to resolve and finding a way to get out of inflation but this isn't just all about changing the legal tender.How many currencies they've got right now aside from their own bank note/legal tender? They should be firm on this one before they resort to another possible solution because it will cost them a lot of loss. Yeah, I may agree about doing the same thing about CAR and El Salvador of adding bitcoin as a legal tender while having those other currencies they think will save their economy.",

Which is poor to middle class earners lacking access to inflation protected assets which could protect their wealth from inflation devaluation.Gold isn't a perfect solution. It can be prone towards scams. Metals like tungsten which have a similar density and volume to weight ratio as gold can be used to make counterfeit gold bars and coins. Gold has many known issues.For the majority of applications gold is still a great candidate for inflation protection.

Gold coins were more used in video games than in actual life, from antiquity to the middle ages people used silver coins and often they would split those into two or 4 pieces to cover purchases and depending on the country and age resort to copper pieces for change.
