  "content": "Hi Guys!I had some bad hashboards from the antminer 17-serie layinga round. I got a tip to prewarm the bad hashboards in the oven and then quickly put it back in the miner.Believe it or not, some hashboards started to hash once again and done that for 7 straight days.I then turned off the some off those miner and back on again. Now the miner can`t find the \"broken\" hashboard. So I prewarm them again and they started once again to hash.How does it come, what conclusion is there to take?Thanks in advance!",

Use a hairdryer instead so you you do not have to remove the boards.Only 2 reasons for needing to do this: Possibly a bad solder joint and heating the board makes it expand just enough to make contact - though odds are it would still be erratic.More likely is that the board has some 'bottom of the barrel' grade chips in it and they need to be warm before they can run at whatever voltage/frequency is being commanded.

What temperature is optimal to heat them up to? It cant get too hot, 85 degrees is the critical temperature in the Braiins software right now.",

Have a better understanding now. Good tip about checking the terminal/plugs, I guess the one`s that are connected with the data cable (2x19 pin) from the control board?",

After 1 year of constantly failed 17-serie miners. Thanks for the tip, will try to freeze the hashboard down before starting them up. Lets see my result.You are right. I am trying in the cheapest ways make those miners alive again. When I buy and receive a broken 17-serie miner. I do the following steps on each hashboard.1. Use compressed air to take away all the dust and dirt. 2. Cleaning with alcohol.3. ultrasonic cleaning with distilled water and 10% Emag EM303 Reinigungkonzentrat Platinen 500ml. Runs 5 minutes on each side with a temperature of 50 degrees.4. Rinse off the hash tables with distilled water.5. Soak them in alcohol and blow them dry with compressed air.6. Put them in the oven at 70 degrees for 20 minutes.7. flash eeprom with pickit 3.5More than willing to receive more tips on how to cheaply repair/get alive of broken 17-serie hashboards.Maybe some step I'm doing wrong, like wrong temperature, degrees, liquids...? I am far away from an expert, just taken som tip here and there. Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "I explained what causes the majority of issues on those Antminer 17 series in the previous post, now check that against the points you listed, and you will see that most of them will not solve the issue and will be a waste of both time and money.Point 1 is good for anything you buy used, point 6 is good for dead hashboards as per your own experience, and point 7 is only needed when an error that matches eeprom shows up, otherwise, it would be a waste of time.Now if I have to give you a better tip than all, it would be \"do NOT buy any 17 series at all\", Now if you are willing to invest time and money to learn how to fix those boards, go for it, you buy cheap broken 17 series for the $100Â  range, fix them, then either use or resell them, but if you are like me and \"can't fix shit\", the best thing would be to steer clear from that model.",

      "body": "An oven is most likely an overkill as it was said above. The same goes also for a heat gun and I am very skeptical about this advice. For one the heat gun can actually reach temperatures that are higher than the temperatures of an oven and secondly it does simple not correctly solve the issue. The issue is the bad soldering of the chip, that will loose connection, because the lead free solder will break over time. Yes if you heat the solder over the melting point you can actually reconnect the solder if you are lucky, but you will also probably damage some components. Still I have actually done the oven method, for one simply reason: I did not have the time or tools for a correct repair. Since the only option then was for me to throw the hardware away, I tried the oven method. It did actually fix the issue for some weeks and that was the only thing that I wanted.",
