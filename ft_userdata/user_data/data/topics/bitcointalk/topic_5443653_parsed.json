  "content": "BTCBTC Hey All, BTCBTCAfter almost two years after getting into Bitcoin, I've finally came to set up my first full node. I'm using Umbrel that I installed on a external ssd. Before this, I was struggling to find the hardware to configure my node due to budget and efficiency reasons. I imagine this is a common problem for people that want to start their own Bitcoin node. So I decided to build a niche marketplace for people to buy and sell hardware that can used to host a Bitcoin Node. You can check it out at www.bitsuuq.live If you have any questions, let me know on my instagram @bitsuuq or email me at support@bitsuuq.liveFeedback is appreciated!",

      "body": "According to the footer of your website, it is related to Kooxtasir Industries. Are you part of them? Is this their website[1]? I've never heard anything about them before. It looks like an amateur website too, so it is really hard to tell if this is a real business or just a result of someone building a website to learn HTML.I also think it is not a good idea to limit the browsing experience by locking the products behind a registration page. At the very least new users should be able to see what products are you selling, and when they decide to check out you can redirect them to the registration page. Other marketplaces do this already, no one would bother looking at your website if they can browse other websites easily.[1] https://kooxtasir.com/services.html",

How do you pronounce it [Suuq (suck or sook)]?Quote from: https://bitsuuq.live/Easy ReturnsNo Questions AskedI don't think most vendors would like this part... Without any rules, certain types of buyers would definitely try to take advantage of this situation!Quote from: https://bitsuuq.live/about/Images of items have to be taken by camera (No stock images).It'd be better if you were asking vendors to also include a handwritten note with the date and their store names [e.g. like this].",

Are you testrunning the site with the already listed products I'm seeing on the site? The seller's information, is it only centered on reviews other than profiles? I suggest that they should be a page for the seller's information for trust purposes. How do you intend to Target your traffic? The market is rich, targeting audience; sellers and buyers won't be that hard yet can be a hassle.",

Here are 2 problems, the first one is the price, as you can see people can but the same SD card for $4 on ebay:https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=micro+sd&_sacat=0&rt=nc&Storage%2520Capacity=16%2520GB&_dcat=96991And the second problem is the size, you can't have a Bitcoin node in 16GB, you need at least 500GB and with the spammy Ordinals, we will need at least 1TB for a full node in the next months.",

If that's the case, making it clear for the visitor would be better. If you don't do that they'd just assume that your price is way too high compared to other marketplaces. At least the product name helps for now, but adding more info would be better imo.Also, when will your company/website start its business? If this testing phase lasts long, why not do a review campaign? That should give enough incentive for people to try your marketplace. Right now, I see no reason to register because the website itself is not ready. You can start more marketing after you do that.",

Shouldn't you first fill out the actual offer, and only then do the promotion and possibly ask for feedback about your shop?you also need to correct certain omissions, for example, different currencies depending on the product. sometimes the price is expressed in USD, sometimes in Rp. you really have a lot to fix before you come out with a request for suggestions.",
