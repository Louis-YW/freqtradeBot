It works in the same way on many other platforms and other providers as well. A few days ago, I was trying to play baccarat, and it wasn't opening for me. I checked the link, and I was like, really? Is it works this way? The link works like a referral link of the casino when they redirect you to the softswiss.praggmaticplay.net (Or some other provider as well). @OP, I believe this is just a display glitch. When it credits your winnings, I see you won $4, and it's credited you over $200. I believe Rollbit has a better explanation for it. I have a few questions for you. As I can see, You started playing with $961. How much you have deposited? Can you please show us your most recent deposit? Can you show us your bet history? Did you reach the Rollbit forum representative?",

At 0:15 in the video, you don't even win, but it takes your balance up from $556 to $676. And then in the following spin, it goes down from $676 to $546.

A few seconds later, it goes up to $432, then down to $277. Etc., etc.I don't think those bets happened in those amounts. It must be a bug as some people mentioned.

Without the actual betting history, it's hard to take his accusation seriously. Worst of it he deleted his account.But I believe it's just a case of an upset gambler who has lost all the sum in a bet and is still in denial. Those slot games can be brutal at times.",

It's a persons own  choose to delete their accounts for many reasons, and some of which has nothing to do with this situation. I think that it's possible that the @OP has lost the money as a result of technical glitch or and error or maybe because of his own irresponsibility. However, we still can't take those claims as truth without proper supporting evidence, and we all know that betting is a high risk activity in which a user can lose the bet anytime.",

Very believable.      It's possible that the OP lacked the knowledge or understanding of the importance of creating backups, which could be due to his inexperience or negligence in the world of betting. Additionally, people may choose to delete their accounts for a variety of reasons, some of which may have nothing to do with the situation at hand.In my opinion, it's plausible that the OP lost their money as a result of a technical glitch, error, or perhaps due to their own irresponsibility. However, without supporting evidence, it is difficult to take such claims as truth. Betting is a high-risk activity, and there is always the possibility of losing everything you have.That was a very bad idea if you have an issue you never delete your account until the issue is resolved because you will need all the pieces of evidence you need to back up your claims, this does not only apply to online casinos but on all platforms, now how can Rollbit trace the account if its nowhere to be found.This is the first time I discover a complainant deleting his account may be out of frustration but this complaint will get nowhere without the betting history, so the lesson here is if you have a valid complaint secure your pieces of evidence first and let the casino delete your account not you.",
