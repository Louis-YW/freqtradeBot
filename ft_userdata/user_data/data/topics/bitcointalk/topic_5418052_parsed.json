I doubt many user here are using same strategy as yours that hunts huge multiplier using consistent bet of small amount until you hit your target multiplier. Most of the time players here are winning insane multiplier on slots but not that same level. Can you share how much you spend before you finally hit that multiplier. This is my first time someone hit 100k multiplier on limbo.",

I bet on crazy time I hit x300+ multiplier. After that I stop playing that live show games since I’m just losing most of the time that nearly empty my previous profit.

You have a very good luck if yoh happen to only bet one before that or a few. If I remember it correctly, my biggest multiplier was only around 1000+ to 2000x. So i find that 100k+ x very lucky.Ofcourse that's a big hit",

I have seen people hitting bigger and bigger multipliers in the Games and Round section.  Whether it is roobet, Duelbit or some other casino, people will just throw themselves into various slots and play multipliers likes 777, or even 1000 plus many times. I have rarely hit anything above 100x multiplier and I find myself badly unlucky when it comes to playing slots. All I have hit is around 30-50x max and nothing above that. I always play very cautiously and do not put anything above 10 cents per bet including combination of lines and coins too. Congrats on your win. I hope you had maximum profit in that since before that there would have been huge slides for you. :-D",

It never worked for me. The more l lost money when I get to cross my fingers in rolling dice. The sad part is that I meant the money for investing in riding a coin that is pumping.I get lucky with sports though. Sometimes the odds are giving the signal to bet which made me accumulate the wins.",

I won by playing on a dice game and I was trying out a strategy that I found online which only works one time and I lose almost the same amount the next day doing the same thing.Anyways, Nice win with that kind of multiplier, I would love to know about the bet you did on that one.",

Gambling result is random, you may need patience to have your turn to get higher wins.  As long as you keep betting regularly, there is a chance that you can hit big time in the future. Since you are playing slots, you might try different slot providers, who know your lucky slot is just hiding somewhere.  Just don't chase losses and always make sure that you are betting what you can afford to lose.My last big win  was just 4 days ago.  I happen to hit a good bonus round on Moon Princess 100.  Detail is on this post.  I turned the €25 free bets into 16mBTC.  Quote from: panjul07 on October 23, 2022, 03:03:55 PMI shared my last big win here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5249415.msg61130023#msg61130023It was a win on Fruit Party, I hit the max win with a $0.3 base bet so I won around $1,500 Best thing in my last big win is that I did not spend too much and I hit it with no more than 150 spins.
