So far all i could find was cex.io but they charge 0,3% or $60 for SWIFT minimum  . Unfortunately p2p and DEXs don't serve my exact purpose.",

From my understanding (and I could be wrong) USDx, EURx, etc. are stablecoins that I personally never heard of (and I doubt anyone else here did either) so it might be a good idea to just trade your coins, and withdraw. It's already not advisable to keep your funds in exchange, so doing so using an unknown stablecoin does not really help.",

Is there a better place to ask about this?",
