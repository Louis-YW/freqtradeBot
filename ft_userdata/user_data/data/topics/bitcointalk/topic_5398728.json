  "content": "Hi everyone,First post here, trying to showcase mining software as part of a school final project. (DISCLAIMER: I understand mining BTC with a CPU is absolutely worthless, this is for informative/educational purposes only)I've setup minerd.exe to solo mine with the following command: minerd.exe -a sha256d -o http://127.0.0.1:8332 -O user:password --coinbase-addr=xxxxxxxxxxThe output I get in cmd is this:[2022-05-15 03:31:59] LONGPOLL pushed new work[2022-05-15 03:32:00] thread 4: 268435424 hashes, 11537 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 12: 268435424 hashes, 10787 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 11: 125082152 hashes, 9109 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 14: 144103736 hashes, 9329 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 10: 224541064 hashes, 10124 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 5: 204924616 hashes, 9975 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 9: 20562568 hashes, 7822 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 15: 162699176 hashes, 9544 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 3: 69090224 hashes, 8300 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 0: 35736592 hashes, 7920 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 13: 248499488 hashes, 10462 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 6: 181701152 hashes, 9736 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 1: 5105120 hashes, 8230 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 7: 103142424 hashes, 8737 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 8: 53014976 hashes, 8157 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:03] thread 2: 86872680 hashes, 8614 khash/s[2022-05-15 03:32:04] LONGPOLL pushed new workMy question is, what does \"LONGPOLL pushed new work\" mean? I can't find it in the documentation for cpuminer.Some results on the web show it is to inform the network a block has been found, so that work is stopped on solving the current block and started on the next (to avoid wasting time), however i noticed that in some other threads about LONGPOLL, the message says \"Stratum detected a new block\", \"LONGPULL detected a new block\". Could someone kindly explain the difference between these three? (LONGPOLL new work, vs Stratum detected new block, LONGPOLL detected a new block etc...even if the answer is pretty self-explanatory in the name).Lastly, I am making a slide comparing pool mining vs solo mining. It's been about a couple of hours since I started mining and no share has been submitted for this f2pool I am experimenting with. (could someone verify if this cmd command is correct? the worker is not showing up as generating work on the f2pool website).minerd.exe -a sha256d -o stratum+tcp://b4c.f2pool.com:1228 -O account_name.worker_name:password --coinbase-addr=xxxxxxxxxxx[2022-05-15 04:13:31] thread 3: 268435424 hashes, 7234 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:31] thread 6: 268435424 hashes, 7243 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:31] thread 11: 268435424 hashes, 7200 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:31] thread 12: 268435424 hashes, 7221 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:32] thread 4: 268435424 hashes, 7224 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:32] thread 15: 268435424 hashes, 7196 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 0: 268435424 hashes, 7179 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 8: 268435424 hashes, 7176 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 7: 268435424 hashes, 7177 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 1: 268435424 hashes, 7160 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 2: 268435424 hashes, 7174 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 10: 268435424 hashes, 7149 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:33] thread 9: 268435424 hashes, 7173 khash/s[2022-05-15 04:13:58] Stratum requested work restartGreatly appreciate all response/suggestions.Thanks!",

      "body": "You are not submitting shares to f2VERY basic view of it:Bitcoin difficulty is very highPools accept lower difficulty shares to prove that you are actually hashing / doing work.BUT a CPU is so slow that it can't even generate work up to the lower difficulty levels.Pools expect a share from you every \"X\" seconds if they don't get it they will accept lower difficulty. BUT only to a point. A CPU is well below that point. The same way a human on the sidewalk is way below the top point of the Empire State Building.Long polling (longpoll) allows worker to know when the work they are doing isn't useful anymore (new block found) it is  part of the old way of miners talking to pools / wallets when using the getwork protocol.Stratum is the newer (2010? 11?) better faster way of miners talking to pools. Wallets do not implement stratum.-Dave",

Could someone kindly explain the difference between these three? (LONGPOLL new work, vs Stratum detected new block, LONGPOLL detected a new block etc...even if the answer is pretty self-explanatory in the name).They have the same meaning, just different protocols, LONG POOLING is an HTTP connection between your PC and pool which the server drops when it senses a new block found by the network, before dropping the connection it will send a new getwork, I also think it may push a new work if you submit invalid shares for reasons like exhausting the nonce (which I don't think is the case with your CPU).This old getwork method is probably done with, I don't think any pools support it nowadays not even the new getblocktemplate improvement. Stratum is a new protocol that is a lot more efficient and it's the most commonly used nowadays.QuoteLastly, I am making a slide comparing pool mining vs solo mining. It's been about a couple of hours since I started mining and no share has been submitted for this f2pool I am experimenting with. (could someone verify if this cmd command is correct? the worker is not showing up as generating work on the f2pool website).I can't tell for sure if your settings are correct, sadly, when people were mining with their CPUs back then I don't even think I heard about bitcoin   , all the info I have regarding these old mining methods come from reading out of passion, but it does seem like you initiated a stratum connection and it went through, but your CPU can't submit a share greater than the minimum diff requested by the pool.If you leave it there long enough or use a pool that has lower diff, you might register there, but with 10kh worth of hashrate,hm,, it could take forever.Since you are doing this for some study purposes I suggest you stick to testnet and stop trying on the mainnet, the difficulty is pretty low there, another option would be getting a USB stick that hashes in the Terahash region.",

      "body": "If the testnet difficulty is still to high to find a block with your CPU. s a thAought there are some altcoins out there which are pretty much dead but still have active nodes / miners you can probably find one of them that you can CPU mine.Keep in mind there is no way to do anything with these coins other then mine. No exchanges / no value just kept alive because people want to keep them going.If you are looking to learn playing with those may help you. Testnet is better since it is BTC, but not if you can't do what you need to do.-Dave",
