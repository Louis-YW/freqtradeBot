Cant find this problem on an android phone. Hence, I thin Im gonna try to use desktop instead of the app, maybe there was something wrong in the apple format.",

I think you know that metamask on Apple is not safe to use. Metamask saves a backup to iCloud.Read how to turn it off.The new mediamask is very easy to set uphttps://chainlist.org/You connect to this site and add the necessary networks.Next, you copy the addresses of smart contracts on Coingeco and add the necessary tokens to your wallet.If you have a large amount of tokens, then I would buy a small lightweight 13-inch ultrabook and a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet.",

I think the best thing to do is precisely describe the challenges you are facing and include screenshots plus error messages that you are seeing.I hope you are aware that some of these so-called Dexes have started restricting people from other regions. Make sure you are from a region that is not restricted.",

If so, you should be fine. Try using Browser MetaMask extension and recover from there until you fix your app/iCloud.",

If i were you if you can install another browser on you iPhone that has extension such yandex or whatever it is, i suggest must try it and for sure it work correctly. Dont used the app coz maybe it's not compatible anymore in your device. If you have Desktop or laptop it will be a good idea as well.",
