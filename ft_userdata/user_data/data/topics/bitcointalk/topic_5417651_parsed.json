They fail miserably in the natural because they don't control it. They only try to predict nature but our CREATOR is above them if they try to use it to their advantage especially by trying to go against the Will of the CREATOR or trying to harm HIS Children. In regards to the underlined, people should try as much as possible not to be controlled by the system. Be more independent of it and it will be hard for them to predict you. Beware and be conscious of monitoring devices that constantly observe you in order to understand & predict. Don't assume they are not monitoring if you don't have the devices around. They could be up there in the sky, on tall buildings, network mask or tall things in general. The monitoring devices & ai are part of the matrix and have been in existence. It's an interconnected system trying to mimicking the natural/spiritual system which most humans are not aware of. If they do, they will be shocked how blessed humans are,and will understand how insignificant the artificial world they built is.",
