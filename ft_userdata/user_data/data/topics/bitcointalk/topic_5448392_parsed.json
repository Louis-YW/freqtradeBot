Up till now none of the projects owners who are involved in the scheme has not faced the law and as a matter of fact, they walking the street as free citizens while they have destroyed the life of hundreds of their victims, and even though there is no authority pronounced illegality of this fraudulent machinism call pump and dump none have been jailed for doing so.",

That is why you may still see pump and dump projects like this and no one arrested. Buy bitcoin or other reputed coins with huge marketcap instead of gambling with your money. But some altcoins with huge marketcap can also becoming nothing in some minutes, just like Luna, UST and FTT token. See altcoins as gambling, but they can give more ROI, invest just very little amount of money on altcoins.",

Just as said, if you know you do not have the money to gamble with investing in altcoins, just stick to buying and investing in bitcoins that is a bit more surer. Many people have been victims of pump and dump schemes just as a few lucky persons have benefited from it because they were not greedy and knew that they had to take profit from the altcoin while it is pumping instead of making the mistake that some people do of wanting to see how high the pump will get. As a crypto user, if you must invest in altcoins, know that pump and dump is very possible, so always know when to take profit.",
