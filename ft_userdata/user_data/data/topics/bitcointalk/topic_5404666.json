The fee used is 10.235 sat/vbyte (6.415 sat/byte), one of the reasons it is not successfully included for acceleration. I will also suggest LDU QUITO to wait, the transaction will be confirmed if the mempool become less congested, even not that congested for now.Edit: the transaction has be confirmed.",
