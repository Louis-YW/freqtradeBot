That's my primary goal. I want to draw my readers into the world of cryptocurrency and giving the website a nice boost. A big specific group loves our content and the way we work en they are interested in cryptos as they feel their privacy comes to an end when they hear the plans about a centralized crypto run by the government.I want to monetize my website now, but with crypto-related products or services.Where shoud I post this to get the right people to read it?I followed some advise, I wrote casinos and exchangers but untill now I just found 1 small deal.",

That's if you want to get paid on BTC and USD. But for other altcoins payment services, your service will be best advertise on the  Altcoins service discussion board  You then then use your created portfolio to search for your desire clients and share them your service Link",

      "body": "Well, you know what they say, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Every website owner has gotta find their own way and figure out what works best for monetizing from their site. Some may find success through affiliate marketing, while others may prefer generating revenue through display ads. Â If you are looking to offer your services, the Services section is the ideal place to do so. I recommend paying close attention to the content of your post. It is also important to include as much relevant information as possible so that potential clients can better understand the value and scope of your services. So, make sure to craft your post thoughtfully, making it as informative and engaging as possible.Quote from: Freedom4All on June 28, 2023, 08:30:30 PM~I followed some advise, I wrote casinos and exchangers but untill now I just found 1 small deal.Finding deals in the casino industry can be challenging. It is a competitive market, and it may take some time. Is your website somehow related to cryptocurrencies? Also, it is possible that potential clients don't see it as the right fit for their target audience. Or, perhaps you did not effectively presented your offer.",

No Amazon Ads, no providers of platforms that connect websites and advertisers.The site is primarily visited by people who fear that everything is being centralized, including (digital) money. And they yearn for knowledge about bitcoins and how to get involved.I want to brainstorm with interested parties on what we can do to actually help our followers protect their privacy as much as possible.Our followers aren't crypto enthusiasts, but people who want to get to know and purchase cryptos as an alternative. My followers see that as freedom. And so do I.The followers aren't crypto experts, but people who want to get to know the crypto world and dive into it.Beginners, so to speak.And I hope to find a \"match\" here. Two dhonest individuals with different skills can conduct good business together in a fun and lawful manner. I see so many opportunities, but I need to start from scratch.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Because want you saying there is to provide services and this board is not for service as you can see the Board name. I know you why creating the two. You are creating one topic in two different boards because you want people to know about your services but that is wrong. Everyone knows that service board is for advertisement and other services so you don't have to create the accounts.
