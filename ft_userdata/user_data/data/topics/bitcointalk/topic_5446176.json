  "content": "I wanted to share this, I am imagine most people have seen Greenpeace's hit piece on Bitcoin (paid for by Chris Larson).   I do NOT support this cause at all; however, I really like the art from Von Wong and from what I hear, he is rethinking his position on Bitcoin and it's impact to the environment.In any case, long story short, you can get a free sticker.  I requested one, as I find it an interesting free collectible that will never see the light of day!  A win/win if a pro-Bitcoiner gets one of these:https://engage.us.greenpeace.org/PRVBAQyiOk6Y03SS-dA6Dw2Again, I do NOT support the code change, but do appreciate the art and feel this whole initiative will eventually be one of the best things for people to understand Bitcoin's cooperation with alternative energy.Thanks!",

I signed up to have a couple of them sent to me. Not sure what I’ll do with them, but it’s funny to think about all the resources this dumbass campaign wasted just to get Bitcoiners some stickers they will be proud of because the campaign was done so poorly. With this type of idiocy, I’m surprised Greenpeace isn’t a government entity.",

Forgot all about it and pleasantly surprised... Damn. I’m betting I threw mine out unless it hasn’t come yet. I got notification that one came to my post office box so I’ll have to be more careful combing through that mess of advertisements. I feel like advertising has ruined mail and telemarketers are trying their best to ruin phones being useful for calls. It’s also possible I don’t take mail or phone calls seriously enough. I do enjoy messing with telemarketers. Useless tidbit: As I was typing this in a lobby, someone named Craig Wright just came in. I did a double take.",
