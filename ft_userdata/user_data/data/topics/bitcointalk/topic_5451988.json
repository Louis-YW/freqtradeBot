As of today 9th of may, the bear market has reached $27605, leaving many investor to wonder if this downtrend will continue or if we should be expecting a recovery any time soon.  The current bear market is it going to be temporary or a long term? for my fellow investors out there, how are you managing during this downturn? are you still holding onto your assets or buying more?

There is bear market again but it is certain that bitcoin will get to all-time-high. It may take a year or two years before this would happen but it would definitely happen. It is not even a bear market to me yet until I see bitcoin at $23000 to $20000 again in the bear trend. This will make me buy bitcoin again significantly. All-time-high is certain.",

That's just my own prediction because I already made a couple of bucks from ups and down these past few weeks.",

      "body": "Currently price has been range-bound between $27K and $31K for the past 6 weeks, that's the other way to look at the current -8% correction from recent highs around $30K. I'd otherwise say that $28K is the accumulation/distribution zone based on volume, but price has also flirted with moving above and below without much significant follow through, so for now this remains more of a \"magnet zone\" for price to return to.I said the same last month at $27K that if this level doesn't hold then we can see re-tests of previous resistance, like $25K, even $23K previous support zone where there is high volume. But as long as price remains above $27K, I don't think there's much to worry about. As for how long a correction could last, that's anyone's guess. Anywhere between 6 days and 6 months would be mine.PS - This topic otherwise belongs in speculation board",

The best course of action right now is to continue buying more bitcoin as much as you can. I anticipated that bitcoin will drop to $25k before starting to bounce back up in price. It is likely that Bitcoin will drop below $25k in a few days if the current network congestion that started today persists.",

Compared to that this is nothing, and even if we touched the bottom again this should not be seen as a crisis but as an opportunity.After all how many people have been complaining during the last months that they missed the bottom? Well, this is the opportunity they have been looking for to at least do some DCA and lower the average price at which they bought their coins, but instead a great deal of those people are panicking over nothing.",

Of course, there have been and will be such corrections in every period. The important thing is to organize our investment accordingly. What price do we expect and at what price do we want to buy? Sometimes we can't get the level we want, but according to the estimation of many, when the bull season comes 1 year later, our investment should be ready for the bulls. It goes up and down more these days. You shouldn't be stuck with them. We have to get used to these falls. What matters is how many bitcoins we have.",
