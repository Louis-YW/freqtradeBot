If you take a loook at the bounty section you’ll. price that so many hunters do register for a campaign that has just little pool and when calculated at the end of the campaign (let’s assume a four weeks campaign) each account will receive $4-$5 which is not even up to the amount they use for their internet subscription.Aside from the fact that bounty hunters get paid little or no money (when they work for a scam project) the bounty section is also considered the land of spammers, it is extremely difficult for you to get a bounty hunters that were able to grow their account here, only a few of them were able to retrace their steps here in the forum so if you don’t want your account to remain in a newbie then just avoid the bounty section.",

He says make account and than earn money with bounty and I don't have knowledge?Bounty hunters often come across as spammers in this forum. Even if you choose to participate the rewards may not be worth it. I believe that some of the bounty campaigns here that offer token based payments don't pay enough due to limitations and small prize pools. Personally, I am not inclined to accept token payments for such tasks unless the token is already listed on a reputable exchange. I would rather engage in campaigns that offer Bitcoin as payment; these tend to be more credible and have performed well within this forum.",

He says make account and than earn money with bounty and I don't have knowledge?Bounties were useful when solid projects were entering the crypto sector, but nowadays, practically all bounties are unworthy of consideration because almost all of them fail, especially given the current state of the cryptocurrency market. I don't believe people are interested in fresh projects because the majority of them are fraudulent.Furthermore, our dissatisfaction for bounties arises from the fact that there are things to learn in this community that are far more beneficial to bounties. If you take your time and go through this forum, you will be interested in learning Bitcoin and investing in Bitcoin rather than wasting your time on bounties that will not pay you a respectable amount.",

He says make account and than earn money with bounty and I don't have knowledge?How old was the video that you saw? As I have read from this thread and somewhere in the forum, there was a time when the bounty section was very interesting, rewarding participants with huge amounts of money, and sometimes up to 1-5% of the total token allocation was given to airdrops and bounties, but right now there isn't much of a reward coming out of bounties considering the number of participants that are also partaking in them. The reward will be very small and won't be worth much, so I don't think anyone will be making any new videos regarding how to earn from bounty now.Another thing is that it seems that back then, there were many good and potential projects that tried so hard to fulfil their promises rather than just having it in mind to scam others and rug-pulling when they hit their target.Currently, there is little coming out of bounty programmes, but they are still not completely useless, and they are not worth all of your time. If you want to give it a try, you can DYOR on a few of the projects, select the ones you will like to participate in, and see what you can get from them at the end of the campaign. But don't expect more from them. If the few that you pick among many happen to give you little things, then you can decide if you are to continue or if you are to let go of them.",

There is nothing free in this world mate except dust. Most of the altcoin bounty is a scam and only waste your time. There is a paid signature campaign but it will be extremely hard for a newbie like you to rank up and join one of those pretty soon. So it is up to you but my advice will be don't waste your time looking for money here instead use that time to learn something and in the meantime use your free time to spend in the forum in case one day you rank up and join a btc paid signature campaign.",

You have to work to complete tasks in bounties and wait for bounty manager or project team to proceed bounty reward to your wallet. Sometimes distribution never happens and your work will be wasted.In the last one year, there is a trend of retroactive airdrop and you will have to do many tasks from testnet to main net, swap, trade, mint like a real user with on-chain transactions, and wait for project teams to assess your on-chain activities before sending you airdrop token.If I do something, I will choose retroactive airdrops, not bounties.",

Main reason behind this is because this is Bear market and all projects are scam and they don't pay and also in bull run people made insane amounts with almost 1000 dollars plus in one bounty too.

He says make account and than earn money with bounty and I don't have knowledge?If we talk about a year and a half ago, it used to be a very good and lucrative reward. Almost as many bounty hunters sponsored good and strong projects, and their payouts were high. After the market crash last year, the launch of good and strong projects has decreased. At present you will find very few good projects on the bounty page. The projects that are there are paid in very small amounts and no substantial profit can be expected from their implementation. In the early days, huge sums of money were paid on projects,and the number of people participating in it was less. Now the projects raise less money, and there are a large number of participants, because of which good returns cannot be expected. Firstly, there are very few good projects and secondly, many projects are scams, there are many projects that pay in tokens, their tokens have no value in the market, thus Your hard work is wasted. There are also sponsors who get paid by the project, but they don't pay you on time and if they do, they pay you very little. So it is better to choose a good bounty hunter with good projects if you want to participate in bounty.",

But what is certain is that to choose a good bounty, we must first research the altcoin projects promoted in the bounty. if it's a good project then even a running bounty will definitely pay out well. With the condition that we have to choose a bounty that is managed by a manager who has a very good reputation in this forum. Usually they have a lot of trust bait on their account. i think its just that simple. It's just that at this time maybe it's rare for projects that are really serious about carrying out their projects. Because too many projects end up being fraudulent.",

I assume they are not familiar with how the forum works. They keep using different accounts to cheat in the bounties application which usually leads to punishment like red tags and bans. Most of these accounts are usually low-ranked accounts with little merit. These members have no interest in learning about bit on but just to learn quick money. It will be better to learn about bitcoin and the forum and be patient to grow your account to earn from other better avenues in the forum. If you are patient and build your reputation in the forum, you will get more opportunities to learn from the forum. For now, let your focus be on learning and contributing to the forum. You did the right thing by seeking the view of the community on this issue and not applying what you just git from a random YouTuber.
