      "body": "Judging by how actively TON began to develop and how many different services arise in this network, its future could be very good. 2022 was a very bad year for the whole crypto industry, but TON itself showed good results for its investors in the second half of the year. You could say that TON was a kind of safe haven for crypto investors, just like the TWT project, for example. I think investing in TON is a good decision. Not financial advice, DYOR.",

Does it have a bright future?Any idea welcome.Thank you.Telegram is the most popular social apps for crypto user right now. There blockchain has a lot active developers building different dapps. They have their own launchpad which launch many successful IDO in the past. This kind of performance only shows how huge the interest on this blockchain which is the factor on determining the future of the Blockchain.In general, investing now on TON is really good because they are still on early phased with limited dapps. This blockchain will be boom soon once the crypto market recover and other developers from different project migrate.",

It does have fast blockchain that is almost similar to conventional blockchain in the crypto ecosystem. Quote from: hack3rcon on February 19, 2023, 08:02:54 AMDoes it have a bright future?It does and why not? the utility for toncoin can be added with the goes of time and just like what already become the second usability of toncoin to buy username of telegram in https://fragment.com/I guess there will be more utility will come soon as toncoin was a long term project by telegram. I have been acquiring some toncoin at the bottom. Im sitting at around 100% profit from toncoin.",

      "body": "There's a lot of hype with this coin a few years ago and knowing that Telegram is the one of the most used social media platforms right now (aside from the fact that it's being used to scam investors), creating a coin that has been attach to Telegram will be a huge one.Currently being traded at $2.34, it's price is just almost x3 to it's starting price 2 years ago and with lots of apps and services that is under TON, I guess this will have a good future. I'm a big fan of staking coins as well, so I might buy and stake TON coins this year. I think knowing that it's attached to Telegram, it's a good coin to hold for short to mid term only (around 1-3 years maybe). DYOR still.",

The name is still have \"telegram\" but it's not actually under telegram control.So i think it's unclear for it's future value, but the volume is still good for profit trading, but for me not really worth it for long time investment",

Those coins that have real use cases and applications that are being used by millions of users are the ones that are ideal for me.Well, this is just my opinion and I don't speak anything related to anyone's investment decision and it's still your choice if you want to buy it or not. I think the second launching or marketing that's been done by them really worked for them. Because there was like a first try and it has made some noise but it wasn't successful as it's getting right now because the current ranking of TON is #27.",

Certainly, the decision that Telegram was forced to stop active development of TON slowed down the development of this project a bit, but there is still a huge, active community behind it. It is worth mentioning that there is currently a virtual hackathon organized by TON and DoraHacks with a prize pool of $180k. Participants are to create Web3 products based on TON, such as:▪️ Fi+ (DeFi, SocialFi, GameFi)▪️ Utility NFT▪️ Utility SBT (Soul Bound Token)▪️ DAO governance▪️ Web 2.5 (The Ultimate Challenge).The event ends on March 31, more information can be found here: https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/63a481aed16ae879abc15b1c/",

Does it have a bright future?Any idea welcome.Thank you.No idea about the update but I think the plans for issuing the coin were cancelled by the telegram team and the private sale investors were returned their money.But if the plan still holds, telegram would be a good platform to transfer crypto between the users. Telegram has proved itself as ban proof platform as it's nature makes it impossible for individual governments to outright ban it. And if token transactions are allowed without restriction, it could be a good platform to trade and exchange without the headache of KYC or being banned for using it on place where crypto is illegal.",

Does it have a bright future?Any idea welcome.Thank you.To evaluate a coin and its future, you need to study tokenomics and understand where the majority of tokens are located and how they were distributed. There were a lot of scandals and frauds in the distribution process, and in this regard the project is difficult to evaluate. There are many similar projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. It remains to answer the question: who has 3.4 billion coins?",
