I’ve gambling for multiple days in a row with just having a breakeven on my total bankroll. This due to the game doesn’t gave me any long winning streak and only just more losses. The only thing that makes me keep up on the breakeven side is the increased on wager to recover my losses but my gambling result is literally 1 win to 3 or more losses ratio. This is how bad my overall game. The only good news is this time I remember how this weakness of mine always makes me lose in the past so I stop already gambling and take a break. This is what I’m trying to share here. If you really feel that your gambling doesn’t want to make you move forward by having decent profit and just giving you a hard time then don’t hesitate to quit! Don’t push forward while you are already playing uncomfortably because this will just make you bet recklessly.Have a break and just gamble newt week or month because a lucky game will make you win easily and not with a very hard to win winning condition.",

This is what I’m trying to share here. If you really feel that your gambling doesn’t want to make you move forward by having decent profit and just giving you a hard time then don’t hesitate to quit! Don’t push forward while you are already playing uncomfortably because this will just make you bet recklessly.Have a break and just gamble newt week or month because a lucky game will make you win easily and not with a very hard to win winning condition.The OP's statement is very appropriate with \"don't force to play more\", of course as you experienced. If indeed the gambling that you are doing cannot give you a win or an increase then it is better to start to stop, you have been gambling for several days and even with that long time it turns out that the results are still even, nothing more and no improvement and all that exists is that you continue to lose and then when you try again several times to restore the defeat in the previous time. Honestly, it's very boring and I'm sure anyone who experiences such conditions will feel tired. Basically, it is true that gambling is only for entertainment, and if you come to win then you will face this cycle, for example, like the OP's experience here, you will only exchange one win for 5 losses or even more than that if you continue to play. True, it is actually not difficult to get a win if you are lucky, and it certainly won't take long to get it. So if you experience a cycle or condition like this you better stop, because if you continue it will only add to your financial problems. So the point is not to be greedy and stick to a healthy mindset in looking at this gambling.",

      "body": "When you are at the break-even point and try to increase the bet instead of trying to recover the loss, believe it will never happen, it can be said that it will rarely recover especially if you expect to play continuously. If you feel that the game is no longer aligned then stop because it is useless to increase as well as the ratio of losing will be more.Once when allocating $75 for a game I felt a feeling that the day would be good, but in reality it was not like that continuous defeat could be said (won twice but lost more than 4 times). At that point, I started to feel insecure because I was unlucky and it was better to take a long break for 1 month.That period of time has been experienced, a long break has also been done because too much money has been spent because it is too curious about increasing bets in the hope of recovering losses.Now I'm more scheduled and usually bet once a week.",

If I get a profit then I will continue with other bets. Maybe this is different if experienced by gamblers in one of the games at the casino which of course will be very fun when they are too focused on the game.",

And in fairness, it seems that you also bet big when you play suga when you lose just to get back your loss immediately.And I also believe in the courage you have when you bet a large amount. But the best thing about you is when you still lose your big bet and you take a break and then come back next week to make up for it, which is a good move, I guess.",

Looking at the nature of gambling itself, there are some things we also need to always out in consideration each time we are gambling, the risk involved, we shouldn't be gambling base on a retaliation protocols to make recovery of some of the losses we have made already, because at the cause of doing so we may be loosing the more, and it's ot in the amount or rate at which we increase our wager that draws us closer to making winnings each time we are gambling.Quote from: Coin_trader on October 11, 2023, 02:13:43 PMHave a break and just gamble newt week or month because a lucky game will make you win easily and not with a very hard to win winning condition.That's true, it happens in most cases that the harder you're striving for winning the lesser your chances for winning, that is why some gamblers can adopt a stop loss method to deal with theirselves while trying to reduce the rate of loosing more.",

Yesterday, i decided to play the game until my balance turns zero, but luckily for me, just when my balance remained about $1, I won a little above $5, I was kind of amazed .So yeah, it is not good or advisable to force oneself to continue playing a game when it obvious luck is not on your side, stepping away and coming back later to try again sometimes actually does the magic.",

Maybe the lucky bet is on the final of the budget, and even if it isn't, I'm not in a bad situation, since I planned using that sum of money for gambling, anyway, and I can recover it later through my work, without any further prejudice to my financial life. There is no problem in stopping when you feel it's not going to be your lucky day, but I also keep in mind the finish line must be closer than we expect in some cases, and to give up when you are just one step behind is really painful.",

      "body": "Many people chase their losses when gambling rather than resting because it will not make them calm as gamblers are always haunted by emotional feelings because of defeat and make them depressed with those feelings, even though if only they knew that continuing the game would not recover from previous losses. which you will actually make your losses bigger. There are many examples out there that we may have seen around us too. The point is, don't force yourself to play for too long.I'm sure that resting won't make the situation even more chaotic, there's still time tomorrow to play, to gamble you have to know when to play and when to stop so minimizing losses when gambling is very important, I'm one of those people who likes to gamble on weekends so I spend weekdays working and also with my family, but on weekends I usually spend just a few hours gambling.
