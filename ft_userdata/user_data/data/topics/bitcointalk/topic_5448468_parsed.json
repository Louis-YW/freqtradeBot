  "content": "Note: cryptocurrency transaction what I mean is not direct bank involvement but their services in adding faster p2p transactions without crypto related key words as those are red flagged offense by the CBNWhy I think this topic is necessary, is because of the recent events in the Nigerian banking system and how the central bank is putting more attention to e-transactions and monitoring citizens' banking transactions. Secondly why I created this thread is to also equip us with the necessary information as related to 9Ja bank vs cryptocurrency transactions, as we all are aware of the fact that the CBN have a blanket ban on the bank - cryptocurrency interactions and any account found guilty may get banned or blocked. To this challenge, a lot of cryptocurrency traders and ordinary users have become sceptical about the on most of the banks we have in our financial system because we all know the attack from the bank of cryptocurrency most especially decentralized coins such as Bitcoin since they see it as a threat to their own existence. So the ultimate question is. Which bank in Nigeria do you think is the most cryptocurrency-friendly and you have used it for your transactions without any issues, in terms of network speed, availability of bank on P2p platform and what is the extent of your trust in them to not link your accounts to crypto and leaking your data to governments agency. Â From my own experiences, I think the most cryptocurrency-friendly bank at the moment are 1: Kuda Microfinance bank 2: palmpay3: OpayThe most crypto-unfriendly bank is. 1: standard chartered bank plc, from history this bank and is known for easily flagging customers' account so cryptocurrency users are advised to avoid using the bank for cryptocurrency transactions.

      "body": "Quote from: Charles-Tim on April 12, 2023, 08:38:56 AMI missed to add this to the first thread, that no bank is crypto-friendly when the head of the banks, the CBN do not support bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What should be regarded as crypto-friendly banks are banks that go into crypto businesses, but we have none. I remember when my friend in UK wanted to buy bitcoin, he bought it using his bank and kept by the bank which he is using. There is nothing like that in Nigeria for now and CBN is making it more impossible. Although, I do encourage noncustodial, not custodial means. But just trying to point out how banks are crypto-friendly.My advice is to never have just one bank account when you can open as many possible bank accounts. With this, you will be able to see the better ones for yourself which would even be more than one.Also it is good to know that banks are centralized services, we should expect disappointments at times. This is one of the reasons we need more than one bank so that if one is having network problem, we can use the other one. I do not know which banks I can suggest because I have not before read the complete terms and conditions of all banks that I am using, not to talk if all banks in Nigeria. I am only using them to keep little amount of money. But according to someone that have experience about banks, he told me sometimes ago that First Bank and Union Banks are better because they will be able to refund back your money if they lost customers money, this can be very wrong and I do not think it is correct and not based on my own understanding.If I should suggest you a bank, Guarantee Trust Bank is good in fast transaction update.Among the OPay Digital Services Limited, Palmpay and Kuda Microfinance Bank, these are young Nigerians favorites. Young Nigerians are the ones mostly in crypto, which would not be a surprise if they are choosing these three Fintech. According to what I have noticed about people around me, they prefer Opay, Palmpay is not bad to them at all, while Kuda being the third which they fear of the Fintech company no to go down at anytime because of the rumours heard. I consider Fintech as organizations that you should not have only the amount of money that you can afford to lose with.It is worth knowing that fiat receiver should not depend on alert for transactions, they should check the bank app or login through the web.",

      "body": "Wiwo, you know very well that no bank in Nigeria accept Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). So no one is crypto friendly. Except p2p. If banks are crypto friendly they have to create platform in which Cryptocurrencies will be received and probably converted to Fiat if you don't want to sell it. Just like ramotatano app. There must be an app in the bank for Cryptocurrencies transaction.

You are contradicting the whole issue, all the transactions you made mentioned is not inline with the question Wiwo ask. Re-read it again. You are talking about Fiat Bank to Bank transaction and not crypto transaction. The exchange platforms, the vendor accept crypto to their Binance wallet and not to bank and send you Fiat money through their local banks. Crypto transaction is between your wallet and and vendor wallet. If what you are saying is the Cryptocurrency friendly transaction process then I will say all Banks are good probably it because of the network at the time transfer. But I don't think that what he means. No bank be a mobile, online and offline banking is crypto friendly. It is only exchange platforms are crypto friendly. Op if I would restructured the topic, it should be \"Which of the Crypto Exchange platforms in Nigeria is Good\"?",

One of the areas I expected you guys to comment on is in transactions speeds and transactions fees that Aid easy p2p transactions and how fast they confirm transactions, this is the major things the 9ja cryptocurrency traders are dealing with right now and again as being cryptocurrency friendly have to do with every other aspect quality and fast financial service that save the user from the hustle of visiting a physical bank to get issues resolved.",

Although the title was a little bit misleading but reading through it would give one an insight. As for transactions speed I would say this brief cashless policy has expose many of this banks. Prior to this cashless policy I used first bank for P2P transactions then although it wasnât that fast as I will have wanted but was better. Banks like Access and Guarantee Trust have also done better in terms of transaction speed but currently the best and most reliable recently is the fintechs like Opay and Palm pay. Kuda also had it hitches sometime ago and as made me to have doubts about it. So In summary my best bank for transactions is Opay while First Bank and Zenith are my pick for the frustrating ones currently",

It is today that I read this: https://fij.ng/article/n63000-deducted-from-union-bank-account-didnt-get-to-its-destination/This has happened to me before twice, in a way your fiat will hang somewhere and no recovery. While failed transaction has happened many times to me before, although reversing it is getting better day by day. Generally, banks can be very disappointing, even before they solve customers issue while not all would be solved. But as Nigeria is for now, we have to depend on bank even if we are bitcoin or crypto enthusiasts. There are times I just do not want to first convert bitcoin to fiat but prefer to send it straight as bitcoin to someone like my family or friend, but I got no option than to convert to fiat first. No store or supermarket or business around me that is accepting bitcoin which is like that everywhere in Nigeria, only few accept crypto payment, even few is still an understatement about this.Quote from: Davidvictorson on April 13, 2023, 07:22:38 AMI Sha since don dey use Access bank and no issues at all. But why e be say some banks fast and some slow?All I know is that slow transaction is common to some banks, while at times a bank can have network issue. I have used Opay since some months ago now, no issue most times. I use many banks which have fast transaction time, if one is having problem, I use the other. Even while I am exchanging bitcoin for naira, there has been times that the buyer will ask for another bank details because the one I saw is having network issue at the time.",

To avoid fear of uncertainty, receive the funds from an online bank and then transfer to your commercial bank.
