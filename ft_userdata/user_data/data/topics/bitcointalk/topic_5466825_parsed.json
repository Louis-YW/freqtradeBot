  "content": "My people I greet una ooo, I say make I share this information way I they here for news about the danger of using gas on generator, I no that the country is very hard but that doesn't mean that most of our fellow Nigerians will use there hand and kill themselves, for sometimes  now people has been using gas for generator implace of fuel without considering the danger involve, actually is not bad to substitute or navigate to easy way of surviving but should always consider our safety before taking some actions. The Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (NL PGA) has admonish the conduct of recalibration of motor vehicles and power generating set of possible explosion may accur which could be disastrous. I came across this news so I decided to share it for people to be careful on there gas usageSource:  https://leadership.ng/group-warns-of-imminent-safety-risks-over-petrol-to-gas-switch/",

      "body": "OP as you see this matter ehn, Nigerians don dey look for means to improvise to solve their problem. As e be say fuel dey on the high side people begin look for means to by pass using of petrol for generator. Using of gas to generate electricity is much cheaper and economical than the use of petrol but when it comes to  precautions that is where Nigerians do not really care about. It is not bad to use gas in place of fuel to power your generator but the safety measures is what we should look into.Looking at the picture uploaded by OP, you can see for yourself how close the generator is to the gas cylinder and I would not be telling lies if it happens that the gas cylinder is always close to the generator when ever it is on.  I have come to realize that most Nigerians are not safety conscious and do not bother themselves on the dangers of poor safety awareness. I am saying this out of experience of occurrences around. It is not funny though.",

This would help correct the explosion.",

      "body": "This new innovation of powering generator sets is something I haven't come to terms with I'm terms of the safety measures and how it's at same time handled by unprofessionals that have little or no idea on how to handle liquified natural gas. Gas explosion is usually disastrous and this practice by commercial bet shops is very dangerous not only to their workers, but for customers and ordinary people around that vicinity in the case of an explosion . The government need to do something about this to avoid impending loss. - Just my my piece of mind though",

No vex, ah no dey compare, but na the truth. If you look other countries, dem fit use the same method, but e no go be like the way we dey do am here. Dem fit don build gas cylinder wey fit attach to the generator with better material, because dem wan reduce the wahala wey fit happen. But for our country, anything wey we see, we just dey use am. Some people sef dey use gas cylinder wey no good at all.If you look most of those countries, e dey compulsory say every house suppose get fire extinguisher and the number wey you fit call fire fighters. Abeg, how many of us fit talk say dem get fire extinguisher for house or dem sabi fire fighter number for Nigeria? I think say we suppose dey look the wahala wey fit happen, since we no get solution to any wahala wey fit show face. Because even if the wahala no affect you, e fit cause damage to the person wey get the house or hin neighbors.",

But the truth of the matter be say, Nigerians go hardly fit management the safety precautions of switching to this gas thing.From the photo you shared. The distance between thst gas cylinder with the gen no fit pass one foot. Please in the event wey that Generator con begin dey spark and getting very hot, e no fit cause explosion? But how many of our people no care, dem plenty.Secondly, how many of our generator houses they get the proper ventilation? Na so person go close gen and gas cylinder inside one confined place. As ventilation no get enter well, the space go begin more heat generation wey fit con lead to fire combustion.Lastly, LPG na gas wey get the potential for combustion, if person mishandle am, e fit come fall for inside the gen house that alone fit make am blow.The risks many share. But to solve petrol problem, government too suppose put hand inside this matter provide us stable electricity. Na cray fish make fish bend like this.",

Although say many people no like the idea of this conversion thing just because of fear way the get for gas, and I they feel am say nah the reason way make them they criticize am.As e be so, we supposed to thank the person way bring the idea come because e done help plenty people both people way they use light for their businesses and those people way they use am privately for their houses, abi if we no get money to buy fuel and we no get nepa light, so make we sleep for darkness? (No na).If I go imagine far,,,, I go talk say the reason why government no support this idea na because people done they run from fuel because of the price.",

Una go believe say because of how much people dey change their generator carburator from petrol only to gas/petrol, gas price dun increase for market currently, the gas sef nor come dey easy to see. The thing dey dangerous but how you want make some people do, when e be say dem get business to run, dem nor dey get light even though dem dey pay bill, petrol now cun dey very expensive and e dey finish quick. Imagine business like mini supermarket, frozen food business and even boutique dem wear ligh need dey make everythind dey go fine fine, dem nor go fit afford to dey buy petrol everytime untop the small profit. Some people dey buy fuel for their business place, buy for motor, buy for generator for house too...How much go remain for the person pocket. Upon say e dey dangerous, people go still dey run am.",

We all understand that converting our generator to cooking gas is very dangerous, and I don't think we should give up because we don't have any alternative as the price of Petronas is steadily raising up and the issue of explosions would never happen if we used it by God's grace.But they're so arrogant that they don't know how to fix it and they won't call the engineers that Sabi the work; their we'll be claiming that they're perfect and them don't know that's a problem they want to create for themselves.",
