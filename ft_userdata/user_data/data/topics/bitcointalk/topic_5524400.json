  "content": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/losses-crypto-hacks-jump-22-bln-2024-report-says-2024-12-19/QuoteDec 19 (Reuters) - Funds stolen by hacking cryptocurrency platforms surged 21% from a year ago to $2.2 billion in 2024, a report from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis showed on Thursday.The hacking amount exceeded $1 billion for the fourth straight year and the number of incidents rose to 303 from 282 in 2023, it said. Hackers had stolen $1.8 billion in 2023.The rise in crypto heists comes as bitcoin BTC= jumped 140% this year to surpass $100,000 mark, drawing institutional participation and backing from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.Do you think this kind of news could impact Bitcoin adoption in the future? Because if you look at the trends, crypto related crimes has been steadily increasing year by year. Despite governments tightening regulations, it seems like those measures haven’t had much of a positive effect, at least not according to the numbers.I’ve been in crypto for a while, and news about hacks is still pretty common. Most of the time, these incidents are the user’s fault, like poor security practices. It feels like this is an area governments haven’t fully explored yet.So, the real question is, how can they educate people to minimize these crimes? Teaching users proper security measures could do more to protect the crypto ecosystem than simply imposing regulations.",

And I don't see it happening in the near future, simply because the government views the usage of crypto / Bitcoin as an investment tool currently, not something that would be an alternative for the common people.",

They will probably mess up more by bringing in some unrealistic regulations which will affect every type of users more than a hacking incident! To be honest, government won't be bothered about such hacking incidents unless some big corporates are affected by it. They simply don't have any such infrastructure to pinpoint and identify a crypto hacker. They will need help from outside agencies like Chainanalysis etc. The education here is more important on how to keep our cryptos safe and secure. Again government is not much worried about it because the Banks will not allow them to do it. That's a huge lobby going on in the background.",

They hacked all those big wallets of exchanges, liquidity pools, etc., till now, very smartly, although I agree if the developers of these products were smarter than these hackers, then there might be no hacks. Speaking of small fishy scams done by spammers is different from hacking. I think it is a good news that government has involved in crypto before they were not that much (means it was not regulated).Now it is so they will definitely set departments for these types of cases (where it's legal) before hackers and spammers knew the government did not give a damn about it so they did all these openly but now with time and scrunities I hope this will also get sorted like other crimes.",

A lot of these hacks are caused by the individual himself due to not being careful or whatnot.
