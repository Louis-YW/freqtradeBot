I want ask a question as an old forum user, is it not prohibited when someone discussed something that is not contrary to bitcoin education in this board.Instead of formulating what is not real to write, it's better to make research of bitcoin and educate others through your research, some people make some posts without making it to be informative, some gives testimonies of their achievement with bitcoin without proven the evidence. I think we are to exchange of bitcoin knowledge and share experience's of bitcoins to each other not to give a fake information of what Bitcoin has done to you without evidence.",

If I'm the one who can be moved with this kind of stories I will not have sympathy on them because all the information is fake and is worth to emulate. I know that everyone has right to exercise it opinion but some opinion is suppose to be informative not giving a fiction. I will not like the situation where by the will be ban because of those kind of stories but let the thread should locked or trashed by the mod, i think that should be nice than banning",

And specially stories that came from newbies and too good to be true story? For sure the members are going to ask him a lot of question to that point that we can say that he is just making up stories to get some merits.So if you find new threads here, then you can ask the OP itself and if he didn't come back to answer then simply ignore him/her.And then there are newbies who simply shill for certain projects and it's going to be obvious as well.",

They don't know that those stories wouldn't give them merits but instead it will make forum members to see them as dishonest people and might even lead to putting them on ignore. It is better in improve yourself my learning and your own research so to grow in the forum rather cooking up lies because for how long will you cook up lies that will make you grow in the forum and improve yourself.",

I'm also thinking with the same reason. This kind of post typhically get atleast one merit if the story is real good even if it's obviously fictional. I don't hate this kind of things or iritates me, sometimes it's quite entrtaining to read some newbie stories. There are just stories that are quite repetitive which makes it boring and makes us think it's a made up story.Should we demand for proofs of their story or atleast demand a disclaimer that it's a fictional story that they want to portray?",

But at the same time, how often are newcomers here disgraced, declaring today a cool business, although yesterday he wrote that he doesn’t know a damn thing about Bitcoin?Not only does the Internet remember everything, but the forum is also very good at archiving posts, and sometimes the travel story of a storyteller on the forum goes beyond all boundaries of lies, which ultimately affects the user’s reputation.You shouldn’t treat those present here as people who don’t know how to read; vivid stories are remembered, and then, most often, you want to know more about the writer.Therefore, if you want to play a fairy-tale millionaire, match it with both knowledge and posts.",
