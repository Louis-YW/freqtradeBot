Sorry for being almost a year late to respond to your query. Current Crypto scenario for on & off ramping in India is a bit dicey. Volume at WazirX, UnoCoin or other KYC exchanges registered in India are mostly dried up. This has happened because of 1% TDS and 30% income tax implementation since April 2023. Direct deposit or withdrawal does not work on most as most Indian exchanges got their bank accounts frozen. People, being forced to use P2P, have mostly shifted to foreign KYC exchanges like Binance/KuCoin/MEXC etc. Many have shifted to non-KYC P2P exchanges like HodlHodl/LocalCoinSwap/AgoraDesk/LocalMonero etc. Lately, P2P on Telegram through their Crypto Wallet service is also on the rise. You'll need to check these services for their respective fees structure.",
