The implications of a war of that magnitude would not be comparable to anything seen in this planet before, and because of the grade of weaponery many governments have nowadays, I would dare to say that there would not be stone over stone after the conflict and the currency to be used by anyone (assuming there would be anyone around) would be seeds, food, drinkable water and perhaps gold.Let us not to talk about war so slightly, it is a serious manner and we all are supposed to avoid it...",

Why do you think that the third world war will happen. Why does it seems like we wish for things so scary and disastrous to happen. Because there was first world war and second, does not mean that there will be third world war. Warfares are the worse situations that can ever happen to a people, states and countries because of the dangers it comes with, wars are highly disastrous and never to be wished for.I know your observation is not just to promote the 3rd world war like before, but to begin to prepare for it in an event it strikes in, how prepared are we truly, psychologically and physically. It is not somwthing anyone is ever ready for I don’t want to believe that with the high level of awareness, any nation will go to war. I think was are things of the past now.Crypto currencies will thrive regardless of the situation because the world is evolving around the adoption of technology today. AI and Machine Learning are becoming the skills of the day and career. As the world gets going, there could be what I refer to as an Information Technology Revolution, where developed countries with resources will compete towards rapid development and adoption of new technologies.",

You should be relieved to know that the BRICS officially issuing a global and multinational currency is very unlikely to happen. You know why? Because even among those BRICS members which seem to be powerful and have a anatognistic relation with the United States, they still have problems amoung each other. Take for example China and India, which are the bulk of the Economical power of the BRICS, to this day they still have conflicts over their border in the Himalayas, to the point they have had clashes. How are they supposed to try to dethrone the USA economical if they can't even get along and solve territorial problems and conflicts? You may be underestimating your government.",

      "body": "The concept of World War III is a very serious and relatable topic, and it's understandable that people might feel anxious and curious about it. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty which currency will take the position of reserve currency or international currency during World War III. Historically, the US dollar has been the dominant reserve currency, but there are several possibilities for replacement, including the euro, the Chinese yuan, and even a new digital currency like bitcoin. The outcome will depend on the respective economic and geopolitical stability of the countries involved in the conflict, as well as potential alliances and agreements formed during and after the war. I think any significant change in reserve currency status will be the result of long-term structural changes rather than a single event like a war.",

As much as I don't want to see another war triggers but if there are signs already, still, I don't want to see it happen anytime soon. But in regards to this, we've seen that there will be more members of the BRICS this coming 2024.So with that, as speculation by many, Chinese RMB is what they think that shall emerge.

Germans lost the last war, so there was no way for them to dictate any terms, but think of what would happen if they won. We'd all be speaking German and hold German Marks in our wallets. When such conflict happens the world will divide and we don't know between which countries. One thing is fairly certain that NATO, EU and Israel would be on one side, along with Japan, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan... Russia, Belarus, China and North Korea would most likely form the opposition, with Iran and Syria. Some of you say that Chinese currency would replace the USD in such situation and I don't think so. I really doubt the group lead by China and Russia could defeat the rest of the world. If the world happened today and China and Russia decided to conquer the US, they wouldn't be able to do it, even if there was no other country helping. There's very little chance of a world war happening ever again because it's impossible to beat any of these big alliances.",

While it's said that their economy is on the brink are they just going to let it go? Whoever triggers world war 3 means that they have to step up and do something for another purpose. It's not about invasion, it's not about terrorism, it's not about disputes but more of the economic war that we're seeing.War today is different. Before it's more of invasion, and territory disputes but this time, a world leader, a strong country that's been on the lead for a very long time needs to do something for them to maintain their statute globally. Because if nothing is done, the other side is doing its expansion from all nearby countries and even the farthest one.

I am curious though. What are your personal predictions about the advance of BRICS when comes to their development of their own international and transnational currency? How long will it take them to issue and distribute it?How many countries do you think will start to accept it around the world together with the USA dollar?Do you believe that if Donald Trump manages to get into the Oval office again there would be a difference about the BRICS issued currency or not?  Because they way you talk about your country (which I would have assumed you would be proud of), you make it sound there is no hope ahead to your national currency losing its international acceptance.",
