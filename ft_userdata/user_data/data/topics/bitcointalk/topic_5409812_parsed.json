  "content": "I recognized the rumour mills as resources that should be channelled to some use, and so we started a creative writing competition. The idea was simple: Put these rumours into some organic manner and submit them as entries to the creative writing exercises.Competent persons were invited to manage the process and in about three to four rounds, prizes were awarded for poetry, short stories, and drama. Nigerians are creative and it is not for nothing that we created a whole thriving industry in Movies and our Nollywood.This has become a very important sector of the Nigerian economy, creating many jobs, directly and indirectly. And from nothing but just our creative minds, in which a whole lot comes from among others, our stories, gossip, and rumours.https://guardian.ng/opinion/on-the-2022-asuu-strike-part-3/",

      "body": "It is not in doubt that Nigeria and Nigerians are great country and people. We are very resourceful and ready to be a tool for wealth creation because we have the physical strength as blacks and also innovative and creative. We need more support from the government and that is why the youth are not in support of the Assu (Academic Staff Union of Universities) strike. This kills our educational system and more intelligent students going to other countries to school and later work after completing their education, this causes brain drain which has a great consequences on her economy. Op I think this is the way you would have gone in your post when you brought it to economy. Now I can't say if this post will be left here or find its way to Politics and Society or Off-topic.",

Your topic can always carry the exact discussion of the content.",
