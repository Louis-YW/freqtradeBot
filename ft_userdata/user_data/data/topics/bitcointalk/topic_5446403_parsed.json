Bitcoin is just like a local currency like USD and the Blockchain should be where all transactions are recorded.The only difference between the local currency and Bitcoin all transactions are private that only governments have access and the currency is much more stable compared to Bitcoin another thing is Bitcoin is decentralized meaning no one can control your own money.About the technical side if you want to become a developer then check this link below - https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains",

It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.\" -- Satoshibitcoin is a volatile internet money that depends on the number of people who trades, buys or holds the currency.  It runs on the blockchain network; a chain of different computers running the bitcoin network. Working interoperable with each other, when one is down others continue confirming the authenticity of transactions.  The network can't stop working, even 1 node is enough to keep the Bitcoin network running effectively. Therefore, it's difficult to stifle the network as it'll require the attacker to stifle all the computers running on the network. Blockchain remains a very strong decentralized network with no central body in control of the transactions happening on the network.",

When he deposits money in the bank, that money becomes a bookkeeping entry with no real backing, and the money itself is devalued by leaps and bounds (you are able to buy less and less things with the same amount). This is what made some people believe in the need to create an alternative digital currency, which eventually led to the creation and launch of bitcoin in 2009.",

Just like you do online fianacial transactions using central bank-controlled fiat, you can also use bitcoin to make payments but the difference is that there are no third parties especially if you are using a decentralized wallet. But if you use exchanges (firms that offer banklike services in the cryptocurrency industry) you have to go through them to do your transaction. It will also be good to inform you that these exchanges will always ask for your details and you will lose your funds if they collapse. Some bitcoins also use Bitcoin as a trading instrument. This is because the price of bitcoin goes up and sometimes down making people buy at a cheaper rate and sell when the price goes high. Some people keep it as a long-term investment. These holders acquire and keep bitcoin for a long period and sell them based on their financial plan. Bitcoin can be bought, mined, or earned.",

You could easily teach them what bitcoin does by explaining the things that you do to bitcoin and how they can use bitcoin to earn, Just the introduction of bitcoin as a digital currency and teaching them about trading. If you are going to teach them how bitcoin works it might get complicated to explain the process and could turn them down, but if you just teach them what can you do on bitcoin they might get interested in it and learn how it works on their selves.Also, one of the best things to do to easily learn bitcoin is just to try buying one and start investing already, since experience is the best teacher, explaining it to someone could just complicate things just guide them not to invest and risk everything on cryptocurrency.",

Everyone may have a different experience when meeting beginners who ask us. But that's what I encountered a lot, they did not ask about the blockchain and also the developmental technology used and built from Bitcoin. They asked, how to trade bitcoin.Of course, too risky tells Bitcoin trade beginners. I don't want those who are new to Bitcoin to be negatively oriented when they fail in their first trade. So I tell them that Bitcoin is an investment asset. Some risks must be taken when you want to invest in Bitcoin.",

Some links have been shared on this thread, now it becomes your responsibility to read them and get a hang of things.Having said that, mind you that there are difficult aspects of Bitcoin that you might never understand, unless you are tech-savvy, you'd be better of focusing on the most basic and important aspects that has to do with sending, receiving and safely storing your Bitcoins. Finally, don't think Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, it is not, quite a lot of people erroneously believe that, Bitcoin is just a decentralized currency that serves multiple purposes.",

When we learn something new, there are bound to be some initial challenges, but as long as you work hard and don't give up, you will learn everything. Sometimes this method works for others but won't work for you, so you don't have to follow in anyone's footsteps. Use your methods, gradually, you will find out which method works best for you.
