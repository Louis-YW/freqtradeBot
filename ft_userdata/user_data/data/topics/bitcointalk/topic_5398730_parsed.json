      "body": "1000% Ponzi scam and how the hck you invest 2000$ to a defi app without doing research first? DeFi should not contact you via email since all transactions should be decentralized and doesn't need conversation from the defi side The percentage return per day is so high and the thing that requiring you to do certain things just to get more benefits is red flag already. You should avoid that service because that is not DeFi! DeFi means Decentralized Finance that doesn't require you to create account using email. You just need to connect your wallet to interact on a real DeFi. Sorry for your loss and cheer up!",

      "body": "Hi againI did not mention in my first post that I invested money in my Mining Fund in the following way:I was contacted by a girl who said WhatsApp and introduced herself as Sarah from Ukraine but that she currently lives in Paris. After a normal conversation she told me that there are great opportunities to make money through cryptocurrencies.She persuaded me to invest $ 150 to start with.She explained everything to me and helped step by step. First I downloaded the OKX application. Through this app I bought Crypto which has been converted to TRX.The next step was to download the Tronlink pro app. I registered on that app. When I did that, with her help, I came to the wallet address that I copied. After that I went back to the OKX app and set up a TRX transfer to my walet address I got on Tronlink. The next step was again on Tronlink where I typed the following link https://deif.etc-defi918.xyz to log in to my walet or My Pool. When I logged in I saw my minings pool and the corresponding amount I had invested in TRX.Everything is still fine, I still have no doubt. After two or three days, Sarah started persuading me to invest more money because the profit would be higher. I listened to her and invested another $ 1,850 on two occasions. So $ 2,000 in total.The continuation of the story is in my first post.",

Up to this point you have basically lost $2k of your money to scammers.If you want at least a small part of your funds back, you (somehow) try to persuade the scammer by pretending you are still in the scam scenario and saying \"I will invest more after my first investment pays off\". But remember my first suggestion.",

The scammer is just trying to scam you again so you should stop and wait on what action made by scammer also learn to move on starting today since for sure that scammer will never return your money.",
