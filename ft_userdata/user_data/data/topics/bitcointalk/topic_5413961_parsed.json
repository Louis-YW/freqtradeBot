I don't have to go through with most details of it as it speaks typically for what OP is trying to do hereI am sure that no one on Earth that understands how to make a wallet will forget to never share his mnemonic phrases that contain his fund. Because it's always been reminded to never share it.",

I was wondering about this but after I looked and checked the Trusts you have it is very dangerous what you are doing. So it's very difficult for everyone here to help you to sell the USDT you have, because it will damage everyone's reputation here by helping scammers.",

Don’t waste time and money for this kind of bullshit excuse to scam newbie.There’s a P2P trading offer by most of the CEX to sell his USDT to his local currency if he really wants to convert those USDT in his wallet.",

You already tried this scam before and you received a red tag as a result of it, maybe you are targeting newbies which could fall into your hands believing they can make some easy money by helping you.But the community here is very proactive and if they can hinder your plans then they will take the necessary steps to do it, as they have done so already, leave this forum it is obvious this is not the right community for you.",
