If anyone is reading this post, please refer to this thread for more details - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5348617I really don't know why people just want to suddenly make money even at all cost even at the expense of the peace of the next man. It Would have been better for him if you just stay sincere and do you business rather than having the intention to scam and defraud any gullible person that falls prey.I actually needed someone to help me receive $3000 dollar in Bangladesh and send me BTC but I haven't found any trustworthy fellow yet and that's really bad that people seem so difficult to be trusted.",
