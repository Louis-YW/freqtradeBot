  "content": "Hi guys, Please be careful with sharkoin.com. I strongly believe it's a scam casino looking for some big deposits. Recently I tried to withdraw some of my affiliate commissions after a long time as they continuously sending emails about my affiliates. I found around $10 in affiliate commission and tried to withdraw it. But it was pending for more than 24 hours. So I have to contact their support or owner in telegram. But I am really surprised by the behaviour of this guy. I have never met such a support or owner. So just be cautious before making a deposit.  I wouldn't even open this thread as the amount is very low. But I have to let the community know about the risk of such behaviour. I am adding my conversation screenshots here - https://imgur.com/CjbMiMChttps://imgur.com/ydsoul6",

All casino nowadays have this kind of rule in their ToS that ranging from 6 months to 1 year inactivity before your account got restricted.I think you have the right to claim those referrals that you earn when you are still active but the support has a valid point regarding your existing referrals since your account is already closed. You should read always the ToS so that you will be aware on the casino rules. I agree on the support because I knew exactly that kind of rules exist on any casino.",

If you feel that they are treating you unfairly and your account has been expired for no reason, you can open a scam complaint against them on the Scam Accusations  board. this is not a right section to report someone against",

The issue here is he is not active for almost 5 years and he is trying to withdraw now after all those years of inactivity. I'm not familiar on the casino terms and condition but some casino do charge an account for holding balance for a long time without any gambling activities until the account close when the balance is already empty to pay the fees. It's too late for him to check if the casino pay or not because it's been 5 years since he start playing and referring in the casino. I think the important lesson here is always check your casino balance and empty it before leaving it inactive for a long time.",

Not saying this is already a scam casino but a warning sign to all not-popular casinos I guess is what users should be cautious of.But I wonder why OP chose this casino over hundred casinos in crypto that are well-known to the community.  Iff he is up to making more than $10, he gotta be signing up to the casinos that have been in the crypto casino business for a very long time.",

If they can not handle a $10 situation with a member is it a big win they would release.  I think they are up to something and come to talk of it, this casino is an unpopular one which I have not heard about before. They are not here which may cast more doubt on their reliability. OP as I see you are  active member here.  It is nice you raised such an alarm early enough for members to know. As you can see, there are lots of reputable casino here which you can engage but do your due diligence. Lastly this topic should be at the reputation board  here",

However, their referral program counted the wagering made by the free funds. That's why they refused to paid, because the referral program at least paid from the raw balance (that's mean, deposit money). No wonder they don't want to pay @OP, but they also make a stupid system while the free-fund money that came from them is getting counted for the reward referral.",

Going back to my reasoning, there's rules and regulations imposed by every casino on every user to protect the casino's best interests and the user's safety/fairness all in all. You've never played with them for over 5 years, with your $10 deposit probably valued more than that just because it's before 2020's bull run. Plus it was imposed upon their terms and conditions which you probably didn't go so far as to give a look-see at. In this scenario the casino is correct, only thing I wish he could've done is be more polite about it instead of calling you a poor idiot lol.",

I have used the gambling platform in question some time in the past and my experience with it was okay. I didn't have any problem with it. Most times, we can avoid putting ourselves in unfortunate situations we could have just read the terms and conditions. Sorry OP. I recommend you just take your L on this one and do better next time to read all terms and conditions to ensure you don't leave money on the table in the future. Upholding their T&Cs doesn't make them scammy in any way except they go against their own terms.",
