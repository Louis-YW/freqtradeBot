I clicked on the image to play the video, forgetting that the forum doesn't allow video clips.Quote from: albon on August 11, 2023, 05:20:41 PMThis feature may be wrongly used by scammers to steal and deceive their victims, from the perspective of video verification, AI is now really scary and easily believable, so do not send your coins to anyone, no matter who they are, even if you see Elon Musk or CZ or others, Do not believe the videos and everything you see or hear.It's not about being wrongly used and all of that, as scammers are already using it right now. I don't know if this app is the actual one they use, but I have seen some similar AI videos generated in which they match the face and body movements of the person they are impersonating, using that means to convince their victims that they are actually real. The more new technologies are being developed and introduced daily for the advancement and betterment of human life, the more scammers are also busy looking for ways to turn that into their own advantage. We all just need to be careful on the internet, where new convicting methods of scamming are emerging day by day.",

      "body": "Domain is 7 years old, means website might too if not shifted from another domain to this one. Means the platform is not something new but we all should be aware of such tools because if one not know about it then he or she might fall prey into the hands of scammers or fake videos. I checked the about us section and the CEO was a employee at Snapchat (we all know what is snapchat) he worked there for 6 years. And now he made his own project which has more than 3 million monthly users. I am wondering what would be people using these services for, instead of ads campaigns, or marketing etc. Because fake faces worth less then real ones so it must become cost effective for the agencies to hire a fake AI face instead of real one for marketing purposes. Well, i read some reviews and the use cases are a lot but as you are trying to shed light on scam side so definitely it could be used to scam others too. So, we have to be careful from such activities.",

Anyone can join its waitlist, and it will be deployed to production soon, and everyone can try it. This feature, which I mentioned above, is significantly developed and has improvements to the quality of the avatar's video and fine-tuned voice technology to the speech pattern, which makes matching the video with AI more realistic and risky.[1] https://twitter.com/joshua_xu_/status/1689189747938508802",

One thing I can think of where this will be widely used is for fake advertisements where someone prominent supposedly supports the \"project\" and fake giveaways. this also reminded me of this thread [Warning]: AI voice replicating scams",

I have seen warning about this before but never paid attention to it until when Elon musk launched his last spacex and a friend of mine call me that there’s a giveaway going on by Spacex company and to participate you have to make a deposit of a certain amount to get your ticket. It was believable because Elon musk video was on display on YouTube live using a different channel, his lips movements and sound were that of him. But, after I checked the age of the domain I found out that it was created that day, I did bookmark the site but I’m currently not on my laptop and as for the YouTube channel and video it has been taken down by YouTube.So there are so many unethical ways this could be used aside from scammers using it.",

      "body": "Well, the tech is not really new. People need to be conscious of what they put on the internet. It will be hard for the AI to properly imitate someone with little to no personal data (like video/audio/pic of hisher face, voice, etc)on the internet. When you understand that the internet is like a mind or brain and anything you expose on it is monitored, absorb and learned by program in the brain, you would be more careful what you feed it. In the end, such personal data will be used to understand you, imitate you, create your replica and mostly used to deceive... For example, they could create a hologram or something called \"familiar spirit\" and use it in place of you after you leave this world, to lie to your relatives that it's you or that it's your spirit or their ancestor. Your replica could be continously cloned/developed and powered by your familiar spirit/AI. Your robot replica would be powered by AI while your clone is powered by evil spirit(aka familiar spirit). And that would mean you live forever in their world whereas it's just a fake/replica of you.",
