The foundation's core purposes are to aid with development efforts like advocating for Kii and its use in the Nu Identity Ecosystem, organizing a roadmap toward sustainable growth, and supporting the technologies and applications that depend on it. The Kii Foundation does not seek to control Kii, only to foster Kii’s advancements and the broader decentralized identity ecosystem it underpins. US citizens and residents and those in other excluded jurisdictions are excluded from participating.About NuID:NuID is a technology partner of The Kii Foundation, and is best known for building a trustless authentication solution for enterprises and developers. Their solution utilizes zero knowledge proofs and distributed ledger technology, preventing the need for applications or platforms to store user passwords server-side. When deployed, this protocol eliminates the risk of credential breaches. NuID has built upon their existing authentication solution to launch development of the “Nu Identity Ecosystem” along with the identity-optimized KiiChain.",
