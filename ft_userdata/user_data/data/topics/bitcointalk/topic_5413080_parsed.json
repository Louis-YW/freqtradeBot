  "content": "QuoteOPEC and its allied producers on Monday agreed to reduce oil production by 100,000 barrels per day amid concern regarding falling oil prices and lingering fears of a global recession.Why it matters: The move reverses the group's decision last month to boost oil production for the month of September by 100,000 barrels per day.OPEC said in a press release Monday that, alongside its allies, it had agreed to \"revert to the production level of August 2022...for the month of October.\"The big picture: This is the group's first cut in oil production in more than a year and comes as crude oil prices have fallen 25% in the past three months, the Wall Street Journal reported.Saudi Arabia's energy minister warned last month that OPEC+ countries could cut oil production at any time, AP reported.Members of the group are concerned that a successful revival of the 2015 Iran deal could see an influx of Iranian oil hit the market, though tensions between the U.S. and Iran have spiked in recent days, with the U.S. conducting a military flyover of the Middle East over the weekend.Members are also concerned that a global recession, egged on by sky-high inflation, energy woes in Europe and economic slowdown in China spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, could weaken oil demand, per the Journal.What they're saying: \"The President has been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers and consumers around the world,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\"U.S. oil production is up by more than half a million barrels per day since the beginning of the year and is on track to be up by more than one million barrels per day by the end of the year, on the way to a new production record next year,\" Jean-Pierre added.What's next: The group noted in the press release that it has plans to reconvene on Oct. 5, and could meet again in the meantime if necessary to \"address market developments.\"https://www.axios.com/2022/09/05/opec-cut-oil-production....Do people prefer for oil production to rise or fall?If oil prices rise, could we see a frenzy of activity spurred on by a search for alternatives to oil? Could it be similar to the natural gas crisis in europe where many are currently scrambling for firewood and other retro residential heating options? I wonder if there are good investment opportunities which lie along that line of thought.  As far as peak oil goes, there have been many who claimed modern day society could not function without crude oil. They say that oil is too central in too many modern inventions and innovations for us to survive without it. Oil is used to make plastics, fuel, lubricant. There is a long list of items and goods we depend upon as daily necessities that are produced from an oil base. Some of which would be difficult to replace were oil ever to be priced outside of our budgets. Many modern innovations of recent times were trends intended to reduce our reliance on oil. Nations sought to achieve energy independence rather than rely on middle eastern or russian oil as sole providers. Our series of technology trends and counter trends have remained cyclical for a long time. And we still do not have a clear answer to our riddle of whether modern society could survive without oil to fuel it.I'm actually very surprised that we haven't seen venture funding thrown at stirling engines, gravity batteries, thorium based nuclear reactors, fusion energy and our usual suspects of alt energy start ups. Is it possible that credit and liquidity have dried up to such an extent that people are no longer throwing random cash at start ups. The silence here is deafening.",

Like you have mentioned the products coming out from oil are many, so if we have oil increase it will also have effect on the other side. The process to get these products will increase too . IMO the products coming out of oil have made an alternative to oil become just an option because the importance of oil because of its byproducts have made oil a more important commodity than whatever replacement we can think of. If you don't process oil, you won't get those products from it and industries will die because they won't have what to produce.",

Raising the price of something does not magically increase profits, as it can produce a contraction in demand that counteracts the margin of increase. How do you mean here when there is increase in price of oil ? The margin of profit doesn't really reduce for a country when the profit for oil is increasing , this is my opinion because I don't think there is additional cost accruing to production at the time, if OPEC has increased oil price, that doesn't affect cost of production. Production and cost are interactive so if there is increase in price and production cost is steady that will increase profit for the country.",

What they are doing is manipulating the price of crude oil higher when their target on the Russian-Ukraine issues could not come to pass. Russia predicted crude oil to be at $300 per barrel due to sanctions, but the world has proved them wrong now. However, the little cut in the supply of crude oil will amount to nothing, and those that cut it now might increase it later, so it changes nothing. What I know is that the market sentiment is a good second force and crude oil has likely bottomed for September at $81.14 (WTI). I expect it to close the month above $95.00.",

What's more, OPEC has no control over demand outside of its efforts to regulate production levels within its bounds. It is likely that a combination of the two will ultimately determine demand for oil in the coming months. On the other hand, some worry that the decrease in price could have a negative effect on global demand for oil. The truth of the matter is that all of these factors are likely to impact demand.",

And we are ignoring two major factors that will come in to play soon. A price cap on Russian oil will be imposed soon. If Russia rejects it and refuse to export their crude, then there will be a major shortage of crude in the global markets. This will push crude oil prices to all time high. And also, Americans will start to re-fill the SPR as soon as mid-term elections are over. That will also create an increased demand for crude.",

I understand the premium prices, but OPEC needs to figure out a way to keep the prices high to make more profit from selling oil, and yet they are also asked to pay more in that case as well, so it would be better at $60 for sure, that would allow Europe to have cheaper energy.But to forget about all of this, we need to go with the renewable energy which requires an upfront payment but then it would be free to continue, just free money forever, a bit of costs but nothing major, and it allows cars to go very long with nearly no money, some places literally do not charge you, some charge you like 100 miles per cent levels, so it is joking amount, we need to move to that very quickly if we want to save some money.",
