And as the CPI report has came out, there's still another reason why it wouldn't go up. Well, it's going to be a matter of time again until we see it move. This verifies that we're in a bear market and it could stay in there for quite a while.",

And the price reduction for other coins approached 90% or more. The price of Ethereum holds up very well relative to many other coins.i agree with you. like the price of ethereum still depends on the price of bitcoin and compared to other coins only ethereum has the same decrease and when bitcoin will go up 100% ethereum will also go up 100%and for the OP the other reason why ethereum is still not moving up and the price is getting lower is because the bear market is still going on. that's the most appropriate reason. we can see when the bull come ethereum will give a very good priceAs ETH is also following the market trend of BTC, expect that it won't fly high anytime soon.But as BTC starts to pump up again, more than likely, ETH will follow thru.The good thing about ETH is this network is not just a crappy project but has a solid foundation that won't disappear when you wake up. It may be down today, but the likelihood of recovering is very high, unlike those meme tokens or other pump and dump projects.",

If there is, expect that it is just pure pump and dump.Yes, it's good Ethereum supply is getting limited, but if there are non buyers, this news will not affect it's price and it boils down that investors are not willing to buy because of the negative sentiments.",

I would guess that the fact that it becomes deflationary was already priced in during the last bullrun when it became public that ETH would switch to PoS and that it would become deflationary with that move. Now that fact is very old news already and not a lot of people are buying because of that fact anymore.",

ETH is actually experiencing the same situation as other altcoins during this bearish era. Many altcoins cannot pump, except the new coin or token listed by the new projects, some of them have high pump but after that? they are also falling down. SO, we cannot see Ethereum to be fall down was only in one opinion. During this bearish, many altcoins including ETH is struggling how they can be stringer every time, to be far away from the bottom, and keep increasing. But the market is always unpredictable and FUD is always spreading. Just be patient and wait for the bullish coming.",

There are many factors that come into play in predicting how well an asset will perform in the ETH market.I think, for this case there was a previous dip in the market when the ICO was cashed out and it didn't make any real impact on the ETH price.Another reason why the price of Ethereum is not rising despite the reduced supply is that demand is relatively stable. It's just that there isn't a strong enough market for ETH to push the price up at the moment.",
