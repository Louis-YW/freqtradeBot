  "content": "the past, months I followed it.I collect every day hoping to get free crypto. And I'm always stuck for a long time. So occasionally I deposit $5-10$ for faucets, cloud mining to sites that seem ordinary.I don't think about the losses or the money I spent at that time. Even though I haven't got access to withdraw but I feel cool I feel that this is fun. And I do it voluntarily.Of course, tiredness approached but I had forgotten the faucet website that I had registered.Have you ever been familiar with faucets as a beginner?what makes you feel successful? what successor to the current fauchet do you use?whatever your experience is very much appreciated",

      "body": "I think a lot of people (newbie to experienced) still seem to like claiming faucets.I go to faucet sites every few months and see if there's anything new around just to see how that side of the ecosystem is going/nostalgia (and of course to claim a few sats). It's normally nice to see sites that are still going and have been for a long time as well as ones where the payout when I joined would've been less than a cent but that payout now would be a few $. (I'd avoid investing in things like cloud mining though if you can help it - you might be better off making a wallet address and then forgetting that wallet exists for a while but setting up automated payments to see if you manage to get much after a while - eg a few years).",

      "body": "Still open my Freebitco.in account on occassion, possibly once a day at least when I commute. It's one of the pinned websites when I open my phone browser. Sort of works like a price check too since the amount it gives is anchored to BTC price.But that's only force of habit, not much else to do when on a commute (other than post on forum). Prone to motion sickness so typing and reading too long makes me sick heh. And there's no captcha or ads at all, one tap and I'm done. Captcha faucets just make me annoyed.They don't call themselves a faucet site anymore of course, and it's more of a casino but that's as close as I get to something-for-nothing. Several hundred dollars worth of BTC over the years.In summary: the original faucet model of ads-for-satoshi. Think it died long ago in 2017.",
