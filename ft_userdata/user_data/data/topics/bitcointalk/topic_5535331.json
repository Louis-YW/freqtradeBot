Having separate holdings gives each partner the liberty to develop and handle the portfolio with as much independence as possible and reduces conflicts from presumed mismanagement of funds.",

As it regards Bitcoin in this case, I think the advise still holds and couples should under no circumstances hold a joint crypto currency account or multi signature wallet, mostly as there isn't a certainty the marriage would last and even if it does, what's the fun in always having to seek permission from your better half just to login or trade or make some secret purchases that they may not find as a worthy expense.",

While it could help strengthen their relationship especially for newlywed couples, but it could also be an instant way for their break up or separation. I am pointing out the tendency for misuse of funds or bitcoin since there are actually instances that both couple would have different investment decisions, the other one wants to buy more and hold, while the partner is eager to sell because he is already hunger for profits. This is most likely to happen especially when there is uneven contributions, when one is having more income to contribute while the spouse only makes a lower income.",

That could turn into a whole different mess.In terms of Bitcoin investment, I would say that a couple can keep their Bitcoin investments in different accounts if they want. Because if a couple keeps their Bitcoins in different accounts, then those Bitcoins will be less risky because if that couple keeps their Bitcoins in one account and for some reason faces problems with that account, then they can lose their money or even lose it. And if their investments are kept in two different accounts, then if there is a problem with one, then the other can be safe. I have not created more than one Bitcoin account yet because my wife is not very experienced with Bitcoin yet, but of course we can have a joint account in the banking system.",
