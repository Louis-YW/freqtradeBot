Even with a passcode and a pin. And then what about a physical attack? Yes, It is impossible to brute force both 12 and 24 word seed phrases even though 12 words generate 128 bits of entropy which is 2^128 = 3.4028237e+38 while 24 words generate 256 bits of entropy which is 2^256 = 1.1579209e+77. In all cases, 128 bits of entropy is considered safe.The problem with the 24 words is that it adds a new complexity, as it increases the possibility of forgetting several words or changing their order, which increases the possibility of losing your money, while it does not enhance your security because 12 words are safe.12 word vs 24 word seed topic has been discussed many times, just search for the word on the forum or Google.Quote from: tread93 on December 15, 2023, 04:03:01 AM And then what about a physical attack? In case of physical access to the hardware wallet (physical attacks), your seed phrase is only protected by a digit PIN. Some hardware wallets enhance their security with one or more secure elements against some physical attacks and to ensure that your encryption uses a much larger number of bits than what the digit PIN provides, in addition to preventing data leakage from RAM.",

      "body": "The recent ledger vulnerability actually points at one importance of an offline wallet. You will read that the attack or hackers couldn’t get their hands on to the seed phrase which simply had your funds secure except you did interact with DApps had it been an online wallet it could gotten access to something like a key or seed phrase. Fro now there is no quantum computer that can crack or brute for the algorithm for seed phrase so the security now is how you personally safeguard yours. First I will say if you tired or hardware companies getting compromised then setup your own cold storage with wallets like electrum to avoid this problems. You can then add a second layer or protection to your seed phrase by adding a passphrase which should be stored separately from the seed phrase itself. Then the most secured method at the moment is setting up a multi sig wallet with an each co-signer having its own device. This multi sig will help to protect funds from been stolen when one of the seed phrases or keys becomes either physically stolen or even through phishing attacks or hack. An example of how to back a 2-3 multi sig wallet is given below. Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 09, 2023, 09:17:14 PMNo need of doing something like this. You can backup your 2-of-3 multisig seed phrase/private key and public key in this order in three different locations:Seed 1, MPK 2 (location 1)Seed 2, MPK 3 (location 2)Seed 3, MPK 1 (location 3)In this way, if you lose one backup, you will still be able to recover back your coins and there is no need for any fourth backup, especially in what is not recommended like phone or online.Backup should be completely  offline.This way even one of the devices gets compromised it will be hard to move the funds on that wallet without getting access to the other co-signers and before the hacker does the wallet owner would moved out those funds. But this is possible or more secure if each co-signer is on different devices as a single device defeats the purpose of multi sig wallet",

What is the best practice here and what do you guys do for extra extra security???Do not split your seed, it is not recommended. If you want to make your seed phrase to be secure offline, use passphrase along with it while generating your keys and addresses. With passphrase, different keys and addresses are generated. If someone have access to your seed phrase but not your passphrase, the person still will not be able to have access to your coins. Use a strong passphrase. Backup your seed phrase and passphrase differently in different locations. If seed phrase or passphrase backup is lost, your coin is lost. Do like 2 or 3 backups each.For multisig, it is well explained above by Zaguru12.",

At the moment 12 word seeds are super secure and at the moment we can say that it is going to always protect our funds but if somehow computers get so advanced in the next decades that we will be in danger (still sounds something unbelievable), believe me, before any hack, we will have enough time to fix the problem and move on a different methods. Worrying about the hack of 12 word seed phrase, for me, looks like worrying about Earth getting run out of water.Please, don't worry about the made up problem that doesn't exist.I would worry about buying and using Ledger and similar wallets. Just buy a Coldcard or Passport.",

Even with a passcode and a pin. The entropy  of 12 word seed is roughly 128 bits while  that one of 24 word seed  ~ 256 bits.To crack those seeds one should flip 2128 and 2256 bits respectively.Flipping  a single bit at room temperature requires 2.9×10−21 J of energy.The sun produces \" 1.23 x 10 ^ 35 Joules of energy in one year\". Thus it requires around 2 1073 years for the sun to shine to secure energy needed to crack 128 bits which is much much less then age of the Universe. (may have made a mistake by couple orders of magnitude  in my calculations, but in this case it doesn’t matter.Try to calculate the same for 256 bits.As to quantum advancements. There is an experimental evidence that  heat generation occurs also at  changing states of qubits.",

Even with a passcode and a pin. Despite its rapid advancement, generative AI algorithms will never be able to crack the true randomness used to generate seed phrases, regardless whether you have 128-bit, or 256-bit entropy.  So, the choice of the length of your seed phrase, whether it's 12 or 24 words, doesn't impact its security much. As for quantum computers, one of the biggest concerns is that one day these machines could crack the widely used RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms, which are the backbone of online banking, and sensitive financial and data transfers, not just Bitcoin.  But there's nothing you as individuals can do about it, as the entire internet will need to adapt to this new reality.Quote from: tread93 on December 15, 2023, 04:03:01 AMAnd then what about a physical attack? What about it? Physical attacks have always been a concern, and they aren't going anywhere. Yet, I still think it's much easier to protect digital assets from such attacks than it is to protect physical assets like your wallet, or smartphone.",

You can't just copy their code to build a new one. You can review source and verify code. To my mind, that's all that matters for users, it's not a closed-source project and we can't make it stand next to Ledger. By the way, Passport is also based on Coldcard too. I don't see anything wrong with using Coldcard, as I don't see anything wrong with using Passport either. Both of them are very good and I recommend both of them to everyone.",
