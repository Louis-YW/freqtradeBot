In the end, it pretty much means that it could make bitcoin more efficient price-wise; but it definitely doesn't mean that it'll stop being volatile — because it will very very likely still be.",

As institutional adoption grows, it could potentially lead to a higher demand for Bitcoin, driving up its value.The institutional investors have been there IIRC since 2021 and backward, so it's not new that they're going to indulge on this market because they already did. And with the success and approval of the bitcoin spot etf, that already signifies that this is becoming and serious market and investment. From there, that's already going to attract more investors through the ETF but then, IMO they are going to learn on how to invest directly to Bitcoin and will learn about holding private keys and using noncustodial wallets.Quote from: #Greatest on January 21, 2024, 03:31:15 PMIt's an exciting development that could shape the future of Bitcoin!What do you think?Exciting indeed and that's why the most patient investors and holders are the ones that's going to benefit from this development that we're having for Bitcoin. Because if you are the impatient investor and you want to just watch out where it is coming before buying in, you might miss the bull run if you don't hold that much. I've got friends that are starting to approach me and ask about what to do, I've just said the same thing to buy now and hold. It's simple as that.",

The market was heated up when there was a potential to approve Bitcoin ETF. But that afford trend is nowhere to be seen now even after it is approved. That's quite surprising! Probably something is going in the back end which we are not able to understand. I personally didn't like companies like blackrock entering into Bitcoin market. Because with the kind of money they hold, they can do anything with Bitcoin as per their wish. Institutional investors are are real threat to this decentralised economy. I think in 2024 the Bitcoin market will remain positive. However the retail investors like me will take a very cautious approach.",

It's an exciting development that could shape the future of Bitcoin!You don't need institutional investors to understand that BTC is a legitimate network, it is open source and you can verify everything yourself. The BTC network doesn't need institutional investors, as a matter of fact what they bring to the network is sometimes against the principles of BTC; i.e. BTC etf's provides a way for people to buy BTC without owning their keys and that is not a recommended way to buy BTC, because not your keys, not your coins.However, institutional investors can influence the price of BTC positively, they pump money into BTC and that can make the price to pump, but that does not mean that they are a must for the network to grow.",

Do you also know that the so called governments who are fighting against bitcoin also have their holdings hence are trying everything humanly possible to have every control over  bitcoin just for their self interest and personal gain to protect their investment not to be tempered., What i could speculates more is max adoption this year and the usability.",

I don't think there has ever been a moment where the institutions are not part of btc.  Retailers alone are not the power behind the price manipulation, it has always been the institutions who pull the strings.

To tell you the truth even if BTC did NOTHING this year and hovered at the 40k level I would still be happy. The REAL action historically always happens the year after the halving so thats why I think that 2025 will really be the year to pay attention to.",

Halving has always been an important event in the past and I think it will be this time too. The price of bitcoin go up +100% in 2023 and there should be a new ATH this year. Demand will then continue to rise and this will also attract new investors. They will have maximum FOMO and also buy also a lot of altcoins again. Bitcoin is getting stronger from year to year, even if the price goes up and down so much. I think we will hear some big news this year or next year.Quote from: ImThour on November 08, 2023, 07:56:52 AMBTC and It's CyclesThis is an amazing chart I have saved for more than a year now, it predicted the 2022 Cycle Low correctly. It's made by someone else, I do not remember the user however I have it saved.I just wanted to share this as many people here do not believe in the 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle. Here's a live proof of that being executed every cycle.The next possible Cycle High is in August, 2025-November, 2025.",

But the fact is, it takes time to start bull after halving, not instantly.If there is anytime that I have feared bitcoin and other volatile market more, it should be this time around. Obviously no one believed that after the Bitcoin ETF approval and they arrival of the institutional traders into the cryptocurrency, that the price of Bitcoin will rather deep instead of bull. If anyone or any prophet told me that it will happen this, I would not just believe. But now it has happened, I am very well convinced that nothing is assured in the cryptocurrency market. I am confidently telling you that even the upcoming bull run might fail and nothing will happen. Just follow the archaic  but standard rule for investment in volatile assets, invest what you can afford to lose and have peace of mind. If you neglect this very rule, you might end up having a heart attack and you can possibly lose all your assets.I am wiser now and I can say the wiser I become in the cryptocurrency industry the more fearful I become. This is the reason why I have always sticked with Bitcoin. I am no longer comfortable with any coin and I have never been comfortable with any other coin apart from Bitcoin. Just a little advice I took from a friend and bought solana, I am currently at 35% loss within few weeks and I have never been at rest till now. If this was bitcoin, I will be confident that someday this coin will reverse as we all know but currently I don't know my faith.",

The ETF news was previously cashed, now we need real capital flow in the market to shoot up again and more likely by the middle of 2024 we can have discussions again about what is next.",
