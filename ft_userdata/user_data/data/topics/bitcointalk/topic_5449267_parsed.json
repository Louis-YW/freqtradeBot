It is more usually applied on exchanges with too low trading volume. They are more sensitive to price manipulations with big gaps between available buy and sell orders / walls. Big price changes on those small exchanges don't mean much for a coin because it does not reflect real market movement for that coin.It's good to exclude those exchanges on formula for calculating average price of a coin. That will help inexperienced people avoid confusion and fomo unnecessarily.A tip for newbies. If you want to check price of a coin, pay first attention on its price on an exchange with biggest trading volume for that coin.",
