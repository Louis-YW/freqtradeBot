It listed about 150 countries around the world that were members of the IMF. It also listed about 20 countries that turned down IMF membership.What is interesting is, that the 20 countries that had not become members, were also the countries of the world that had the most trouble... wars, famines, internal disputes, diseases, etc.It makes one wonder. Did the peace come because the IMF made things work out for a country that joined? Or was it the IMF that made trouble for the countries that wouldn't join?",

And to think the country just witnessed a coup months earlier. These military leaders who seize power end up not doing what they promised they would. They’ve got no plan for the people but to enrich themselves. They suspend the constitution and rule by decrees. Sadly, this may not be the last coup",

They come in different deceptive ways such as peacekeepers, relief suppliers, Donors, investors etc. Those are the real devils.Look what happened to Libya. History has it that before it was bombarded, it was a self-reliant country that didn't have to continuously get those donor loans in order to fund their development, but well, some people were definitely not happy.",

Although Nigeria was a British colony and not French, that country is also suffering from neo-colonialism. Most policies of African states are influenced by their former colonial master. And they sometimes finance or support a coup to remove disloyal or or unsupportive African leaders.  There have been reports that colonial powers were behind the assassination of one of Africa's finest leaders Thomas Sankara. It was alleged that he was killed due to his anti-imperialist foreign policy. But it is a great shame that African leaders have continued to be puppets and always collaborated with Western enemies to undo their own people. Africa's major problem is not neo-colonialism but its inability to select selfless leaders that would effectively and efficiently utilize the enormous human and natural resources for the common good of all. Nobody can develop Africa for Africans because other countries have their own challenges. Africans must work hard to make Africa work.",

I tell you what, maybe this thing called \"Modern politics\" isn't anywhere good in some cultures after all. There is a line; although not a thin one like you say between “such countries”. Nigeria is in no way like Burkina Faso because Nigeria hasn’t had a coup in like 20 years and counting. Nigeria has had its share of internal wrangling that has not yet driven the country to war. During the 2015 elections in Nigeria, the west and US in particular predicted that Nigeria would split but Nigeria has withstood all that. Big sparks have risen and quenched and there isn’t war all over the place. Africa was growing beautifully and  steadily at its own pace until the colonial fuckers came along and fucked everything up.",

Captain Ibrahim Traore has now assumed leadership of the west African nation.  This is almost a biblical example of what you sow is what you reap. If you came to power by a coup, you should also be wise as well to expect a likely coup against you if you are not convincing that you deserve the power you took. This is also applicable to the new leader who has come to power by same means. Karma has a funny way of acting.",

Nobody can develop Africa for Africans because other countries have their own challenges. Africans must work hard to make Africa work.  In order not to be unfair to some African politicians (they are certainly corrupt in different ways), the process of disengaging from the colonizer is very difficult if not nearly impossible. France imposed an unjust monetary policy on West and Central African countries in the so-called CFA franc. This franc can only be used in those countries and is not accepted in the global financial markets. Burkina Faso, when you want to take, for example, a loan from an international donor in dollars, France is the one who receives that money and transfers it to Burkina Faso in the form of CFA francs.Politicians do not have sufficient means to change their currency and get rid of France's hold on the country's savings.",

Infact, like Barrister Femi Falana said that what we have in Nigeria is not a democracy and I trust that to be true. How do you explain a country whose governors and president find it difficult to obey court rulings and you call that a democracy? I wonder why there is yet to be a coup in Nigeria despite all the bad and evil things going on with government officials in Nigeria. Maybe the Nigeria military are scared to overthrow and kick President Mohammed Buhari out of office and that is why they are keeping quiet.",
