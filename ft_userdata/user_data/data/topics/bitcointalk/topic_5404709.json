I think when bitcoin starts rising back up again and breaks a resistance or two, it won't just stop at $28k. Remember a couple of years ago when $4k was broken and in a very short time price went from $3.1k bottom to $10k?In any case I believe that comparing bitcoin with other stuff that don't even fall in the same category as bitcoin (the currency) is wrong. Both gold and bitcoin serve different purposes than one another. For example you can't really use gold to pay for stuff easily but bitcoin is designed to do exactly that.But as far as their cap and circulating supplies go, you are right both have limited maximum supply but gold's circulating supply can be increased by a lot as the news from Uganda proves.",

German bank Bayern LB speculated in 2019 that Bitcoin would reach a price of around $90k after the halving, so even though $100k was something that many predicted, they were still closer to what ended up being the last ATH.In addition, many large German banks have requested licenses for crypto trading during 2021, which means that the market has become aware that profit can be made there and that Bitcoin has a long-term future.As for gold, I don't see why here should be so much discussion about what is better or what should be invested in - because gold has its advantages, just like Bitcoin. Long-term gold and Bitcoin have their place in everyday life, with the fact that gold has been proven for thousands of years, and Bitcoin is just at its beginning and will show its real advantages in the time to come.",

With Bitcoin, everything's fixed. And it will run out at some point. I don't agree with what the Deutsche Bank analysts seemed to imply, though, when they said that Bitcoin is more like diamonds in that it is \"a highly marketed asset\" rather than gold because the latter is \"a stable safe-haven commodity.\" If we remove all the marketing in Bitcoin, it doesn't cease to be popular. The only difference is that its supporters would highly be populated with people who really believe in the technology rather than in a bull run. Finally, $28,000 by year end is too low.",
