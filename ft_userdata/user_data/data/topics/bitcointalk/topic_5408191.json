The density of crypto ATMs is among the highest, as there are two machines for every 100,000 people. This makes Hong the most Crypto Ready Nation.USA was the leader on the list during the year 2021. Now it has fallen to the second position. Switzerland, one of Europe’s financial hubs does not tax crypto gains and is home to numerous blockchain startups. The authorities of the Southern Swiss city Lugano displayed intentions to introduce Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and LVGA Points token as legal tender.Interest different nations show towards digital assets based on the Google search data for \"cryptocurrency\".Australia - 4,579 people out of 100,000 have searched “cryptocurrency”Ireland - 3,472 people out of 100,000 have searched “cryptocurrency”UK - 3,409 people out of 100,000 have searched “cryptocurrency”Source : Most Crypto-Ready Nation in 2022 (Survey)",

I think a lot of those countries are in Europe or like to adopt European legislation so it'll be interesting to see if Europe changes in either way (either becoming more or less accepting of crypto) what affect that'll have on the list as a whole (especially if they maintain a favourable relationship towards it).",

But for sure mainland China still has huge influence on them, the government, the people.And we all know that the Chinese government is very hard on crypto specially bitcoin. So maybe the numbers might not be right after all. I'm not surprised by the 2nd and 3rd though, they have been in the limelight as far as crypto friendly is.",

If there are a lot of scam ICO/IEO/DEFI/NFT/... shittokens coming from a country, we can't say that country is \"crypto ready\". I say that is the opposite, the more number of scams in that country the less ready they are for the blockchain technology.Or the number of ATMs, due to their higher fees I don't see why would people want to use crypto ATMs instead of more P2P ways of exchanging their fiat and cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that companies may start mass-installing ATMs that aren't used like in India that they were even shut down after a while.",

One of the advantages that Hong Kong has over other nations is its small land mass and population when compared to the US. The US is already neck and neck with Hong Kong on the other factors that makes a country crypto ready. I wonder why crypto mining is not one of the factors to indicate a country's readiness.",

Sure, it makes sense to include the number of banks if you were trying to estimate worldwide banking readiness, but blockchain startups have almost nothing to do with the actual communities that use crypto.QuoteSwitzerland, one of Europes financial hubs does not tax crypto gains and is home to numerous blockchain startups.

Just make your own CDBC and call it a day.Never heard of the third one though (LVGA points), but you'd have to be really high on drugs to think that a points system as a legal tender is a good idea.",

China can always change it and introduce rules and laws that apply in the rest of the country, and then the crypto game is over in HK.Regarding the research methodology, for those who have not read the article, here is the direct link -> https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/Some things are still half-done because the zero capital gain tax infographic does not show Croatia, which has a similar law as Germany, with the difference that the tax is not paid after 2 years have passed since the purchase. Also, all crypto assets acquired before January 1, 2016 are considered tax-free.",

For that, Internet penetration and ownerships of smartphones are IMO very important to see if there's ground for adoption. The number of ATMs is probably not so relevant if there are convenient online exchanges instead. My question would also be crypto-ready for what, as adoption of Bitcoin as money is one thing, and blockchain businesses are quite a different thing.",

Isn't that too low? But I wonder why they call it the highest. I think that Honk Kong is also one of the richest or well-developed countries around the world so maybe that was the reason why they don't need a tax anymore for some other things like on crypto for example. We shouldn't worry about it but it's also a good news at the same time for the people living on those countries because they can get all their crypto profits without any cut from the government. Don't worry if your country isn't like that but time will come that you can also see a big improvement.",

However, there are two payment options in that country, and after 20+ years of using the US dollar as the official currency, the average person in that country trusts paper bills more than something that most people don't even fully understand.As @pooya87 says, it will take a long time for Bitcoin to become more useful in that country, because everything will actually depend on the younger generations, and not on older people who hardly or not at all change their habits.",
