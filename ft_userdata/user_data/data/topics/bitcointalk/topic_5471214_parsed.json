We know say this place na people first discover am and some people discovered here by themselves so, them try to stand by themselves while those who was brought here are being coach and mentored by their mentors but that notwistanding. We should always try our best as possible to consult them in all difficulties because I believe they still have important roles to play in our lives that trying to outsmart them thinking we can do anything in the forum since that we have access to post any place or we can now be creative to start receiving merits so we don't need them again, my dear you are making a very big silly mistake because when e red you go still run go meet am.The thing is, before you carry out any action always seek for the face of your mentor despite say you dey read like computer e still get things you never understand here, same is me as well if you watch my post them I never too dey go english board I just dey here dey cover myself small make my leg strong and make i know more things before I go begin run express wey. If you never understand here come back to our local board seek idea or even go back to your mentor for guidance than say you begin do anyway here thinking say here na other social media wey you fit carry play as you like or even dey change change password as you like, come if you jonse omo you go collect wotowoto because those people wey una see outside here no even want us to grow here talk less of say you go jonse outside. Have this in back of your mind say, here no get Mercy as soon as you lose guard you go collect no be me but people wey no like us go still treat your matta, so came down hustle no need to rush because here no be placed you go carry play.",

A lot is needed to learn by a new person in this forum and you can't learn it if you turn a proud peacock to your senior men. Loyalty can earn you their guidance and support and even help you rank up faster in the forum. I still submit all my topics for  approval before creating a thread. Yes, I do and some are  rejected by them,I only post the ones they approve because they're more experienced than me in the forum and they always point out the irrelevance in some of my  topics which I even fail to see.  Humility will earn you what millions of Naira wouldn't give you.",

Many young people dey see am say if you dey humble, you go lower your self-esteem as a person but no be so the matter really be. What is the thing is, you create a more understanding between yourself and that person which give your master or whoever it is the confidence to rely more on you.When you are humble, you make people become for valued and comfortable around you. If you remove your ego from your life and come down to earth. Vice-versa, When you dey portray ego, those people wey dey close to you go feel bad and inferior.When you are humble, you will have the ability to learn. Plenty people wey dey humble, dem dey get the loyalty and respect wey they make them learn quickly. There's a lot of information out there that your masters have, when you dey humble, them go give you that access to learn about those things that as though you would not.And many more, na why e dey important make person they calm down dey loyal and trustworthy to their masters. E no dey easy to be humble, but it is great if you are humble.",

The truth is that humility attracts more favour from people,  being humble is a good thing, it takes people to a height in life which they never expected or think they will ever reached.  People feel free to relate with humble people,  if you check out in every organisation or office people with humility tends to do better abd being promoted to higher rank.  The reason why humble tend to gain more favour is because they are friendly to everyone who ate around them . It really pays to be humble but some people thinks being humble people will take advantage of you which it will look as if you are being called fool, sometimes it is even bettert be called  fool just because you really understand where you are heading to in life.",

Even in the Holy Bible it teaches us to be humble in 1 Peter 5:6 \"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time\" same for anything that has higher authority over you, if we refuse to stay humble to higher authorities then we plan for destruction. No boss would be happy his boy is not humble to him, just as DaNNy001 said all masters has secrets to teach and for that secret to be taught to his student they have to earn it by showing their seriousness and humility. So my advise to newbies abeg this period our boss dem dey pepe, make we no go do watin go make dem give our account negative tag our even report us to moderator, e no go nice for us if we start to get issues with higher authority for this forum and precisely our naija board, if we humble ourselves you go see say e nor go tay before we go grow our account to take dey get one or two.",
