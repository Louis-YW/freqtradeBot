When did Utopia launch the Android app ?I wonder how how Utopia is available on playstore since it is a P2P platform. Is google allowing P2P apps ?I have reviewed the desktop app earlier in the review campaign and will try out the Android app over the weekend.You know what, I tried mining CRP on cloud as mentioned in the official website and forgot to turn off the cloud instance at the end of month.Later, I started getting notifications about getting billed for $38",

Regarding launch date I'm quite dumbfounded cause you could see it on play store itself.",

I remember installing Tor browser on my phone as well so I should have figured it out.I did know about finding app details but never looked at the release dateÂ   Thanks for letting me know.",
