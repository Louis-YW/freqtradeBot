The coin base transaction is usually unique because it requires close to 100 confirmations in the blockchain before been spent.They contain the output address to which block reward are sent to. Before the reward is distributed to other addresses",

They serve as the bitcoin generation method to get new coins into circulation.Quote from: Sudeeq3350 on May 18, 2023, 05:16:12 PMHow can we use it during bitcoin transactions if it is stronger than a standard transaction?What do you mean stronger? Coinbase transactions are recorded in the block along with other transactions with the same level of difficulty. The bitcoins involved are higher valued cause they are newly minted and have never been involved in any other transaction prior to that.- Jay -",

Quote from: un_rank on May 18, 2023, 09:57:55 PMRegular transactions have inputs and outputs, but coinbase transaction does not have any inputs and are basically created out of thin air. The newly generated coins aren't created out of the thin air. Miners work for them. Quote from: un_rank on May 18, 2023, 09:57:55 PMThe bitcoins involved are higher valued cause they are newly minted and have never been involved in any other transaction prior to that.No. There is no difference between the value of newly generated coins and value of other coins. When you want to sell your bitcoin, no one will ask you whether you have mined them or you have purchased them.",

Ethereum is an example of a coin-based cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin is entirely UTXO-based.Quote from: Sudeeq3350 on May 18, 2023, 05:16:12 PMHow can we use it during bitcoin transactions if it is stronger than a standard transaction?Coinbase transactions are not 'stronger' than any other transaction; I'm not even sure what you mean by that.",

I am aware miners work for them, the out of thin air reference refers to the fact that the coins are not outputs from any previous transaction. So if you are tracing the flow of a particular input, you can only go as far back as the coinbase transaction.- Jay -",
