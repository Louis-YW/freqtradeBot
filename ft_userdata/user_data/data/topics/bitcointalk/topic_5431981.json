For one, the reports might not be acted upon, and they are just generic domains that don't take much to create, they will spring up faster than they can be reported.",

Probably sending the link to telegram users too and he could easily say he misspelled it.But obviously, even without these DMs, he does have the intention to use the domain to redirect users to his binance ref link. This is not far from the situation of registering bitcointalk.xyz and sending visitors to binance ref.",

This means that if you eventually create an account with Binance, even if it's months later, the tracking cookie will let Binance know which referral link you used in the past. The person who set up the redirect website will then receive credit for the referral. It's likely that this is the main reason for setting up the redirect website and spreading the tracking cookie with his referral code as widely as possible.Although this tactic might be a bit shady and deceptive, I agree with others that there is no basis for reporting the website. After all, there's nothing illegal about it as far as I know. It is possible, however, that it violates Binance's affiliate marketing policy.",
