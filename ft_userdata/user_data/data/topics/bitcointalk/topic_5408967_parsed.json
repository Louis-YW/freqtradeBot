If you already have one the question is moot,you can try mining with it and observe for yourself. You will be disappointed. Real GPU mining needs a GPU with 8 GB of VRAM or more.",

That 3060 RTX is still 520$ in my country, for 47MH per 400$ GPU is a very good price, I don't know why RTX won't go down here right now only GTX and RX cards are dirty cheap right now.",

Video cards 570/580 from $200 because they are newer. 4GB versions cost about $100 and even a little cheaper. But there are less than 40 days left. In China, new 3060 Ti video cards cost from $500.",
