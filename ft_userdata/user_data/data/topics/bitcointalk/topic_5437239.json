I think many user will be interested to purchased your art if you will post this on the collectible section to help you gather funds for your sewing machine aside from your fund raising.

A similar employee at a factory in China would make pennies.I can’t compete with sweatshop prices, and I don’t want to.People expecting big-box prices for handmade goods. And the sad truth is, most of the time those handmade goods are underpriced just to compete with this mindset. These customers don’t see the hours of design, standing in the fabric store deciding between fabrics, emails back and forth if someone wants a custom piece, and the hours of learning and refining the craft. It’s said that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert on something. Since that first sewing class through today, I have accrued much more than 10,000 hours of sewing. When you buy handmade, you’re not just buying a dress or a purse. You’re buying the entire handmade experience. The next time you’re considering buying a handmade item, remember there’s a woman sitting behind a sewing machine in her basement, surrounded by mountains of fabric and years of experience, putting a piece of her soul into that item, hoping that you will get as much joy from the finished product as she gets from making it, and maybe she can pay some bills too.",

I just want to give a piece of advice regarding failed auction, Your problem started when you didn’t honor this auction https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5348726.msg57434912#msg57434912. User here will not trust you anymore on your succeeding auction if you didn’t resolve the issue properly. Your negative trust score also affects this fund raising of your in the forum since you have a record of not honoring the rules of auction here.I do understand the hard work on your art because my mother is sewer too of hand bags. She got only small pay despite of the time and effort she puts on her creation. The world doesn’t value properly those hard work of small people but they are willing to throw huge chunk of money for crappy item that is made by popular companies even though it just made somewhere in China factory. I do sense your effort and fashion to your work. I hope that you will succeed on your fundraising here and social media. I really suggest to resolve first your previous issue by reaching out to the affected users.",

Some of the artwork is over $1000, for example. People pay little attention to how difficult something was to create unfortunately. If you can afford it, I would suggest doing auctions with lower starting bids.Your negative ratings from 2021 don't help you either. Misunderstanding or not, it could have been handled better. Now everyone sees a red flag when they want to do business with you. Have you tried talking with the people who left you those ratings to see if they would consider removing them or changing them to neutral. Maybe you can offer an item you made at a discount to the person who thought they won the auction, and in return they will consider deleting the rating.Another question: have you tried selling over Ebay or some other online marketplaces that exist where you live for fiat?",
