  "content": "I'm consider selling off some of my hoard but I want to know if anyone is interested first. I have a considerable amount of both gold and silver, the silver is 925 sterling and the gold is grouped 10k, 14k, and 18k. I will break the lots up into smaller lots, silver will be sold by 100 gram lots and gold in 1-5 gram lots. You will never get less than promised but you may get slightly more because of the scrap source. This is not bullion grade but sourced from jewelry, coins etc.I am looking to get paid in BTC or ETH but I will consider altcoin trades.Let me know if you are interested by replying here and feel free to ask any questions I will get back to you asap.",
