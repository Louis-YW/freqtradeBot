  "content": "Is there a way miners agree to coordinate an attack on the network? I know there is, the point is that I don't see the possible gaining other than short ETH in the market or making a point about the real danger of this merge. Also, coordinate miners can (as some have probably already done) buy a PoW currency, then move their hash power to it, wait for the market to buy it, and finally sell and go elsewhere with their mining power. Since a bit percentage of mining is in big pools, are they less likely to act in a \"malicious\" way for facing legal prosecution (or ethics)? I just want to understand the game's theoretical options for the agents, miners are going to lose an income and be terminated, and they could try to take advantage of their power before being relieved. IMAO this merging process is totally unsafe, they can always use the override card (or the fork card like on the DAO event), but wouldn't that be proof (one more) of a deception? I understand that this is an experimental technology, they're doing the necessary research and some good can come from it. But I find a huge part of the Ethereum community very arrogant, talking about flippening, laughing at other projects... That lack of modesty is what I don't get",

I am expecting a 300000 block last minute delay or merge and the best crash and burn ever.But what do I know. GameStop stock went up up and away. so maybe eth does the same after its sept merge. (if a sept merge happens)For those that don't know what GameStop did it went as high as 81.25 usd jan 29 2021 up from 4.42 on Jan 8 2021 it is down to 31.55 usd now.if eth goes up 18x like GameStop did it will top btc as it will be near 27K",
