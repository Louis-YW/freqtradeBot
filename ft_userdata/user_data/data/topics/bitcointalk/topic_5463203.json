  "content": "We dont see that Free money in the world now Even the UK libor ended it means it's end of the Free Money and speculation.But me and many others Will choose UK libor and financial speculations and inflation becouse If economy not stimulated and we have economic problems it Will create crime rate bigger.We cant shut down the money printers we have to do brrrrr....in order to keep economy good becouse i see now our safety is in question.Now there is more Robberies car stealing and other crimes and when countries have economy problems then to put criminals in prison and keeping them in there it's extra Cost and by the way more expensive.We the people Are use to with good life and Comfort lifestyle with housing food and using bank credit quite easy when all this. End then many people turn into criminals becouse when you want to eat you want to survive you not think clearly anymore your insticts will lead you and you might be Even dangerous for yourself.What i say here IS this that we must return back to money printer brrrrrrr.... And keep economy stimulus it's safe for all of us the bad economy Will create too high crime rates that we Will have more expenses for prisons for security and insurance.We can always print brrrrt...as long as we have enough risk assets where the exsessive money Will go in order to keep inflation Under the control so the gold Silver btc will take the inflation hit like a thunder storm strike Will hit the stabilzier and it Will Direct the sttrike into the ground that's the Job of gold Silver and btc as long as money been printed and invested in risk aassets a lot then we can keep this economy stimulus and Crime rate down and prosperity for all of us at least for Western Nations like UK Canada Au and Europe when we Are use to with things what's Luxury for maybe other places but things like new iphone is normal thing for us it's nothing special becouse we do printer brrrrrr.So this letter should be sent to central banks so they Will Understood that it's bad for safety to LET economy down.I hope u like this idea",

      "body": "There is no solution to high inflation problem, if you think you have one you are wrong, you are not a politician, leave that side for those who are running it, there are many people who blame the government for problems in the country but if they are given the chance to become the leader themselves they will probably make the nation problem more worse. The government isn't going to solve everyone's problem, the highest I can expect from them is security, there is a good reason why we aren't taught about how to make money in school, the government will seize to exist if everyone is rich, there will be chaos, who is going to be my maid? Who is going to work on the oil rigs? Who is going to dig the ground for natural resources? Who is going to construct the bridges? Workers exists because of the future of every countries and schools was created in such a way that you graduate to work under the government.Forget what you think you know, the situation of countries is getting worsen, you just need to work on yourself, be a man of creativity if you want to change your tight situation, as things are getting more advanced you also start becoming more advance.Free money isn't coming, be creative enough to start making money and forget what the government have to offer, it won't favour the government if they are helping people anyhow.The ultimate goal of the government is 'KEEP THEM POOR\".",
