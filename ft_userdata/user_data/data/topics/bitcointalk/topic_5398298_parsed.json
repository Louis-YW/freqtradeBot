So it can change, in fact, the first time I looked at it, it said less than 10 minutes, or the next block.",

If you take a look at that graph:https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,8h,fee,17You will see that 17sats does not guarantee it will be confirmed in the next block. And looking back for last 24h, the situation is the same.I would suggest to increase fee if it is possible - or just wait.",
