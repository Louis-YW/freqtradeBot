That way they can refund you the remaining 10k. I'm sure you won't mind waiting up to 2 days for the KYC. If everything goes well, don't use them again as they are slow as snail.",

For the record, I am merely stating the obvious here, I am not defending them. This is the first time I heard about them, and I am understand your reluctance for waiting for two days, given their ToS state that the longest time should be 24 hours or less. I am inviting their representative here to give their explanation regarding your issue, but don't hold your breath, their last online activity was on the 30th of May, almost two weeks ago.Meanwhile, can you give us the exact screenshot of your email exchanges with them? Maybe they give an explanation about it there.",

ChangeHero is striving to protect the customers and partners from any kind of fraudulent activity, that is why we are following AML/KYC standards. Our risk-scoring system can pause a transaction for further verification and manual processing. Requesting Source of Funds is a common practice when conducting AML checks and once the customer provides us with the necessary information, their transaction gets released.Before carrying out the transaction, the user agrees to the policy and rules of our exchanger (https://changehero.io/aml-kyc). You have given your agreement before the exchange too. As a result, the risk-scoring system paused your exchange, and it required KYC. Since you refused to undergo the KYC procedure, according to our rules (https://changehero.io/aml-kyc), we can refund you your amount -10% due to denying going through the KYC procedure.We are absolutely transparent and do not hide the working conditions. And we are always trying to help the user. We feel sorry for your negative experience with our service. So if you are experiencing any issues with ChangeHero, please do not hesitate to contact our support team, we will be glad to help.Mila, ChangeHero team",

Op contact ChangeHero Team for your refund as they have stated here that they will refund you the -10% taken as a result of not completing the KYC.",

Honestly I'm trying to imagine the operational fees you mean, but on the other hand I conclude you are playing with the regulations. Hope I'm wrong.",
