It just seems that way because there's a majority of RED in the market, and it just makes sense with everything happening worldwide. I hope every important coin will recover in these situations, but we will only be sure if we are there already.

If this happens, everything some of us always talk about comes true.  I could translate your statement into 'Which is why the Governments will ban Decentralization and BTC will die soon after, while the Centralized Altcoins will survive'.No matter how you take it and spin it, Bitcoin is not the main cause of global warming nor should it be the priority on making things more environment friendly.  Bitcoin is only currently sitting at the top of the list because they do not like not being in power of our finances.  And while I think any solution to the long term effects of mining is warmly welcomed by any of the Bitcoin enthusiasts, for now I am convinced it is just an attack on Bitcoin's name.Quote from: crwth on November 22, 2022, 01:32:17 AMI believe it's important that renewable energy resources should be the ones facilitating all the mining power used by miners ASAP.

      "body": "Bitcoin dominance is high so altcoins do tend to drop because of that (it's around 40% and normally falls to 80%+ at its worst afaik). Based on previous crashes, the altcoins don't crash compared with bitcoin until bitcoin has dropped and doesn't rebound for a month or two (on a greater sustained scale than the one we've seen - however the forks and random news of fake innovation for most coins have done well to keep their coins as strong as they have).Renewables are handy if you've got a large power grid and a fairly well diversified area to host them. If you're not including multiple countries in the grid, you're wasting your time though as this isn't what they are best at. Energy rates only went up in Europe, a lot of other places put their rates up using that as an excuse, there's lots of oil that can be extracted cheaply from areas and that might end up being done.",

For bitcoin to resurrect it needs to die first, and that is not happening, its value can go down as we have seen many times in the past, but disappearing to the point not a single person around the world is using it would be the only way for bitcoin to die and I do not see it.Also while many shitcoins will in fact die during the next years, it is impossible for every single one to disappear too as scammers can create new coins with no cost for themselves, which explains why the number of coins in this market keeps increasing.",

It's not an immediate return for us but it's on the long-term side of things. At least reducing waste is already a good direction for us. I do hope that all of the countries have these reforms, not just concerned with the mining operations but in general terms. As long as recycling is concerned and the energy that it takes to mine up a single BTC is to be dealt with. Little things are okay as long as it's in the right direction.",

Currently, it can be said that all industries and jobs use energy and emit waste, the ultimate purpose is to serve people and so is bitcoin, It is like any other industry, consuming energy but also creating a lot of value for us. So if we say the cause of global warming, everything is making the earth warm, not just bitcoin. The possibility of POW being banned is entirely possible, but the root cause is due to the decentralization of bitcoin, not the use of energy. The government has failed with bitcoin, they have not been able to control it and there is no way to stop bitcoin nor, so they will find a way to blame it and rule it out.",

      "body": "My take on this is that some altcoins will survive, but many will really eventually die. Bitcoin will preserve its leadership.Those with most danger to not survive are those who depend on a centralized \"team\" which has ensured a lot of income at the coin's start with a generous (often 100%!) premine. If these coins lose value and fail to get long term success, it's very likely that the team simply dumps the premine and disappears. We have had this dozens or hundreds of times since 2013, and it can happen to any premined & centralized coin, even those in the top 50 currently. (Well, I think with the exception of maybe Ethereum because it has already such a big ecosystem.)Quote from: PrivacyG on November 22, 2022, 01:51:30 AMHow many solar panels or other renewable energy producing equipment is built in an environmentally friendly factory using renewable energy?Solar panels produce much more electricity than what is wasted when they are produced, so the contribution is positive even if they're produced with the dirtiest coal-based energy.The indicator you must look at is called ERoEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) or Energy Return on Investment (EROI), which indicates the relation between energy generated during the lifetime of a typical installation and wasted energy during production of the technology.- PV panels have a very wide range, from about 8 (which still means that they return 8 times more energy than what was wasted) to around 35 [1]- Wind energy has an average around 20, some modern turbines up to over 30 [2] [3]- Hydropower has about 50 [4]Sources:[1] PV: 2015 study in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews (doi:10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.057)[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222703134[3] Vestas numbers for their V150 turbine[4] Weißbach et al., 2013 (https://festkoerper-kernphysik.de/Weissbach_EROI_preprint.pdf) (also includes some outdated numbers for other technologies like solar and wind, even then they're still net positive.)Thus, while it's currently not very likely to mine with 100% renewables if you include the production of the generation technology, you can reach numbers of around 95-98% easily.",
