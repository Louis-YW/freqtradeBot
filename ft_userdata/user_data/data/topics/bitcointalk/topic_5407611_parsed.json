  "content": "Hello all,Over the weekend I had an issue in my mine that lead to some high humidity. I have 3 S19's now that are \"on the fritz\" One machine wont hash on any board, one only see's one board, and one sees two.  I am assuming the humidity killed/damaged the PSU's or in a stroke of insane badluck I managed to have a ton of dirty hashboards all happen at once. Here is a log from one machine that is only seeing two hashboards. I have other logs I can send/post as wellCode:===========================================Miner log===========================================1970-01-01 00:00:09 Miner compile time: Tue Nov 16 19:20:40

Unplug the power cord 20 minutes then  restart it again,2. restore the antminer to the  factory settings,3. change the power supply, plug the cable,4. upgrade to the latest firmware,5. clean up the dust for the antminer 6. check the ambient temperature",

What do you mean they didn't skip a beat? Are the miner is now running fine?If you have a multimeter I'd like you to check the PIC chip on the hashboard if there is 3.3v supplying the PIC chip if there is no voltage or less there is a problem with other components not supplying enough power to your PIC chip. I hope that you have some repairing tools you can follow this guide below- https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/Antminer-S19-Pro-Hash-Board-Repair-Guide.aspIf you don't have repairing tools then your last hope is to hire a technician you can check this https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/ they do have a list of repair centers and maybe there is one near in your area.",

HeyDid you try both of the following solutions as per : Support Bitmain : s19pro fail to read pic temp for chain 0 ?Solution 1 (I guess that you already tried these steps ?) :Quote1 Unplug the power cord 20 minutes then  restart it again,2 restore the antminer to the  factory settings ,3 change the power supply, plug the cable,4 upgrade to the latest firmware,5 clean up the dust for the antminer 6 check the ambient temperatureSolution 2 :QuoteMy importer has found a solution to this problem.1. Disconnect all hashboards and flash the main board firmware2. Connect only hashboard 1 and flash the firmware3. Connect only hashboard 2 and flash the firmware4. Connect only hashboard 3 and flash the firmware5. Restart the miner with all hashboards connected.This has resoved the issue for two of my  S19pro 110ths units.Hopefully it will work for others too",

It needs a BGA HotAir blower to replace the chip or to reattach the heatsink.But if you don't have tools then it would be better to hire a technician I already posted a link above where you can find a repair center.",

I don't think Zeus has any repair center outside of China, those are just listed by them no sponsored or guaranteed by ZeusBTC, they probably did a bit of due diligence before listing all those repair centers, but that doesn't mean much, my info could be outdated but a few years ago, I was told by the owner of ZeusBTC himself that they were not affiliated with those repair centers, maybe things changed so do reach out to them.As for other repair centers charging more than Bitmain, that's pretty normal, they are probably faster than Bitmain, sending your gear to Bitmain for repair is rather risky, I heard terrible stories of people waiting for ages to get their miner's back.Quotealso please advice that should i send the whole miner or just the hashboards for repair, coz sending only hashboards for repair will massively reduce the shipping cost.If the miner is under warranty Bitmain wants you to always send the whole miner unless you manage to convince them otherwise, I did that once after a long debate with them, and ended up sending them only the bad control board, if it's just for repair that isn't under warranty I see no reason why they would force you to send the whole miner, unless they suspect the issue to be something else like PSU or CB.",

( may be one temp sensor gone bad on each board due to high humidity and lost internet connection for hours and machines were on and fans were sending more humid air in cold machine)which seems unlikely...or may be its psu unit which broke due to high humidity which also seems unlikelyi have now 4 machines all broke before 2 year of mining, 2 s19 pro already broke 6 months ago showing same  problem of temperature.does any one tried bitmain usa or china repair center for repair?",
