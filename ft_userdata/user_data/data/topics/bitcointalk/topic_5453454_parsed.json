      "body": "Been surrounded with crypto investors is an advantage because you could easily get firsthand about the whole thing. Just like you said bitcoin requires capital and patience, also have the mindset that bitcoin isn’t a quick get rich scheme. Although with proper understanding of its trading you could make profits from it. The most important advice on crypto space is to invest an amount you can lose, this advice is because bitcoin and crypto in general is volatile. As a beginner to minimize risk stick only to bitcoin holding, investing into Altcoins are only profitable to experience trader’s because it is more of pump and dump coins, so to invest in it is risky for a beginner Also do not quit your job to focus on crypto trading only",

And there's no guaranteed that even you start with a capital, your success isn't assured. The best approach is to start little and then learn the market as if you have no option since you've placed your money already. Dollar cost averaging(DCA) will be suggested to you by many and take note of how you do it. You can start with as little as you can while testing the waters until you've got enough of it and ready to venture more with your additional capital.",

This is why I haven't ventured into the space, but with good guide I believe I can make it as well. For those looking to earn significantly from the cryptocurrency market, capital is, in my opinion, the most crucial factor.There are other ways to succeed in the cryptocurrency world as well, but the ideal approach is to have your own money. However, before you start investing in the cryptocurrency market, try to learn more about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. As a beginner, I can only advise you to invest in bitcoin first and steer clear of all other cryptocurrencies, as many of them are worth investing in nothing but trash. This is because beginners may lack the information necessary to do their own thorough study to identify the best coins or tokens out all existing altcoins.
