Have you really ponder despite ethereum been proof of work back then, a lot of people still considered it as not decentralized like the way Bitcoin was highly decentralized? That's because everything about bitcoin is trustless, you can verify everything by yourself and you will see that there is no single point of failure, then network works in way that transactions from the signature verifier to node then to miner and then back to node are independently done with any form of comprising but ethereum wanted optimization with too much point of failures and yet it was consuming much energy as a proof of work.If there is anything I like about Bitcoin compare to altcoins is the fact that Bitcoin is just Bitcoin and over the years it has proven to be unique in all ways compare to altcoins, it get to decide if the market is going to move or not, there is no way Bitcoin will crash altcoins doesn't, it decide the faith of the market and that's why it's most owned by the institutional investors.",

Altcoins are copies of Bitcoin created with the sole purpose of making profit through speculation. Bitcoin was created with an ideal in mind by Satoshi Nakamoto, while altcoins copied Bitcoin with the purpose of generating profit for crypto developers who saw in Bitcoin an opportunity for a living.Even the top altcoin, which is Ethereum, enjoys the current status it has because it allows another crypto developers to launch their own tokens on its network. It's everything about speculation and quick profit opportunities, while the most important features they offer, Bitcoin already offered before any of them imagined existing.As I see, Bitcoin is here to stay. On the other hand, altcoins just want to take some advantage of Bitcoin's popularity aiming quick gains for its developers, whales and early investors in general. If you want to think only about gains and forget the ideals Bitcoin brought up, you can be assured it's still the best alternative, because BTC is much more reliable on long run, as we can see its history since the beginning.",

You have to work for success; it's not guaranteed. Many altcoins lack substance, and adding staking to a proof-of-work consensus can seem nonsensical. To avoid creating a rug-pull sham coin, focus on building a solid project with capable leaders, securing exchange listings, and acquiring at least 100k to kickstart. Strong leadership is crucial for maintaining repositories and providing updates. Launching an Ethereum token, or any token, demands liquidity and faith in its potential. The crypto market cap could hit 100 trillion if not for the prevalence of rug pulls and scams.What's your project? Thanks for sharing. I appreciate some altcoin initiatives I've mentioned earlier. They hold potential but depend heavily on vision and execution. I personally prefer mining SHA256 over involvement or investment in ERC20 but have no issue using ERC20 to support SHA256 or facilitate cross-chain swaps",

And ETH has better technology with a robust blockchain that includes smart contracts, from the point of view of technology ETH is better than Bitcoin.

Not all coins can easily build a strong community like bitcoin, and if ever there is, most probably it could be only be less temporary since altcoins have bigger chances to lose its value easily and end up as shitcoins, that's why a lot are hesitant trusting altcoins over bitcoin. Also, having bitcoin's position as the king of crypto, that alone proves that bitcoin has greater advantages than altcoins, something that other investors are still blind with it.",

      "body": "QuoteWhat is your most important pro Bitcoin argument?Bitcoin was designed, where there was no such thing as \"cryptocurrency\". There were only fiat currencies. In 2009, people didn't even know, what \"altcoin\" means. And because of that, the design assumed, that it is the only coin, made of bits, and there is no competitor, besides fiat, and centralized banking services.Which means, that if you want to create a successful altcoin, you have to assume, that Bitcoin is already there. And then, you have to compete with it. You have to provide something, which can be done only on your chain, and nowhere else, and what cannot be copy-pasted into Bitcoin, because it would be considered \"out of scope for the payment system\".In general, if you want to make an altcoin, then it should not be focused on producing any new coins at all. If you do so, then you repeat something, which is built into Bitcoin, and you have to compete on the same field, which is difficult, and most altcoins die, when they try it (another reason not to do that, is because then you abuse 21 million coins limit, by creating more of them, out of thin air).A good example is NameCoin: imagine how better it could be, if it could only produce new domain names, without producing any new coins at all, and if all NameCoin transactions would be Bitcoin-denominated, so that you would have 1:1 peg with Bitcoin, and use them for all of your purchases. Also imagine, how good NameCoin could be, if there would be a market of vanity miners, which would mine you some Bitcoin addresses of any type you want, and would receive some domain names (or some Bitcoins, not NameCoins) as a reward.QuoteMy most important Bitcoin argument is PoWThe only reason why a lot of altcoins switched from double SHA-256 into something else, is because they still don't know, how to implement Merged Mining correctly. In general, what they should do, is to always keep track of the heaviest chain of 80-byte block headers, no matter, if they are valid or not. Then, based on that, they should calculate the global double SHA-256 difficulty. And then, they should allocate any actions, like producing some new coins, in a way, which would be related into that.For example: if Bitcoin can reward someone with 4 BTC, for difficulty X, and your altcoin has 1/1000000 of the total double SHA-256 power, then your altcoin should reward your miners with an equivalent of 400 satoshis, and not for example 50 ALTs. In the best case, it would be related to your own product, like \"a new domain name\", and not \"just some dummy number, worth 400 sats\".",

You will see people saying bitcoin only stays as number one because it was the first, I totally disagree the utility surrounding bitcoin will help it go past any other coins even if it comes earlier. People’s claim about bitcoin having scalability issue and other coins been more scalable is to me not a good point. The reason why bitcoin is faced with congestion is the nature of use, if any other coins especially those with low transaction fee actually gets the same volume that is on bitcoin I believe they will be much worse. My other argument is, no matter the problems people think it’s has no one has created something that beats it or correct those mistakes, solving those problems only results into some certain limitations of security. Bitcoin is also less volatile and a safe heaven well looking for a currency with less inflation risk.",

Although altcoins are there and have also been proven to be a good alternative to bitcoin, not all altcoins could have the potential to grow or have a good future because people or investors are also becoming more meticulous when it comes to investing in different coins because there are a lot of coins that could become scams or have the potential to rug pull, which should be avoided. That's why there are just a few altcoins that are popular because they manage to establish a good community for their currency. Why bitcoin first?
