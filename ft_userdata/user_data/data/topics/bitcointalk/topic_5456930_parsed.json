Going cashless helps reduce the rate of security risk of physical attack of robbery by carry cash in hand, its equally seamless and stress free at a go for the traders, this and other reasons the traders must have taken into consideration and that's why despite living in a local area they still embrace the cashless trend of online payments.Did you know that as a trader that accepts cashless transactions you're likely to have more customers patronage compared to another trader that only accepts cash. Customers are likely to return to where they received a convenient service.",

I'm impressed with them because it's still a poor area and payments are mostly cash, but the way they're approaching the changes in the world is still unrestricted.I was in the bank one day and a customer was issuing a cheque to the bank cashier and was expecting to receive cash. The banker told him that he cannot receive such money across the counter because it was against the bank policy. He was advised to download the bank app. or use the ATM. He complained that he doesn't want to use to channels because he was scared of fraud. The banker told him bluntly that if he refuses to use these modern channels very soon he will be cut off from the world financial system. In my country, even roadside petty traders both in urban and rural areas are accepting bank transfers and POS payments. Very soon cash will become outdated because even central banks are even shifting toward central bank digital currency (CBDC).QuoteIn recent years, especially after the outbreak of the disease worldwide, the shift of people to payment via Internet channels or mobile phones has increased both the number and value of transactions.

In addition, the full data connection contributes to preventing fraudulent acts, enhancing information security.Companies spend so much money on research and development. Without information or data, many top firms cannot make decisions that will help the growth and expansion of the business. They need to understand the needs of the people so that they can come up with products that will help to satisfy these needs. With data, many companies will be able to identify opportunities and threats that the business might face in the future. Data collection and analysis make decision-making easy.

In life, there are problems that will come to universalize it but over time people do think we will use less cash.These changes in technology, financial transactions, and communication are happening everywhere but at different rates and mediums. In some places, the changes are faster and widely accepted, while in other places it is gradually due to some factors. Factors like political system, religion, education, and level of poverty will determine how fast these changes will reflect in the everyday lives of the people.",

This is innovation and this inevitable and it's good to hear that even in places where technology isn't expected to be advance, there goes the vendors, merchants and business folks that are already using it. While we should also be careful keeping our data and information online, the thieves are also improving. Before, they're pickpocketing our physical wallets, now, they've become cyber-criminals and thieves that are trying to get onto everyone with every and little information they get from their targets and victims.

I do not think that the reason for this is the epidemic, but many economic variables, for example inflation is one of the important factors in cashless payments, where instead of moving large cash blocks and trying to sell them quickly due to inflation, you can do that from banking applications easily, this is good for both the buyer and the consumer as they tend Because governments are slow to print larger denominations of cash, which makes the user have to carry many small denominations, or wastes time by carrying large denominations and waiting for everything to be counted manually.https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/25032/the-inflation-monster-is-destroying-your-wealth-every-year/The ease of conducting transactions digitally, the presence of a smartphone for each user, the stability of the Internet, and the ease of use of interfaces for these applications are what made them relatively better than cash.",

Twenty years ago it was impractical to accept card payments for $2 payments.

Therefore, it is natural for the use of cashless payments to increase. Many people work remotely and stay at home. In other words, they do not have physical interaction with other people, so they spend their money remotely. This is both convenience and distracts you from an effort.Making transactions in the digital environment can sometimes cause us to make mistakes. There are some things we should pay attention to in these payments. If we make our account that we will use cashless payment in the form of a virtual card and set the limit, we can prevent us from making mistakes when we are distracted.

It means more centralized control toward governments, which in some cases, specifically on authoritarian and repressive governments would be bad things.

Fortunately, it is easy to avoid if you're willing to use other alternatives, especially in regard to crypto trading/payment activity IMO. On the other hand, as long as you have a decent understanding of how scammers work you can avoid their trap.
