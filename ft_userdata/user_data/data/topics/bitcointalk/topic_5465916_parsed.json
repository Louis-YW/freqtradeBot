Pesin fit don raise this mata for here, but I check and I no see nai make I create am. My observation? I notice say for this local board, we don dey deviate from the local English we de nack for here and come dey use as oyinbo go call am \"Queens English\" for here which to me dey quite disturbing. My reason? I stroll enter local boards of other boards like the Polish, German and even Dutch. One thing dey there; except you are opportuned to hear those languages or you dey use translator, you no fit code wetin them dey yarn and e come sweet me unto say them dey promote themselves for the forum and members wey belong to that place go feel like them dey dia cabal away from home. I doff hat for wetin oga Mpa dey do for \"African proverbs in Pidgin\" and him make sure say nah strictly pidgin we dey nack.When I see us dey burse English for local, (no be say e bad to speak am o) but I dey feel somehow. E come be like say I still dey other parts of the forum. I just feel say as each of us no fit nack our dialects, make we use this one represent. I go like hear una thoughts on this.",

I know say for your mind now e go be like as you go other boards you don’t understand anything they said, you will also like it if we do d same but that is not the case make we just they go like dix e make sense",

      "body": "@Majestic-milfI have seen you replied under my thread before which was definitely created in English. I am wondering why you brought this question up again when it has been answered countless number of times. For a senior member to see a legendary posting in English and challenging it, I think some bigger ranks are involved. If big members are not involved, please, let us stop this spam and repeated question. This was created five days ago.Quote from: Igebotz on December 21, 2022, 04:48:22 PMMy reason? I stroll enter local boards of other boards like the Polish, German and even Dutch.How about India? IndiaI supposed not to refer to Indian board, but you were using other local boards as an example.Local board is not about the language that you speak or used to communicate, it is about discussing what is happening in your (local) community. The exceptional case would be if some people in your country do not know how to communicate in the general language, that could be the reason a local language can be enforced. All of us on these forum excellently understand English. And we agree that we can all post in English, Pidgin or English/Pidgin. We can posts in either or both. We should not violate the rules of the local board:Quote from: Igebotz on December 21, 2022, 04:48:22 PM1. Only Naija Pidgin and English is allowedI can point to all posts in Pidgin that the Nigeria (articles, news) links that you people are posting are in English. Click on the links on the posts below:Dis one nah another achievementTribunal court don set judgement for  PEPTThe posts are in Pidgin, but the links you people are including (in your Pidgin posts) are written in English. I can point to more and more. This indicates how English is widely spoken in our country.We should not continue to spam this board with Pidgin matter, let us bring something useful for ourselves that will educate us more.Please, you do not have to force people to post in Pidgin, let individual choose the one they want voluntarily.",
