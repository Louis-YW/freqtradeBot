If their hippocampus gets affected, they'll have to start afresh to learn again. Few things on earth are guaranteed, saving a wealth isn't guaranteed. Wealth can disappear, stolen or forgotten. I could remember how embarrassed I felt the day I forgot my password; my brain failed me. I used this example because unlocking my device is something I do more than 10 times a day. So, people should hold their money in ways they think works for them. Because we have different destinies.",

However, when the wrong decision is made correction should be the next step.",

      "body": "Quote from: Kara3 on May 27, 2023, 10:46:56 PMThe fact that you can lose money on a business an can make it back in no time so far as you have the knowledge.Economics teaches us how to be conservative and how to judiciously spend our money, because every dollar that you waste doesn't come back to you without a cost. Yes, you are right that one can lose money in business and get it back when you have a sound mind about how to go about getting your money back, but that money you lost doesn't come back freely to you. You will still have to do some labor to get it back. So, I can say that even while you are investing in your head and learning how to earn, you also learn how to manage risk and use the money judiciously and conservatively. Perhaps, as the @Accardo has said, even while you are making that money, the head doesn't save money.QuoteHappy children day from this side of the world!!!Happy Children's Day to you!",

Rather, my money can be embezzled by the bank authorities at any time. Since my money is completely controlled by them, some measures should be taken where my assets are controlled by me. In this case, the most secure and acceptable method is to invest on Bitcoin. Because if I invest in Bitcoin, my money will be completely in my hands.",

I can say that your money is still safe in the banks, until they will become bankrupt because they're holding it for those people out there who are using it though it isn't safe for inflation though. Money not safe at home? It depends on the situation I must say. I mean if there aren't any thieves around then I can say that it's safe right?You've said it already that knowledge is the greatest thing that we can give to ourselves, and it's true, but knowledge alone isn't enough if you don't know how to make actions. There are some people out there who have the knowledge about certain things, but they are afraid to make actions because of maybe lack of self-confidence or whatever reason that is. Knowledge is a vital role to one's success, but executing, and making action is one important part as well.",

No one can steal it from you, and most likely you will get a better job in the future if you study hard.So yeah, I do agree that knowledge is the key here, and you should know how to harness the knowledge thru the education that we have to went. Of course, not everything is being thought in school, but at least we can piece the puzzle as we mature because of our education.",

Major banks in various major countries have gone bankrupt and many people have lost their money. So I think it is best to invest in cryptocurrency rather than bank. Keeping money in the bank is not a problem at all but the virtual currency Bitcoin definitely has some good hopes in the future.",
