That's right we need coins like that because of the ongoing updates that are little by little taking us our privacy again with the new updates. When remembering back then, the government are less occupied with what was going on with the crypto industry because they thought it was just some scheme that was used for scams. now that they see it's an earning opportunity for them, they put a heavy load on the people behind it and take huge actions on the projects that they cannot put their hands on. For example these privacy coins we have right now.",

This can be a good update and probably a new trend, if SHIB will successfully implement this update, you can expect more up trend to their value. The issue with SHIB is their utility, and now they are planning to create utilities which can be a big one, will try to analyze this and start to buy some SHIB before its too late, bull hype started to come.",

And does that mean that its rate will now start growing?Never heard about it. But if the rumors are true, then you can bet SHIBA's price will increase for a short period of time. I honestly don't think how developers are going to add privacy features to Shiba Inu itself, especially when it's a token (smart contract) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The only thing I can think of is forking a mixer contract like Tornado.Cash for users to \"anonymize\" their SHIBA tokens. Adding ZK-Proofs capability into the SHIBA smart contract itself will be a tough one, especially when gas fees on the ETH blockchain are extremely high. It wouldn't be a good idea to make SHIBA a privacy-focused coin, as that would lead most exchanges to de-list it. After all, privacy goes against KYC/AML rules for which centralized exchanges are required to comply. Because SHIBA would lose a lot by becoming a privacy coin, it would be best for third-party apps to do the job. The Bermuda dApp does a similar function to Bitcoin's \"Samourai\" wallet, without actually requiring a change in the cryptocurrency's code. It's much easier and doesn't inflict blame directly into the cryptocurrency itself. Governments are taking a stricter approach towards crypto/Blockchain tech, so we'll see how this plays out in the long run. Just my thoughts",

XMR is the leading privacy coin. The main and, perhaps, indisputable advantage is absolute anonymity and confidentiality. Transactions are unrelated and therefore impossible to track. Also untraceable are carefully hidden addresses.",

I think it will take tens of years to step on the price you mentioned, if you continue to develop it.",
