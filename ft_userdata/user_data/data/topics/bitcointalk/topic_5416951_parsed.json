  "content": "Multiple emirates in the UAE are looking to the metaverse to boost tourism in their respective regions. Sharjah the second most populous emirate in the UAE, with roughly 1.8 million people now joins Dubai in broadening its Web3 ambitions. Through Sharjahverse, the entire emirate will be viewable to the public. The new metaverse city is a “photorealistic, physics-accurate” metaverse that encompasses the emirate’s 1,000 square-mile surface area. The virtual city will support the local tourism industry and potentially create new metaverse jobs. The metaverse city is backed by the Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority, or SCTDA, which is the main government agency tasked with promoting the emirate’s tourism industry.In addition to growing crypto and blockchain adoption at the emirate level, there are signs that UAE’s federal government is readying positive regulatory catalysts for the country. As reported by Cointelegraph in February, the UAE’s Securities and Commodities Authority is developing crypto licensing legislation that would enable digital asset firms to establish operations in the country.

      "body": "The UAE has been very forward-thinking when it comes to the development of the region with a view to attracting tourism which can be one of the biggest revenue generations and has also been very receptive to the Cryptocurrency/Blockchain ecosystem. I admire what the Government is doing there, first was Dubai, and now Sharjah. The UAE and most especially the emirate of Dubai is already a destination choice for most tourists, this will make it more exciting for tourists to see Sharjah in the same light and they rightly pointed out, create new metaverse jobs.",

And it's a ambition that can be achieved and unlocked by the country.",

Using the google earth is far more attractive to use to have a 360 view on the tourist spot compared on the current graphics if they want to boost tourism. Don’t get the wrong idea on my statement, Metaverse is a good idea but the current technology is very limited to display almost realistic image inside the metaverse. It will take time and resources in able to produce a presentable metaverse that can the display the real beauty of those tourist spot.I hope they have enough funds to continue the product development for long term until they have a good product or else they are just repeating the old version graphics design of old games like what I mention above.",

Therefore, the UAE government as a country will not invest in bitcoin and metaverse, but it may be done through investment funds.So, in short, the news is inaccurate or very optimistic.",

They invest in every field and almost every sector. It is a very good thing that they invest in the crypto money industry and work on metaverse technology. In my opinion, they do this job very comfortably when there is money available in the united Arab emirates.When they invested in something we need to understand that it is the best version of it. I wonder how would it look like and who will be the people that are allowed to test their metaverse city. Looks like it will be one of the best experiences to try it for the first time. If this is open for all, then we might not need to go there to have an experience of the country, even though it's just some virtual world, the experience is more likely the same and if you go there for the first time after getting to their metaverse, it would be like you had been there for long because of the early experience you had in the metaverse.",

Just like Zuckerberg's own version of metaverse who turns out as bad as it is. Say, their application and implementation of the tech turned out flawless, would it even be within reach of us mere mortals anyway? Or would it only be available to the elites whose social status is extremely high and whose pockets are so deep they can do anything that they want. If we won't be able to get a taste of this experience, what's the point of them being the metaverse city at all?",

Though looking at the Metaverse city, it looks like another city and not the known UAE where you can see a lot of buildings but it's good for other emirates to follow the footsteps of the other emirate when it comes to blockchain adoption. This is indeed a promising project and a proof that Metaverse is not done yet.",

Maybe it will trick people into wanting to see the real thing though, I don't know.The project targets people who have the capability to visit the place.  So I believe it is productive and isn't a question of whether people have the capacity or not.  A platform is merely a form of advertising and promotion.  Besides, with or without the metaverse platform, a person cannot visit the place if they don't have money in the first place.  Metaverse is created to give at least a \"first hand\" sample of the environment around and entice those who have the capacity to experience and feel the place in real life.Quote from: abel1337 on October 14, 2022, 06:34:51 PMQuote from: el kaka22 on October 14, 2022, 06:10:41 PMIs this productive or counter-productive?

I believe they do not want a third-party company to have control over their planned project which is why they try to recreate the place themselves.  Besides, I think the country may implement entrance/viewing fees to visitors of the metaverse after it is fully polished.",

I think this is just a private company who created this metaverse but if their government supports this, probably this can be the next big thing. The hype for metaverse might not be here anymore because of bear market, but I’m sure it will come back again because Metaverse is still on its early stage.",
