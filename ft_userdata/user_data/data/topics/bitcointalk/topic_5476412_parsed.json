  "content": "The very first bitcoin bar was opened in Sofia, Bulgaria less than 24 hours ago, or a little farther than 24 hours ago actually, from the pictures posted on Twitter, all looks very interesting to be honest, i could see real deep love for bitcoin in the faces of those in pictures..Here are some of them. Now, the most interesting, and one I love so much is the bitcoin art, a bitcoin painting which is designed in such a manner that it has a hidden message which can only be revealed under a UV light, it also comes with a certificate of authenticity and it's sold for 2.5 million bitcoin sats. Find more about this on X - https://twitter.com/Plamen__Andonov/status/1730922240756138495?s=19Look the beautiful stuffs people around the would are doing and building with Bitcoin, this bar definitely will be the first place I visit if i ever get the chance of traveling to Bulgaria, and I am actually motivated to build something like this in my area here in Nigeria when I make enough money to finance it.Do we have forum users from sofia, Bulgaria here with us on the forum? Check this bar out.And to the general forum users, isn't this a good business idea?",

Maybe they can held monthly or even weekly meeting there and talk about what else their favorite subject, BTC.And they you have the chance to meet different people, know them by faces as we all know that maybe some of their chooses to remain anonymous.Although it might be a haven for some cyber criminals to target Bitcoin enthusiast and committed what we call a 5 dollar wrench attack. So everyone should be very very careful as the statistics are growing with that kind of crimes, just saying.",

As a result of the congested memo pool, people will at least see that the hope is alive and the fees do not change the fact that bitcoin-lovers still exist.  One thing that gives me the most joy in this bitcoin bar is the fact that the owners know what we are currently passing through right now and have made everything available for people to be able to pay through the lightning network, in other not to suffer the networkdelay and the high fee. So no excuse and people who attended the opening party are all happy, at least if I'm not their. I can tell from the picture presented on X (formally known as Twitter), and I hope to see many of such in the near future in places where the government is friendly with bitcoin.",

There are the real MVPs because history will surely be kind to them. However, one of the security concerns I have is when they install a bitcoin ATM. In the past there have cases of bitcoin ATM thefts.I like the designs and the colour blends in the bar.Building something like this in Nigeria will be a hassle but can be done. But there is concern about harassment that people who go there will face from law enforcement agencies those guys are adverts to bitcoin.",

What I have been thinking before maybe weird and unrealistic but, let’s imagine throwing a huge party for Bitcoin lovers then Invite the real Satoshi but without knowing him. Just the idea that he might be anyone beside us inside the party.Anyways, just me and my crazy thoughts. What matters here I think is only promotion for the bar and ability to pay with crypto is nice. Probably, more closer magazines and stores will start using Bitcoin as well.",

Not only it will boost the interest of people to try out Bitcoin, but it will also make more people motivated to get knowing bitcoin. The bar looks classy and the theme itself looks very promising that every customer that gets in will be attracted to the bitcoin representation. I have also my dream building bar with bitcoin, but I think it will be hard to realized because our country itself does not support Bitcoin.Kudos to another bitcoin achievement. This will not be the first and last, but surely there will be more bars like this that will pay tribute to bitcoin. Rooting for that.",

But the positive side is that many people who were not familiar with BTC can to know about Bitcoin after visiting the bar.",

A few days ago we had a discussion about wearing clothes with the BTC logo and I think most people think it's a bad idea, and all those who think so would probably think twice before entering such a bar.Something similar, only in the UK -> Satoshi’s Place, U.K. Bury, Greater Manchester",

Why think about the negative part, yes there could be a risk but I'm sure the facility is safe of course the building or the bar cannot operate thy don't comply to business rules and customers security is one of them, but out side yes its a different story, but the thing is if you are a responsible owner or holder of a bitcoin or have a huge amount of bitcoin holdings of course you will not be a target if you will not give an information, the most effective way to keep out of the radar is keep lowkey, doesn't mean you attend to a bar dedicated to bitcoin means you have a bitcoin holdings or enough to be a targer by those malicious intent, anyway be happy because this kind of entertainment is being build it will help to spread bitcoin even more, more establishement being build dedicated or themed by bitcoin  could help to even more bitcoin investors.",
