  "content": "Hello guys,UPDATE - 1st Giveaway Closed - Winner: elskerlinn----Original postIt's my first post so hi everyone !I'm planning of launching a crypto gambling contest newsletter. The concept is very simple, every week we partner with a crypto casino and allow one of our subscribers to win a few hundreds or low thousands dollars to be spent at the casino partner platform.On one side the casino operator gets a marketing promotion which will eventually results in traffic. On the other side, the members of the newsletter get a chance to win free money to be played. The newsletter would obviously be free to subscribe to.What do you guys think ? I need your feedback as players and therefore potential subscribers.I've talked to a few crypto casinos and I've already some that might be interested to partner for the launch.----FAQWhat is Waggger.com :We are a rewards club for crypto casino players. Every week we organise, in partnership with one or multiple casino partners, a contest where we give away bonuses to be played at their casino.What can I win :The exact figures greatly vary from one casino partner to the next. However, the reward structure remain similar.The winner gets a no deposit bonus of a few hundred dollars to be played at the casino partner with a wager requirement.That’s our plan at the start. Obviously, if we get a good traction, the winner’s bonus will considerably increase to the thousands of dollars.Do I still get something if I didn’t win :Depending on the casino partner, you can still get a small no deposit bonus in order to always incentivise everyone to participate.It’s a win win for everyone !How can I participate :First, you need to subscribe to our website. All you need to do is enter your email. Nothing else.Every Friday, you will receive an email with the instruction for the next giveaway. 24h later, we will randomly draw one winner that fits all the criteria mentioned above. The winner will be announced on social medias and email. Is it free :It’s 100% free. Subscribing to our website and taking part to the giveaways is totally free.What’s the catch :There isn’t any. Crypto casinos are constantly looking for new players or new ways to incentivise their existing player base. We simply act as a promotion platform for them by creating weekly contest.Is your website safe :Our website is built on a platform named Beehiiv. It’s a renowned newsletter platform that is being backed by venture capital. Apart from your email, we do not ask for any sensitive information such as credit card details, personal address …Does it require KYC :We do not ask for KYC. However, each crypto casino has its own KYC policy. Therefore, you might have to go through it at some point, like you would normally do, in order to withdraw your winnings.Is waggger.com a casino :No we are not. We are a rewards club for crypto casino players.Where is the bonus money coming from :As of today, the bonuses are sponsored by our casino partners. At some stage, we plan to subsidise the bonuses ourselves in order to give away bigger rewards.How are the winners being picked :We use a professional software named Rafflys that randomly selects a winner among the eligible participants.How do you pick the casino :We only work with crypto casinos that have a public credibility. We thoroughly review them in order to make sure they provide a safe place to play.",

First their brand will be exposed to our entire subscriber base which at some point will hopefully be significant enough. Then, we can think of a system where the winner gets the big prize and the rest of the subscribers get something small but enough to incentivise them to give it a try and play on the casino partner.

In theory, someone could whip up a bunch of email addresses just to up their chances of winning, and it could be pretty tough to spot. When you're dealing with freebies, you've got to keep in mind that there'll be folks trying to game the system.",

Idea is great to be honest.Signing up simply for news letter then it would be requiring that email and speaking about further marketing then it lies on there itself but it is actually that quite different on the casual stuff that we do know on which i highly doubt if there would really be some catches on this one since it is really just that easy to sign up and im wondering on how they would really be able to avoid those abuses considering that once people around do sees that it do give out chances on getting that few hundreds of free bets then it will really hook up people but the question is, how many x it would be wagered before you would be able to withdraw?If this one talks about x50 or x60 then i wont really be getting shocked into it. hahahahThis is quite different and @OP, then test it out and find for yourself if this one would really be that effective on imposing your marketing on this way.Just for the question on how many x wagering requirement for this one?",

Because that is basically what the prize is, as far as I understand it. This is a kind of marketing approach which would not require the casino to do any partnerships. And if they really wanted to promote their contest, they would probably do it with several platforms that already have been established for a while with growing loyal audiences. What kind of content would your newsletter contain? I imagine that your partners would demand more than the advertising of their contest. Probably advertising spaces within the newsletter itself?",

As I'm sure this will be a win-win for all parties involved, that is, the \"gambling community\" who will stand the chance of winning a price, the \"casino itself\" who is likely to get more traffic (i.e more sales) and  you @ O.P who is likely to earn a commission for promoting these casinos to it's target audience. And i'm wishing you the best as you kick-start your journey.Note; it's definitely not everybody that will buy into your idea, but that shouldn't stop you from giving a try, because your ability to present a well structured business proposal will determined whether a casino buy your idea or not, since every casino will want to invest in where there is a potential proof of return of investment.",

Well you partnering with a casino will increase the number of visitors in the casino. Because since there is free money to be spent people will be participating. Most of the newsletters which I have joined so far were free. There is no too much to talk about in your case since you have not launched the project.
