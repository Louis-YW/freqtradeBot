So either sideways a bulltrap or going to hehell at moment, any rise is a bulltrap, the ideal price to buy btc is 15k or below, btc is still over priced, miners are selling, sheeps are buying. The only time to buy btc is when is below what miners are paying to mine one btc because in the bear market fiat is king. So is normal for miners to sell their coins at loss to get fiat to pay their bills, bull market is normal for miners to sell coins for a lot more than they cost to mine them.",

Not to mention that cryptocurrencies have greater liquidity than video card. In an emergency, if you need money quickly... I have no doubt that selling your cryptocurrencies will be much faster and more practical than selling your video cards.Make fractional crypto purchases... but be very careful, because unfortunately there are great chances that we are currently in a FUD",

Let's wait and see what happens this time round, but as far as I know, we are already in a bear market. Most people realize it when it's too later.I sold 90% of my coins back in May last year when BTC was ~$45k. I don't think that was a bad price, considering I bought the coins when BTC was ~$5k. It's impossible to time the market perfectly. I thought things would keep going down from there, which is why I didn't build any mining rigs then. But I didn't foresee the second bull run later that year, which is fine, because I profited enough.So this market was actually similar to 2018, where there was a bull trap in May-June. I fell for that bull trap and signed a lease to rent mining colocation space for 6 months, hoping that we could keep mining because the price would at least stagnate if not go up. But the teddy bear left and the grizzly bear showed up, ETH went to $90 and the rest is history.",

There are phases in this market, I'm not even calling this a bear market yet, this is a pre bear market, yeah the next one is a bear market. Yes, I said not to buy gpus if more than msrp and I said not to buy coins because scammers were pumping coins to more than 50x. I said to sell coins and get that 50x scammers pumped, I myself sold 80% of my eth I had at the end of january 2021 at 1500 usd. So you are right, if people bought gpus before january 2021 and still mining to this day june 2022 did profit big but only if they sold close to the top if not then they have not because gpus prices at that month rose too much too, remember you only profit if you sell, eth at 4.8k top was good eth at 1.7k is bad and will get worse.",

So as btc halves in april 2024, my prediction was that pos would have come starting 2023 onwards, so I was on point on that too as far as is going, the issue that I always pointed out was about buying gpus for more than msrp and we know what happened after january 2021, gpu prices jumped 4 times x msrp and that was insane, no way I would have recommended anybody to buy gpus at such inflated prices but like I said the ones that have bought gpus at inflated prices and sold at top then they won big, the ones that bought gpus at inflated prices and have not sold at top they have not even reached roi because difficulty increased so much and price decreased so much that reaching roi would be close to impossible if people sell their eth now, eth difficulty in february 2021 was 5th's, now 15th's, so basically you are earning 3 times less eth now than in february 2021 and price is pretty much the same. Given the difficulty at that time 5th's, you were earning with a 3070 0.06 eth per month, today you are earning 0.02 eth per month with 60 mhs and this i'm not even accounting the gpus were lhr which would be 30%~50% less earnings per month and many people bought lhrs 3070 gpus for 2k each. Anyway my point is, 0.06 x 1 first month + 0.05 next month and ever decreasing earnings to the point of 0.02 today makes an average of 0.035 per month x 14 months average = 0.5 eth, eth right now 1.8k, 0.5 eth = 900 usd, people paid on 3070 around 1600 usd, so they never even reached roi up to now if they did not sell close to the top or at top. So the people who bought gpus at msrp or lower earned big and reached roi and that was what I recommended people to do so.https://whattomine.com/coins/151-eth-ethash?hr=60&p=0.0&fee=2.0&cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&hcost=1600.0&span_br=1h&span_d=24&commit=Calculatehttps://etherscan.io/chart/difficulty",
