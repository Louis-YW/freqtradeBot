  "content": "It's an undeniable fact that, the fear of Negative trust and being ban from the forum is the reason most newbies with myself inclusive, do not contribute much to the growth of the forum. However, I will advice all new members including myself, to be acquainted with forum guidelines in order to guarantee safe usage of our accounts. Although, it's quite kinda difficult to be conversant with all the forum rules since they are not documented in a single thread. I guess the reason for this is due to the large nature of the forum and as such each section might have different and interrelated rules. In an attempt to make myself and other new members to be conversant with the forum rules, I'll recommend these threads for guidance.1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1689727.02. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5184741.03. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.04. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5277049.0I'm pretty sure that, thoroughly going over the above threads might help you get rid of the fear of Negative trust and being ban from the forum.

Remember the rules are not fixed but determined on a case by case basis.",

A person who knows in real life what is good and what is bad, what is legitimate and what is illegal, even if he does not read the rules, will not run into any major problems. If someone cheats, steals and lies in real life, no forum rules will help them be better in the online world.",

Do not make a conclusive statement with words like \"undeniable fact\" when you can't speak for all the newbies. There are many reasons why some newbies have not started contributing here gainfully, Many are struggling to adjust to contributing to general discussions, some naturally do not know how to express themselves, some are still tensed thinking their contribution will not be valid etc there are so many reasons unique to every newbie. Plus if you are truly a newbie, the probability of you knowing about something as negative trust is very slim even bans (I had no idea about the trust system for a while when I was a newbie). That is why as a newbie when you make your first contribution indicating that you are a new user, The rules of the forum is usually the first thing that is pointed out to you by more experience users here to familiarize yourself with. The purpose is not to scare you but to welcome you here and show you that unlike other forums that they may have come across without rules, things are done quite differently here.",
