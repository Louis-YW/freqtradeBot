It would be cool for all the participants of the project to help mine to create value and holdings for the project by mining on the projectâ€™s behalf. Reminds me a little bit of my NastyFans project, only we donâ€™t give NFTs to those who donate hashpower. Maybe an interesting addition that could help see more participation from members in order to receive a rewardâ€¦",

If you prefer proof of work coins and NFTs on this blockchain, then the very first project is Ethereum Classic.If you are talking about mining NFT tokens, then I do not understand the meaning of this. Miners ensure the security of the blockchain and get coins for it.",

Last man standing, yet the last blocks that each had only one transaction were mined almost a month ago, or am I missing something?It is just one of those not so good projects that claims to be Environmentally friendly, but then they go ahead to use the Bitcoin name in their branding because without Bitcoin appearing in any part of their name, they won't get any attention.I always see such projects as deceptive and scam.",
