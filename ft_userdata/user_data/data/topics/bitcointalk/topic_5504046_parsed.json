But if you want to at least broaden your horizon, you can go here: -> https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO.There's a lot of individuals who have experienced trading Bitcoin and they share a lot of technical indicators and maybe you can get your answers some from of them. Or perhaps you can learn a thing or two as well and in the future you are the one making your own analysis.",

When I look at it, I see periods of relative stability around low prices (at least 50% below the ATH), and then more active periods of growth with corrections. The latter periods are something like 'three steps forward, tiny steps back and forth, and then one or two steps backward' to me. Right now we are past three steps forward, somewhere in those small back-and-forth steps. But that is, of course, very subjective and can change at any point.",

Yeah, you're correct though your choice of words isn't totally correct.When you're buying Bitcoin to hold till the price goes above the price you bought Bitcoin, you're actually investing in Bitcoin and not trading your Bitcoin. Trading Bitcoin is mostly related to a very short interval of time and sometimes it doesn't work out as planned and might lead to loss in the process. Even though you're trading or investing, it's good you don't forget that the money you're using should be your spare money so that in the event of a possible loss, it wouldn't become a serious cause for alarm.With regards to when is the best time to buy your Bitcoin, What most people mostly think is that it's best to buy during the DIP and then HODL it till you're comfortable enough to sell at a particular price. If it's in an ideal case where everything works out as speculated, then that's perfectly fine but because we can't be too sure if we can accurately time the DIP, it's best that we should buy when we have the resources and if we're financially able to continue buying more, we can keep buying with the use of the DCA method. With the DCA method which involves buying either on a weekly or monthly basis using a small amount each time you're buying, it's easier to build a strong portfolio over time and gain a better profit from your investment.  Also note that apart from some general strategy that has been proven to work in the past and is currently recommended as a good strategy, it's best to do what works best for you depending on what's peculiar with your situation.",

Anyway, many people discuss about the patterns but to be honest with you, I don't see it as a 100% accurate because all of it is done by people who are expert on technical analysis.
