It's better to be realistic in that regard, as it will motivate him to train hard and become a knockout artist. In fact, I've read an article stating that Japan and Australia are considered the worst countries to host boxing matches, as the judges' decisions are often unfair.",

I hope Franco takes this fight seriously and works even harder to secure a victory. You see, in Japan, it's difficult to expect a win unless you are clearly the superior boxer, which makes it a challenging task for Franco to defeat the hometown favorite.Quote from: Questat on June 21, 2023, 05:42:50 AM In fact, I've read an article stating that Japan and Australia are considered the worst countries to host boxing matches, as the judges' decisions are often unfair.

Do note that this 2nd fight or rematch is on the same place, Kazuto's backyard yet Franco is not showing any signs of fear or anything that could give an advantage towards the Japanese boxer.Although, when it comes to adjustments, I'd give my vote to Ioka as he's the one who have more experiences in this industry and he's quite faced a lot of good boxers already.",

That's why bookies are giving them a 50/50 chance, as evidenced by the previously released odds. This fight will likely go the full 12 rounds, unless one of them significantly improves. However, judging by their KO rate, it's quite low, so we can't expect a knockout.",

And I thin Franco already learn his lessons on that fight. And although he was the busier fighter, the judges didn't see his power. So for sure he will adjust on this second fight and try to take the belt from Ioka.",

Not necessarily with power, but just touching them to look good at the judges. But it was a different set of eyes, and although he throws a lot of punch, it was not enough for them to award him the win.Quote from: Jawhead999 on June 21, 2023, 02:08:44 PMIf the fight is close and it should be draw, Ioka will win.

Just to be fair though and we want it to be clear, even if the fight is made in Japan, the judges who score it are not Japanese, (but maybe they could have been sway to favor the Japanese, we don't know).Scores were 114-114 and 114-114 from two of the three, with the third scoring it 115-113 for Franco.It is also noted that Franco weight is over the limit Quotehe official pre-fight weigh-in saw Franco (18-1-3, 8KOs) tip the scales at 55.2 kilograms—roughly 121.7 pounds, which is nearly two full divisions above the 115-pound limit. He was granted two hours to lose as much weight as possible, per a fight week agreement reached between the respective teams. However, Franco’s body had already shut down as he was only able to get down to 121 ¼ pounds (55 kilograms).Ioka was well under the limit on the first attempt, as the Osaka-born boxer—now based out of Tokyo—was 52 kilograms (roughly 114.6 pounds)https://www.boxingscene.com/joshua-franco-still-over-115-pound-limit-wba-title-stake-only-kazuto-ioka-rematch--175600",
