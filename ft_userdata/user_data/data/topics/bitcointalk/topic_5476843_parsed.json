Because I believe that all of us here in the room have never heard of that gambling game provider. And the weird thing is, the OP call it the best. Lol, but how come right? Same goes to the casino that he mentioned there. I almost didn't noticed it if I didn't read it again. I really thought he was only going to talk about a casino gaming provider here, since that is also what his title is saying about.But it's better if he can edit it now, (if that is still possible) and include the word casino there. So the new title should be read like this: \" Best game provider and best casino \". Speaking of it, it must be the two provider that you mentioned there. And they are available on so many casinos, including the best one's like Stake and Bitcasino.",

In any case this is not the first time that we have seen this kind of promotion and usually it will backfire on the casino itself. And if the OP is not related to the casino, ouch, that will be a negative to them.I'm betting that the OP will not come back anymore here and answer some of our \"constructive criticism\".He might have thought that he has done something, but gamblers here are smart and not going to fall for that kind of promotional trick.",
