As reported by Adam Cochran on his twitter: https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1687959096316542976, looks like Huobi might only hold a fraction of the reserves declared in the \"Merkle Tree Audit\", which they stopped updating last month.We have some fresh press hits already:https://cointelegraph.com/news/huobi-tvl-drops-amid-rumors-insolvency-investigations-chinahttps://decrypt.co/151535/huobi-insolvency-police-rumors-adam-cochran-justin-sunhttps://ambcrypto.com/unraveling-the-link-between-justin-sun-huobi-usdt/Huobi's twitter account is active but they didn't bother to address this accusation so far.",

Here it is:Quote from: DrBeer on August 06, 2023, 01:02:49 PMThe waves of problems on Binance have not subsided, as it started with Huobi ...Unexpected news:-Huobi top executives and TRON developers arrested in China. Overall, i think we should not panic and do not recommend others to withdraw there funds until they make some announcements because such panic and quick withdrawals will left that exchange no other choice but bankrupt only. I know it's not an acceptable option for the members who have there funds on that exchange but still i think a little patience is necessary. Edited: I was at wrong because i thought if we will start to withdraw funds abruptly even in the loss (in trading) we will left the exchange no other option but bankruptcy. But after getting useful replies from some members i can now say other than this, There are many other factors too that we have to consider. And in this condition all members are in favor of withdrawing the funds and it is the best practice.",

First of all, nobody should be using centralised exchanges as wallets. But most of all, if you claim that people withdrawing funds will make them go bust, that would mean they've been using fractional reserves banking, which alone would be a good reason the get out of there.But if the rumours are true, maybe at least some of their customers will manage to escape before it implodes.And frankly, if you had any funds in there, I don't think you would take your own advice of just sitting and waiting for the announcement, so don't advise that to others.",

So, having less amount might not impact the liquidity of Houbi that much. But, once i have to withdraw some funds probably it was around $100 so, i asked my foreign friend to receive them for me because i was not able to make an account at the time but unfortunately the logging of that account lost and as my friend have no knowledge of how to get that account back and i was exhausted to teach him so i left it by saying (maybe that friend was not wanna help me) so i left those funds with him in his account. Other than i have no other funds. This reply is for both pawel7777 and rat03gopoh",

This is bad advice. The only way that withdrawals lead to bankruptcy is if they are fractional reserve. If they store every deposit in a secure cold wallet like they should, then they will have more than enough coins to process each and every withdraw. Everyone should withdraw all their coins now (or ideally, years ago).",

Every single one of the exchanges I just listed above were tweeting about how everything is FUD and fUnDs ArE sAfU in the days and hours leading up to their collapse. No exchange which is fractional reserve will ever come out and say \"Yup, we are fractional reserve\", because they know that doing so will trigger a bank run which will collapse them within hours.

There is actually no money, and all you have in your \"account\" is just numbers, if they have used your money to do risky business and lose it, it is obvious that you will be unable to withdraw. People are advised to withdraw their money asap from these platforms because they would be able to process some withdrawals before completely suspending withdrawals due to being insolvent, so some people who get the advice early might be among the lucky ones to withdraw successfully.Quote from: The Cryptovator on August 07, 2023, 10:35:08 PMThere's a growing concern that CEX platforms, alongside regulatory challenges from the SEC, could potentially harm the crypto market.

It is the shitcoins that will be affected the most, so many of them will collapse and fall out of the market, though the good thing about it all is that many people would learn about the importance of self custody.",

If you do not withdraw your funds from the Exchange that has rumors of bankruptcy, then you are doing bad to yourself, as otherwise, people will withdraw their funds and those who are late will be left behind with their funds stuck at the exchange.Even if you have very few funds in the exchange, you should withdraw them as that is your money and you do not want to throw it away, do you ?In case, everyone gives a withdraw command, the exchange will surely stop the withdrawals because they do not have the funds to pay to all. That is why they are near to bankruptcy but at least you should give yourself a try and maybe you are the lucky one getting the finds out before the exchanges closes.",
