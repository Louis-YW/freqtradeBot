Let me explain how it should be done.1.-User input his Username, Mail and Password to create the account.2.-The data is sent to the backend.3.-The data is verified in the backend to see if its valid before write it in the DB4.-If the data is valid, then call your bitcoin node with RCP to get the new address and send that info to the users array.5.-Write In the data base: ID, Username, Password(encripted), mail, balance, address...Then each time the user request the address you can fill that input with a SQL call.Quote from: tradopt on November 28, 2022, 04:12:39 PMand can withdraw deposit ?For withdrawals:1.-User input the withdrawal amount and the address.2.-The data is sent to the backend3.-Data verification (If the balance is enough if the sending address is valid...)4.-Send the transaction with RPC calls.5.-Update the Data Base with the new balance, and record the withdrawal transaction on a new table.Since you are talking about website development i would like to recommend NodeJS for a crypto application as a backend.",

But if you ask such question, IMO you should hire someone who already have experience to create cryptocurrency-related service.It is a good idea to hire some  to professionally manage the job.Additionally,  I will suggest that you work with btcpayserver.org,  which is an open source and free software which will manage all payments for you.It will generate address for each buys, monitored them, etc  it has an extensive documentation and really looks like a professional solution.",
