  "content": "We have read many times about gamblers, professional gamblers, compulsive gamblers, gambling addicts, and so on.  But did you know that there are seven types of gamblers each with their own purpose why they are playing gambling games?  Aren't you curious about what type of gambler are you?  To cut the chase, here is the list of types of gamblers:List of Seven Type of GamblerProfessional GamblersCasual Social GamblersSerious Social GamblersRelief and Escape GamblersConservative GamblersPersonality GamblersCompulsive gamblersYou can click the link to jump to the explanation of each typeImportance of Determining What Type of Gambler We AreIt is important to know what type of gambler is a person.  It greatly helps in the medication of a gambler with a gambling disorder.QuoteThe same is true with gamblers and people who struggle with gambling addiction. Gamblers show addictive behaviors in various ways. To understand and treat the problem, it’s necessary to understand the type of addiction and the individual’s unique situation. In answer to the frequently searched question, “Which type of gambler am I?” This overview of seven types of gamblers can be helpful.After reading the explanation of each type, I hope we can categorize what type of a gambler we are.  It is beneficial if something wrong happened with our gambling ways.  Hopefully, we don't need to use this categorization to treat ourselves.  Let us have fun and be responsible when we are gambling.Explanation or Detail of TraitsProfessional GamblersQuoteProfessional gamblers are a rarity. People who gamble professionally make a living by gambling. Somehow, they confront systems that are built around taking their money and come out ahead.Being a professional gambler takes an extraordinary level of:PatienceFrustration toleranceIntelligenceSelf-controlSuccessful professional gamblers continually weigh the odds of each situation to decide how to proceed. Impulsivity and anger stand in the way of their performance, so professionals dismiss these traits.It is important to note that professional gamblers will not usually be addicted to the act of gambling. Addictions can diminish self-control and rational thinking, which would undoubtedly cause more losses than wins.Quote They are skilled in the games they choose to play and are able to control both the amount of money and time spent gambling. Thus, professional gamblers are not addicted to gambling. They patiently wait for the best bet and then try to win as much as they can.Casual Social GamblersQuoteCasual social gamblers gamble for recreation, sociability and entertainment. For them, gambling may be a distraction or a form of relaxation. Gambling does not interfere with family, social or vocational obligations. Examples of such betting are the occasional poker game, Super Bowl bets, a yearly trip to Las Vegas and casual involvement in the lottery.QuoteA casual, social gambler is much more common than a professional player. A casual gambler may stop in a casino from time to time, spending a moderate amount of money on slots or blackjack and then head home at the end of the night. They might also join friends for a fantasy football league or Friday night poker game.For the casual, social gambler, the act is not about the strong desire to win. This type of gambler is interested in spending time with friends, meeting new people and engaging in some rest and relaxation to relieve stress.The casual, social gambler is comparable to a social drinker. A social drinker may head to the bar after work some days, but the experience is more about socializing with similar people to de-stress. Alcohol, or gambling, in this case, is not the primary focus.Serious Social GamblersQuoteIn contrast, serious social gamblers invest more of their time in gambling. Gambling is a major source of relaxation and entertainment, yet these individuals place gambling second in importance to family and vocation. This type of gambler could be compared to a \"golf nut,\" whose source of relaxation comes from playing golf. Serious social gamblers still maintain control over their gambling activities.QuoteGambling can be either a positive or a negative coping skill. The casual gambler uses gambling as one of their various available outlets, but the serious social gambler relies solely on gambling to cope.While negative coping skills seem useful in the moment, they only lead to problems in the future. With long hours spent gambling to cope with stress, serious social gamblers may begin sliding toward problematic gambling while struggling to maintain family obligations, work and friendships.Relief and Escape GamblersQuoteThe National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that addictions commonly form when people engage in behaviors, like using drugs or gambling, to fulfill an emotional need. Relief and escape gamblers may only seek out gambling as a way to manage their depression, anxiety or other causes of stress.Escape gamblers may be pretty unsuccessful at winning, though. Due to their emotional state, their decision making and judgment can be poor. Relief and escape gamblers could lose huge amounts of money in a short amount of time and feel higher stress, anxiety and depression in the long-term.Relief and escape gamblers benefit from expanded coping skills to address their emotional needs.QuoteCuster's fifth type, relief and escape gamblers, gamble to find relief from feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, boredom or loneliness. They use gambling to escape from crisis or difficulties. Gambling provides an analgesic effect rather than a euphoric response. Relief and escape gamblers are not compulsive gamblers.Conservative GamblersQuoteRather than seeking the thrill of winning or the social aspect of gambling, conservative gamblers are interested in the experience. They want to try playing slots or rolling the dice because they have seen the games on television or in movies and are curious.Conservative gamblers likely place a modest budget or time limit on their gambling and stick to it whether they win or lose. This practice makes problematic or addictive gambling very rare among conservative gamblers.Personality GamblersQuoteFor better or worse, the above gambler types all involve activity that is legal, even if it could become problematic. The personality gamblers — sometimes called antisocial gamblers — are different because they behave in illegal ways.These gamblers want to make large amounts of money gambling by any means necessary. Personality gamblers may lie, cheat, steal and deceive other players or people in charge to come out on top. Their tactics could be simple like hiding a card up their sleeve, or elaborate, like conspiring to fix a race or sporting event.For the personality gambler, gambling is an issue, but there could be other facets of their criminal activity and mental health that need equal attention from professionals.QuoteIn contrast to professional gamblers, antisocial or personality gamblers use gambling as a way to get money by illegal means. They are likely to be involved in fixing horse or dog races, or playing with loaded dice or marked cards. They may attempt to use a compulsive gambling diagnosis as a legal defense.Compulsive GamblersQuoteCompulsive gamblers lead lives that are entirely controlled by gambling and money. Even though they might not want to admit it, they frequently display signs of a gambling disorder like:Spending too much time gamblingMaking unsuccessful attempts to cut back or stop gamblingContinuing to gamble despite issues with relationships, work, school or home life caused by gamblingConstantly chasing the next win to compensate for the last lossCompulsive gamblers typically need professional treatment and support from their loved ones to avoid worsening life circumstances. Compulsive gambling can quickly consume a person’s life.QuoteCompulsive gamblers have lost control over their gambling. For them, gambling is the most important thing in their lives. Compulsive gambling is a progressive addiction that harms every aspect of the gambler's life. As they continue to gamble, their families, friends and employers are negatively affected. In addition, compulsive gamblers may engage in activities ­ such as stealing, lying or embezzling ­ which go against their moral standards. Compulsive gamblers cannot stop gambling, no matter how much they want to or how hard they try.Note:  I decided to quote the whole explanation of each type of gambler for fear to miss any important details while enumerating them.

For me I do think am a social gambler, like just few days back we visited casinos in Swansea and played some slots even through we did not win anything we did enjoy the whole experience and it was fun to see really old people as well having fun there. It was like a vintage casino with very old slot games but I personally like the online gambling better. google picture hosting",

But as a regular gamblers, we must be careful not to slide from one class to another and be able to sustain a level playing ground between our present position and the next,",

This practice makes problematic or addictive gambling very rare among conservative gamblers.Conservative gamblers should not get too comfortable having heard that problematic gambling is not so common with them, they should also become careful of the category of gamblers they keep as friends. An association/relationship between a Conservative gambler and a gambler in any other of the categories may soon have an influence on the conservative gambler who may slowly become a serious social gambler or develop traits of the friend in the other categories.",
