Advise what forums and websites are there for publishing my articles on the topic of cryptocurrencies?Can I also post my articles on the Bitcointalk forum?I've seen on bitcointalk here and there - especially on the services area - people wanting to write articles for websites, some even for free. So you have competition on that.So the first thing that comes into my mind is: if you don't necessarily want to monetize your articles, you can make your own blog or medium page, there are plenty of free options.And yes, you can put your articles or quote them here if you want to open a discussion on the matter. You can take a look on what Hydrogen does, for example (his topics list is here). The point is to put relevant text and indeed open a discussion, not just post links; and obviously don't spam. Also, if you quote, make sure you put the source, even if that one is also yours (so you avoid accusations of plagiarism).",

I can think reddit and bitcointalk might be useful places to start though if you don't want to search around too much.I'd recommend posting a decent amount of the article on the forum too as many are averse to clicking links but might do once they see a site with good reputation/reporting - I don't know how many actually go this way though it might be easier to get views by buying ads on faucets and similar sites once you can get ad revenue to yours (I think it takes a long time for these sorts of sites to be paid back in views and user activity).",

Secondly, to answer your question I quoted above, \"Yes\" you can actually write cryptocurrency articles on this forum, there is a special board for articles, and that is the press board, so feel free to write your cryptocurrency articles and post there.",

Advise what forums and websites are there for publishing my articles on the topic of cryptocurrencies?Can I also post my articles on the Bitcointalk forum?I was writing articles for a long time related to cryptocurrencies topic. I mainly publish my articles in publish0x, leofinance or hive. There are pretty few other micro-blog sites like read.cash and noise.cash. All these sites are focused on cryptocurrency articles. If you have a personal blog, you can also publish the same articles everywhere. I saw many bloggers publish the same articles on different platforms.Some examples: xuanling11( you can check out https://www.xuanling11.com/)johnwege ( you can check out https://www.publish0x.com/@johnwege)PVMihalache ( you can check out https://www.publish0x.com/@PVMihalache)You can see my post also here https://www.publish0x.com/saikots-blog/evaluating-tokenomics-xnxvzyv also here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396160.msg59973370#msg59973370Same articles I published on different platforms. But while things need to be cleared up. Before posting the same article on different sites, give the reference of the first published site (Reference is everything). You should maintain the same author personality on all platforms.",
