Does it have to require the vendor to supply same verification code or what pay again for another verification process?I don't think this is a good service those phone number are not directly from the dealers otherwise this thread can be locked üîê.Hello, people needing a phone number for 2 step authentication and securing their account should use a long term renting phone number. We provide phone renting from 7 days to several month. The majority of users use phone verification service mostly for account creation, phone numbers are not asked again. For example to verify a discord, google, telegram account. This service is safe to create valuable account, because sim are used only once per service then throw in the bin. So no risk to loose access to your account.This is the official thread. Please check my email with domain on my profile.",

      "body": "I have tried this service, and it works good. Thanks for posting this here, I have been looking long time for a online service where I can create PayPal accounts.The accounts works and you can register them, they dont get flagged.The negative thing is i dont know if i need to send a SMS to the same number again how I can get up the same number again on the website.But I solved it with renting a phone number from Skype where I can recivie calls.also the support says \"We reply immediately\" but i waited some hours now.But overall, its a very good service for the price in my opinion.[UPDATE: I tried to rent a number and it not works, get a error message]BUT overall its a great service.You can create a PayPal account.Then get a free temp sms phone number or 2FA verification and it will work.",
