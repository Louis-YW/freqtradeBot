  "content": "By making a living, I mean making four or five figures after Profit - Loss.If yes, then which bookmaker?I am looking for bookmakers who doesn't create problems when you win. If you have been consistently placing bets & having no issues on withdrawal, stake amount, cash out or human or machine errors, then please share your experience with the bookmaker(s).PS or BF types do not support where I am located. Also, I am not looking for their alternatives or clones or white hats. Expecting reply from REAL punters.Thank you.",

You will have no problem on this casino if you are winning big and sometimes losses with organic bets.Bookmaker itself detects the betting pattern of all there players and have an eye to those consistently winning with same bets. This is the common concerns and issue posted here against bookmaker but this is not a problem if you are playing without any involvement on this shady activities.Others will suggest Sportsbet, Cloudbet and Fortunejack which are good too considering how long they are operating with good reputation here.",

There always has some case for \"Sportbet\" user, because compared to \"Casino\" games you can have more win chances on \"Sportbet\" rather than the \"Casino game. Advantage player is always being restricted by some casino & also there has some cheating scheme in \"Sportbet\" like Arbitrage Odds or Fixed Match (I found this on \"Stake\") while there has some fixed match in \"Tennis Match\".Also comparison problem between \"Sportbetting & Casino Games\", by my experience in forum for around 3 years. Most of user who have a problem is always on \"sportbetting\" user, so that's the reason I talk like this. IMO, If people bet in big match not some random/uknown match you could be not getting problems at all (but, that's just my speculation.",

Sometimes sports events happen every weekend only. Betting with huge amounts is also the way to profit 4-5 figures. Betting on multiple sport can be tiring or time consuming but even if we just stick only on one sports, we can still be able to make a fortune as long as we master that sport. This is the same when I bet on a casino, I also stick with one game even though the casino that I am playing with have a good library of games. In gambling, there is a thing called odds.Odds can determine if how much we will win and can also tell the difficulty of the game. High odd is something that is unlikely but we can be able to gamble small amounts on it and then expect that our winning will be huge as long as we get lucky to hit it of course. It should be called parlays on sports betting.",

I'm not sure about that, maybe there are, but if I'm going to bet, the way I see it, majority of the gamblers here bet to have some fun on their favorite sports and not necessarily wanted to make a living out of it. Or bring food in the table for their family based on their gambling because it is going to be very hard, in my opinion.",

So I can't say for certain, because if you have to look at gambling, it's either a hit or miss. So it's really better to have a regular job as your living instead of relying to gambling as a means to an end.",

      "body": "in my opinion it is not realistic to live on games of chance, honestly I think it is a great risk to live on games of chance mainly because games of chance do not give guaranteed profit, let's take a more realistic example: let's imagine that you rent a house to live alone, after that you hire an employee to cook and clean the house, at the end of the month you will have to pay rent, water and electricity bills and the employee's salary. so every month you will have to place bets under pressure and if you start to lose a lot your bankroll will be reduced and with that you will also have to start paying bills with your bankroll money, of course you can argue that if you place bets of great value so you will have a lot of profitlotteries so much profit that they can pay the expenses with just a single bet, but the more money you spend on a bet, the greater the risk of losing all your money and staying on the streetI recommend that you read this article:Quote from: https://www.quora.com/Can-a-guy-make-a-living-through-sports-betting-Is-it-possibleDepends what u think when u say living through sports betting… On long way no.. Because in that way no bookie would exist..Do you can earn in short time , or make a decent amount of money of it? YES.How? Well i can tell you how u can’t , and that’s if you play on your own.. Favourites and ‘safe’ odds are sure but only for them, and if u saw that whole world - and there is about 1billion people betting out there - play , then u have to ask yourself can you life through sport betting?Im getting some games from - matchinsider.info - website and for now i bet on 14 of 15 games from there, because i skip the first one.. Anyway for all these years and all ‘tipsters’ and experts and also some site like olbg or sport journalist type, i found it most profitable .The other ways are just simply unsustainable and the more games u put on bet the % of win decrease. So now I'm playing only single games, and with good backend and information's about them..I'm not making millions, but I'm not poor like before and i don’t i lose my nerves…Source: https://www.quora.com/Can-a-guy-make-a-living-through-sports-betting-Is-it-possible",

On my end, I am quite earning enough to continue playing, fortunately. Sportsbetting on the other hand is gaining more popularity since many leauges are now again operational since the pandemic is at ease. But also, it is one of  the gambling activities which requires less luck and more of analytical skills. A bettor may create assumptions of the winning team and losing team which makes it more entertaining, not to mention that you are actually watching the game of your interest unlike with other gambling activity wherein you'd just play and merely depending on luck.If you are looking for a bookmaker, there are many in this industry. I am playing at Stake right now and so far I am having a good experience but you may also try primedice and other big names in this industry to lessen your worries on finding legitimate sportsbettinf site.",
