There are chances that I may have effect or it may not.Question 2. I am not the one that appreciate the fact that actions of political leaders will determine the price movement of Bitcoin, looking at the bigger picture if this continues then Bitcoin market will be easily manipulated and this will be very bad, be careful what you wish all for quick pumps. Question 3. I stand to be corrected but I don't think Trump has done anything concerning taxes on Bitcoin, but I am aware that he is standing strong that US won't be selling any Bitcoin.",

Price did not go up because Trump did not come out and say we already have plans to buy so-and-so amount of bitcoin, or we already bought this amount and the rest of them. The market reaction is just a clear indication that the information from summit was not as expected. Quote 2) Where do you see it heading in price from here? Just as always, we can't clearly predict the future of the market, but it needs time sometimes before it will recover from whatever is keeping it at that level, but pretty soon it will point to the green level.Quote 3) Has Trump removed taxes yet from crypto when selling and/or tranferring from one crypto to another I don't know about the taxes being removed, and I don't even know if there was any law that charged holders a fee for sending from one wallet to another. If there is any such law, please point me to it.",

      "body": "1. Bitcoin price is determined by many factors. A single event might not be able to increase the price. The market responded positively when he made the announcement. So we might not see the same move. The US tarriff war might be affecting the market.2. Bitcoin price will increase before the end of the bear run. Hopefully, these tariff wars will soon end, and the global economy will recover.3. There is a report that Trump is considering removing Capital Gains Tax on Bitcoin (BTC). Maybe it will happen very soon or in the future.",

The reason why bitcoin price is volatile and dropping is not due to it being accepted as strategic reserve but due to the economic uncertainty that lies ahead. Which also is directly related to Trump who has started a tariff war which would make many countries suffer economically. I see this price drop as chance to accumulate bitcoin below 100K. Whether the market trusts trump or not is a short term problem, in long run, what he had done would have significance even after end of his presidency.",

      "body": "Crypto enthusiasts expected Donald Trump to announce that the US government would buy bitcoins on the free market. This would certainly lead to a sharp increase in the price of the first cryptocurrency. However, this did not happen. Donald Trump decided that the bitcoin reserve would be formed mainly from confiscated coins. By the way, this could potentially lead to more such confiscations, and tighter control over the circulation of coins. Crypto enthusiasts are unlikely to like this. In my opinion, the price will not increase in the near future. At the same time, I do not expect a global fall in price either. In my opinion, institutional investors are currently actively buying bitcoins, simultaneously holding down the price of the first cryptocurrency with the help of derivatives (the so-called \"paper bitcoins\"). They have recently created the appropriate infrastructure that is capable of performing this task.",

The strategic reserve for the United States may have been signed but its effect on bitcoin market price will only be felt if and when the funds for the Said reserve are put down into Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin spot ETF also took time before we saw the effect in the market and changed the pattern on which the halving and ATH do take place in the market from the way it was in the past. Some changes take effect immediately while some takes time. Quote2) Where do you see it heading in price from here?Heading to the moon as anticipated. We cannot give the actual price it will go to from here but definitely political influence will be felt by the market even though it will just be for sometime. Regardless, Bitcoin is still going to achieve its course at the right time. Quote3) Has Trump removed taxes yet from crypto when selling and/or tranferring from one crypto to another?Since saying that, I don’t know if that has been effected already. People from that region will know better and acquired to it been actualised already or not.",

If the news of bitcoin us reserve have now bought bitcoin then many people would have posted here or on a social media platform about the effect of the bitcoin reserve to the Bitcoin price. Anyway, as far as I have noticed before that after reaching a new ATH then the price will decrease or in other words won't stay on the same price when it reached new ath just like now where it stays lower than the ath just like before.",
