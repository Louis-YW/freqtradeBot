  "content": "I have been storing some crypto in Metamask wallet since early 2021. Last week, I opened my wallet and saw it empty. First I thought it was an error, but after reviewing the transactions, I realized my wallet has been drained out. About 5.6 WBTC (equivalent to 5.6 BTC) was sent out to some unknown address without my knowledge on June 15, 2022.  Here's the history of my Metamask wallet: I installed the wallet on a desktop in early 2021 and transferred some fund into it. Shortly after, I installed Metamask wallet on my laptop using the same seed. So, I have the same wallet on two PC mirroring each other. A few months ago (around April) I installed the wallet on my iPhone with the same seed, so basically all three devices had the same wallet. Up to that point I had about 126K USD Coin in the wallet. On June 14 I swapped all the USDC for WBTC, with amounted to about 5.6 WBTC. All transactions were done through iPhone. A few days later I opened the wallet on my iPhone and was shocked to see that the wallet was empty. Some transactions were made on June 15, sending all the WBTC and ETH out without my knowledge. Needless to say, it was a trauma for me. I was scrambling to find out how it happened. Did I download a rogue version of Metamask, or one of my devices was compromised? For the PC, I downloaded it from metamask.io. For the iPhone, I used Apple store. Here's a few things that may give clues to how the attack came through:1) The fund has been in my wallet for months so if the attackers wanted to take it they could have done so earlier. It must be something I have done lately. One June 13 I downloaded some software and installed it on my desktop. The software was not related to crypto. At the same time, my Norton Security subscription just expired and I didn't renew it right away. So there's lapse of security on my desktop around the time of the attack. The desktop is used on daily basis and it is on most of the time during my work hours.  2) All the latest transactions was done through iPhone, so I wonder if the attack could be on my iPhone? One thing I notice is that while all the latest activities are shown on my iPhone Metamask wallet, they are not shown on my desktop nor laptop wallet. All the transactions I made on June 14 (to swap USDC to WBTC), and the unauthorized transaction of sending WBTC out, are shown on iPhone, but not on desktop or laptop. Looks like someone has erased the transactions to hide them from me. Though I can view them on Etherscan. 3) I did not turn on the laptop in the week leading up to June 15, the date of the unauthorized transaction. I actually barely used my laptop to access Metamask. Here's my wallet activities on Etherscan:https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf0a095f3479847c8bf677e33046a5e7b5dcce94I learned that I can store my BTC in hardware Tresor wallet and trade through Metamask, instead of storing the coin in Metamask itself. I wish I knew that sooner. I take my consolation in the fact that this is not all the BTC I have. I still have some BTC stored in Tresor wallet. If anyone is storing your coin in Metamask, I urge you to use Tresor instead. Use Metamask to trade only, not to store the key.",

And secondly, who else knows you have such money in your metamask wallet? Because these days you can't trust anyone again, but am still convince the lickage most have come as a result of the newly downloaded softwares because Metamask is an encrypted wallet that can only be unlocked with the use of a password or seed phrase",

Using a hardware wallet is the best solution, and there are no other solutions that compare to it.Secondly, altcoins never represent a real alternative to Bitcoin, and nothing guarantees that it will not collapse overnight. I find it very risky that a huge amount exceeding $100,000 at the current price of Bitcoin will be put into token on the Ethereum network.",

Maybe living on this crypto world as good option try linux or hackintosh, `impossible` to hack as your example. i never leave bigger ammounts in hot wallet, trust, fearless etc. All bigger amount is in nanoX with 24 keywords offline from internet and from world.  5/6 years using, no problems so far",

So that case, he was very vulnerable to outside attacks.

      "body": "I'm sorry for your loss OP. If anything the best that I can tell you is that you should assume that your devices are compromised and the following should be done:Fully analysis on your PC to check for malware/virus. - You mentioned that you've installed some program (not related with crypto) on June 14. May I ask which was it and where did you got it from? There's a slight possibility that it was the vector attack that allowed to have access to private information of yours.Verify if you got the real application installed in your iPhone - See who was the developer behind the app and make sure that you've installed the official one. While the Apple store has more quality control in their store than Google's Play Store, it wouldn't be the first time that a fake application related with crypto was available to download on it[1].Transfer all your funds to HW wallets - Since the seed words within a HW never \"exit\" the device, it's the most safest way to have them stored (assuming you don't share the seed words nor loose the device).Consider changing the password to every account (or the most essential accounts) that you use - This goes from either bank accounts to e-mail accounts. Again, we don't know how long your information may have been exposed to someone else.Activate 2FA on every service that you can - For instance, if you got e-mail confirmation + 2FA activated on Metamask (I don't know if it's possible (?)), the attacker would still have to access to both your e-mail and your 2FA device in order to successfully execute the transfer. In Binance, for instance, I know that some users have to insert a code that is sent to their e-mail plus their 2FA code in order to send money between addresses (friends experience regarding BTC usage).These were just some ideas that came to my mind while reading your story but I highly advice you that you consider at least some of them so that you can prevent further similar events to happen. It seems that you already use a HW device (which is good by itself), I just hope that this event makes you consider extending the usage of the HW device to all of your (crypto) holdings...[1]https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/[2]https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis[3]https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP",

It sucks to get weaseled out of your hard earned funds and more so when you don't know who did it or how it was done with certainty.It's not a wise choice to have one address spread over different devices.

Metamask is an amazing software. But you used it the wrong way.You can use metamask with a hardware wallet and it will become a cold wallet.But you cannot store your life-savings into a wallet where you type your seed in different computers.

I can understand that the amount was big and might be hard earned, but still we are hopeless.The hacker might be also very smart, so after taking money from the OP’s wallet, he might used a mixer service to mix the coins and hence his address cannot be traced.Wishing that this should not happen with anyone in the near future.",

It's not really a good storage to keep your money on a metamask. A small amount would do but having that sums of money, it should have been into a hardware wallet. You should have swapped it into actual btc and not wrapped so that you'll be forced to keep it onto a hardware wallet. The cause might be that software you've downloaded prior to the hack and whether you use mac os or windows, there has been a lot of hijackers in different app marketplaces.I think, it is not the metamask itself that failed the security here.The OP mentioned about installing a software application and at the same time expiring his norton security subscription. So that case, he was very vulnerable to outside attacks. And how did hackers know about his large crypto funds?It may be someone that knew him from social media channels, and that they knew he is into crypto with good amount of coins.Because we don't know the whole story, the hackers may know the OP for all we know.So aside from securing your funds in your own hardware wallet, make sure you don't disclose your crypto activities in social media.What I've said about metamask is that it's not really a cool place to store your funds for long. I did mentioned that the cause might be the software that he has downloaded.It could have been a spyware or malware that was able to penetrated the system and we don't know how they do that but that's where they are expert for, in stealing other people's money.",

And this is expensive mistake which many people learned off so for the incident happened to OP most provably many people are much careful upon using metamask and also we need to avoid downloading unknown things since this is also one of the method used by hackers to stole the balances on the wallet of their victims.",

There was no notification on sending from the metamask as this doesn't require 2fa. That's why 2fa implementation in metamask is the most important thing. Storing in exchange site was a bit better rather than metamask. Why do you put all of your money in metamask? You shall learn a lot from this case. If you are holding bunch of money and better to store it into the exchange sites which so many security verification or cold wallet.",
