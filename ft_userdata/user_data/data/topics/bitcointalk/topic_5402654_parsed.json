With the examples you've provided, the only example that is wrong is being a scammer.Miners have invested with their rig using their own money and they have paid for the electricity for the maintenance to run the rig that they have made. Also, Miners are important people to crypto currency.Investors are also, using their own money to invest with various cryptocurrencies to further their increase their funds however it has some risk whereas not all people maybe able to earn. That is why, TA or technical analysis are used by many investors to minimize the risk of losing money. There's really nothing wrong with these methods as we are just trying to earn cryptos.",

They do not see the immediate impact of their actions (like cooking a frog) ...so they stay focused on their goal to make money.

More bitcoin miners are making use of clean energy, over 58% of miners are using clean energy to mine and the percentage will likely continue to increase the more as bitcoin miners are facing threat from critics and government like the New York government. Before the creation of bitcoin were poisoned marine lives, before it has been global warming, before it has been deforestation, before it has been other greenhouse gasses emission like methan into the environment, before it, humans has been polluting there environment themselves. For investors, they have to make proper research before they invest, if not investing on bitcoin, they should take it for gambling as altcoins are far riskier. If they are investing in bitcoin, they should make research and check price history in order to make right decisions and have perfect investment plan.Before bitcoin creation were scammers.",

So, literally humans are greedy. However, we're also trying to compensate what we think we've destroyed, but only a small portion of it could be restored. Like what a \"responsible mining\" does.
