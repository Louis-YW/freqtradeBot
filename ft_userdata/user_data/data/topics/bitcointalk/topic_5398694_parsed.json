I also asked the same before, when we are breaking ATH at least for BTC in reaching $50k-$60k, it was institutional investors and then governments. So who will be the next one? billionaires? gold bugs who will totally shift their assets to BTC? or will it come from retail investors as we might see adoption growing in the next 4-5 years?",

It's not even surpassing 3 trillions and how it possible for crypto to surpass 10 trillions in the next years. Remember the bearish trend can also be a very long time like this can recovers in years later. In my opinion even at that time we have done another bitcoin halving and this can't change the market capitalization drastically. It needs sometime to make sure people are feeling confidence with the market and they can FOMO to pump bitcoin.",

I think Binance will be getting more licenses in different jurisdictions which will enable people get in crypto easier.  Now that many local exchanges have reached out to newcomers, I don't think Binance will play a significant role in boosting market capitalization. And I don't understand which adoption you are talking about, in fact mass adoption has not reached 50% of financial services worldwide (not including banking).Likewise with new projects, although with big ambitions, they have not been fully implemented in the real world as written in their WP.",

The cryptocurrency total market cap has expanded exponentially over the last 10 years so I expect everything will be much slower in the next 4 years cycles If you do not know which coin to buy, just throw everything you have in Bitcoin.

Some people like above me may able tp give his prediction through creating the line but again the market will decide its future. We have not yet seen bitcoin to touch 100 USD and im sure that once bitcoin will reach 80k and there will always be a correction like this. The chance to be doubled will always there but expecting the crypto market to worth 10 trillions are too big and it's too good to be true from a few years from now.",

I predict 3 trillion for 2025, 3 times the current capitalization.You are counting the capitalization from the current decline to the supposed maximum, so it seems unlikely to you, because the difference is too big, about 7 times. But I want to remind you, if you take that same year 2020, the capitalization was about 370-400 billion in the middle of the year. In 2021, the capitalization has increased 9 times, so an increase from current levels of 7 times does not seem anything unlikely, especially considering that there are 3 more years of development and acceptance of the crypto industry ahead.",

Of course, the positive impact will also be felt on other altcoins. Where market capitalists develop more rapidly and massively. I'm sure it won't be too difficult in the next 2 or 3 years. It could even exceed what we listed. The development of the cryptocurrency market which is currently being intensively made has become an option for people to save their finances in crypto. Therefore, speaking of market capitalists above 10 trillion can be realized.",

At the moment the total market cap according to coinmarketcap.com is 1,27 trillion USD. So i personally think that maybe around 5 trillion at the end of 2025 are possible if the surrounding conditions are positive and in favor of the crypto market. I also think though that it is possible that we stay at the same level as we are now for a few more years. If the federal banks keep on increasing the interests rate again then maybe a lot of  capital will flow back from cryptos to traditional bank products.",

I mean even if we look at just bitcoin, which is a great indicator anyway, we are at around 30k levels so far, being 300k in 2025 wouldn't be a shock to anyone.That is why I love bitcoin so much, we are in a situation where it is clear to me why people are moving towards bitcoin more rapidly compared to past, since the idea of \"bitcoin always recovers and goes up\" finally started to hit people. When you realize that, even if we are down right now, 300k still doesn't seem too unlikely for any of us, we all think that it is quite possible.",

It's around 4 trillion and if you are expecting more from than this and yeah keep it in your dream. It's not a game that you can drastically pump the marketcapitalization. It's better to think rationally based on the fact rather than keep dreaming with your wish that will never come true until the next decade. im not even sure if we will be seeing this will be reached in the next decade as well.

Not sure about how much transaction raise because bitcoin drop again every day, up few percent early morning and night back to lower price and take few weeks later for reach higher price.",
