There should be some purpose, otherwise, I don't think you can get value in the trading market.I wish everyone is as concerned on protecting themselves against fraud. All this necessary links are meant to be provided with the available community to join and discuss, not a vague information. I noticed some old accounts are more active in the forum. They enjoy the discussion since the bull is over and trading had reduced. Such detailed information will be something to work with for potential investors.",
