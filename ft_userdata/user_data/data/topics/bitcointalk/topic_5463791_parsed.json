Are you in the process of getting listed there?I found them on BestChange website, but they don't have any reviews so I would be very careful when dealing with them. Also, their \"reserve\" number  ($195M) seems grossly overexagarrated, compared to some of the most popular exchangers on BestChange.",

      "body": "I find exchange bit poor in terms of UX (no quick flip, minimum amount doesn't reflect instaneously, mobile site doesn't show 'receiving side at all — in desktop mode it's fine). Customer support was quick tho, I asked query about minimum amount being ~2K USD (no discrimination involved, all coins same Polygon/TRX too, which was surprising to me) and they answered promptly, it's their policy. I see no reason to use yours in myriad of others. Good luck!",
