Although we talk about bitcoin investment always but just decided to share with us You can share your thoughts on this.I posted this thread in my local board on the 9th that was a day after yesterday concerning this particular altcoin how it jumps from $1.22 to $1.80 in less than 24hours seeing it as an altcoin that one might invest in the shortest period of time, but was bullied and that made me to lock this thread and moved it to altcoin discussion.. Although I was still skeptical about the price  movement it's was just about 24 hours but now it's about 72 hours making it hit $4.38 and now isteal have the reason to believe that this altcoin has the potential to recover like I said earlier. What do you guys think please.",

About their sudden increase, well i won't argue any bit of it but should be very mindful as altcoin can't be trusted despite any rise to me this is possibly to gain back their investor's faiths but believe me or not no reasonable investors would want to go investment with that project anymore because their image has been tarnished. As a piece of advice to you if investing always use the funds you won't come larmenting of how you have lost huge funds, always be vigilant otherwise you won't know what would have happened next.",

Never ever think that abandoned projects will reach ATH and there are zero reason one should even be trading this token as it's a bubble which can burst anytime and boom all your investments and holding will be vanished like it happened. I don't think we should even discuss about FTT all time high rather we should be making people aware that it's a scam is back to pool some more money from naive investors, I am sure most of these who have invested into FTT and got more than 2x profits will not be cashing out yet in greed of more returns just to end up losing I mean there is nothing backing up this project and still it's pumping hard which means it's a pure manipulation.",

Although we talk about bitcoin investment always but just decided to share with us You can share your thoughts on this.I was surprised to see the price performance of FTX Token (FTT) recently, based on 7 day TF, the price of $FTT managed to rise up to 240% with the current price around $4. Back to the question, can $FTT reach its ATH again? I don't think so, it's because their image is already bad, maybe the significant increase that is happening now is because of market pumping from whales. Remember that the ATH of $FTT is around $84, that would require an increase of almost 20 times from the current price which is already pumped up.",

This exchange has a lot of shadiness from its core and I doubt investors will be too optimistic on this token to invest huge amount even high price without thinking that the previous owner of this project still holds a lot of this token and willing to dispose anytime if he has a chance.The existence of SBF is a threat to FTT growth that’s why it will never reach again ATH besides most of the CEX right has their own utility token which means competition is much tougher now compared before when FTT main rival is just BNB.",

Talking about the opportunity hit ATH again I think its not easily around the highest price above $80 and difficult current price around $5. Regarding with their market not recovery or refund investors money I doubt with FTT will hit their ATH price although in this days make another highest price again. Need more than x20 time for FTT return to their ATH price and looks almost impossible there are not good news with current FTX exchange market, are there highest price of FTT depend with whales impact and some time have potential to make it drop drastically again?",

I wouldn't want to feed those dumpers, but even if you say that there also people who are willing to pump the coin, I won't still invest on it. I wouldn't support the people who created this coin because they have done something wrong to the public.I feel sorry for those who hope to get big on this coin because they might only end up like that (hoping) but there is no real thing that is going to happen because I can feel that there are also lots of people who are scared to take risk and hates the coin too much for them to completely ignore it. There are many coins out there that needs our support better but I only hope they won't end up like FTT or FTX if they are still a new project.",

Like we all know that the crypto market can be very unpredictable looking at some strange things we normally see in the market which we never expected to see. The project might go up again to a level that would surprised many investors that had sold there holdings. That is how the market works, anything can happen anything any day so if you are already holding, it would be better to keep holding since the bull market is still loading. Just like we have seen with pepe recently that the price skyrocket when no one ever thought it would toook that kind of brave movement.",

FTT tokens could be abandoned entirely, dumped, or transferred to new ownership. If the FTX exchange comes back then the token would get relisted on many exchanges and current holders would use that opportunity to cash out causing the price to crash.You would have to be a complete degen to invest a significant amount in FTT right now. It will take a long time before everything is fully resolved with FTX. It is risky to trade this token but if you have a few bucks to play around then I don't see much of a problem.",
