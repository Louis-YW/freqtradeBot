I feel like this system is due for an upgrade and could use some more social media like elements. ...Update: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466990.0Quote from: tread93 on September 16, 2023, 01:06:18 PMAfter reading the responses to my last post in this section I realize that there is merit to the current order of things here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466736.msg62842780#msg62842780 Keeping it OG is very important, while other changes suggested by others could perhaps seem necessary my recent suggestion is far from one that should ever be implemented. I realized how ridiculous I sounded after I went back and read what I wrote. One thing I realized after the fact is that the current comment layout helps to foster cumulative responses taking eveything said into account. If you want to keep up with this platform you have to be invested and sort through all of the commentary, this is something that is unique and also makes things more fun. Posts that pop up like social media with an algorithm are engineered as such exactly to monetize, the organic posting nature of this forum is so unique it would be a shame and probably cause people to leave because nobody likes change. Don't change a thing with BTalk",

I just remembered that the topics that appear ignored are because the person who created them is on the ignore list, not the topic itself.

We are okay with it and we are already used to it so making changes will not change anything. It’s even better this way because early replies are the most relevant and other replies are mostly spam. Also reading a post and early responses makes it easier to understand the topic better.

I love the forum layout especially the comment section. The layout makes it easier to track comments based on which one came first and makes it easy to understand where the conversation is heading. I don't like collapsible drop down layout, it looks untidy to me and obstruct the flow of reading. The forum layout looks clean and simple to understand. We have the quoting function that can be used to reply others comments and they're clickable (redirecting you to the quoted message) so I don't understand why there's a problem here.We're getting too used to the new look of social media but we're forgetting that they're arrangements those platforms in the best way it'll be easier for them to get their advertisements to a broader audience.

Those who sat near me, started to ask questions related to this and I have only one thing to say, this is a discussion form where you can learn and learn about and through BTC respectively.
