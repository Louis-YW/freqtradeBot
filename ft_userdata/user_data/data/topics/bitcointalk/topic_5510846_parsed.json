If you want to compare data then you have to be specific about the Country you collecting data for Because it varies from State to State and country to country. This is for my country https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/real-estate/nigeriaYou can go little further down in the page to access other countries and compare the data with that of Bitcoin( quite easy to search for)You can use Tradingview though.",

Assuming Bitcoin price reach $100K, I think it's still not enough to outperform real estate with the current rate.The inflation in housing price rising too high, but it's harder to sell and you need to have big amount of money to buy it. https://inflationchart.com/btc-in-home/?show_divided_by=0&logarithmic=1&zero=1",

When you see this difference, you will not look for that chart.Bitcoin market is like other markets, has its cycle. Focus on its cycle!If you want to invest money in Bitcoin, focus on Bitcoin market cycle.",

Even in the periods when it was the other way around the difference was not much according to the graph and I think that if we took into account the good real estate business, i.e., buying with 80% financing and renting so that the payment of tenants results in positive cash flow, real estate would continue to win in more tranches and would be on a par in others. But the real estate business is much more complicated, has more risk and requires more effort than just clicking a few clicks.",

Growth in a region would be different from another and might not be relatable. If you just want to understand Bitcoin vs Real estate markets on how they compare as an investment. There's an article on Bitcoin Magazine about it.",

I guess its ideal too OP if you provide where specific location you need because of course forum members came from different part of the world just to make sure they can provide what you need at least.",

To clarify - I am interested in data covering any country, metropolis, jurisdiction etc. I would like to track how BTC sucks in monetary premium from real estate.Is it too much for your desire to get this unnecessary available information conducted by other teams/ people?I said earlier that it is unnecessary and by this, it means there is very little chance it was conducted by someone else. From this general unnecessary, you want more data to country, metropolis, jurisdiction and it's far from what you can achieve, if not say impossible to find it somewhere.Real estate is like groceries that can increase in prices because of inflation and if we count different industries / sectors will be affected differently by inflation, this simple chart https://inflationchart.com/btc-in-home does not give too much useful information. It can be very misleading if you don't count inflation of fiat currency, inflation of Bitcoin and fiat currency inflation impact on real estate and Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin is internet investment and real estate is physical investment and they have different investment approach and input and output. And if you want to know which one has the highest profit then I will categorically tell you that Bitcoin is much more though it is the long term investment in Bitcoin that make is more profitable.",
