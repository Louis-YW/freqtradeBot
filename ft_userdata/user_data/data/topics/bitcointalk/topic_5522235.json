Bhutan is a small country with a population of less than 800k, however, its economy has been on the rise. The economy of Bhutan rose around 6.1% in 2024 alone which is a great feat to achieve, in my opinion. Many countries wouldn't be able to achieve that.Now with Bitcoin providing them with good profits, I'm sure they can do better things for their economy that many other countries aren't able to do. Some countries, mostly third-world, aren't able to understand and realize the potential Bitcoin has and they are truly missing out on what Bhutan and some other countries are achieving utilizing Bitcoin.",

It's not that a big money as well, maybe they will used that money to refinance some projects in their country or totally build a new mining grid, so everything is for the good purpose.Besides, they can make that up next year as they will obviously continue to mine Bitcoin for good. And how lucky that crypto trading company is, and it could be Bhutan is one of their biggest client and so they will also make a lot of money from it. So it's a win-win situation.",

And they are still using their hydroelectric resources to continue mining.   Yeah, they really slip under the radar during the time that we have been discussing crypto mining specially when China ban it. We never thought that a country like Bhutan is going to mine because of their abundance of electricity in which they also invested way back in the 80's. So we commend the people who put their thoughts of using their extra electricity to mine Bitcoin. And now they are really taking it to the next level as they are one of the most wealthiest in term of Bitcoin holding and so they can sell some portions of it to continue with their mining business or the cost of maintaining it. And most likely, they will continue to accumulate thru their Bitcoin mining and so the effects for them are zero.",

If it helps funding their governmental projects and bringing benefits to their citizens, it's very good action from Bhutan government.We don't know they're taking advantage of this volatile time in Bitcoin market to take profit, or to trade for increasing number of bitcoin in their portfolio. We will ahve more information about Bhutan government actions in future.The Kingdom of Bhutan is onchain and mining millions in BTC",

They have gotten good profit from Bitcoin mining and after taking good profit and enjoying it, I believe they will continue with Bitcoin mining.I believe that with their experience, they know that with time, Bitcoin mining will become more challening, more a competitive and they will have to spend more time and resources to mine a same 1 bitcoin. However, it's not wrong to take profit and they actually sell part of their bitcoins, to get their initial capital investment into this mining activity first. Then they can move forward by reinvest their profit to future mining.I believe that every Bitcoin miner needs to know this Equivalent network time.",

The majority comes from their state-sponsored mining operations, which is why they’ve been able to accumulate so much.As of now, their total holdings are valued at over $1 billion.
