  "content": "Hi everyone!  I have been looking for a long time for a scanner that will send alerts in real time in a wide variety of intervals with types of indicators such as ma 50/100/200 in combination with rsi just like the tradingview scanner is really excellent!!!  The problem with it is that it won't send notifications in real time and it requires me to check most of the day, which doesn't save me time... There is the altfine scanner, the problem is that it fakes and gives false signals of conditions that don't really exist, I would love to receive your recommendations on scanners, of course, for a fee!  Thank you very much and have a great day",
