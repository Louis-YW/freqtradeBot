If they say Bitcoin is risky, you can ask them which investment has no risks. People with no knowledge about the sector will always spread lies or rumors. In most cases people don't know the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins they assume that cryptos are the same. Just like every other business, investing in Bitcoin has some level of risk. That is why it is important to invest only what you can live without or what you can bear if there is any loss.

All investments are risky depending on how you get into them, some have the mindset that bitcoin can make them rich overnight while other like the bitcoin maximalist that knows what bitcoin truly holds haven been able to get rid of that mindset and if you check online those that still thinks that bitcoin investment is not worth it or still call a scam or honey pot are those that came into the ecosystem thinking that once they purchase a certain amount of bitcoin they would be rich in the next few days probably after they watch some random YouTube video calculating their weekly profits from just holding bitcoin without them fully understanding how the market works.

But Bitcoin itself isn't really that risky.Logically if you look at the way the fiat devaluates you will agree that bitcoin isnâ€™t at all risky. But looking at its volatility ratio in a short term then we can consider it been risky. A clear example is the fact when you invest a certain amount or bought it at certain price there could be a period that the price might fall due to volatility for close to 4 months without heading back to the initial price, so the risk here is once you invest an amount you needed within that period you will certainly be getting it out at a loss which most people refer to as the risk. Another thing could be the risk act of how you store your coins, in fact the self custodian ownership method is a huge risk to careless people. So I would say bitcoin protocol itself is less risky if managed well just like the fiat in your bank account",

      "body": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and as that there is absolutely no risk in it whatsoever. The problem is that some people like to treat bitcoin as something it is not, an investment. As an investment and because bitcoin price is volatile, obviously there are certain risks involved.Even with the false definition as an investment, whether we can call it risky or not depends on the situation and what you do. For example during a bull run the risks are a lot lower compared to the sideways market where things are uncertain. It also depends on what money you are investing. For example if you are borrowing money (or generally money that you can't afford to lose) to invest in bitcoin, then the risks are extremely high.",
