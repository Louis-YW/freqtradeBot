I also searched for this type of option for a long time, but unfortunately nothing is guaranteed. Even banks do not provide this type of service as easily as we imagine.The main reason is to ensure that the savings remain frozen for a specified period without a single penny being touched. For example, every time I try to secure a reserve amount to use after a specific period of time, say a year, I find that I use it for a date much shorter than that. There are other reasons, such as providing savings for children or reserve insurance for the period of expected crises.",

Certainly not for a long period or a large amount.Mixin Safe offers a time-locked coin stake option, maybe you can look at their offer. Their ANN Mixin Safe: A Convenient and Decentralized Multisig + MPC + Timelock solution But be sure to read all the comments and suggestions of other forum members, especially in the last few pages.They had big losses due to the hack, but as far as I can see they continue to work. However, I would not recommend any service for something like this but do your own research.And don't forget, not your keys, not your coins.",

      "body": "Im not so sure locking up your coins is the best idea.  That seems kinda risky to me and  committing to not being able to unlock your coins until some set time in the future is a big commitment.  OP, what is your reasoning behind this? Are you just looking to invest long-term, or is there another specific reason you want to lock up your coins like that? Either way, it seems like a pretty bold move to me, locking up your money on a centralized service and throwing away the key for so long. But thats just me - maybe you have got good reasons for wanting to go that route that Im just not thinking of.",

      "body": "I'm not a fan of staking, but this is quite common nowadays. There are several DeFi platforms offering this. Even centralized exchanges are also offering this feature now. Even the likes of Coinbase and Kraken and other popular exchanges are now joining the bandwagon. I'm not sure, though, if they accept XRP and USDT. I've also stumbled upon ReHold and WhiteBIT. As always, do your own research. I'm not recommending any platform.It's weird that you prefer the risky way of doing things. I guess the trend nowadays is staking without locking.",

      "body": "You want to lock USDT, which will be worth $1, and it is similar to requesting a locked deposit in the bank. The only difference is that you bear the risks without getting a return, while your money is guaranteed in the bank and you get a return. If you think about locking USDT, do it using your bank account and USD. I did not find a service to lock xrp, but there are already services in Bitcoin where the timelock feature can be used, which you can find here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/TimelockBinance gives you a good staking service, but it is centralized, and your funds may disappear if there is a problem with Binance",

It is way more safer than using any online service.",
