      "body": ">localbitcoinsSomeone definitely concluded a scam and made you a part of it. The cybercell is doing an investigation into that scam, and you probably received victim's fiat while the real scammer got your \"bitcoins\" in exchange. You should send an E-mail to the cybercell as a record, explain how you are oblivious about the reason of this freeze and would like to know more. Or make a call, like synthia331 said.They will be interested in knowing about a certain transaction.Provide them will all the details(like who initiated the trade on localbitcoins, time, if you have their phone number etc). Were you accepting third party payments?",

Try to get as much information as you can from him. That's exactly what OP should do. If the amount in our bank is frozen then it is the bank's responsibility to let us know why it is so.They should also provide a solution on how to overcome the issue and provide all the necessary relevant details.OP should visit the branch and talk to the manager directly since he would be the right person to talk about such issues.Also, OP should have all the details about the transaction and valid proofs on his end to make sure he didn't do anything illegal.",

Contacted cybercell via site no response.Any solutions or precautions or measures to be taken.Please reply fellow members.This is problematic, i think best way can be to pursue this legally try having a word with the cyber crime department by directly walking into the department, or maybe you can try to approach the court as well if you can prove that you are facing issues in your daily activities because of all this. Government is surprising first they will want you to keep everything in bank account then they will freeze it with you waiting for your own money. How problematic is it for someone who doesn't keeps handy cash.",
