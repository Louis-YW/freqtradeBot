A friend that helps you in every situation regarding time and issues and Google plays the same role. It's a trusted tool and I am updating myself through Google so I called Google my best friend.Quote*How long have you been using Google?If I am not wrong it has been a long time since I have been using Google since 2009.I grew up with Google and I spend most of my time on it. In my school, I did my homework on Google and nobody knew this till now when I growing up I used it for my research and also for finding the best recipe because I loved cooking at that time. And now I use it for many purposes.Quote *Do you prefer other search engines than Google lately and can you tell why? (If any)No, I do not prefer any search engine to anyone else because my experience with Google is better, and recommend it to everyone to use Google as it provides the best services from any other engines.Quote*Is there any improvement would you like to see in Google that you think is not included assuming it is possible?Not as such improvement but one thing that I desire that Google has to improve and that is to reduce the fake and unauthentic websites. In today's time if you search for something a lot of websites show which 3 or 4 is related to my question and the rest of the website are useless and are not the answer to my question. So if Google controls it and just provides the answer of what the keywords are searching then would be much better.",

I believe all crypto users use google daily since they can surf a lot of information especially the current news then also the other more things they want to search.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on September 27, 2023, 04:20:30 AM*How long have you been using Google?Since High School days and until now which I participate in any crypto activities I still use this, maybe around 15 years if I remember it correctly.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on September 27, 2023, 04:20:30 AM*Do you prefer other search engines than Google lately and can you tell why? (If any)I try to use Brave browser before when they launch it but I go back to Google since I think this is more convenient.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on September 27, 2023, 04:20:30 AM*Is there any improvement would you like to see in Google that you think are not included assuming it is possible?Maybe proper dectecting of phising and fake sites then block it on their platform.

Many people have fall victim just by clicking on the wrong link and Google been a trusted brand makes it more easier for victims to fall. I think they should do more to filter that area of concern.",

I've learned a lot of things through it and I don't think a day would pass without seeking information on it, and it has been easily accessible and helpful in almost all facets.Quote*How long have you been using Google?I can't remember correctly anymore, but it should be over 20 years. My only regret is that I didn't envisage the opportunities of earning therein.Â Quote*Do you prefer other search engines than Google lately and can you tell why? (If any)I don't, and the reason is simple. There is no information needed that can't be found through Google, but there are many that can't be found in others.Quote*Is there any improvement would you like to see in Google that you think are not included assuming it is possible?There is always a need for improvements despite being spectacular. Google needs to stop the issues with sponsored ads where the true information will be pushed lower than it. Also, they need to fight the scam through their ads and reduce misinformation to its barest minimum.",

      "body": "Recently I saw the 25 substituting double O in google while searching for a picture of an Elephant today. Google has been great in optimizing the usage of the internet as a search engine. With its numerous security and privacy flaws on users, many switched to different and more private search engines. Yet they remain the best for marketers. Its numerous marketing tools like adsense, adwords, etc have helped in boosting the reach of potential clients for businesses and companies. Google is the mother of the internet, everything almost revolves around them, people use google chrome, gmail, google cloud services, keyword research tools etc to better their internet experience. And indeed, I can't be excluded among these users, which many of us still falls as a client in one of their multiple services. They have so much power and influence allocated to them on the internet. Site owners want to rank on google to yield traffic. Hence, google is our friend. I'd want google to reduce its updating speed and also make it easier for sites to rank on first page. People can't understand how the ranking algorithm work these days, whether through guest posts, high DA backlinks or top notch quality niche contents, these methods still may not rank a website in today's google ranking analysis. At some point, not now, I'd switch to private search engines and leave google, because of the way it rough handles people's data to feed advertisers. If google is 25 I've been using them for 25 years too, lol. I don't know how long I've been using them, but its been quite a long journey using google.",

But all my questions and problems, I took it all to Google, since I'm not the kind of person who communicates that much.I've been using Google for as long as I can remember, but can't pinpoint when exactly.3. Lately, I've been using Bing more. Google sometimes doesn't give you straight-up answers, and there are lot of information there, you don't know which to trust. But for Bing, it's information is related and not scattered like that on Google.4. As for improvement I'd say they try to fix the problem of not giving me what I want.
