By so doing, you won't delay any of your customers. Some customers out there are also mostly centralized exchange users who mostly use exchanges as a secure means of storing their crypto. If you come across such customers, then I will recommend that you use Binance Pay, that is, if you have one to receive the payment. which you will return to your private wallet immediately, it's confirm to avoid delay. A fast and successful business transaction brings in more positive feedback for the business.",

Mostly you would really be still touching up some payment processors on which you would really be recieving up Bitcoin but would be still converted to fiat later on.Unless if you do really want on p2p transactions in regarding to be done via wallet to wallet which you do own and with the customer. If you do want it that way then its better to make use of LN payments which i dont know if its already that fine on using it upbecause transactions fees are cheap and confirmations is almost instant or really that fast comparing on the current legacy. Overall, i would like to congratulate you onto your new business and would hope success and having that good revenue.Adding up Bitcoin option payment is really that something commendable if we do speak about recognition.",

I have my own business, where I also accept Bitcoin payments. I usually don't leave payments I accept in Bitcoin because of price volatility; after receiving payment in Bitcoin, I usually convert to fiat currency and only keep my profit in Bitcoin. But that's your decision to make; Bitcoin volatility is also good for the business some times, because if the price of Bitcoin is going high, then you will definitely be making more profit added to the profit you made from your sales.Also, to gain customers willing to pay in bitcoin, you should post an official notice in your business premises and make some advertisements on social media. You can also make stickers and give them to your customers to stick to their cars at will. that will get you more exposure.",

      "body": "I'd most probably create two wallets for the business: one hot wallet for day in, day out transactions and; one cold wallet for long-term storage. Expect that you may not be getting a lot of payments in bitcoin because a lot would probably just flirt with the idea but will not commit given how well bitcoin is performing very recently. At least, it will give some awareness about bitcoin if they see a sign hanging outside your gas station saying \"bitcoin accepted here.\" But yeah, you might have problems with confirmation times and all those, but if you are just trying it out, a simple wallet like Electrum would suffice. Be wary of double-spends though, enforce confirmations on transactions before letting your patrons go. Congrats on the business!",

I still won't be surprised to see someone convince his nation's government to start paying its civil staff in bitcoin.This generic thread of having to do this and that with bitcoin is becoming too much. If i don't know any better, i'll take it that y'all are just lying.

It is a good thing you have done to have made bitcoin a payment option for your services rendered as a means of payment for gas in your locality. I like what you have down mate, as I see based on what you have said, mostly people who patronize your gas station are youths so therefore, it would be of good benefits and importance that you do e needful just as you have said to enlighten them more on bitcoin and how it works so that they could be able to adapt quickly to it but I will advise you not to think or try a way of convincing them so that you do not put yourself into problem.",

Also you make your customers life easier with bitcoin payment, now they don't need wait for the changes or find their wallet to pay. They can pay the bill by scanning a QR code if you have one for bitcoin payment. But if you don't put a QR code along with bitcoin address people got demotivated, because people will find it uncomfortable to type all the characters of bitcoin wallet at a gas station.Also I want to see some pictures of your gas station and how you implement or encourage people to pay with bitcoin.",

Since you set up a gas station and connected bitcoin as a means of payment for that gas station.  When people come to your gas station and go to pay for gas, they will curiously ask you how to pay through it. This is how they will be introduced to Bitcoin. Especially the youth community of your area will take it very positively and you will see people coming from far and wide to get gas at your filling station.  El Salvador recently integrated Bitcoin as a payment method for gas stations in their country. And after some time you decided that it is really admirable. Hopefully, little by little, Bitcoin will become one of the means of transactions.",
