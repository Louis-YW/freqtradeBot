I enjoy camping with my friends because it is a great time to spend your day and when we are done we like to prepare a BBQ. The best part of my weekends with my friends is being able to catch up around the warm bonfire and be with the nature. I set up our tent which fits about 4 people and is just perfect for myself and my friends.We have enough space to set up our inflatable twin beds, and have a sleeping bag, blanket, and can’t forget about a small pillow. We use a cooler with ice to store away our soda, water, meat, eggs, some vegetables, and fruits. Aside from food, if you bring a small grill, charcoal, lighter fluid, lighter, knife, forks, and knife is pretty much all you need for an exciting weekend.",
