If Ethereum get approved for an ETF it could potential for Ethereum value. The approval of Ethereum's ETF could serve as a positive precedent for other altcoins too. But thing is that the approval order of ETFs for Ethereum and Bitcoin are pending and it is difficult to predict which will come first.",

I believe the same thing and it is because of that court order that SEC has to follow barring any other reasons that SEC might use to delay implementing what BlockRock won in court. Plus it seems that SEC is more friendly to Bitcoin these days. there are saying that the final approval of BTC ETF can come in January so it can be a big welcome gift on 2024 just in time for the halving. Now, on the other hand, there is also a big chance that eventually ETF for Ethereum can be approved but this might be taking some time considering the environment that SEC has now under Gary Gensler.",

So Blackrock's entry into ETH could provide new investment and legitimacy for the asset. And of course, the implication of the Blackrock ETH filing in the ETF is to increase its institutional adoption and liquidity as well.",

They must have had encouragement from the SEC regarding the bitcoin ETF so have pushed ahead with an Ethereum ETF application. Exciting times lay ahead I think.",

I was only thinking about that but I know that these are for real and the institutions such as BlackRock are already for Bitcoin and ETH.

There's a lot of demand/interest from these big investment companies. It seems that Blackrock is getting deeper into the crypto craze. Other companies will follow if they see the SEC approving Blackrock's spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. I think a Bitcoin ETF will be the first thing to be approved, since BTC is the main cryptocurrency of interest. ETH is going to have to wait a little longer. If both ETFs are approved, we should expect a massive bull run for the aforementioned cryptocurrencies. It's likely BTC will reach $100k, while ETH goes all the way to $10k per coin. This is all speculation, of course. No one can tell exactly where market prices will go. Yet, increased institutional demand/interest is a sign that crypto/Blockchain tech won't be going anywhere soon. We're still early adopters of the revolution, so hold on tight as this is going to be a wild ride.",
