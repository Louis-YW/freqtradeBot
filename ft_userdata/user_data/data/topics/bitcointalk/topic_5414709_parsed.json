It's one of the oldest ones around, and they're building something of a name and wealth for themselves getting contracts with govt enforcement. They also shut down noise from an ex employee a few years back who went whistleblower, claiming their tech is laughably poor and unscientific.- The idea that Bitcoin guarantees anonymity is misled, was never claimed, and disproven publicly from the days of Silk Road. Why do we need Chainalysis to tell us something they really didn't have a hand in helping educate about? Think it's really just Bloomberg readers who still think so.",

They can't just place banner ads or run a signature campaign on bitcointalk because I don't think anybody would participate and they would probably be bashed to hell with their accounts neg-tagged Their audience are also not here. So when they pay these news outlets to publish some nonsense about bitcoin and their services, they are practically advertising their services and to a better audience.\"the US Department of Justice announced it had reclaimed almost all the Bitcoin. ~ FBI had tracked the ransom Colonial paid to an address tied to DarkSide, a Russia-linked cybercrime group associated with the attackers, and swooped in to seize it.\"hmmm. they should have mentioned some other country that US has some jurisdiction not Russia where they don't!",

Add in getting the information from other centralized services and it becomes more difficult. But still possible.What they do do is provide 2 things.1) A nice PR for the government agency when they show they are protecting you by hiring people to find this stolen, or obtained through fraud or whatever BTC2) They are the fall guy when they get it wrong, \"We didn't do anything wrong, we hired the best company we could find\"-Dave",

A very good example recently was tornado cash. The government has made it clear to many that it will not allow shady dealings. We are all about to be heavily regulated. Some exchanges have long since stopped accepting deposits from wallets with built-in mixers.There is illegal money everywhere, and by the way the amount of it in crypto is small compared to other places, e.g. like with paper money. These chain analysis companies are not doing anybody any favor but the government. Regulations isn't new in centralized exchanges, they have always been 'censor agencies' and be it money, data, privacy, etc is not safe when one uses them.",

Actually Bitcoin mixer and decentralized exchanges help to make Bitcoin become 100% anonymous, if they're saying Bitcoin can't guarantee anonymity, why in the hell they're can't trace the whole Bitcoin scammer? especially those who create ponzi scheme on many sites.",
