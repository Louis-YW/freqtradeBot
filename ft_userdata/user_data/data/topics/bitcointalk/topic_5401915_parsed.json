Source Now my question is how often can we see a country's Fiat currency currency thrive despite the harsh economy in the country? The answer is natural resources here! Russia is a part of OPEC plus countries and has one of the biggest oil and gas reserves. So now America's dream is coming true when they see EUR is dropping faster than expected. Because that's was always the gameplan of US. Russia has told ass their buyer to pay in  Rubles and as a result their buyers have started selling their euros against Rubles to pay Russia for their oil and gas bills. As a result, EUR is standing at all time low and Russia is getting the benefits of strongest Rubble ever. US is happy because EUR is weakening and UK is happy to prove that Brexit was a correct decision.",

Source Now my question is how often can we see a country's Fiat currency currency thrive despite the harsh economy in the country? It's interesting to see how easily some people can be fooled without doing any proper research on the topic. There is no doubt that Russia has a positive budget which is fuelled by high oil and gas prices right now, but the rest of their maintenance economy is in tatters and we are still only in the very early stages of seeing this play out. Nobody wants to but roubles right now and foreign businesses are being restricted from selling assets as they flee the country after dire sanctions, so Russia can use their relatively large reserves to prop the currency up to any level they want. The central bank of Russia actually went too far in this illusion because an overly strong rouble is actually even more damaging especially in the current situation.",

At the time, Russia’s central bank pegged the price of RUB to 5,000 rubles for a gram of gold. Russia also made it so “unfriendly” countries are forced to pay for gas with the ruble. Numerous international buyers are complying with the rule and paying for petro products in rubles. The country’s central bank also slashed Russia’s benchmark bank rate as well.Russia is sitting on a lot of energy exports that India and China are willing to purchase readily. Other countries in Europe require these energy exports too and there is not an indication that these other countries can immediately switch energy suppliers without drastically raising the costs. Relatively speaking, ruble still isn't performing well.",

I wouldn't be surprised by the sheer volume of data regarding the ruble's rise or fall. Because basically, the impact was worse for those of us who were not involved in the war. But it bears more than the sanctions imposed on Russia. So who is actually going to be hit and who is going to hit the economy of another country when two countries are at loggerheads?",

Ever since March 11th, ruble price has been on the decline and fall more than the price it was before the war. https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=RUBYou are reading all wrong, you are intepreting exactly the opposite of what the graph says. If comparing USD to RUB, when the line goes up it means you can buy more RUB with a dollar, so, the RUB worth less (or the dollar worth more) the higher the line. When the line goes down it means you can buy less RUB with a dollar, that's means RUB is getting stronger (or the dollar is getting weaker).If I'm not explaining it well, imagine you are visiting Russia from USA, and you go with dollars. The exchange rate was 1 USD = 135RUB during the war, but now you only get 58RUB. The RUB is more expensive.And yes, it is true that the RUB has recovered its value and now worth more than before the war.============I'll add another piece of data so you guys could know if the price is \"real\": Check if people in that country (Russia in this case) can freely exchange RUB for USD or, in the other hand, the exchange is limited by law. If Russia limited the exchange by law, RUB will look stronger than what it actually is (as it looks right now).For example, in Argentina (USD/ARS), the exchange rate is 1USD = 110ARS, but only private banks can access to that price. If you have ARS and want to exchage for USD, you must to pay 210ARS in a paralel market. Politicians do this by limiting the amount of dollars you can freely exchange, or/and, by taxing the exchange. Argentina does both: If you have ARS you can only exchange for 200 USD maximum, and you have to pay a tax of 65%.EDIT: Yes, Russia limited by law the amount of RUB to USD you can exchange: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/08/ruble-dollar-exchange-barred/",

Today, Putin canceled the mandatory sale of foreign exchange earnings for exporters, yesterday the Central Bank of Russia increased the export limit from $50,000 to $150,000. Russia is trying in every possible way to weaken the rapidly strengthening ruble, because it is unprofitable with a large positive trade balance. So far, it is not working out very well, apparently the Central Bank will again reduce the key rate in the near future.",

Previously, Russian citizens bought US dollars and euros to travel abroad for tourism purposes.  The family budget for such trips was very large (at least 2-3 monthly salaries).  However, Russians have now stopped traveling abroad.  This is due to the closure of borders and a general drop in their standard of living.  This led Russians to stop buying euros and dollars, and began to keep all their money in rubles.  This helps to keep the ruble at a high level.  Also in Russia, the number of imported goods has sharply decreased.  For example, the purchase of smartphones and laptops in quantitative and qualitative terms fell by 26 percent compared to the same period last year.  People prefer to repair old electronics and home appliances rather than throw them away and buy new ones.  One can rejoice that the ruble exchange rate against the dollar and the euro has strengthened, but in fact this event is driven by the general impoverishment of Russians, the decline in their standard of living and general cultural and technological degradation.",
