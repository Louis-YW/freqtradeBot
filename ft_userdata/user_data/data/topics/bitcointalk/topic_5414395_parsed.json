Eventually I got this email.They claim that you have insight and professional knowledge of the sport and also suspect you have multiple accounts and will block you and confiscate your funds.I've used many sites, but this is the first time I've seen such an absurd scam site.In my opinion, any gambling site, if they find multi-accounts and engage in cheating in betting they will block your account, your balance will be automatically confiscated, if the gambling site team finds suspicious activity, that's common and often happens on most gambling sites.TRUSTDICE.WIN, have representatives on this forum, maybe you can try contacting their team here: Coinbox1, to talk about your problem.In my opinion, if you are not cheating in betting and can prove you are honest, I think the TRUSTDICE.WIN party/team should give a clear reason here, about your problem, and vice versa, maybe the members here can only hope that you with TRUSTDICE.WIN find a bright spot about your problem that you are experiencing.",

To be honest, all of us are 3rd parties, we don't know for sure what you've done to get that treatment or if you're truly honest with us about your statement.But for once, I dislike how the betting site only gave some vague responses, listing their rule that you've violated without proof to back up their claims. For example:Quote* we suspect that you have registered, manage or direct your betting activity on multiple user accounts in an attempt to hide your betting activity, bypass our set trading limits or violate any promotion Terms and Conditions;\" At least, they need to show the log and timestamp to show multi accounts they thought were from you. Not just a simple line of text just like that.Also, what does this mean?Quote7.14.

Not until the teams forum representative relayed the abuse on its Cash Out feature.I think, if that was unambiguously relayed to the OP along with the captioned T&C, as it has been done hear by Coinbox1, it would have undoubtedly not necessitate this the opening of this thread and not have the reputation of the casino questioned.With OP haven't seen this probably and not dispute it or make further claims, it presents the evidence levied against OP to be true and stands.I would say, if we expect the fairness of casinos and gaming platforms, we must ourselves be fair to them as well!",
