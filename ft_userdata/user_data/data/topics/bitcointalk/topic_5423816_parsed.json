This means the final word has 3 bits which are not checksum, which gives 23 = 8 possible combinations. For each of these 8 combinations, there will be exactly one correct checksum, meaning there will be 8 valid final words for any given 23 words.For a 12 word phrase which has 4 bits of checksum, there will be 27 = 128 possible valid final words.And of course, I have to ask, why are you manually picking words to create a seed phrase? Such a process leaves you with a very insecure seed phrase and liable to have all your coins stolen.",

One would pick some nice words, one could pick the words alphabetically, one may not know / care that those words can exist multiple times in a seed...If somebody has issues with the seed generated by his wallet (works he doesn't know nor want for some reason), a better way is to simply generate 1-2 more wallets until the words are good enough. The result is that the seed is still much better than the one the user would have been picking by himself word by word.",

I was just curious on behalf of those that don't trust wallet software and wanted to be hardcore about it.It is not easy to generate a bip-39 phrase without software because a SHA-256 hash is required. However, many wallets will allow you to use an invalid phrase, so simply picking 12 (or 24) random words is a viable method, but it is not as safe.This page describes in simple terms how it is done: https://medium.com/coinmonks/mnemonic-generation-bip39-simply-explained-e9ac18db9477",

That depends on the quality of the people reviewing the software and all other community members and their abilities to spot vulnerabilities in a piece of code. And also how long it will take them to do it. 1 day, 1 month, 1 year, 10 years.... A vulnerability that gets discovered and patched in a day is totally different from something that's out there publicly for a year, for example.Here is a good article that mentions a few interesting points:https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/last-years-open-source-tomorrows.htmlQuoteFinding open source vulnerabilities is typically done by the maintainers of the open source project, users, auditors, or external security researchers. But despite these great code-archaeologists helping secure our world, the community still struggles to find security flaws.On average, it takes over 800 days to discover a security flaw in open source projects. For instance, the infamous Log4shell (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability was undiscovered for a whopping 2649 days.The analysis shows that 74% of security flaws are actually undiscovered for at least one year! Java and Ruby seem to have the most challenges here, as it takes the community more than 1000 days to find and disclose vulnerabilities.",

There are only 128 possible words if you are picking them manually. Since the last word of a 12 word seed phrase also contains 7 bits of entropy, then when generated properly there is exactly one word which provides the correct checksum for the provided entropy.And yes, it is important. If you don't have a checksum and import an incorrect seed phrase, then you have no idea you have imported an incorrect seed phrase. You could spend weeks or months trying to brute force a passphrase which doesn't exist, or searching weird and wonderful derivation paths, or who knows what else, trying to hunt down your wallet. With a checksum, you know immediately one of your words is wrong and can immediately narrow down your search significantly. Not to mention that brute forcing an incorrect seed phrase is also quicker with a checksum since you do not have to derive addresses and check them for balance for all the invalid phrases.",

Because this checksum thing can't fix things if there were too many mistakes made like writing words in the wrong order and leaving a few of them out. You would be SOL. has anyone here ever been in the situation where they needed this checksum or else all their funds were lost?   that seems like such a remote possibility as to not even be worried about happening. you could even require a valid seed phrase to be 46 words long by just duplicating the original 23 word phrase. then the last 23 words would be your checksum for the first 23 words. and they could detect AND fix errors.",
