If it's a crypto project then hard to do marketing with a low budget among most social media. There is a lot of marketing source even outside of the forum. So it depends on the budget and project. Please write more briefly, I have been working with a couple of crypto projects as a marketing incubator. So let's discuss telegram or DM more details.",

Is it a website that provides gambling (or some other services ) or is it about any altcoin which you want to promote through marketing? Also when you say you have a low budget, can you tell me exactly how much you will be willing to pay for this marketing campaign so only those contact you can work in the budget you will tell?Quote from: coupable on October 13, 2022, 04:54:46 PMWith a low budget, i don't think anybody would be interested for a long term partnership.Not necessary as if OP is promoting an altcoin, he can just start a bounty campaign on bitcointalk and pay in the native token. This way he won't be spending any money and yet promoting his project. This is being done by many projects already and OP can also do it. Although if he had budget and can spend some dollars on marketing, that would have been more effective.",
