What do you think about altcoin market.Brother the first thing you have to know that nobody can confirmly predict the Bitcoin next move in current market the Bitcoin situation is just like the avalanche falling from a mountain so NoOne know that where it will stuck and confirm their support.While the altcoins is directly proportional to Bitcoin So if Bitcoin confirm their strong support then it will bullish his price & that will be the zone which we can say that it's the bottom of altcoins.Quote from: Z390 on June 23, 2022, 05:56:13 AMIs polka-dot a good price at 7 dollars? This was its price two years ago, do you think that polka-dot can still go down or not? Yeh polkadot is quite good at 7$ price but may be it can go down if market crash but be patient because it almost hit 50$ in past so if you hold it It will be Worthy more than you expectation in future",

Have we met the bottom for altcoins or all these are just fake outs? What do you think about altcoin market.As you probably know the altcoin market depends a lot on the movements of bitcoin and right now there is not too much strength for the price of bitcoin to go up, so while DOT at 7 or 8 dollars may seem like a good opportunity it is better to take your time and avoid making too many moves at this time.The bear market has the potential to keep going at least for another year, so there is no need to rush and buy DOT when you could even buy it for a cheaper price during the next  months, so take your time and only once we are closer to the bitcoin halving then you can make your move.",

What do you think about altcoin market.That maybe a good price to enter and remember the peak for DOT was $55 and there’s still a chance to hit that price once the market fully recovers and especially if there’s a new development with DOT. The market might be on a bull trap for now, so better to wait for the real bottom before buying but if you are a long term player, then I believe $7 is already a good price to buy, just set up your target price and you can be good. Altcoins market is still down, many are still struggling so grab this opportunity now to have those good altcoins.",

Even to say it will or not, this still not sure about it. We should have to know the fact that we never know what will happen next. We do speculations, right and it was certainly unreliable unless we are the one who controls and manipulate the market as this DOT and the rest of the altcoins are still reliant on Bitcoin, and once it falls, they will follow as well, and so the pump.

Don't you even remember about if the best buy for people must be when the price of token has already reached the bottom value? That gives you a chance to accumulate polkadot at the bottom price.

I also wouldn't be surprised if many of the conclusions for today's altcoin market are fake, but are you going to wait for the right price to buy a few bites of Polkadot? you also think $7 is the same as 2 years ago. Well my advice just hold on and wait for next fall if you're hesitant to start invest in Polkadot because inflation is still above the sky there is no sign of a decline.",

But in reality of course its not possible, due to the market was too unpredictable and all of us are waiting for this. Now if your gonna ask me, does this moment is a good timing to buy DOT, I could say yes and no. Because like what I said the market is unpredictable, if ever you buy now then it suddenly the coins dump the price quickly, you know the feeling of saying the words like \"what a pity, I shouldn't be in a hurry\" you know what I mean.",

That's why everyone is recommending investing in bitcoins because as of now, it is the safe haven for the investors.
