  "content": "Posted this in other subforum but not getting many replies so want to also post it here.  My nano ledger s has a screen issue and i bought a nano ledger s plus.  Have not opened the box yet but have the device.  The only time i restored my seed phrase was few years ago with the old nano ledger s with a new same nano ledger s.  This time it will be with a nano ledger s plus.When i went online to check for videos on this, the issue is either they are using an old nano ledger s to restore or a nano ledger x.  They do say you could also do the same with any device but I prefer it to look exactly the same.  Also they are not very direct as 1 or 2 videos, the person mentioned if you want to restore a seed, just click either the left or right button to power on and restore?  That makes no sense because doesn't the nano ledger s plus require it to be connected to laptop?  But if not, connected to something first?  Also the order they are doing it make no sense... say enter you seed phrase and if correct, it show processed?  Then they mention to do the ledger genuine test?  That make no sense because shouldn't that be done before you plug the nano ledger s plus in your laptop in the first place?  Many videos seem so skip important steps or make assumptions that they think people know.Now my ledger live program still remains the same on my laptop.  But after you enter the seed phrase and say it shows it's correct, shouldn't you delete the accounts you have on ledger live first and then reinstall them again to make sure the seed you entered matches the accounts shown on ledger live?  You notice how some people say it doesn't for them and that was because they have several seeds so one so the accounts showing on ledger live won't match the seed.  One video said if your ledger live was untouched on your laptop, all you have to do is go to the accounts where you have a balance on... so say it's btc and bch, just go to each one of them and click receive, once you do that, it not only installs the btc app on your new nano ledger s plus, but it would also display a btc receiving address on your nano ledger s plus screen and once it does and you confirm it is same btc address, then the seed you used is linked to the correct accounts.  Then do this with bch and any other accounts.  Can others here confirm this method?  Or better to just manually install the apps?  Because after doing that, you can click on receive on each app just to verify the receiving address on the accounts is indeed linked to that seed you entered?  So nobody here deletes their accounts on ledger live before doing the seed phrase recovery?  Or say even after the seed phrase recovery, delete your accounts and then re add them?There was another time i restored my ledger live only when i got a new laptop.  Had to download ledger live and add accounts and it was there.  This was much simpler as there were few videos that showed exactly how to do this step by step.  Also it was with a same replacement nano ledger s.  That is much simpler than restoring your seed phrase on new device.Has anyone here bought specifically a new nano ledger s plus and used it to restore the seed phrase from a nano ledger s?  Now if so, can you answer my questions?  There is no video on youtube that shows the exact steps here as some don't even mention if the nano s plus was connected to laptop or not before they start entering the seed phrase.  And when they show them entering a seed phrase first and then check the device is genuine makes no sense.  Anyone can list the exact first steps here or show me a video on youtube for this?  Most of the videos are not clear and the omit few parrts.  Thank you.",

      "body": "Are these the proper steps here?1.  Log in my ledger live and shows all accounts.2.  Connect my new nano ledger s plus in laptop usb a port.  But when i do this, since it's a new device isn't it going to ask if i want to create a new seed, or restore seed phrase or connect it to laptop say if i was installing ledger live again.  I know there are 3 total options when you connect a new ledger to a laptop.3.  Choose recovery phrase and enter the seed phrase?  Then it it's correct, it will ask you to create a pin number for it?  Got to assume this happens after seed recovery words are entered as before to before?But when does the check ledger is genuine occur?The thing is if i had to install ledger live all over again, this wouldn't seem that complicated as that would be like setting up the nano ledger s plus for the 1st time.Anyone can tell me if the 1st few steps are even correct?  The confusing thing here is some videos say you can just power it on without connecting to anything which makes zero sense.  Unless they mean the nano ledger x only which is bluetooth?  Make no sense you can enter your recovery phrase on your new nano ledger s plus while it isn't connected to a laptop.",

      "body": "Also as a security precaution, should one set up the new nano ledger s plus device as new?  Then you write down the new seed phrase even though you don't need it. Then you enter pin wrong 3 times.  That resets your nano ledger s plus.Then you go to restore from seed phrase and then enter your old nano ledger s seed phrase to restore?  Or is that completely unnecessary?  As oppose to directly restoring the seed phrase?",

Don't feed the troll.Quote from: dkbit98 on May 03, 2023, 09:52:19 PMOh boy, jerry0 is back again and he created bunch on new recycled topics in Hardware wallet section.If I counted correctly there are 12 of his topic that are floating on top, and he created bunch of silly questions again.Most of his ''questions'' are related with ledger, but I can't even read the content and I don't think this is normal at all... maybe someone forgot to take his pills  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=261.0I need someone to create PURGE script in bitcointalk forum, instead of Ignore option.",
