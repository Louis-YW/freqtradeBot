Fake airdrop will never cease to exist for as long as there are legitimate airdrops out there promoting their own coins. I don't think that it's real celebrities that are in this kind of scheme, maybe some of them are part of it but I don't think everyone is, let's make it clear. Remember that you can easily use a celebrities picture and with AI maybe even fake the voice and the videos as if they're really promoting a scam. No matter the effort, Twitter will never rid of scams unless they do a scorch earth policy to destroy the scammers which might affect legitimate users hence called a scorch earth.",

Like many scams, they try to expose a large number of people to the scam and if only a few people fall for it, it is profitable for them. They are usually quite successful, moreover. I remember the first time I saw one, I had Youtube on in the background while I was doing other things and I saw Saylor talking while a message appeared below saying that if you send x Bitcoin to such and such address, as a giveaway they would give you back double. To disguise it they put that you could only send a certain maximum amount, when if you think about it it's BS because if it was real, you could send from other addresses to skip the amount. We will not fall but the bad thing is that there is always someone who ends up falling, so they do not stop making these ads.",

Just might take them 5 minutes to create a new website and but a domain at a cheap price.But then when someone falls for it, they are potentially going to earn 10x of what money they shell out. So it's going to be cyclical, every other celebrities are going to be hijack, so don't be surprised that it is still prevailing up to this day.",

Do they, for example, want to waste their money for free? And have they ever done that? The answer is no; that's a sufficient answer that makes people ignore these false giveaways and phishing and scam sites on Twitter, and to report these sites will be positive to reduce fraud, so we have to be positive.",

I have seen such type of scams on Facebook, and the scammers were using Facebook ads to attract users to a platform where a user can earn huge Airdrops of many newly launched coins The worst thing about those scams is that they force the users to invite their friends if they want to get the Airdrops in their wallets. I even saw such sites where they had proper implementation of Metamask, and they were asking users to connect their Metamask wallet to earn the rewards.",

I remember Charles Hoskinson of ADA very vividly, during the height of the bull run as he become the face being used by scammers. As for Youtube, really hard to distinguished as well as again, this criminals are using AI now. So there will be a lot of investors that are going to fall for it no matter what as they thought it's the real individual hyping this program or promoting certain websites.",
