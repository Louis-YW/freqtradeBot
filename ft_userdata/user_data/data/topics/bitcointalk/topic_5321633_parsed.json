Processing power has gotten so much faster, that wiki is obviously outdated.I'm not really sure how people think Elon Musk needs donation. Probably the same way as a Nigerian Prince scam.",

Used to improve security, a distinctive address makes it harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your customers into paying them instead of you. Unfortunately, vanity addresses also make it possible for anyone to create an address that resembles any random address, or even another vanity address, thereby fooling your customers.",

Those scams generally don't ask for donations. They advertise themselves with something like \"Elon Musk decides to giveaway bitcoin in celebration of SN10 landing\". Then they'll have some explanation about how the most tech-savvy man wants you to \"learn\" bitcoin. So, as a proof, you need to send some BTC and Musk will send you double of that.There generally are lot of supporting replies saying, \"OMG, My life has changed.

Anyway, one thing for sure with this story is that scammers are always so creative in finding ways to attract victims and milk them out of their funds or digital assets away from their purse. They are tuning in to our sense of greed in many cases and taking advantages of people who are just new to cryptocurrency who can easily be misled. The best way to counteract is of course providing the right information and putting a red warning for these type of scams.",

It would be incredibly easy to at least tag them with the current OCR they're using on images to detect certain phrases.Not just this, twitter had been a hot ground for ongoing crypto scams. There are tons of accounts which has 10k+ followers who are scammers trying to rob people's money by doing fake giveaways and promoting scams. While considering Bitcointalk (a community which is being run by the community) it is much easier to spot the scammers and they would be tagged sooner. Not just that, there are indeed way more celebrity shillers like Lindsay who are being bribed to promote TRX knowing its a shitcoin and Marques Brownlee video has put a pause on these shills! Justin Sun has been trying to promote Tron as much as he can   and newbies fall for it. There were various instances from known people of mine, who invested in the shitcoin citing the reason for the tweets. At the time of this writing, TRX is trading at a $3.5 billion marketcap and DOGE at $6.3 billion and this shows how poor the investor's brains are! Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on March 05, 2021, 01:59:16 AM- How do they blindly believe it?- Why did they skip the investigation or verification on validity of those addresses?Quite often, newbies fall for these since they are into the space to make instant profits in short span of time, hence more or less they would either be losing their btc in trading shitcoins or vanity address scams like these.I did create a few vanity addresses back in 2019 for experimental purposes but stayed away from them as they consumed too much of my processing power nevertheless it was a fun experiment",
