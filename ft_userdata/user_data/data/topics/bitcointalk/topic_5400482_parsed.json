I remembered when I was actively betting, a friend of mine (although younger) came to me about this kind of betting. I told him the risk and how people (the bet predictor)  are just using it to make money from the victim (the bettor) and yet the bettor which become the victims will lose. He tried it with $10 and paid $10 to the predictor and he was given 2 matches to bet from Ligue two (French league). When I saw it, I new it would definitely be a lost bet. He actually list the bet and also his money was not refunded. You are a newbie here, you just came up with this kind of scam idea, with telegram account which can not be linked to your real identity. People should just avoid you or they will be scammed. Do not trust someone that has nothing to lose.",

You send me 3 win tips I bet for you without guarantee. There are really a lot of idiots on this forum. If you bet in locals bookie in Italy, Czech, Romania, Russia you dont touch odd on Bet365 or Pinnacle or Asianodds. Locals can only removed tip, or blocked in locals in this country, but odds are stable online. You dont know difference between offline and online betting. I dont bet analysis and tipster for other sources.I need only source who win.",

First of all, OP isn't asking you to send him any money. You are not paying him to receive information about an alleged fixed match. You are supposed to tell him about such matches only if you have such information. If you can't make the bet yourself because you don't want to, you are scared to do it, or for any other reason, OP claims he will do it for you. He will bet with his own money and the two of you agree how to split the profits. At least that's how I understood the offer. This doesn't mean that it's not a scam but also not that it is. I personally don't like what I see and don't trust him, but everyone should make up their own mind.Quote from: bitbollo on May 28, 2022, 03:02:42 PMTaraz next match is programmed for next month. I don't now what you mean with \"now\". Taraz played a match yesterday at 14:00 CET. They won 3:0 and were leading 2:0 at halftime. OP posted that tip of his at 12:49 forum time, that's 14:49 CET, which means that the match was already at halftime when the prediction was posted. The prediction is therefore not worth anything since the first half already ended or was close to end when the post was made.",
