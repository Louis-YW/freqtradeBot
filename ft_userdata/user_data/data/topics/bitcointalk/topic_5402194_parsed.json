Just like what already mentioned, its the security, security over other features is the most important. Bitcoin serves its purpose as a means of payment and now store of value. Other alts just have many useless features. Most of them are just made to make money and make the team behind richer.",

The protocol was lunched for the aim to be accessible by everybody without the interfere of any third part entity whatever its power. In the other hand, almost all other alts (except for few ones) are maintained by centralized powers which can control over it whenever needed .",

Your thoughts, ideas and opinions are welcomed.It's so far the most decentralised one. Even thought this advantage could vanish in just one second if Satoshi is discovered or he moves some of his Bitcoins from his cold storage. But so far this is the biggest advantage that Bitcoin offers otherwise in terms of scalability and price of a transaction it is much worse than others. Only two advantages are it's the first blockchain amongst all others and it is most decentralised one too",

But Bitcoin is good enough and trusted enough, and I think it also helps that we don't know who made it, so there's no power of the creator over the project.",

And there are just more actual businesses and other services building on it, to improve the experience for us.I honestly can't see any other blockchain (you say blockchain and not crypto right?) coming close to it in terms of utility and that's really how you get something going and keep it going.Every other alt (save Ethereum) blockchain would kill to have a hint of Bitcoin's utility.

Prior to SegWit, for example, there were certain outputs that anyone could spend (although I don't believe this was ever actually used by anyone). Currently, data can be stored on the blockchain via OP_RETURN outputs. It is also possible to implement fairly basic smart contracts via bitcoin, although there are altcoins that are far superior for smart contracts currently. I don't think something like the ability to execute smart contracts is necessarily a bad thing. To answer the OP's question, the advantage that bitcoin has over blockchains is that the most effort is used to secure bitcoin's blockchain. In other words, bitcoin is the blockchain which the most effort is put into mining.",
