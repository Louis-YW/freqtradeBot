  "content": "Guys, this is not my first rodeo with Trezors.  Created a new Debian 11 system.  My Trezor is working perfectly using Suite or Electrum 4.2.2.  Flawlessly in fact.I like to use trezorctl to enhance security features ---- wipe PIN, SD support, etc....I installed trezorctl as noted below:-----------------------------------------------------------------https://wiki.trezor.io/Using_trezorctl_commands_with_Trezorinstall trezorctl from scratch debian:1. sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev2. pip3 install setuptools wheel3. pip3 install trezor  #Update your $PATH by running4. source .profile  #setup Udev rules:5.  install https://data.trezor.io/udev/trezor-udev_2_all.deb    #update your Python-trezor version run:6. pip3 install -U trezor     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I watched the install and the wheel being built it was all successfully completed.  I figured good to go because I have built several of these.  I connect my Trezor enter my PIN and open a terminal to start entering trezorctl commands.  NO GO.First a basic handshake type command to make sure its connected:XXX@Debian:~$ trezorctl get-featuresbash: trezorctl: command not foundXXX@Debian:~$ Brain dead today.  Any suggestions for how to run this down?  Repeating I watched the install and build it was good to go.Edit:  I don't remember running the aforementioned source command in the past.  Wondering if something is on a path out of the norm for some reason.  Just my initial thought.  Re-pasting below#Update your $PATH by runningsource .profile",

      "body": "I know there a many times a Windows or Linux newbie would consider using trezorctl to add some enhanced features to their Trezor T's IF they were not blasted away with the complexity of installing trezorctl on their systems.I wanted to make sure that readers of this thread realize that TAILS 5.1.1 (some other versions do also) has trezorctl resident and ready to go on the ISO.  One advantage to TAILS is that you can completely configure your Trezor features offline.  TAILS can only go online IF you provide wireless connection details to your LAN (or if you plug in the ethernet on a wired desktop machine).  By mounting a TAILS USB you can simply connect the Trezor, use a terminal and type trezorctl with the instruction command following.  EASY.e.g. open terminal and type:trezorctl get-featuresIf you are new you do NOT have to use trezorctl but can setup your Trezor T and might use Trezor Suite instead.  THEN you can add advanced features such as wipe PIN or SD encrypt using trezorctl.  Once those features are enabled you can resume using Suite and all enabled features still work fine.  I setup up my Trezors using trezorctl because I like to do the seed creation and related stuff OFFLINE.  Just my take on this.Trying to be helpful here.  I am going to paste in some simple command stuff that I use.  There are more commands but you will see this is simple stuff.  Hope this helps some that might have been shy to install the software, but might like to try it.https://wiki.trezor.io/Using_trezorctl_commands_with_Trezor** Bitcoin-only firmware - NO SUDO NEEDEDPlace Trezor in bootloader modetrezorctl firmware-update --bitcoin-onlyVerify valid signatureConfirm the action on your Trezor device----- ** Show CURRENT configuration of Trezor:trezorctl get-features-----** Initialize device:Create DEFAULT Trezor wallet with PIN protection of desired SEED length.[This command initializes the device and generates a new seed after the new firmware is installed.]12 word SEEDtrezorctl reset-device -t 128 --pin-protection24 word SEEDtrezorctl reset-device -t 256 --pin-protection-----** Self Destruct PINtrezorctl set wipe-codedisable the wipe code: sudo trezorctl set wipe-code -r------** Turn on SD Protection - Trezor Ttrezorctl device sd-protect enabletrezorctl device sd-protect disabletrezorctl device sd-protect refresh-----** Wiping the Trezor device[This command removes all private data but not firmware -- NOT in bootloader mode]trezorctl wipe-device[If the device is in bootloader mode and the option --bootloader is called, it will erase both the user data and firmware.]trezorctl wipe-device --bootloader-----** Recover Trezor device:[recover Trezor, set PIN, pick 12,18,24 words, allow 4 characters only during entering SEED words]trezorctl recovery-device --pin-protection --words 24 --expandThis is absolutely easy stuff.-----",
