  "content": "I saw a locked 🔐 post from 2021 which I found interesting, and want to share how it has been helpful to me by expanding my knowledge about this forum.The OP (@HridoyHk_5), was addressing the issue of multiple accounts and also, urging members of the forum to avoid using multiple accounts which ofcourse is a good advise, check out the post; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377591.msg58755798#msg58755798But then, unfortunately for the OP he was found guilty of same topic he created and advice he was dishing as he was found to be connected to various accounts. Check out these comments; @Lovesmayfamilis connected the OP to two (2) accounts, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377591.msg58761302#msg58761302while @YOSHIE further connected the OP to six (6) accounts, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377591.msg58765496#msg58765496LOL!Reading the comments and checking out the evidences against the OP was quite embarrassing, and I’m sure the OP was filled with so much embarrassment in front of his screen while seeing how he’s been caught in the act he was advising others on. This is just a perfect example of shooting oneself with their own hand. Nevertheless, this has been quite helpful to me as it has educated me that there’s nothing hidden under the sun and there are ways around fishing out defaulters in this forum. It set an example for me and has also taught  me on how not to be careless on the forum and has also made me bury any thoughts of doing anything that may in turn, one way or the other, lead to my account being flagged. I hope other new members will learn from this and protect their accounts from any form of distrust.I Learned.",

It’s not as easy for bounty hunters to grow an account so they resort to other means like buying accounts and exchanging merits between their alts. “As they say everyday for the thief, one day for the owner”. It’s okay to have multiple accounts, just don’t exchange merits between them and do not participate in the same campaign. You can even give a neutral tag to your alt so people know it’s you.  You don’t have to wait for a moderator, you can delete your posts by yourself.",

It’s a honest mistake and you won’t get into any trouble for something like this. I have reported the other post as a duplicate, I’m sure a mod will delete it soon.",

      "body": "When I went through the thread OP referred us to, it was very funny. @HridoyHk_5  was part of the perceived problem he wants to solve. He intended to get some merits but he ended up getting enough bashing that kept him mum until the thread was locked. There is no need to claim who you are not because it will always lead to lying. And a lie will always need another lie to make it look legit. But I have learned that lies don't last, they will definitely be uncovered one day. Saying the truth might have some consequences but it also shows that you have a good reputation. Lying might look like a temporal solution but its negative consequences are long-lasting. It is always good to learn from people's pitfalls so that you will not make the same mistake.",

The only thing he would feel is \"regret\" and not for his action rather for not covering his track properly... As a cheater there is a 100% chance that he'll surely return back to the forum with a new account and he still won't stop the unethical things he was caught doing with his previous accounts.The Op of that thread is a clear example of a Hypocrite.QuoteIt set an example for me and has also taught  me on how not to be careless on the forum and has also made me bury any thoughts of doing anything that may in turn, one way or the other, lead to my account being flagged. As long as you're not doing anything unethical then you won't even be bothered by topics like this, only those that have skeletons in their cupboard would be disturbed whenever their name get mentioned in a thread that has to do with investigation. Trust me Op if you continue topics like this it will only draw attention to yourself and you'll be added to accounts that would soon be scrutinized by forum members, expect it soon though but if you have nothing to hide then there's nothing to fear...To be sincere Op I don't think this is a topic that deserves a new thread. When I saw that the title had \"learn\" and \"relearn\" in it I expected some kind of a tutorial from a newbie account or a perhaps a more interesting topic. The only thing I got from this thread is ---> Cheat but be smart.",

      "body": "Having an alt account isn't a crime in the forum but it isn't advisable to do such in the forum,but the problem lies when you abuse the merit system by exchanging merits with your accounts or participating in the same signature campaign. One thing that I see with human is that we are hypocrite and we act as if we are innocent of what we are advising people not to do. One needs to be careful with his forum activities so that you don't break the forum rules to avoid you losing interest in your account.",
