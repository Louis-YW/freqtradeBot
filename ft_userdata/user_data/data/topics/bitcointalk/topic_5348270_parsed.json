  "content": "I have recently stumbled in a few tweets regarding the Lightning Network. I am always been a LN fan, and I have a long history of reporting on various metrics, and I would like to start again. First, an overview of the network so far:The brown has been exponential, considering also that BTC has increased in value.Looking at the LN capacity we see that much of the grow has been registered on the last few weeks. Growth has gone parabolic:If we look at the following graph we have a detail on the balances added during the last months:Of course, adding 250 BTC of capacity when BTC is at 30k is totally a different story than adding 300 BTC capacity when BTCUSD trades at 8,000 as in March 2019.So, pretty a neat increase in capacity. Just wondering if the real usage of such capacity is gaining traction. I guess the “low” fees in the main chain are not pushing adoption, but it’s important to invest in this invisible assets.I will try do add news, reports and commentaries about LN to this thread as soon as they are available or worth mentioning.

'others' may use bob to route to starbucks. thus diluting the dave outbound to starbucks even morechuck doesnt just have bob and dave as partners. 'others' may use chuck to route to starbucks. thus diluting the dave outbound starbucks even more..point being if you know that 50% of the network only has $200 capacity..then you can work out that alot of outbounds are going to get exhausted very quickly(average $2 payment = exhausted in 100 payments)(average $4 payment = exhausted in 50 payments)(average $8 payment = exhausted in 25 payments)(average $20 payment= exhausted in 10 payments)you can also work out if you know it will cost about $3 lock-in and $3 unlock of a onchain fee.. thats $6 of the $200 the people will want to recoup even to allow their balance to be used by othersso you can work out that as a minimum break even (logic/common sense) they are going to charge 3% fee($6 of $200=3%)heck.. you can then do some math. if you know the average is 3 hops to the destinationyou can work out that it ends up costing the spender 9% (3% per hop)so you start to get a picture about how expensive it is within LN compared to just buying coffee onchain vs buying a single $80 giftcard via fiatso yea there is alot you can learn from knowing what the majority of the networks channel liquidity is. even without knowing each precise paymentheck if you know that some 'lightning pizza' promotion is being done for $25 of pizzayou know that the network will start showing massive amounts of payment failures within 8 payments along routes('fold' lightning pizza' experiment had 90% payment failure rate)https://decrypt.co/5321/folds-bitcoin-lightning-pizza-turns-out-to-have-been-a-success",

Ah! Not at all, this experiment would be pronte to the “Chamberlain argument”!I know the subject has been debated many times. But still there is a lot of issues on the matter.I think it’s very useful if a payment system is centralised/decentralised/peer-to-peer. Each of those network structures has a set of features, there might not exists an absolute winner. But honestly recognising the status of the network could be the first step for an analysis. Having said that:After 4 years from launch the 90% of the liquidity is provided by 1% of the nodes. I hardly see any explaination of why this should be the product of free market, rather than a sort of accident, whose causes and effect I ignore.Given the above structure, and the stability of the capacity of the median channel, I struggle thinking LN is gaining traction. Something I think it would be a net positive effect. I don’t think this centralisation is a problem. It is very similar to the hash power being concentrated at 90% in China: did I like it? No, of course. Was it a problem? Not at all: when China “banned bitcoin” mothers network readjusted by itself. Something probably would happen if the 1% of node would drain their liquidity overnight. Which is the best measure for network decentralisation? Capacity? Network usage? Transaction numbers? Which of those metrics can help us assess the LN success and how reliable are them?",

Probably mostly the latter. Seems like natural behavior, some will be purely speculative/service oriented, while others will be rich people who already use Bitcoin for their business payments taking advantage of the cheaper tx fees.Until a large proportion of merchants and regular people start to use the liquidity (and add their own), the network will continue to be balanced this way.",

For now it's more of a concern.  It's all about potential.  Centralised points of failure aren't generally perceived as a problem until they fail.  So it's better if something could be done to encourage a wider distribution of the load.  But what that \"something\" might be, I sadly have no idea.  Hopefully it's something that happens organically through market forces and competition, but there's no way to tell right now.Something things do have to go wrong before people adjust their behaviour.  When mistakes happen, some people learn right away and change their habits, while others don't.  But gradually, over time, there are fewer central points of failure and the whole thing becomes more resilient.  A similar situation could arise here.  If any of these major nodes have failures, people may be more likely to use smaller nodes in future.All I can suggest is keep a close eye on it, see what develops, then make contingency plans if it looks like it's getting worse.",

You have to dig in at the individual route then look at a more macro view over time to set your fees and know where to put your sats.
