Get a good plan together. Thinking about putting up ads for your visitors? If yes, what kind? Also, are you thinking of using affiliate links? It's all stuff to consider as you work on your faucet site. Once you've got that sorted, then you can start thinking about the technical and other details.",

      "body": "Faucet businesses can be profitable only if you run with some cheap but known coins. With Bitcoin, you won't make any money for sure. Also a lot depends on what kind of advertisements you want to show. Nowadays, you won't find a lot of advertising companies who pays out in Bitcoin. Also I don't think goggle adsense will give you approval for a faucet website. Also a lot of scripts can be found in the market which will run faucet websites for the users but no view will be counted due to strong as blocker. In long term, faucet is not a business you will prefer running.",

This business is not profitable anymore since no one is interested to do captcha in exchange for a penny reward. The reason for this is because there’s a lot of cryptocurrency choices now and cryptocurrency is already grow a lot in price compared before when crypto is still on the early syage and everyone is optimistic that the price will grow someday even though we are just claiming a penny before. Cryptocurrency already reached the stage which it’s price is already discovered.You might spend more on your faucet setup especially the hosting fees compared to the amount of profit you can get on your captcha and banner ads posted on your website. There’s no harm in trying though. I will gladly use your faucet when it’s already out but as a businessman, I don’t see any good profit on this plan.",

What do I need to learn about?  Apart from faucets there is also another method known as an airdrop, both of which have almost the same function to complete a few steps to get a prize. Now why aren't many people talking about it anymore because the potential profit from these two methods is quite small, so people prefer to find ways to invest or trade even if they use their own funds which are a little limited. For investments, we know the DCA term that can be applied and we can take advantage of small financial conditions to collect it.If you intend to develop a faucet, maybe what you need to do is try to monetize the faucet site and after that place advertisements or videos that have user interest. Lastly you have to make sure that your site doesn't look like a scam so that people don't feel worried about joining and other things you might be able to learn with experienced people because there are lots of suggestions they can give you.",

Years ago they were the best ways for you to earn bitcoin since not only are the reward blocks higher, but at the same time bitcoin is lower in value they can just give out money willy-nilly. 2016-18 is what I would consider the golden era of faucets as these were the times when bitcoin faucets are still relatively generous when it comes to rewards, but at the same time there's real value and relevance in bitcoin's part already, which makes it even more enticing to push for faucets like this.

The rewards is still the same in fiat value because I remember claiming sats back then that is totally negligible too. The price of Bitcoin just explode now that’s why the value in sats is very low while the fiat value is still the same low amount. Faucet is just a micro earning even before. People nowadays is just very lazy to claim very they knew that there’s a slim chance for the Bitcoin price pump hard to make their little satoshi valuable.",

What do I need to learn about? Claiming a faucet requires the user to wait for an x amount of time and complete a captcha. The reason for that is that the faucet site inserts an advertisement on the claim page or the whole site. Since that advertising is usually paid by views, the amount the owner receives might be used to pay the claimant.With that in mind, you should calculate how much you can get paid per view, and estimate how many users you may be able to get. Also, you should also remember to make an anti-bot or cheat system. I believe it is a kind of complex project, yet, the profit opportunity is minuscule.Quote from: KiaKia on August 18, 2023, 11:15:18 AMLastly, what advice do you have for my goal?

What do I need to learn about? Lastly, what advice do you have for my goal? I don't think faucet today makes sense. Faucet earning is actually really simple. You earn very small amount of popular currencies in faucets and then if you are lucky enough one day those coins will get pumped and reach at a decent level and obviously at that time you'll feel that faucet was actually worth it. Unfortunately such a thing isn't really practical for top cryptos now because even faucet providers know how far can bitcoin go so actually they will give you peanuts which can never really become big money. Your best bet is to receive faucet money in a hidden gem of a crypto which tomorrow becomes a big blockbuster.",

On top of that, Bitcoin was worth way less back then, and it wasn't seen as an investment as much as it is now. Thus, they were paying tremendous amounts of BTC, which were then worth a few pennies at most. It was actually my starting point for cryptocurrencies as well, from which I managed to accumulate a relatively decent amount of BTC for today's standards, some of which I held until a few years ago.Nowadays, the majority of Bitcoin faucets have shut down because people lost interest in them because the payout was extremely insignificant. On top of that, most faucets were kept running through donations and advertisements, and since Bitcoin was considered a valuable asset, people stopped donating, and as I've mentioned earlier, people lost interest in them; thus, ad revenue was pretty much nonexistent. FreeBitco.in is still functioning but paying as little as 2 satoshi per roll; thus, it's a waste of time.",
