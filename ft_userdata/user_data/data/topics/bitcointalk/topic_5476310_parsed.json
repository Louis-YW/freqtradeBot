      "body": "I bet on lottery few times because the lotto outlet is very far on my location but I’m always betting on my regular number such as my birthday and some birthday numbers related to someone very close to me as a good luck bet. Choosing numbers is what makes lottery betting special since you can be proud to yourself if you won using your own choice of number. Letting a machine decide on what number to bet is just like tossing money without enjoying it. Winning in lottery is harder than being hit by a lightning strike twice so why not enjoy the betting experience given that our chance of winning is very small. At least you have a little fun and excitement.PS: The sample picture of lottery card is very nostalgic since that our local lottery ticket.  Been ages since I touch one of those.",

      "body": "Eitherway would be valid given that luck is the determinant of the winning combination. However, I understand those who are betting for birth dates, special even in their life, and such with  corresponding number 'coz that's their belief and there's nothing wrong with it. For them it would help them get a winning bet sinply because they value those numbers but will never guarantee winning, same as with machine generated combinations. They know to themselves that if they are not lucky then no matter how many times they try then they won't still win but using their special numbers just simply makes their bet special. Just think of how happy they would be using a number they really think of.",

(sarcasm, I know some places won't play...but they are few)There are all types of lotteries, those that have selection samples, from 0-99 numbers, from 0-999, and so on in that sequence what they imagine they can do in the possible combinations and in that idea, some people tend to stay with their combinations over time, but, maintaining them or changing them does not improve or worsen the probability.In my case I practically don't play lotteries, but when I do it happens in the 100 number lottery and the 1000 lottery, in which I always play the same number, but such a strategy has not worked.",

We do not get to choose the numbers we want to gamble on. Here the lottery consist on small gambling cartoons which are pre-printed and distributed all around the country for people to buy and store until the day of the number drawing. Here we cannot walk in a gambling agency and choose numbers, just buy how many cartons as we wish. And keeping in mind they can be as expensive as a couple of flour kilos, people often opt for only buying one or two. If  people had the chance to choose, they would do it very often here, because superstition and folk religion here. People who dream with numbers go and pick up the cartoon there they can see those they dreamt of.",

Well, I have to agree that lottery is very popular in our country, and most of the bettor have their own numbers that are betting since then and yes you can be addict with that which you will not realize since the price is just small if you think. I do bet in lottery with the same number though but I rarely bet due to the fact that I don’t have much time to go to the lottery vendor because of the conflict in working hours.",

It is really just that you are just betting on random numbers whereas other people do really bet on their personal choice numbers on which general essence on which you are just basically doing the same. When it comes to how big you do spend on tickets then this is where it would vary on which it do really give out those kind of difference in between bettors because purchasing ticket might really be that cheap but when it do piles up then it would really be that becoming that big.So its still not a thing that you should really be ignoring on.",
