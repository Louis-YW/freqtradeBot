Ironfish dev team is running a testnet rewards phase where miners and contributors earn Testnet points which will be proportionally distributed among Testnet participants as mainnet Ironfish tokens at launch.For those who don't know, Ironfish is a new in-development privacy layer blockchain that is aiming to be for crypto what SSL is for the web. This includes multi-asset bridging with other crypto blockchains. Mainnet launch is early 2023 (moved from November 2022). Phase 1 and Phase 2 (ongoing) testnet reward points will be exchangeable for mainnet IRON at launch. The founder, Elana Nadolinksi, is a former Microsoft employee with expertise in blockchain privacy. Their general counsel, Craig Timm, is a former BOA and DOJ employee. The project has received nearly 30 million in funding from investors.
