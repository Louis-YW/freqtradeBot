  "content": "Good day to all the members in this forum, maybe I should start our conversation with the questions we will discuss. First question, is it possible to ban Binance in the Philippines? According to the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) there is a group or organization called INFRAWATCH PH that issued a letter to the BSP saying that one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world should be banned or suspended. Because it doesn't have a license to operate in our country, and if your gonna take a look at it, they are right. Because in order for you to be an official company related to exchange or virtual assets, you need to have a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) and there are always associated requirements before you can have a license to operate in the Philippines. And some of the licenses here are Coinsph, PDAX and Paymaya which will soon be able to buy and sell crypto.According to Binance, they have not yet formally received the letter about banning them here in the Philippines. And they are also ready                  to discuss about this matter because they are also ready to get a VASP license or even an E-money license.And as far as I know, last June the CEO and Founder of Binance visited here and they plan to expand here in our country, and they also plan to provide a scholarship program and eventually the graduates will be able to work in the Binance company.According to the SEC (Security Exchange Commission), Binance is also not registered but they are monitoring it despite the fact that other investigations are still being conducted not only here but also in other countries such as France and the U.S. That is why because of these events the value of their BNB token was affected.So far we have not really heard any Final updates on these events, because at the present time now we can still use Binance here in our country whether we want to transfer it via Coinsph, Gcash, or Bank account that we have. And I just hope that Binance will not be banned in our country because there are also many users here in our country.

From all you've said, I don't think the ban will happen, Binance is already a very big exchange and any licenses they need to continue their operation in Philippines would be to hard for them to get I believe, we all know that the Binance CEO, CZ, is a very hard working man and also a man devoted to his business and the expansion and adoption of cryptocurrencies, He would definitely go to any length to make sure no ban happens, and also considering the fact that Binance have a lot of users from Phillipines, this will serve as a motivation for CZ to make sure the ban does not happen, so put your mind at rest.",

The same also in Singapore, they've been stopped there but eventually has to come back CMIIW. But as said, it's like a proposal and it's not yet official. And even its government allow it to hppen, Binance will do something to change that decision will all their might and that's how powerful they are as a business.",

I might be wrong.Binance has already a lot of traders and users in the Philippines already and I would say that they are one of the top crypto exchanges already. So it will be big lost for Filipino crypto traders. But for sure Binance will not go down without any fight here. I mean they will just have to comply with the new BSP rule to be able to stay in the PH market. And with that, I don't think that they will get the ban hammer in Philippines which is one of the crypto friendly countries in Asia.",

Binance is a centralized exchange. Anything centralized is under the full mercy of regulation. However I do not think that the Philippines will be introducing any bans on Binance as they could have already done so. Just because there are now people who are calling them out on not running \"by the book\" in a certain country. We should not panic too early on this matter. Binance is probably the most careful exchange I know. Even the SEC itself has not raised any alarms yet.",

Banning binance on Philippines will just give a bad image to its people that their country is not crypto friendly so I don't think that BSP will really do it.",

I assume Binance would do something about it if they were urged about it or maybe even doing it now, just that it may not be a top priority since again, they weren't really being rushed to comply. Reading the article, it seems like CZ is already on talks about getting the license/s needed for Binance here. From OP's 2nd articleQuoteJust last week, the founder of Binance, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao was in the Philippines to discuss his company’s expansion. He mentioned that Binance is  interested to acquire a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license and the e-money (EMI) license.",

For example, they have also been responsible for calling on their government to fix lots of stuff in the road, power and mining, housing, telecom, and water sector as I read on their website. Binance should secure the necessary licenses to operate in the Philippines just as it has done in other countries where they operate. I feel they are just looking out for their people.

On just common sense where Binance isnt a company that had been operating on Philippines which does simply means they cant really impose ban or something like that and even if they dothen they cant just simply stop on making use of that P2P feature which is something that cant really be traced up.Plus if they would really be making ISP on blocking binance thenwe know on how VPN works thats why its meaningless even if they would really be banning or prohibiting it since people could really still make use of it without being caught.Seems like PH is trying out to ban crypto overall soon and the one who had been seated on the government is really against crypto now?",
