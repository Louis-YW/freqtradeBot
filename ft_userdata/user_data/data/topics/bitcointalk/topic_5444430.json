I'm tired of watching these circus.Theymos, can you make a rules so that: - only users starting from senior member are allowed voting into contests?- only users with minimum 5 years of profile are allowed voting into contests?Quote from: nutildah on February 17, 2025, 03:09:44 PMI laughed pretty hard at this. From the Bitcointalk Awards thread:Quote from: Uhwuchukwu53 on February 17, 2025, 09:25:03 AMCode:Help Buster: Lovesmayfamilis Despite being a woman, her outstanding commitment in making the forum a better place by revealing AI texts, spambots, scammers, alts accounts and more.\"Despite their gender handicap, this person does a pretty good job.\"OK that's enough forum for today.So what? Some unknown full member praised someone. Now it's a whole event worthy of this solemn ceremony?How many years have I been sitting on this forum and I don't know this noname Uhwuchukwu53. Who that suspicious noname user which is praising a his own target? This unknown full member Uhwuchukwu53 was registered in 2023 and his opinion is already so weighty that the great and terrible nutildah himself quoted him. It's very suspiciousI get the impression that these protégés are praising their main alts in these votes.",

Or do you think people don't have alts accounts that are up to 5yrs old? Because the same way you claim people have alts accounts that are 2yrs old, that's the same way those same people are likely to have alt accounts that are up to 3,4,5 and even 10yrs old on this forum. Hence, after analyzing every bit of words O.P said on this thread, It's obvious he has a personal issue with Icopress and Lovesmayfamilis, because Uhwuchukwu53 was not the only one who voted for Lovesmayfamilis and wrote sweet words about her, so why single him out, if I must ask? And likewise, Icopress is not the only person to organize contest on this forum. So why should his become a problem? Hence, I will advise you O.P to go get a chilled bottle of Coke and Pizza to calm down your brain, because it seems you need it more than you need this forum.",
