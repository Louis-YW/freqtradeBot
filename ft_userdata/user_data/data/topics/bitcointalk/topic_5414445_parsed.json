I want to stay on the safe side and use a real address (not a fake one), so if anybody reading this has a PO Box or some other business address they don't mind PM'ing me, it will save me a lot of trouble. Thanks in advance.It will not be used for sending/receiving any mail, it is strictly for CAN-SPAM compliance purposes only.",
