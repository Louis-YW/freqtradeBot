Any of those altcoins can potentially lose their peg with Bitcoin, just like those so-called stablecoins can lose their peg with the USD. Do you remember the Terra(LUNA) and TerraUSD(UST) crash? When it comes to Bitcoin, there's only one true king, so why take unnecessary risks with these alternatives? It's best to stick with the original and not get caught up in the potential death spiral.",

Don't use either WBTC or BBTC simply because you are encouraging them to continue with this thinking, I wouldn't be surprised if you hear about BXXZCWBTC in the future. The idea of encapsulated tokens was the basis for facilitating bitcoin trading between different blockchains and linked to bridges.Due to the difficulty of managing smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain, a locking mechanism was invented through which to lock your bitcoins and obtain tokens of the same value as bitcoins, assuming that you will trust that the locking mechanism is always 1: 1.It seems that BBTC is trying to use the word Binance to convince people that the linkage is 1:1 maintained, but as long as you trust Binance to maintain the linkage, why not use the platform directly?If a problem happens to Binance, you will definitely not get anything, and if a problem happens to WBTC, you will definitely not get anything, you increase the risks and do not gain interest in exchange for it.",

I would say none of them, it's just ERC-20 token wrapped or pegged it's price to BTC.If there will be safe and more secure it will be the original BTC. Specially you mentioned Binance which is under attack from the US government. So it's really good to be very careful with this whole WBTC or BBTC or even Stable coins for now.So if I'm in your shoes, it's better to stay away from them, just saying.",
