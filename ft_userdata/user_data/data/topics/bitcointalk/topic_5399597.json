They're reputable, you can look them up online and see the reviews and they'll only take 20% if they manage to crack the wallet for you. Obviously, though, this is not going to work unless you have an idea about what the password might be (length, complexity).[1] https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/",

IF you run in to trouble then post publicly in this thread and we can help.Regardless of how you choose to progress though, the whole process will hinge on whether or not you have any idea of what the password could be. Is it likely to be a variant on a password you know, or is it likely to be something completely different? Do you have any idea if it follows some kind of structure, or would it just be completely random characters? How long might it be? Does it include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols, etc?Depending on how complex the password is, it could be crackable in a matter of minutes or it could be impossible to crack even in millions of years.",

Could also be malicious programs running on your machine or at least at the time the wallet was last accessed. Though, I wouldn't know enough about your exact circumstances.

When you restore your wallet and rescan, your node scanned the blocks it still had, found the relevant transactions, and updated your balance accordingly.If, however, the blocks containing the relevant transactions have been deleted from your hard disk because they were old enough to be pushed beyond your 10 GB limit, then obviously your node cannot scan those blocks because it no longer has them, and so it cannot update your balances and your wallet will continue to show the old balances, as has happened in OP's case. The solution to this is to turn off pruning, re-sync the entire blockchain, and then rescan. Or alternatively to export your private keys in to a wallet such as a Electrum.",
