Please delete old bumps if you are to make new ones.Anyway, about the service. I made a test purchase, so far so good. I haven't faced any issues yet. I like the fact that there are 4K and HEVC versions for most live chances so that in times when the internet connection isn't that good, the HEVC channel versions still run smoothly.",
