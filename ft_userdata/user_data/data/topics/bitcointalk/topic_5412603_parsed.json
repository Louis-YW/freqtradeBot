I assume that the same applies to BHW as well.I'm not a fan of spam and I certainly won't even consider such offers through DM, most often it ends with a report and block. but can you somehow prove the quality and functionality of your service? is it possible to measure your work?you should definitely include the negative effect of the spam campaign in the whole analysis.",
