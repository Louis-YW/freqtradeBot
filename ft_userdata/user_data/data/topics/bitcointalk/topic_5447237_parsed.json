      "body": "It is very simple to copy the signature code on computer or laptop directly using the mouse. It can be hard on mobile phone, but if you do not want it to be hard, you can start to copy the first and last words that are not in the signature code, copy them together with the signature code. Paste it and remove the first and the last word.The first word is 'code', while the last word will be the next rank, like 'senior member' rank.",

Managers would surely use it to announce their signature campaigns.It's not a bad idea, but us not a necessity either, it would only take a couple of seconds to copy it on a PC and a less than a minute on movie if you're used to doing it.",
