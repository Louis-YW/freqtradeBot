  "content": "Am trying to swap an altcoin for Bitcoin on my Trust Wallet app but I can not find that option. I can swap for other tokens but not bitcoin. But I get to find related tokens with bitcoin tags like Wrapped Bitcoin, BBTC, BTCB, and I know they are not bitcoin because none of the addresses are the real bitcoin kind of address. I can find bitcoin in Trust Wallet and can transfer same to my wallet from other wallets but why can I not swap another token to it like I can do with others on Trust Wallet? Am not looking to buy with fiat as that is the only option there. Does anyone know how I can overcome this?",

Swap is on chain transaction and mostly is done on the same chain. Convert means you make a conversion of your altcoin to Bitcoin (real Bitcoin) but have to pay conversion fee for that service.

Is there another way to do it? It is not difficult as you think if you have wrapped BTC or any other tokens, your choice of chain is arbitrary but fees should be your number one scale of preference. Most exchanges accept wrapped tokens be it BTC, coins or tokens, click on the deposit and you will see a drop-down menu of any blockchain they support, the popular ones are Ethereum, Solana, and Binance smart chain.But do you really need wrapped BTC? It is stress and workload with all these conversions and swaps.",

As you can see from the https://www.github.com/thorswap, they can fork their idea but I don't think there is a need to swap real Bitcoin to wrapped bitcoin, holders don't need it except the lenders and some decentralized finance who used it to bridge between blockchains and another reason I think Trust wallet wouldn't copy that idea is that native and wrapped bitcoin is already available in Binance, doing that on trust wallet is will be pushing some users from Binance especially those who don't want KYC.",
