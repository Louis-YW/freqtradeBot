Personally I don't believe any of this premise. What I believe is that it doesn't matter whether you are an A student or have a high IQ. Rather it's about having the courage to venture into unchattered territories, including taking calculated risk and making the most of the opportunities that lead to high income. In our society today and in the past, the people who have demonstrated audacity and capitalized on privileged advantages to undertake risky yet lucrative business ideas are the ones who end up being of great influence and earn more.

Because you have the knowledge to read and pass and become exceptionally known to be very brilliant in class, it does not translate to having exposure, opportunity and the ability to earn money more.

Do you agree?This is motivational. All are motivational. If you are not that good in class, you still have hope that you can be rich which is not wrong and it is the truth. Because you are not brilliant in school, that does not mean you are not talented in other aspect of life. But I agree with you, with self-discipline included.",

Do you agree?fastercapital.com/startup-topic/Taking-Calculated-Risks.htmlAnd that's what really happens nowadays. Mostly those students who excel in their class before are having a hard time to find a job, to do business or let's say they are facing the real world very hard while student C excel in Businesses and work, sometimes those people who didn't finish their colleges are usually ended up being a successful entrepreneur and earning a lot than a person who has a degree being a corporate slave. I'm not saying you shouldn't study, but if you look at it, It serves as a motivation. We can't predict a person's future based on their academic skills and grades, it's all about how you can face the real world after your study.",

Well in as much as I ascribe to that but not in totality to say that being an A student or having high IQ doesn't matter because it does matter at least to have high IQ. Those who have high IQ despite not going to formal education but are more sharpened by the native intelligence they have and that is even why they would venture undoubtfully into grounds that are still untapped and infertile but yet making out a niche from it. If you don't have IQ then you won't be able to succeed in the first place.Also, for those who didn't go to formal educational institutions before becoming rich and wealthy have also found the necessity to be educationally intune with the current happenings and in old age, they have equipped theirselves with enough educational qualifications too. So a C student who wasn't able to get to A student academically, it doesn't mean they are bereaved of intelligence quotient and that is also why anyone that applies either educational prowess or IQ has chances of financial success and if combined, the sky is your limit.In reality, the time has come for more people with IQ to uplift their financial status with the bitcoin halving bull around the corner.",

Do you agree?Absolutely yess. In academics, being smart indeed earns good grades and a diploma. However, in business, intelligence alone isn't sufficient... you need mental strength, initiative, consistency, a tolerance for significant risks, discipline, and many other factors that contribute to success in business. The law of the jungle truly applies in the business world, and even those with a lot of money might not easily find success in business.The \"high risk, high gain\" principle still holds in the business world. However, significant risk is not usually taught in the educational system. That's why people who excel academically often fear taking risks and opt for the safer path as employees rather than entrepreneurs.",

Do you agree?fastercapital.com/startup-topic/Taking-Calculated-Risks.htmlThe more risk taker you are then you are really that giving yourself the chance on being much better compared to those who are playing safe or really just that basically that contented on having or sticking into their own work/jobs or ventures.Whereas to those who had taken up further risks then they would really be having that chance on even more successful although it does impose risks but probabilities is there.Academic achievements wont really be a guaranteed ticket to success, yes you are really that an A+ student with having those good degree records and achievements but ending up on getting a job which do pay standard. To those who are on average who did have made out some business or startup then gradually they could really be able to advance. It might take long but at leastthey are really doing steps to success.Success would be really be depending on someones steps or actions that be made on. Sometimes you would really be needing to go out into your comfort zone for you to be ableto make yourself that something better or having those kind of possibilities on making yourself that progressive or else you would really be just that stagnant.",

It also refers to a study that says graduates of the most competitive colleges earn 19% more than those of other colleges.Here's another article about a report that higher level of education correlates with higher employment rate and is strongly linked with higher annual income.Of course, it's also important to recognize the limitations of relying on the data from one country (USA, in this case).

But of course, since you'll never know what will happen to you in the future, it's better to have a \"back up\" of having a degree. At least even if you won't be that successful, you have your degree for you to find a stable job. It just gives you more assurance that you can earn for yourself. But overall, there are people who are academically smart and there are street smart. Also, most successful people have their own business, but not everyone have that skill to run a business successfully. On the other hand, academically smart people still gives them advantage to find success in the future even if it's not about starting their own business because they have the brain that can contribute to their field. It will just all depends on one's opportunity in life.",

Because here the aspect discussed is mainly material, so I will make the issue of intellectual success the most important.Obviously competition and greed make us not know what the meaning of life is, and instead of accepting what we did wrong, we find ways to justify it. If we start from the same point and are raised equally, the results we receive will only be a nuance.

There are different types of students and amongst them, there's those who do better than others and are tagged \"very intelligent\" whole there's those known as the dullards. Well, educationally, they may not be sound but that does not mean the end for them.

Why, because that person doesn't stop when they fail, but keeps trying while fixing previous mistakes. People like this certainly don't know the word give up and are the type who fight until the end. There are 2 types of people, type 1 works and accepts what he gets, is afraid to take risks and continues at that job until he is old. The second type of person is not satisfied with what he gets and keeps trying something he is pursuing until he gets it. From here we know that the benchmarks for a person's success are different and financial success depends on how we respond to things and how we can gain financial freedom.",

Although I admit that there are some successful people who come from poor educational backgrounds, in general people who have a good education will have a higher chance of competing and getting a better job.That's right, most of high-risk businesses also provide high profits. But do you believe that more people succeed in high-risk businesses than those who fail? I think it is safer if we create a business that has low risk, when we have financial stability then we try to create a business that has high risk. Going all in in a high risk business is very dangerous, we have to play it safe because doing business is not an easy thing. As far as I know, in theory business looks easy, buy cheap and sell at a high price, but in practice it is very difficult",
