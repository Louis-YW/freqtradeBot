  "content": "Hello all,Recently I've signed up for Firefox Relay paid service, which allows me to create unlimited amount of e-mail addresses on mozmail.com domain. So I can use one address per website.So I've changed my e-mail on bitcointalk account to ***@mozmail.com. No other website has this e-mail, its unique to bitcointalk. My e-mail address has never been public, it's hidden in my profile, I've never given it away to anyone or published it anywhere. I only use it to login to my bitcointalk account.Today, to my great surprise, I've received two spam e-mail to this inbox.Subject: WhiteList & Benefits (Wallet Searcher Team)From: \"whitelist@walletsearcher.pro [via Relay]\" <replies@relay.firefox.com>QuoteWallet Searcher CorpWALLET SEARCHER - MINING 3.0 RELEASEWe present you an Unique Software that combines:Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - POWER: working through cloud serversÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - INTELLIGENCE: 3 completely innovative algorithmic systemÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - SIMPLICITY: convenience limit, the minimum entry threshold Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - VARIABILITY: 4 types of different blockchains, from BTC to BNB Thanks to your active participation in the projects of our Partners, You were Â be included in the WHITELIST of Wallet Searcher Software!(...)QuoteSPECIAL BENEFITSSince you are a member of WL, you take:0.5 BNB to your Wallet Searcher Account, 12 hours of testing our SW, with a full Bitcoin blockchain search version!Alternate textWL Activation for YOU \"***\"To activate WL, as well as learn about WL, you need to go to the Telegram Group, and write to the Administrator Â that we gave you above.Detailed information(FAQ) you can find in our Bot or in Telegram group.You are Welcome!Â ðŸ‘‡Â JOIN NOW\"Everything complicated is actually simple, a successful life is closer than you think.

      "body": "OP, this is very unlikely to happen in bitcointalk. I doubt theymos would ever sell the email addresses database. That would be ridiculous. Unless the forum database got hacked, I'm sure that theymos will never sell them to any service. You would be glad to know that theymos recently even stopped on forum ads too. Forum has more than enough funds to survive for a long time unless BTC price gets dropped significantly.Quote from: crypto_curious on October 06, 2022, 01:38:49 PMIf bitcointalk staff are reading this, be honourable and don't delete this message - don't ban my account trying to hide itTheymos practices \"freedom of speech \" as much as possible. You won't be banned, man.Quote from: rat03gopoh on October 06, 2022, 01:59:52 PMDoes it contain a crypto-related premium name, like bitcoin@mozmail or something?

It's because Op has shared their email publicly while thinking that they had hidden the email address.",

Fortunately, the OP has a way to create unlimited e-mails, so the fix for his problem is more than simple (I hope)",

I was reading OP and wondering what's going on. I was even thinking possible ways to get the emails like having the DB hacked or bots are scrapping emails or there are such email generators which work automatically and generates email address. Most of the times they get invalid emails though. Success rate is too low. And then I read this response before checking the profile LOLIt's still public :-POP go here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=547217;sa=accountLook for \"Hide email address from public?\"And mark it active then press the \"Change profile\" button.

Thanks, I can rely on you guys as always. I've checked from private session of the browser, and my e-mail was hidden so I didn't dig deeper. But indeed, option to hide e-mail address has not been checked in my profile, so passive viewers can't see my e-mail, but logged-in users can! So someone has copied my e-mail by hand, or harvested if from my profile and now spam comes.
