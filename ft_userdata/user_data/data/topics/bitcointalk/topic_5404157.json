  "content": "Hello everyone,I am not a legendary member of the forum and also I am not really active here. Nevertheless, I read along regularly. Today there was an incident on the German-speaking board that I would like to clarify. There is a small group of users around the user Unknown01 who have been spreading Russian propaganda and trivializing the war in Ukraine for some time now. Lies are openly posted and war crimes are denied. I didn't want to watch this disgrace any longer and joined the discussion today. I confronted the user and asked him how he justifies some Russian war crimes of the last days and posted a few links. Of course, the user did not reply to my post, but insulted me as a fake account and threatened me that theymos will ban me soon if I continue to express my opinion (that there are war crimes of course). He also said that he already has a list for of \"suspicious\" accounts that refute his Russian propaganda and that he wants banned by theymos. In short: I'm told to either shut up or get banned by the admins.How can it be that a user with a higher rank can oppress a user in such a way? Can I really be banned for contradicting the lies he posts?The User Unknown01 is supported by his friends s0nix and MinoRaiola who sent positive feedback to each other without any reason other than to make their account look better.Quote for reference:Please use Google translate.Quote from: Unknown01 on June 26, 2022, 04:14:55 PMQuote from: Kamix on June 26, 2022, 04:03:09 PMDa ist man seit langem mal im Forum unterwegs... unfassbar was Putin Trolle bei Bitcointalk verbreiten. Eine Schande für die Bitcoin Community...Quote from: Unknown01 on June 26, 2022, 03:27:59 PMKeine Ahnung also was sich unsere Kasperln denken? Wenn man neutral die Situation betrachtet gibt es keinen einzigen Kanzler/Präsidenten  auf unserer Seite der es annähernd körperlich oder geistig mit Putin aufnehmen könnte. Toll, dass die Herren sich aufjedenfall amüsieren können.Was bist du für ein erbärmlicher Putin Troll. Dir kann man nur wünschen, dass du das Leid was die Ukrainer erleben selbst durchmachen müsstest...Deine Posthistorie strotzt nur vor Lügen. Wander doch nach Russland aus.

There's no way you will get banned just because you have shared your opinion. There's nothing wrong with that.I don't know why would he say something like this. Why would even he threaten you? If someone doesn’t like other opinion, they can simply \"ignore\" the user.Nevermind, have you broken any rules? If no, I would say please move on. That would be good for both.",

      "body": "I can confirm that the threat happened against Kamix and Unknown01 completely lost his mind. Unknown01 is involved in various shenanigans against established accounts and new accounts. I fact, he's taking the German section hostage with his Off-Topic shitposts and baseless accusations. However: I think that there is no chance at all that @Kamix will be banned because Kamix didn't break any rule. Kamix is a friendly account from our German section. If there would be a ban, Unknown01 would be first. Unknown01 is providing no value to the forum and now he's starting to attack new accounts.

The rest.. is just cheap talk. Believe it or not, freedom of speech (like on this forum) also means that some will say that Putin is great (even if every sane person knows that he's just another war criminal) and their posts are allowed.

You have to either grow a thicker skin, either press the ignore link. As simple as that.The problem of these accounts spreading Putin propaganda in the German section: they are thinking they can abuse Bitcointalk for their agenda and post their nonsense without receiving harsh opposition for their inhuman hot takes. They are derailing our local board. That's what's wrong and we have talked to them whats wrong about it. They aren't listening and instead now, they are threatening Newbies with bans (which is funny because troll accounts don't have any power to ban anyone, their lack of forum rules, DT and other stuff is apalling)Yes, it's not only limited to propaganda spam but also to giving out positive trust to other troll accounts, which is deeply concerning in my opinion because it's not how positive trust should be used. Such feedbacks should be neutral, see here. Quote from: Nestade on June 26, 2022, 05:00:19 PMDon't worry... as long as you haven't broken any rules, you can ignore the user's empty threats. He has no clue about the forum's rules (and that is why he constantly breaks them himself). However his bad behaviour (especially against a newbie) and that of his colleagues really damage the reputation (of the forum's German section), which is unfortunate. Their behaviour already lead to the imminent closure of the German \"Corona-Thread\".Actually it's quite funny that exactly this user who is not unknown for his off-topic shitposts threatens you with a ban.Exactly! The accounts mentioned by OP aren't contributing any value, have no forum rules awareness, know nothing about DT, are just spamming 24/7 our German section and now also attacking Newbie accounts.  They are not beneficial for Bitcointalk.",

I did not see his recent activities (may consider a look) but the name sounds familiar to me and I get the feel that he is not a shit poster. Anyway, I will look at his post history shortly before making any bad assumption.Is that me only seeing another complain in local board after the Arabic section? Feels me so many hates and bad arguments in local boards between homies.",

Now Unknown01 accuses me and 1miau with a neutral trust to be alts without any valid evidence except that we're using the same language (and probably both of us are breathing air). Yes, Unknown01 is so clueless. He knows close to nothing about DT standards and showed his lack of knowledge multiple times. Same goes for his befriended shitposters. I think distrusting them is an easy solution (and maybe a neutral trust for shitposting, trolling and harassment). Quote from: Nestade on June 26, 2022, 05:48:35 PMEven his claim that 90% of my merits came from 1miau is a lie as shown on bpip:As a German Merit souce, I even gave a some Merits to Unknown01 because I had the impression, he would improve but unfortunately, I was wrong. Quote from: Nestade on June 26, 2022, 05:48:35 PMQuote from: 1miau on June 26, 2022, 04:52:27 PMThere's an easy solution: ~Unknown01 [DT2]~MinoRaiola [DT2]~s0nix~thandieAgreed.Unknown01 is DT2 and just like his friends misused the trust-system by giving his friends POSITIVE trust without any indication.Exactly, such users like Unknown01 shouldn't be anywhere near DT.

Unknown01 is providing no value to the forum and now he's starting to attack new accounts. The user seems known to me, I mean I saw him many times in posts like I see a lot of you. I did not see his recent activities (may consider a look) but the name sounds familiar to me and I get the feel that he is not a shit poster. Anyway, I will look at his post history shortly before making any bad assumption.I think you mean Upgrade00? Upgrade00 is a quality poster. But Unknown01 is mostly active in the German section and in spam megathreads, facilitatig post like these: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1041310;sa=showPosts;start=560https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1041310;sa=showPosts;start=540He was even accused of low posting quality: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2360806.msg57024047#msg57024047",

He has no clue about DT, doesn't use it how it should be used but trust is obviously good enough to send a fraudulent positive trust to his shitposter friend Unknown01:  That's how they use trust...",

This member has no interest in free speech, only his own opinion. This user attacks all members who do not share his opinion because he is absolutely incompetent to lead a factual debate.Anyone who disagrees with him is called an asshole, dirty pig, troll, shitposter.1miau's comments are full of hate and contempt for people who think differently. Instead of arguing he rants, he lies, he denounces other members by spreading fake statements.His latest campaign: spreading Putin propagandaHe spreads lies! Everything he writes here are lies!My position has always been clear:fact:Quote from: thandie on March 12, 2022, 11:24:25 AM...Ich habe hier nun wirklich oft genug geschrieben, daß dieser Krieg ein Unrecht ist, daß die russische Aggression in der Ukraine durch nichts gerechtfertigt ist, daß es nichts zu relativieren gibt, daß es für die Ukrainer eine absolute Katastrophe ist, daß dieser Krieg so schnell als möglich gestopp - wie auch immer - werden sollte, daß es massive Reaktionen darauf und Unterstützung für die Bürger der Ukraine geben muß. Ich habe bereits aktiv geholfen. ¹fact:Quote from: thandie on March 10, 2022, 10:09:06 PM...Ich habe mittlerweile fast 15 große Kartons an Hilfsgütern für die Ukraine zusammengestellt und in Richtung polnischer Grenze bringen lassen.Aber meinen Freunden in Wladiwostok und in St. Petersburg würde ich ebenso helfen, wenn sie durch die Sanktionen in Not geraten sollten. Und zwar unabhängig iher pol. Meinung. Denn das sind normale Menschen und meine Freunde. Noch geht es ihnen allerdings gut.fact:Quote from: thandie on March 11, 2022, 02:57:24 PMIch hätte wohl kaum etliche Kartons mit Verbandsmaterial, Hygieneartikeln und anderen Hilfsgütern für die Ukraine zusammengestellt, wenn ich ausblenden würde, daß dort Leute in größter Not sind, daß sie vor dem Beschuß durch die russische Armee fliehen. Dieser Vorwurf ist mehr als frech, auch anderen Leute gegenüber. Denn man kann davon ausgehen, daß sich viele Leute, auch Bitcointalk-User, an Hilfen in welcher Form auch immer oder mit Spenden oder sonstwie beteiligen. Das ist für die Leute in der Ukraine relevanter als Beteuerungen in Online-Foren.But he calls me Putin propagandist, he says I glorify the aggression.1miau continues to spread his shameless lies to damage people's reputation.This is defamation. And that is a criminal offense. And by the way:If I were pro-Putin, I would say it louder.Because I am not a wimp who hides behind anonymity like 1miau.",

Your shenanigans have been tiring the German local board for some time now. You can express whatever \"Opinion\" (posting \"justifications\" about Putin's war) but don't expect that your \"Opinion\" goes unchallenged.  90% of your posts are dedicated to that topic, 9% are defamations, 1% are the war is ugly BUT...We know how your propaganda is intended! Don't expect that there's no one calling out your Off-Topic troll spam. You are contributing nothing to the forum! The criticisms from Kamix, from Nestade, from Dissi_xD, from Basti773, from bullrun2020bro and from myself and far more are totally deserved for what you are giving out as \"opinions\". In addition, you are the ones manipulating trust because you have no clue about DT standards. DT is a community based reputation system, developed in the first half of the last decade! You don't know the difference between positive and negative trust! Your lack of DT knowledge is embarassing. Did you ever read LoyceV's guide? Quote from: thandie on June 26, 2022, 06:28:30 PMAnd that is a criminal offense. Your Spamposts are \"a criminal offense\"   Read more here: Dangerous and inappropriate use of Trust: giving positive Trust for ShitpostersPeople like you are destroying the forum from within because of - supporting shitposters- supporting spam- inappropriate use of positive Trust- contributing nothing (you are accusing me?

They are derailing our local board. That's what's wrong and we have talked to them whats wrong about it. Although I don't follow the German board (Ich spreche keine Deutsch), I agree that the forum is full of this kind of people accounts.I don't really have a solution for them and I don't know what can be done. If we do something we hurt the freedom of speech, if we don't.. the forum gets full of this kind of trolls.Quote from: 1miau on June 26, 2022, 05:14:11 PMThey aren't listening and instead now, they are threatening Newbies with bans (which is funny because troll accounts don't have any power to ban anyone, their lack of forum rules, DT and other stuff is apalling)Yes, it's not only limited to propaganda spam but also to giving out positive trust to other troll accounts, which is deeply concerning in my opinion because it's not how positive trust should be used. Such feedbacks should be neutral, see here. Spam should de reported and removed at sight.I've seen the threatening of newbies. Afaik it's not in the forum rules, it may be punishable offense. But we need mods' input in this. Cyrus is mod in Reputation, maybe he can help?Trolling is punishable offense. But trolling may be a bit vague. Still, it's best we can do.Quote from: thandie on June 26, 2022, 06:28:30 PMThe only problem is @1miau himselfI've seen useful posts in the forum made by 1miau.

That's what he does, nothing else.I'm not talking about other threads, but in the OffTopic section @1miau is the biggest troublemaker.",

They are derailing our local board. That's what's wrong and we have talked to them whats wrong about it. Although I don't follow the German board (Ich spreche keine Deutsch), I agree that the forum is full of this kind of people accounts.I don't really have a solution for them and I don't know what can be done. If we do something we hurt the freedom of speech, if we don't.. the forum gets full of this kind of trolls.I think one of the problem are paid accounts (Sigspam), so good Campaign Managers are an important point here. But it's not limited to paid posts, see BADdecker (but he's in a league of his own). Some people have too much free time.  Of course, an active community is also essential where contributors are rewarded (for example Merit) and low-quality posts are discouraged, sometimes even long posts are contributiong nothing. The moderation can discourage such spam by enforcing the forum rules. For example, we have already rules in place like trolling spam and similar but it's not easy to decide here. I've reported some shitposts in the international section and all of them were remowed. That's how reporters and moderators can make Bitcointalk a better place with lesse spam. But after all, the most essential thing is, that people participating on Bitcointalk have at least some sort of self-awareness: Are my posts beneficial for Bitcointalk or am I abusing Bitcointalk as a dump for my propaganda? We should try to be people from the first category.   Quote from: NeuroticFish on June 26, 2022, 07:19:05 PMQuote from: 1miau on June 26, 2022, 05:14:11 PMThey aren't listening and instead now, they are threatening Newbies with bans (which is funny because troll accounts don't have any power to ban anyone, their lack of forum rules, DT and other stuff is apalling)Yes, it's not only limited to propaganda spam but also to giving out positive trust to other troll accounts, which is deeply concerning in my opinion because it's not how positive trust should be used. Such feedbacks should be neutral, see here. Spam should de reported and removed at sight.I've seen the threatening of newbies. Afaik it's not in the forum rules, it may be punishable offense. But we need mods' input in this. Cyrus is mod in Reputation, maybe he can help?Trolling is punishable offense. But trolling may be a bit vague. Still, it's best we can do.I'm in favor of adding \"harassing newbies without reason\" to the rules. Newbies are very important for having new, potential contributors on Bitcointalk. Maybe that's a discussion for Meta.  Regarding trolling: some might consider it \"trolling\", others not. Some excessive trolls have caught a negative trust, some only neutral. Some posts are getting deleted, some not. It's a difficult question and most likely we won't get a final answer.  I'm still hoping for more self-awareness how such low-quality posters are destroying the forum, even damaging Bitcoin's reputation. Most of the are just here to earn, some are just here to troll. People brought that up in our local section, shitposters didn't care. We keep trying.  Quote from: Poly#Crypto on June 26, 2022, 07:15:30 PMMeanwhile you are the biggest troll on the German board, the members laugh at you, nobody likes you.Yeah, I like trolls like Poly#Crypto and thandie digging their own holes. Stop posting Putin propaganda, stop harassing newbies, stop misusing positive trust and start contrubuting Bitcoin-related content. Since you are not posting Bitcoin-related content, maybe Bitcointalk is not your forum.  And tell Unknown01 that he's very lucky to earn valuable BTC every week for his spam.  Quote from: thandie on June 26, 2022, 07:36:25 PMQuote from: NeuroticFish on June 26, 2022, 07:19:05 PMQuote from: thandie on June 26, 2022, 06:28:30 PMThe only problem is @1miau himselfSo I don't share your opinion.Yes, of course, I don't see any problems in the Bulgarian Borad either (I do not speak bulgarian).
