When the customers want to bet in our casino, they need to swap their currency to MCL tokens first. The process will charge them certain handling fees.All of the funds from the customers will gather as a pool. The common games available in most casinos can be played in our casino, including Blackjack, Slot Machine, Roulette etc. Customers can choose the game whatever they like.Let us take Blackjack as an example.https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCIa_uoGEAqaA-XcJydQkW4IN7COtg7Wts0w&usqp=CAU Several players participate in the game. The game is like what a traditional casino is. If they won in the game, they would be given a corresponding amount of MCD token from the pool that mentioned above. In contrast, if they lose the game, their token will be collected and put into the pool.Let me explain more,and why I chose the way of casinos to operate this project.Let's look at other examples of decentralized applications first….   Focusing on other decentralized projects is actually making profits in the way of betting, and our view is that it is better to start a company directly, and then the way of customer participation becomes more interesting And they're also operating without any licenseSecond things is I chose the casino way to launch,Doesn't mean I support gambling, we are also planning how to make it more meaningful! I have developed wallet apps for IOS and Android,Using our Siriusnet blockchain,I bound the price of USDT to MCD through the smart contract,In the past, people have used trading pairs to value currencies,In fact, this is very dangerous, as long as anyone who knows a little mathematics can understand it,Back to the topic, now 1 to 1 USDT is for the next stepTo maximize the application of MCD, one of the methods I think of is compromise.We can't ignore Visa and Master. These two companies make consumption convenient in many countries and regions, so it is necessary to rely on their strengthThat is to say, I will connect the Wallet app to Visa or Master Card,So that our MCD can withdraw money/consumption directly through the card!  Compared to other cryptocurrency projects. We have adopted a special method to turn our own chips into stable coins. I can't disclose how I achieved this effect at the moment. Because there have always been hidden dangers in the blockchain. People try to use the old financial system to apply blockchain technology. And I focus on efficient transfer speed and unlimited use in any country. I am more focused on the application of the token than the investment of the token.for more Join us here to earn more rewards for passion : https://www.mcl-token.io/ https://discord.gg/PG8kNvBN https://t.me/macaucasinolisboa",
