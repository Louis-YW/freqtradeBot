  "content": "Hi there! I am doing research for a Bitcoin presentation. I was hoping I could tap the community here to double check the data I come across. My first question is around data sources. I plan on reviewing Glassnode, Messari, Coinmetrics and theblock.co... are any of these particularly good or bad in your opinion? Is there another data source you would recommend? Thank you so much! I have also been pointed in the direction of https://bitinfocharts.com/, https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning and https://cryptofees.info/.If you know of any of these being particularly good or bad in terms of data quality I would appreciate the heads up. Thanks!",

Depends on your objectives for your presentation which I don't know now as you did not describe so far.One of most comprehensive source you can use is The bullish case for Bitcoin and it has a book on Amazon too.Those sites you listed are for on-chain data but I believe it is better if you focus on basics first. On-chain data is not fundamental and not for beginners. It is for an advanced level of course that does not match for newbies.https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/ is a great site for on-chain charts.",

It depends on the data you want to fetch and then use in your presentation and how accurate you want your information to be. For example something like \"number of blocks per day\" is very hard to miscalculate while \"block size\" even though it is a very simple \"data\" it is apparently something these online data sources (like bitinfocharts that was mentioned) easily miscalculate as I recently found out and pointed out here. Or glassnode that reports some of its so called \"analysis\" based on news not hard data acquired from research and blockchain analysis, such as their reports on \"hashrate per country\" which is very inaccurate.Another problem is the bias some of these tools sometimes have. For example if you check out reports by a blockchain analysis company working to deanonymize bitcoin, you can see their reports are always biased towards convincing the reader that bitcoin is used for illegal activities and they can track everything.Apart from bias we also have maliciousness. For example there are malicious websites reporting extremely high fee rates as an attack on bitcoin trying to inflate it. Or there are altcoin centered websites (like bcash sites including bitcoin.com) that are known for providing misinformation.",

      "body": "Thank you so much everyone. I should have been clearer about the purpose of the presentation. It is aimed at a broader more general audience, first and foremost to give them factual information useful to them. I am not looking for perfect, but to do responsible due diligence and provide reasonably accurate information. I have worked for chains ( and been in crypto since 2013 ) and know how reporting services can get things wrong and even how within one's own community it can be hard to come to an agreement on what the facts are.I will be doing a comparison to roughly 10 years ago and primarily Bitcoin vs fiat. I will address a lot of the criticisms against Bitcoin, the environmental stuff. If anyone knows of data that tracks the environmental impact of the fiat banking infrastructure etc... that would be amazing. Also gonna do a comparison to gold. This is a long shot but if anyone knows of any credible studies on the environmental impact of the state monopoly on and manipulation of the marketplace that would be great. I will probably dedicate a bit of the presentation to acquiring, securing and privatizing ones Bitcoin.Definitely gonna bring up the current fiat crisis and regulatory environment. Gonna share the salient historical events over the last 10 years, please add any I am overlooking:* The hard fork* Segwit* Lightning* Nation state adoption* TaprootI am also gonna touch on the current developmental state and possible paths for Bitcoin.I have seen mention of the way taproot is being used opening up the door to things like sidechains, rollups etc... so I need to look into that more. I may include current debates within the community and where one can go to follow and participate. This forum and nostr and twitter seem like obvious recommendations, any others?  What would you say defines Bitcoin? What is the single element that if removed would cease for it to be Bitcoin. I am personally leaning toward the overt dominance in hashing power. Regardless of algorithm, on the small chance that a flaw were found in sha-256, Bitcoin would move to another algorithm and the mining industry would adapt and follow.Another secondary defining feature imo is the conservative development that solves for simplicity. What would you say is the best concise ( yet factually accurate ) explanation for how Bitcoin works? You are skeptical of Bitcoin, your intelligent but are not interested in becoming a dev or reading pages apon pages of text ( yet ) to understand how it works. You are bombarded with information from all sides, your attention is taken for granted and abused, everyone is claiming doom and gloom trying to convince you of their thing ...and it would be a part time job to try and qualify and validate all of it. you just want concise objective facts. I like 3Blue1Brown's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4 - but it is a bit technical and of course, not concise, lol. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Quote from: Volition on March 14, 2023, 08:55:39 PMWhat is the single element that if removed would cease for it to be Bitcoin. This is interesting. I guess it will be the very fundamentals aspects of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin's block size is significantly increased, would it still be Bitcoin? I guess so. But what if Bitcoin shifts to PoS, would it still be Bitcoin? I don't think so. What if transactions carrying Ordinal inscriptions are rejected or censored, would it still be Bitcoin? That would be debatable. What if the 21 million supply is increased? That's certainly a deviation from Bitcoin's fundamental design. So I guess there isn't only a single element that makes Bitcoin what it is.",

What defines bitcoin is not about the huge hashrate, it is not about the price nor that it was first and all that. It is all about offering a solution and providing an actual utility.There is a problem in real world with the centralized financial system, banksters and centralized fiat and its related payment systems. The bitcoin paper summarizes that well in the first section. Bitcoin solves that problem and does it well. This is what defines bitcoin and is the reason why bitcoin is successful and still continues growing even after 14 years.",

Depends on how we define the term. If we assume that hard fork is a radical change to the protocol of Bitcoin's blockchain - then it wasn't really a hard fork, as the BCH and other forks have indeed introduced radical changes the blockchain, but those changes were made to their new brands of blockchain, not to the Bitcoin blockchain.So it's not like the Big blockers tried to push their new fork as Bitcoin.But yes, all that Big Vs Small blocks civil war was definitely a significant episode in Bitcoins history. It exposed some ugliness and some dirty plays, but also had some bright sides, and all seems to end up quite well.",

(ones segwit rejected)segwit was declared by the economic nodes(merchants/services) as bitcoin and the opposition as an altcoin where the altcoin had to change things in its minority chain to ensure the chains dont converge by the end of august. (so that the flag can be taken out/to not need to continue having 100% flagging which was used to prevent differing blocks on the bitcoin side)this version of events is backed up by actual agreements. actual code and actual blockdata that is immutable and is strongly uneditable by 6 years of confirmations",
