But the problem is most full nodes will reject it because it nonstandard, that’s why the most accepted form is the RBF which is why most wallets support it.

I realise I must have been misunderstood. I was wondering specifically about the text in red colour by Charles-Tim.I think that most wallets don't support it. When you select a utxo to be part of a tx and you broadcast it, then it can't be selected again, unless for RBF, which by default I think means sending again to the same output address.",

So, you are kind of right. It's only electrum that allow you to use the outputs that have been already spent in an RBF-enabled unconfirmed transaction to one of your own addresses. Even electrum doesn't allow you to use any address you want as receiving address in the replacement transaction, however there's a workaround for that. Charles-Tim is also right. According to BIP125, the replacement transaction must have at least one same input as the original transaction. It doesn't say anything about outputs. So, you can use any receiving address(es) you want as the receiving address in the replacement transaction. If you can't do so, it's just because your wallet doesn't allow that.",

Right on the left, click on the -  - and you will be allowed to change the destination. Quote from: hosseinimr93 on November 04, 2023, 01:49:55 PMAccording to BIP125, the replacement transaction must have at least one same input as the original transaction.Every wallet I've come across treats RBF as a double-spend, which is correct. When you replace a transaction, you're literally double-spending the inputs until one of them is mined in a block. So yeah, it has to contain at least an input of an unconfirmed transaction.",

I don't know what OP got as the bearest minimum for a transfer when they made theirs. I have checked, too, and according to the mempool, even 35 sat/vB is a low priority. This is insane. Spending more than a dollar for $50 transactions is too much already.Quote from: Mpamaegbu on November 06, 2023, 02:46:44 PMNow, here's the thing for those who bemoan lack of mass adoption for Bitcoin. I think this fee thing is a major part of the problem for Bitcoin, not necessarily lack of government support or approval. I agree with you as well. If we consider that mass adoption will increase the number of transactions, the mempool will get congested as it has for the last couple of days. Would you spend that much money as fee-only? Do you remember how congested the mempool was when the BRC-20 tokens craze was there? Most of the time we see lightning networks as alternatives, but that's not a proper solution.",

Yes there is a feature like that on electrum but what it means is that you’re actually double spending your transaction to your own address by paying higher fee. The reason for the higher fee is to get it confirmed first to your address before the original or first transaction gets confirmed since the miners prioritizes transactions based on fee rate.

Technically you can cancel a bitcoin transaction you can just double spend it to another address using a higher feeSorry there is a difference in bumping a transaction fee than getting a transaction ejected from the Blockchain. Bumping the fee is to encourage a miner in getting the transaction confirmed. While ejection from the Blockchain is getting it out and crediting it back to the wallet. Technically Bitcoin was meant to act as a payment processor and behave somewhat similar to fiat currency. The point was to make a cheaper way to make payments globally. That is why such features were added to it. As of now with the uncertainty on the transaction fee and how much to spend as the fee is more volatile than the Bitcoin price. I assume such features should be shared with everyone.Quote from: satscraper on November 13, 2023, 05:27:30 PMOpt \"Cancel' transaction in Electrum is somewhat misleading.

That is why the fee is increased when comparing it with that one relevant to the \"canceled\" transaction.  I think your way of explaining is more appropriate than mine  . I am not a technical guy but I am aware of things happening within the Bitcoin ecosystem. I have also seen the cancellation fee being lesser that the transaction fee. The problem here is that I cannot show you but it does happen.",
