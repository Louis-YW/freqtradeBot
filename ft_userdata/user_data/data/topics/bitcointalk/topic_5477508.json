  "content": "The whole mixer discussion and also the ever-tightening regulations of Bitcoin/cryptocurrency services let me think about if KYC at least could be more friendly. Particularly, if there are practices and methods which don't allow hackers to steal the identity of the service users, or to link different personal data together.Of course in general I strongly prefer non-kyc services (for well-known reasons - read this excellent thread by 1miau). But in particular for the fiat-Bitcoin on- and offramping step the services are limited, above all in some lesser-known currencies.In reality, not the KYC data collecting itself is the most problematic step, but the verification process, which often involves images and videos of the user and his/her documents.So here I want to collect methods and \"best\" or \"least worst\" practices which at least make it more difficult to facilitate identity theft.- Offline verification services. In some countries \"old-style\" verification methods exist, like Postident in Germany. In these cases you go to a store, show your ID document, and the store employee thus confirms to the service provider that you are the person you impersonate. Sometimes, a copy of your ID document or passport has to be delivered, which makes the whole process a bit more vulnerable if this is stored digitally, but on the whole I think these methods are still preferrable because a black-and-white passport copy has often low resolution and would not be useful for a criminal trying to get an online KYC verification with your data.- Proving ownership of a bank account (added Aug. 2024). The service provider sends a very small amount of money (a few cents) to the user and attaches a message. The user has to provide that message to the service. Doing that twice with at least 30 days between first and second time should be safe enough to deter most attempts to \"game\" that method, e.g. with a stolen bank account.- Registration without email or phone. While email addresses or phone numbers seem not to matter that much if you have to submit an ID photo, selfie or video, they are elements which could be linked to the rest of your data, making the construction of a fake identity easier. Thus, a registration based, for example, on a public key/private key pair (like on the Nostr network), is a little bit less dangerous.- Selfies with dates and service names on paper (to link the photo/video to the registration date and the service). This is actually quite common, but I guess with the advent of AI imagery tools it is less efficient than it was before. (Edit: There are variants like a Street selfie where even more items are required to be present in the selfie like a sign with the street address, but these seem overly intrusive and carry other dangers, so I don't want to point out them as \"good\" examples here, even if they might make an identity theft more difficult too).- Transparency - it should be clear who does the KYC verification and who stores the personal data - the service provider itself or a third party, and data about the third party should be provided in the ToS of the service (Providers located in countries where the GDPR or other restrictive data protection laws exist should offer this).Do other such methods exist which still allow an trustable verification making identity theft difficult? Are there examples in the Bitcoin/crypto service world?I could imagine methods based on cryptography, where an image for example can only be considered valid if the user signs it digitally together with a message that links it to a service and date. It would be basically the \"digital variant\" of the third method mentioned above. But the problem here is that this would have to be an universal standard, because the photo could also be used on another service which requires it.",

Thus, a registration based, for example, on a public key/private key pair (like on the Nostr network), is a little bit less dangerous.I agree with risk from registration with email addresses or phone numbers. Non-tech users usually use one or two email addresses for multiple platforms that destroy privacy and even anonymity..Theymos used to share his opinion on it and 1miau has an excellent thread on risks of KYC.Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and uselessQuote from: theymos on July 12, 2019, 08:04:24 PMBTW, email is a big privacy issue in general. It's too expensive (mainly time-wise) to create new email addresses, but if you use the same one, it creates tons of links. Ideally, you should use one email per service. I've had two ideas in this area:First, you could create a simple email forwarding service like this: - Without registration (but maybe with a tiny fee via eg. Lightning), take a user's email address, generate a random key, and use the random key to encrypt the email address. - Also encrypt the email address with a server secret. - Give the user an email address of the form ENCRYPTED_EMAIL.DECRYPTION_KEY@asdf.com - When the service receives email at a forwarding address, it decrypts the email first using its server secret, and then using the provided decryption key. Then it forwards the email to the email address - To destroy forwarding addresses, users could provide the service with both their forwarding address and target address, and the service could then send a confirmation email.This would be convenient, and it'd fix the problem of services being able to connect users across multiple sites through email-address reuse. But it trusts the forwarder not to log the per-email decryption keys or give up the server secret key. Though if multiple services like this existed, you could chain emails through them to increase security.My second idea is: - The user would be using his own software (like eg. Thunderbird or perhaps prontonmail). From this software, the user could instantly create low-capacity throwaway accounts on the server. Each throwaway account could be (or behave similar to) a POP3 account with low capacity (eg. 50MB) and quick message expiration (eg. 60 days). - The client software would use Tor and careful polling to download all of the messages on its throwaway accounts without leaking to the server info about which accounts are connected. To improve anonymity and efficiency, you could perhaps use PIR, or the server could publish hourly/daily bloom filters meant to match email addresses which received mail in the time period. The client software would collect all of the messages into a single inbox for the end-user. Since it polls frequently, the client wouldn't have to worry about the low limits on the individual throwaways. - The server could anonymously require a small one-time for each throwaway account by using blinded bearer certificates.With this, the server shouldn't ever be able to connect any of the accounts together. You could also send mail from the throwaways.The main thing necessary for this second idea is a really smart email client meant to juggle many throwaways. You also need a cooperative server allowing quick account creation (like cock.li), ideally via an API.",

Identity theft has many stages, you have to first create a fake (or real) identity linking different data items together (email address, name, photo, ID number, etc.), and only then you can \"use\" it on a service. The \"non-email\" method, for example, attacks the \"identity creation\" stage, as it makes it more difficulty to create links between data sets, and normally many items are needed to really steal the identity. So I think the title isn't that bad as I'm interested in techniques which make the whole \"identity theft\" process more difficult.  Quote from: NotATether on December 12, 2023, 10:23:36 AMBut I have always wondered, why not support webcams as well? Since everyone is videoconferencing with them nowadays, it doesn't hurt to allow verification with a desktop or laptop.I think there are services allowing that. Kraken for example allows photo upload, mobile device, or webcam. But just Kraken's method (require ID and photo separately, i.e. a photo without the ID nor the name of the service/date) is one of the worst, because these items can simply be used without any particular modification if the hacker is able to connect the identities, it doesn't require \"faking skills\".Quote from: Apocollapse on December 12, 2023, 04:40:58 AMSo... you're suggesting we should trust in centralization?Offline verification service, registration without email or phone number, selfies with dates, street selfies, what next? you just trying to make a new North Korea to adopt a very strict rules and if someone not follow it, he would get a shot by unknown sniper.Of course I'm Kim Jong Un As a more serious reply: It might be possible to use non-KYC services exclusively, but I believe not even 10% of Bitcoin users are doing that. Even \"oldtimers\" used Mt Gox. For the remaining 90%, they have to suffer some form of KYC sometimes when they deal with Bitcoin services. Thus, it's not a bad idea to point out KYC methods which make identity theft at least a little bit more difficult, so people can actively select services offering them, instead of relying to methods like an ID photo which can be simply stolen and used on another service.The paradox thing is that some of these ideas seem \"intrusive\" at a first glance, like submitting a selfie with ID, but a selfie with ID is already a little bit safer than the ID photo itself.Thanks for the link to the \"street selfie\" idea, didn't know that. Lol. That's of course totally over the top, even if it is simply an extension of the \"link image with service name/date\" technique to make identity theft even more difficult.",

For example website owners often can simply access their servers via SSH which uses a simple asymmetric encryption scheme, you store your public key on the server and authenticate with your private key stored on your device. (Well, and also Bitcoin works this way  )The same principle can be used for all kinds of communication. If the customer has a Nostr account (an open source social network), then he can identify simply with his private key and exchange messages, chats etc. so this could be even used for \"contact\".The big advantage to use a Nostr-like system to authenticate instead of email is that the user can create as many Nostr accounts as he wants, and everything is done on his own computer, so there is no intervention from a third party like an e-mail provider. So it's much easier to create one account for each KYC service you use, and thus for hackers it's more difficult to link the data together and build identities.That this kind of registration isn't very popular for typical \"massive\" internet (and also crypto) services is true, but technically it's absolutely no problem.",

Of course.One could ask what is better, use services which do the KYC themselves, or those who pay a third party authentication service?In general, I think I'd prefer the third-party service, because they should work with the newest standards regarding identity theft protection and storage of the documents. Ideally, they wouldn't even need to store them, only to give an \"OK\" to the service provider, that the data of their users is correct. And the \"verified data\" items should also be stored more safely, of course.One could argue that identity verification services could be an especially interesting target for hackers to steal identities, but I guess these would target mainly \"DIY KYC\" crypto services and smaller specialized KYC services knowing that their practices aren't on the newest state of the art. Only in the case of a big, established service provider I'd accept them to do KYC themselves.The problem is of course that often you don't even know who does the KYC verification - the crypto service provider or a third party, and which third party. So you don't know whom you'd have to trust. It is definitely better if the provider clarifies this on their website or in their ToS.I thus agree that there are many problems with KYC and it should be avoided if possible. But for some service categories it's difficult, and thus I continue to think that thinking about \"best practices\" - or better: \"least worst practices\" - isn't a bad idea.",

      "body": "I bump this topic because I still consider it important, and would like to read more about \"safe\" KYC methods.I've actually forgot one of the most popular methods before the \"KYC craze\" in recent years, which also is okay for me: Prove you own a bank account. This is mostly done the following way: The service sends a small amount, or a code, to you via a bank transfer. If you are able to provide that code or the exact amount, that proves that the bank account is under your control.I suspect that this method wasn't deemed enough in recent years because of the rampant problem with stolen bank accounts. But there would be actually an almost 100% safe method: Make the user prove his ownership of the bank account twice, about 30 days between the first and the second time. If the bank account was stolen, it is almost impossible that the criminal would be able to submit that proof twice because the owner of the account for sure would have already gone to the police, or at least contacted the bank to block the account.I've added this method to the OP. Posts about more methods, even those only locally available, are highly appreciated",
