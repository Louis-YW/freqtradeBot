I'm guessing my pin is 8 digits or higher (I'm betting on 8 ) and I am having no luck finding help from even the wallet recovery services people who charge 20% of your total wallet. if anyone can help me I will reimburse you, I realize this is time consuming. thank you.generally,Â  the spending PIN takes more difficult way to encrypt. so it is very harder to get decrypted. according to my personal experience on 2 cases. there is still possible to recover the 10-12 digits, even longer one with special skills and experience plays more important role. i would advise the users to set the spending pin to protect the btc in case your kids set it to a random PIN by accident.",
