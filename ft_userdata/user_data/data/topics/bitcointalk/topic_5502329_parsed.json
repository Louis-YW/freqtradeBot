Some people prefer PayPal because of the customer protection policy, as you have stated, but most people abuse the use of that policy a lot, so anyone who knows how PayPal operates might not want to receive payment through PayPal, but they can still go for other crypto payment options.  If you go to the service section in this forum, you will see a lot of people offering different kinds of freelancing services, and the majority of them want to be paid in bitcoin or another accepted crypto currency, but it's hard to see someone requesting to be paid with PayPal or even a bank transfer, as both of them have little difference.",

If you get a freelancing job on this forum, just know that most likely that your client will pay you in bitcoin or an altcoin although there can be dialogue of paying in fiat if you do not want to accept cryptocurrencies. I have heard also that some clients on some freelancing sites can pay in bitcoin or in altcoin.  You can request your client to pay in bitcoin and see what he will tell you. Also that some clients can offer you to get paid in bitcoin.",

Do clients really pay to freelancers for their work in bitcoins ? Or they prefer other payment mediums like paypal which provided more protection to buyer. Why Not? Just like other users here have mentioned, it's a matter of agreement. Freelancing has a variety of payment options with fiat as the most common method, however if you and your client can come to an agreement with a particular crypto currency then you are good to go.The only thing that may pose some sort of hinderance is the freelancing platform itself. This is because In the terms and conditions, some freelancing organising platforms compel their freelancer to a particular method of receiving payments which is usually via fiat like I said earlier.Anyways crypto payments would be nice especially if a stable coin is used.",

There are some bitcoin specific freelancing sites and these are more likely to have crypto payment systems in addition to fiat. Those who initially started with fiat payments are less likely to add crypto if their local jurisdiction does not allow it.Of course if the parties involved in the work are both into using bitcoin, a mutual agreement can be done to get crypto as payment.If the recipient does not find it easy to sell those coins they will not buy it  similar with the buyer if bitcoin is scarce wherere they live they will not go forward with it.",

Bitcoin is the simplest payment method anyone can use because, if you just have Bitcoin in your wallet, you can make payments to anyone without having to create a third-party account. If you want to pay via PayPal, you need to register and verify an account, but it's not like that for Bitcoin.",

Do clients really pay to freelancers for their work in bitcoins ? Or they prefer other payment mediums like paypal which provided more protection to buyer. I think this is not a good idea. This is due to the fact that during the reporting period before the tax, it will be very difficult for a freelancer to prove that he received payment in Bitcoins in return for a certain service. And the tax service may not accept this type of payment as accountable. In general, these are difficulties for the freelancer who wants to have legally provided taxes to the state.",

Do clients really pay to freelancers for their work in bitcoins ? Or they prefer other payment mediums like paypal which provided more protection to buyer. I guess things like the payment can be talked during the interview between the freelancer and the client. If I remember correctly, once a freelancer has been hired, the client will tell the rate and at that time, the freelancer can suggest to the client if they can pay him/her through Bitcoins. It's up to the client of course if he/she will agree to it or not.Most of the clients prefer Paypal or Payoneer because it's the most efficient and the most widely used application for paying these freelancers. I'm not saying that clients don't want their freelancers to pay through Bitcoin, but most of them will always prefer what's best for them.",

I think that it depends mostly on the nature of work. If freelancing in the crypto community then you can expect that the payment will be sent in crypto as well.If the client personally asks that their identity remain anonymous then it’s most likely they will send the payment in bitcoin or crypto. It’s not always that you see the freelancers setting the kind of payment they want to be paid in as they would want to prioritize convenience and accessibility of their clients over their own. Outside of the crypto community though, I still see paypal as the #1 payment method for a lot of freelancers.",
