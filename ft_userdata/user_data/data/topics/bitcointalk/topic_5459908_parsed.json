They are all yours. If you go to \"Receive\" tab and generate a new address, electrum will give you one of the receiving addresses from \"Addresses\" tab. When you make a transaction and there's a change that should be sent back to you, electrum uses one of the change addresses to receive the change.",

      "body": "Both addresses are yours, as hosseinimr93 stated, and you can use any of them to receive your Bitcoin because they are all public keys for your wallet.The change address is also a receiving address because when you broadcast a transaction, it uses all of your Bitcoin. For example, if you have 1BTC and want to send 0.5BTC, while broadcasting your transaction, the entire 1BTC will be used, and the remaining 0.5BTC will be in your change address. After all, the overall amount will be summed up as your total balance.",

After all, the overall amount will be summed up as your total balance.This is not always true. It's possible that you have received the 1 BTC in multiple transactions and you have multiple UTXOs. Let's say you have received two transactions, 0.5 BTC in each of them and you want to pay someone 0.4 BTC. Now you have two UTXOs and for sending the 0.4 BTC, you don't have to use the entire 1 BTC. You can make a transaction using one of your UTXOs and the change value will be 0.1 BTC minus transaction fee.",

If you like, you can make the change address your address too, but I will advice you to use receiving address and let you wallet automatically use change address to receive your change.",

      "body": "Alrighty, since there are already a bunch of folks who have given their two cents on your initial question, I will just focus on this part:Quote from: Hasslong on July 15, 2023, 01:33:01 PM~In case if I want to revive coin ,does the wallet automatic select one of those labeled by received or the wallet generate new address?That is right! When you go to the \"receive\" tab in the Electrum wallet, the software automatically selects the next available receiving address from the list in the \"addresses\" tab. This approach is for better privacy since it is recommended to use a new address for each transaction. However, feel free to choose any other address from the generated list in the Electrum wallet. All of those addresses are associated with your wallet (actually, that list represents only a portion, as you have an unlimited number of addresses at your disposal), and any coins received at any of those addresses will be added to the overall balance of your wallet.",

So under normal conditions and without user intervention each address, receive or change, will be used only twice and have two transactions.Electrum also maintains by standard always 20 free receive addresses and 10 free change addresses in your wallet. It derives new addresses in each section as needed.",
