This can be terrible backup stories, client hacks, reversing at MtGox and such.I don't want to gather a list of hacks of commercial sites in particular because there are plenty of information on that already.I will post everything I find on this very simple website:http://sites.google.com/site/whoissatoshi/bitcoin-mistakesDon't be shy!EDIT: Please add some context, interesting details etc to make it a nice story.",
