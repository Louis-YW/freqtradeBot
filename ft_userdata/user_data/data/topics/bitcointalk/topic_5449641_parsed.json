  "content": "Greetings to all.My question is not about the Electrum wallet in particular. It is about software wallets in general. Since the Electrum wallet is a prestigious software wallet for its privacy and security, I thought that some of its users probably know this. What I have heard a number of times when learning about btc security, is that when you use a software wallet, your private key is briefly exposed during a transaction, and thus, this opens the door to the private key being stolen.Does anyone know if this is indeed the case?Cordially,",

There are cold storage option and the use of Electrum 2FA wallet mentioned by nc50lc which are recommended. Or the use of multisig wallet. Or to buy a reputable hardware wallet. Using them safely and securely.",

If the hacker has obtained root access or what is known as a rootkit, you may be in trouble, as once you decrypt the wallet, your coins will be stolen.The same thing if the attack was limited only to things like keylogging, where the difference of the tool will determine the amount of risk.Hackers are rarely able to carry out the above two attacks by simply clicking on a link, as they need you to download or install the tool yourself.So always use cold storage to sign the transaction.Quote from: nc50lc on April 21, 2023, 05:02:27 AM\"2FA wallet\" requires 2 signatures, only one will be exposed when sending transactions so it's not enough to get your bitcoins stolen.If all of your devices are severely affected, even 2FA or multiple signatures won't be the solution.",
