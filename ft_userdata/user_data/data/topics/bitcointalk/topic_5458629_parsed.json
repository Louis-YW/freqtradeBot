Thank you for the invitation, and just as CryptoHeadlineNews has said, the IV goes to show that you hold us on high regards and we really do appreciate it. I believe many members here are going to participate and I hope one of us emerges as the winner. I've got a question though, the partner we are supposed to choose, are we contesting against the partner or playing with the partner against another opponent?",

I am personally convinced that bitcoin will take off in Africa. As the best way to understand what is really going on is to ask the inhabitants themselves rather than taking a journalist or a politician at their word, I wanted to come and have a look at your local board.I am quite sure that your answers on self-custody will also be of interest to Shiftcrypto: for my part, I love the bitbox, which is why I am proud of this sponsor.For partners:1. Your participation is validated as soon as you confirm that you have completed the survey. (we take your word for it)2. Your partner's participation is validated as soon as he also appears in the topic.3. The goal of partnerships is to get more responses, preferably from different countries.4. If you haven't found a partner, you still participate.Good luck !!!!!",
