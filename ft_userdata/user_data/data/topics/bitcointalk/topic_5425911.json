  "content": "Using existing blockchains such as Ethereum and maybe one day Bitcoin they will bypass the banking systems completely and create a fully digital form of the dollar, hosted on blockchains.Bitcoin better get ready to support more functions, though moving at a snails pace you can little by little do more with Bitcoin than people know.  China failed at creating a global digital currency, they didn't use the blockchain and its centralized.Sure, we hate printing of money, but at least we can more actively see the MINTERS of USDs and what happens to that money.Physical cash is a MASSIVE waste of power and resources. From the materials its made out of, to the machines that create it, to the endless agents who have to find counterfeiters, to the banks hosting money on centralized ledgers, the list just goes on and on.It just doesn't make sense to have a stable coin \"linked\" to a bank somewhere. Defeats the real purpose of crypto and Bitcoin in general and then who trusts this auditor?FULLY digital dollar coming to a block chain near you!",

For example, the way CZ controls Binance Smart Chain the government could control their own. Just because there is a blockchain, doesn't mean that it can't be controlled by one entity.@OP No, governments won't issue stablecoins on existing main stream blockchains. Well, not unless they take control over it. After all, they won't even issue stablecoins but CBDC instead.",

It must be a part for the future development of crypto. it doesn't matter how hard you are trying to leave from the domination by the government but you will always be following what regulated by them. it can be said that if this time the decentralization and centralization will be co exist. The auditors will be coming from the regulator's side. Regulators will be trusting the auditors.

The physical money will become old and people will prefer to have balance in their wallet that can be spent anytime. You can't avoid it. You shall follow that.",

If some of them are corrupt then some of the money will fall in the wrong hands or will be misused. On the other hand, stable coin being tied with the actual money is I think a good idea because people are doubting stable coins before thinking that it wasn't backed by anything.With the help of blockchain, it's now possible to see their transactions but don't be happy just yet. Don't forget that they won't issue it on traditional blockchains and we don't even know if it's possible. They will create their own so I think manipulations are still possible there.",

This is a private blockchain our central bank has used. So even if the digital currency is using a blockchain, it's centralized to the core! Also this digital currency is created outside of banking network. Which means, you have a separate wallet where you need to buy digital currency using fiat at 1:1 ratio. Then use that wallet to do the transactions which is happening outside of bank accounts. I honestly don't see any government using mainstream crypto blockchain to introduce their own stablecoins ever!",

I see GDPR issues and all sorts of other AML issues without even thinking it over 1 minute.

You keep talking about why this is good for us but you are missing the point, governments do not really care about what is best for their citizens, they care about what is the best for them and what kind of benefits they can obtain, and it is obvious that losing control of the money supply is not on their best interests, so this is a power they are never going to let go willingly, so what you are proposing has no possibility of happening whatsoever.",

While this isn't guaranteed to be an easy process, there are various methods being considered to make this a reality. I think it's important to try and find a balance between the stability  and how much trust you're willing to give to centralized institutions.
