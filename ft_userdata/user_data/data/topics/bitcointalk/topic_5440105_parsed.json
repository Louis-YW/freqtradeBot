For me i think it is better to start with spot trading gradually observe how the market respond over time before moving into future trading. Both are indeed volatile and risky but i think spot which involves immediate buying and holding until price goes up to sell at a profit is more easier to start than making prediction on a price to either go up or come down on a later date. Spot can be a nice start for newbies from what i have seen from the market so far. Since it only entails buying and holding until the asset appreciates just that it will only require patience since little or no technical skill is needed although with technical skill the trader can have more advantage over the market.",

Is there really much of a difference?In spot trading, when you buy you are predicting the price would increase and when you do not, it is cause you are not confident it would. The difference I see, is that in spot trading, you can not profit off of a negative market.- Jay -",

Trading with spot and future are different. Trading with small fund and with big fund are very different.If you can not get profit from Spot trading with small fund, don't do it with big fund as you will lose big.If you can not be good with Spot trading, don't move to Future trading because you will lose fund more easily and more quickly.QuoteSpot can be a nice start for newbies from what i have seen from the market so far.

Hold your bitcoin and wait for its recovery even it can take a few months. You will not be able to do this with Future trading. Liquidation will knock your doors and you funds will be liquidated by exchanges.",

I gave it a try and noticed there was money in future trading even with a small capital, so I began trading futures. I wasted all the money I deposited in my futures account, I moved all the money I had in my spot account to my future account, and I wasted it as well.

They need to start why they're buying that's coin, choose a good exchange with low fees etc. Imagine a newbie choose a shitcoin where the price is 1 token worth for $0.01. He have 1000 token or worth $10, next 3 days he making 1000 token but the price is worth for $0.004 now, so 2000 token x $0.004 is $8, he's get more token but he's actually lose.",

But futures trading offers greater returns than spot trading, and that's what many novice traders try to get into.I try future and spot trades at once if the price moves well.

Spot trading also gives you the privileges of holding onto your coins for a longer period of time exceeding your initial target when buying that particular coin.Spot trading is less risky than other forms of trading and can be easily understood if you pick interest in wanting to learn then begin practicing what you just learnt to make money. There's also the advantages of having many coins available for you to research on and trade compared to other types of trading as not all coins are available for leverage trading etc.",

The only direction or concept youll think is youll gain if the market goes up and youll lose if the market goes down. Its easy, and the only parameter youll think is how good your token being watch here. While on future you can gain in both directions but predicting the market is somehow bit different and risky. Some might be good at profiting on this but required a lot of skills and knowledge. Not really sure if those parameters they are using work on their end cause market is unpredictable anyways.

      "body": "A very subjective question and we have different answers for that.Futures trading isn't for newbies out there because they might get liquidated in just one trade especially when they used a high leverage. What's good with Binance though is that, the maximum amount of leverage that you can use if you just registered into their platform is 20x. I had registered an account a few months ago and I can't use more than 20x until next month. I guess this is their way to at least minimize the risk, but overall, futures trading is very risky, and I don't recommend it for newbies.Spot trading is more of a safer way of trading. Safer = less profit. Futures trading is very risky, but it gives way more profits than that of spot trading. I guess what's important in trading is that, you always set a stop loss because anything can happen with crypto. We've seen Bitcoin pumped days ago so the shorts for sure got liquidated because of it.As for me, I'd go trade with futures trading because I already experienced trading in spot trading.",
