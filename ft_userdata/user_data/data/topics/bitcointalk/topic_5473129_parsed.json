  "content": "Hello community,sup...I am currently facing a challenging situation with my client's Bitcoin wallet. Despite diligently exploring all the solutions outlined in the previous discussions regarding stuck transactions, I've yet to resolve this issue. It's been months now, as the problem initially arose on February 18th, and the transactions remain unconfirmed.I kindly request the assistance of anyone knowledgeable in this matter who might be able to guide me through the process of confirming these long-pending transactions. Your support would be greatly appreciated.",

How is anyone supposed to help you with such a lack of information?Who is rebroadcasting such a transaction over and over again to keep it alive for more than half a year?Anyway, if you don't control any of the transaction's outputs, you can't use CPFP. If the transaction originated from a custodial wallet then you can't use RBF, because not your keys, not your coins' control.",
