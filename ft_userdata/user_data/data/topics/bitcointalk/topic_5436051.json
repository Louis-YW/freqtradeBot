You can check product uploaded pages on this demo product link Link RemovedAlso as described earlier it is not good idea to publicly share all uploaded products as they can contain personal data. We will try to find some solution for displaying products in a market way if seller agree to post it publicly. But again it will be a mess to control spam and fake products on market.",

Participants and potential buyers would find it difficult buying what they have no idea about. If you want it anonymous, there is no issue about that but it would be nice one knows what he or she wants to buy if not seeing it, bit atleast a little description can help a little in having idea what sellers are offering to sale. I also have a look at the site although it is a new on but the IU is not attractive but a kind of dull to say. If I may ask how do you confirm to know that the person downloading the file is the one who paid for it. Do you not think that one can copy a transaction hash and claim they paid for it? How does it work?",

Like if you have made a website or made a new software you can sell its source code. You can sell your new music. You can sell your digital art. Video editors can sell their edited videos to clients. If a file content is unique and you only want to sell it to limited people then there is an option to set sell limit. You can sell a file for like 1 time or as many times as you want. It is like a digital store. You don't have to worry about payment and product delivery. Users can ask the person sharing product link for their product demo, screenshots, videos etc. And they can buy from sellers they trust.",

We do not provide escrow services but you will get what seller uploaded after making payment. Buyer must do that on their side.Our system scans for viruses and we keep data encrypted so our system is protected. But for buyers someone can still upload a virus protected in password protected zip files so buyer must trust the seller before buying. That's why there is no option to view all products that are uploaded on our platform. Sellers only share links with their potential buyers themselves.",

This as an protection for the buyer in case there is some that try selling inexisting items that they don't actually have ! .. like this the buyer may ask for a refund...

So making the service like this do not do not provide any addition than just like making a direct transaction between to seller and the buyer!There is a field to add description to each product. Maybe you did not saw it. Kindly check this product Link RemovedIt is not like a direct payment. You can just upload files and then you can sleep after sharing your product link .People will keep buying and you will receive payment without need to always send them files each times. Also Buyers do not need to wait for you to come online to send you files. They can pay and get your products anytime. Consider it like you have 100 website codes to sell. You can add description of each product and maybe include screenshot or video links for your website demo. After one time upload you can paste links on services like pastebin and share pastebin link. You have just created a digital store. You don't need to make a website for selling your products. You do not need to manage payment addresses etc. Consider it in big numbers and you will see difference i.e 10k buyers of 10 products in 1 hour. https://selldefi.com/ saves a lot of time and management work and I hope people will start using it once they understand it.",

For example you paid $100 for buying a product. You closed the tab and then came back after 1 hour. You can open product link again. You will see same bitcoin address that you have already paid to. Just click on \"I have paid button\" and your download link will appear. Product purchase information is stored on buyer browser cache which can be used to download product multiple times without paying again until they clean their browser cache.",
