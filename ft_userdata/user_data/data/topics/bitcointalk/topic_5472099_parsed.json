This issue has been opened in 2018 and it's still opened: https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/issues/181Which phone are you using though? Maybe you can use \"Dual apps\" and run a new instance of the wallet instead. I tried doing that with other wallets before, and it works fine.",

I tried doing that with other wallets before, and it works fine.I am using Android 13 but the phone is only support app twin for social media sites like Facebook, Twitter...But the phone is having a better feature in a way that you can have multiple users. With multiple users, you can have another user or more with different contacts, files and others apps included just like new phone. With it I can run Samourai as a new app like a new phone but on the same old phone.I just ask this question to know how true it is that Samourai is not having a way of creating more than one wallet.",

You could search the entire phone and the Samourai app is nowhere to be found. The only way to access the app is to dial your PIN into the phone pad as if you were dialing a number to call. In doing this, the Samourai app will launch making is accessible to you.",

My phone have a better way which I explained above. With my phone, you can setup many users and each will act individually with different apps, files and contacts. This is better and private than app twin.The ones I have tried before on app store have ads, I hate ads and it can lead to scam and misuse of my private information. Most apps are free because they are embedded with ads. Who wants to avoid malware should also avoid ads.",

The feature where you can spend unconfirmed coin is actually amazing, especially when during period of slow transaction. Also does this wallet support cold storage?",

As long as it's a non custodian wallet, you can implement cold storage on it by keeping the wallet offline or on an airgapped device.",

Also you can use Electrum as the watch-only. https://samouraiwallet.com/sentinelOn Samourai, click on you icon at the upper left corner -> settings -> wallet. You will be able to see your legacy, nested segwit and native segwit master public key which you can import into sentinel (provided if your Samourai wallet is offline)But I will prefer to use cold storage on Electrum on a desktop device instead of a mobile device.",
