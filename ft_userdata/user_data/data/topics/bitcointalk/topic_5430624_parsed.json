Did you deposit crypto or fiat? If crypto then do you mind giving the transaction number so that someone really realize that you indeed lost money. If fait then a screenshot of the transaction although screenshots can be manipulated. Whatever you do, are you a stupid or something else?Sorry to ask you so many questions. Fact is you should not deposit any money to a casino which name does not exists in the industry. It's created only a few months ago and going to expire in less than 2 years.",

Is this your first time to deposit on this site? Why deposit big if you are not so sure about the site? Again, this is a reminder that we should always do some research about the site we are going to play with so we can know if we are dealing with the legit site and avoid any losses as much as possible.",

Also maybe next time try to deposit on reputable casino since nowadays we can't trust the new since some of it created only to last for days or week and scam their depositor so much better to be aware always about such scams.",

I advise you to open a proper scam accusation thread with all the evidence needed and link to the website if possible, so that at least other members of the forum will stay away from such casinos.",

I suggest the same thing mentioned above to open scam accusation on the board following this format[1].On the other side, i will suggest to DYOR always when you are trying to use any financial related site that require deposits especially to a newly made website.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0",

Did you try checking to see review  about the casino before getting involved in dealing with them?  It is obvious that people can not take a little time to do a proper research or due diligence before investing or dealing with projects.Nevertheless, how do we believe you irrespective of this post you made here to be genuine there are no facts or evidence here to back up your claims. Maybe transaction hash could be ok but you know sometimes this kind of post are done most times as a result of bias which ends up in a sour state between the bettor and the casino and as a result sometimes the bettor would want to get their own pound of flesh back by doing the unthinkable to tanish the reputation of the casino.The casino in question seems to be a new one because I have actually checked this platform round and can not see anything about the casino. I think they are yet to identify with this platform so therefore dealing with them at your own risk but anyways it is nice you called our attention to this event so we could take caution.",

With how old the casino is now, we should be able to know if it is a scam from the deposit and withdrawal history of its addresses which some people has already said it is indicating the casino site to be for scammers.",

By looking the site it offer \"150% deposit bonus\", who else don't want a deposit bonus right? And that's what probably lure him to register and deposit there without making a research the reputation of the site/casino first.",

I mean before depositing you should at least have a background check on the site where you are depositing. It only proves that you don’t care about your money and you have plenty of money to giveaway to scammers. The site’s name is also not looking professional. Moreover will you also like to share how much money you lost? It will be really an example for all the newbies who are always in excitement to try new sites. From next time onwards, always double check the casinos, and if possible play on old and reputable casinos.",
