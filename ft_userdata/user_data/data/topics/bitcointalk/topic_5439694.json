Are you using tools to this determine the AI user?Or it is simply because they are having low-quality posts means they are using AI bots on posting here in the forum.Conversely, output from ChatGPT has good English...But since it's a bot, it has no opinion/perspective, so it won't use strong language to persuade. It rarely uses phrases, I, I think, You, IMO, etc.It also over-explains things, try inputting \"What's AI Written Post?\" on ChatGPT, It'll starts with the definition, the example, the conclusion, and it'll repeat \"AI written post\" keyword frequently. This format/pattern is easily noticeable.Oh, the bot also can't write personal experiences (memories) among other flaws. Perhaps you can instruct the bot to include phrases/things I mention so it will be harder to detect, but normal users won't be bothered to do that.Quote from: ajiz138 on February 13, 2023, 01:07:07 PMYeah, I tried using several AI detection tools but the results are not the same, sometimes it's wrong to look at ChatGPT posts or from humans whether it's really AI or not and actually there is no accurate detector that is correct to prove that it's a post AI.Try google \"GPT Detector\" and you'll find many websites. Just test which one you like the most. But you should be able to suspect/detect a post before using these tools. It is only for confirming your suspicions.",

At that time, many accounts were banned for copying one sentence.Anyone who values their account should think about it. It is likely that this plagiarized machine may one day repeat its purge.",
