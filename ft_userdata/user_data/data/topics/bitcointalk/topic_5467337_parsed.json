  "content": "Alik BakhshiAzerbaijan begins to eliminate the illegal regime in Karabakh            In connection with the decision made on the final liquidation of the illegal military regime in Karabakh, Azerbaijan sent a message to the population of Karabakh, warning about the introduction of the army in order to eliminate terrorist gangs illegally located on Azerbaijani territory and restore the constitutional order there. This decision is fully consistent with UN resolutions on the territorial integrity of the state of Azerbaijan within internationally recognized borders. At the time of the introduction of troops, the Azerbaijani government recommends that the civilian population of Karabakh stay in their homes, do not have weapons, do not wear army uniforms, do not obey the orders of the military junta and stay away from military equipment and all administrative buildings where the illegal regime operates.         After winning the 44-day war, the Armenian nationalists who seized power in Karabakh did not lay down their arms and continued to terrorize the population of Azerbaijan, violating the peace agreement and preventing the return of refugees. Naturally, this situation could not suit the Azerbaijani authorities, which ultimately led to this decision to put an end to the nest of terrorists entrenched in Karabakh.       19.09.2023",

And we can see that CSTO is such pointless organisation. Russia had few thousands peacekeepers in region, but they didn't played any role in this conflict. Seems that Russia is loosing influence in region.",
