  "content": "I have this colleague of mine at workplace who is a bitcoin enthusiast just like me. Often times at work when we're less occupied with our job we kind of spend such moment's¬† discussing about bitcoin generally. Two days ago he was telling me about his plans to start buying BTC with 20% of his salary every month for the rest of the years he has to retirement that's when he will then take it all. And based on the company total years of service he has 16 years left to his retirement.With the way he was talking to me about it he appears to know exactly what he's about to do and how its going to end for him. But for me his idea has left some apprehension and questioning in my head due to the length of years (good 16 years) he is going to keep up with. From my angle the years are too much as no one can certainly say for sure about what the future of cryptocurrency and bitcoin holds despite how positive it could be looking today.In my opinion I wanted to talk to him with a logical conclusion why he should reduce the length of years, not to do it at a stretch of straight 16years he has in mind without applying risk management technique, maybe by splitting those 16years into four interjecting years. As in he should in every 4 years be taking 50% of whatever total amount plus profit¬† till it gets to the 16years he planned. At least in worst case scenario this method could save him something reliable to fall back onto.How do you guys think about this idea of mine for my colleague? Can it really be helpful to him in the long run or it may just obstruct his original plan killing the whole idea?¬† Please all opinions are entertained but whatever your opinion might be, also try to put the length of years involved into consideration.(16 years)",

And based on the company total years of service he has 16 years left to his retirement.This is certainly a great plan because the percentage set for the investment is actually a percentage that most experts actually advise on when investing into bitcoin. Also the year is quite long couple with the fact that this isn‚Äôt a one time buy, the monthly buy looks exactly like someone applying the DCA method which minimizes the risk of lost because it will be quite hard to have bitcoin way below its intial value after 16 years (this has been proven by past trend of bitcoin).

So i second your suggestion of him taking the profits off after the very halving, since every halving has the potential to make each bitcoin grow to multiple times its price. This profits can be used to buy other assets that have stores of value or used to open up business(es). The profits from the business(es) can then be used again to buy more bitcoin and then same process continues on each halving. This will minimize the risk of depending on one source of retirement income",

      "body": "I think your colleague's idea is not made by keeping any risks factors in mind, he simply made the most simplest retirement plan of saving 20% in BTC every month, and if i am not wrong, you are suggesting him to buy/invest in BTC after every four year maybe with 50% of his total savings. If that's what you are suggesting then, i totally agree with you because in this way, your friend will be able to buy from every dip, no wonder he would not be able to get benefit from 100% dips but he would be able to increase his profit ratio unlike by his own 20% plan.I think he preferred this plan because he is not that technical person or he did not wants to spend so much time on analyzing the market and so far, in my POV (to some extent only) if you are holding for 16 years, its like fours halvings, then analyzing the market did not matter at all.But if he could follow the market trend and put money accordingly instead of every month then his profit ratio will increase",

In my opinion, they can continue purchasing Bitcoin over the course of 16 years while also taking advantage of its volatility in the interim. This approach does not involve active trading but rather long-term holding. For instance, when Bitcoin's price surged above $60,000 and subsequently dropped to $16,000, your friend could have capitalized on such opportunities. Although there is a certain level of risk involved, it is preferable if the plan succeeds. If not, they can still continue with their ongoing strategy of buying Bitcoin.",

I feel he should not dive into this if the saving is really towards retirement. Money saved for retirement purposes should be kept as safe as possible. I want to believe that the organization he currently works with has a retirement saving account for him already because this is done for all employees in my home country. In my country, there's a retirement saving plan called AVC(additional voluntary contribution), which is an additional voluntary inflow save towards retirement, here the employee can instruct the employer to deduct an X amount of money from the salary and add to the mandatory contributions. I will suggest that your friend take this type of approach because Pension contributions are largely invested in secured investments with minimal risk instead of investing his hard earn money in BTC for 16 years.I will also suggest that he can do like 5% in BTC for the duration of 16 years(Take the interest as often as possible) In my own opinion,20% is too high. However, if the retirement plan stated above is not available in his workplace then he should invest 15% out of the 20% in a more secure investment because he's saving towards retirement while 5% goes into BTC.",

As the years go by, he will always keep an eye on the Bitcoin trend, because if anything goes wrong, he still has his Bitcoin in control and can decide whether to sell it off or hold it. Bitcoin is not like every other centralized system that will ask you the reason why you want to sell your coin or not. Just like the banks, there is a particular huge amount you will keep in the bank, and any time you want to take it, your account manager will ask you what you want to do with the money. But Bitcoin is not like that; your friend can keep accumulating and holding it in a cold wallet, which he can also sell at any time of his choice. Perhaps he is not investing every part of his salary into Bitcoin (just 20%), but he still has the rest to do other things with, even if it's to use another 30% to carry out other investments. Then he can use the remaining 50% to solve his expenses.Cheers ü•Ç, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange üë∫üë∫",

If one is not certain what it could look like in 16 years then you are equally not certain how the next day or week would affect the currency.We sometimes refer to how cheap it was 10-12 years ago, but to have been able to benefit from the price increase you need to have held for a long period of time, close to the retirement plan of your friend.16 years isnt a very long time, I agree but it depends on what age you are when you start!TBH those in their 20's, 30's or early 40's doing this long term retirement plan tactic is a great move, they can esentially retire early! but for those who are older, working this plan meansthey have to work until they reach retirement age to benefit from that 16 year outlook so I would rather in my 50's work on a less than 10 year plan in order to retire early too!!as above we have all wondered at the value of Bitcoin 10 years ago, fast forward to 2043, whatwill we think/remember of todays Bitcoin values?",
