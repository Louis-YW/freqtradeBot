If won by the Democrats, all house bills will be stopped in the Senate.Even if the GOP will have the Senate majority, and ALL GOP congressmen and congresswomen would support such a bill, they cannot override the president's veto power.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto_power_in_the_United_StatesThe Land Lease will go on uninterrupted.And Ukraine can expect an extra large package for Christmas.Also, with a majority of just a few seats, Kevin will need to get all the normal republicans and the trumptards to agree for him to have any power....good luck with that.",

The demand for re-done elections is growing, with hand-counts rather than voting machine counts.Calls grow in Arizona for new election after Kari Lake “loses” in extended recount following widespread polling station problems on Election DayQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-11-21-calls-in-arizona-new-election-after-massive-polling-station-problems-election-day.html#Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake is not the only one who believes the extensive problems at polling stations around Phoenix on Election Day earlier this month are grounds for holding a new election after her alleged ‘loss’ to Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs, who did not campaign much, refused to debate Lake, and, as secretary of state, led the office in charge of balloting.According to a press release from the group U.S. Election Integrity Plan, an “open letter authored by Arizona citizens calling for a new election continues to be circulated throughout Arizona. Citizens are demanding the new election is run without electronic voting equipment and mail-in ballots. Arizona citizens are proving to be a persistent, powerful force.”The press release adds:Key excerpts from the letter clearly express the seriousness and commitment of the Arizona citizens, “We the people of Arizona deserve better, and we demand better. We demand transparent, free, and fair state elections.”  There is no confusing the citizens stance on the ground, “Elections belong to the People. Stolen elections are illegitimate.” The letter closes with a promise, “[citizens] will peacefully descend on Arizona until the new election is conducted.”The release goes on to state that Arizonans have taken it upon themselves to begin sharing the letter via email, and by calling officials and posting it to social media in order to put additional pressure on “officials, legislators, candidates, and law enforcement.”One deadline has already passed for officials to stand with concerned Arizonans who support a new election, but the objective is to convince officials to act before the election for governor is officially certified — by Hobbs’ office, no less.“It appears the citizens of Arizona are on a roll and getting a boost in shaping a viable solution. Kari Lake and Charlie Kirk have both shown support for a new election specifically in Maricopa County,” the press release stated, referencing Turning Point USA founder and CEO Kirk....",

Her Voters Tell a Different Story. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/maricopa-voter-complaints.html)Quote from: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/maricopa-voter-complaints.htmlWhen he stepped inside a Phoenix polling place on the morning of Election Day on the way to work, Kevin Bembry was told that the tabulation machines were not functioning properly and he might want to vote somewhere else.“I’ve never had that happen before,” Mr. Bembry, 57, a security officer, said in a video later posted online.His testimony was one of many circulated on social media by activist groups, right-wing media outlets and Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor, whose campaign posted Mr. Bembry’s video along with several others on Thursday.But a crucial element has been missing so far in all of these accounts: clear claims that any eligible voters in Maricopa County were actually denied the chance to vote.The video the campaign circulated of Mr. Bembry, for instance, was an edited version of a longer video posted on the site Rumble. In the full video, he states that, despite the inconvenience, he cast his ballot at a nearby polling site. “I was able to vote — no waiting, no misreads of the tabulation machines, nothing,” he says.",

Mark Kelly a full six-year term in office. But the race for attorney general was heading to a mandatory recount once the election is certified by all 15 counties and the secretary of state.

So far, Mohave, Conchise, and Yavapai counties have refused to certify the suspect election.
