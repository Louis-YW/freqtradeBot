  "content": "I'm going to tell you a little bit about how Bitcoin passed through my life 3 times...I worked at a company at night and sold video games in Paraguay during the day at the beginning of the last decade and used the rest of the morning/free time to read about different topics on the internet, trying to make good deals, make good purchases abroad, etc.Until one day when searching I found a foreign website (I don't remember which one) that accepted Bitcoins and sold some retro games that I considered good products, at the time Bitcoin cost a little more than 1 dollar, and as I had access to buy with It was easier to use dollars via PayPal and it didn't make much sense for me to pay more with Bitcoin, this was my first contact and my biggest regret.¬†I didn't pay attention and I didn't have the sensitivity and knowledge to see the opportunity that passed by me...Many years later, Bitcoin appeared randomly in my random searches on the most diverse subjects, it was worth 4000 USD. I was going through turbulent times financially and it never crossed my mind to have that amount on hand, after all, in my ignorance I imagined that you could only buy 1 BTC and not fractions of Sats, in short, it took me many, many years to get really interested and come to truly understand the power of decentralization and the revolution that is Bitcoin.¬†The third and last time it came into my life was through the bull run boom, where everyone was talking about it. I lost a lot of money due to lack of knowledge. At this point I decided to stop and study, delve deeper and try to definitively understand what BTC was and for me it was one of the best decisions I've made in recent times in my life, it gave me peace of mind, opened my mind, gave me views on the world and about the things that completely transformed me into a better person.¬† ¬† I was able to understand what true freedom is and the countless possibilities it can bring.¬† ¬† I understood that a person has to decide their own destiny, it is their responsibility alone. Don't outsource things, don't play the victim, in short, be the protagonist of your own life, Bitcoin and what it represents simply frees you and gives you an incredible mental expansion. I just have to be grateful for having known you. Could it have been earlier in my wanderings on the internet? Yes... I've already blamed myself so much for this, but there's nothing to do, simply each person in their own time, that's how life is, that's what makes it beautiful. Each one living in their own time.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has a lot than profit and it wasn't created for it to be an investment but rather as an alternative payment method through p2p, and to also give people financial freedom from the government by making them to be their own bank. I think that is the major purpose and biggest benefit which is her decentralized nature. From what you said, it means that if bitcoin price dips down below your entry point and stays for long, you wouldn't call it the best thing that has happened to you. The profit should be seen as the secondary benefit because it was the decentralized nature that made so many people to adopt bitcoin in the early days, but from what I have observed now most people adopting bitcoin are only after making profit and that is why they end up buying when the price is high and before they know it, when bitcoin price dips below their entry point, they will panic and sell and run at loss.",

Bitcoin itself is just a currency, but it's true that when diving a bit into how it's different from fiat and what kind of ideas it implements, you can learn a lot and rethink how freedom looks like and what kind of freedom is possible.I'm not sure whether Bitcoin is the greatest invention after the Internet because it's hard to pick one thing like that for me, but Bitocin is a practical application of libertarian economic ideas, and I'm glad that we have it around.",

Take what you've learned and keep going.Bitcoin is more than just a currency, for me it's something that goes much further, with it you learn many things, how to be more patient, how to deal with things you can't do anything about, be persistent, resilient, consistent...Everything in our lives, whether personal or professional, is achieved with hard work and most importantly: discipline, I only really learned that with bitcoin, I'm very grateful for that.Although volatility initially scares those who are not used to it, it brings countless benefits to life, dealing with problems in a much lighter way, after all, you only do what you can. Being in this environment and in this alternative market is simply the best choice I've made in recent years.Quote from: Blitzboy on December 06, 2023, 02:22:23 PMYou've been through the highs and lows of Bitcoin.

Take what you've learned and keep going.This is really true, each person has their own unique path, and things happen in their own time.But the interesting thing about what you wrote to me made me think, many, many opportunities pass through our lives and we simply don't realize or can't see them, sometimes I catch myself thinking about this, that I should be more sensitive to opportunities, but it's something that you can't guess, we only see it when time has passed. There's nothing wrong with that either.That's life, anything can happen at any time, opportunities come and go at all timesThank you so much for your answer",

At the time when you came to know about Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin was 1 dollar but you looked at 1 dollar as big because at that time we did not see so much popularity or so much potential of this coin. It would be wrong to say that you didn't have a dollar because if you had known then that Bitcoin could come to such a state, you would have managed a dollar or a few dollars and bought Bitcoin. There is no point in worrying about what happened in the past. We think about the present. We can invest in Bitcoin with the idea that the price of Bitcoin can reach 100,000 dollars from the current state of Bitcoin price.",
