  "content": "For a time now, I've been trying to learn more about the technical side of bitcoin, and I've heard that I can do so here. I so made the decision to ask here in the hopes of discovering a better explanation for some of the things I don't understand. I discovered that a blockchain system consists of numerous nodes dispersed over the globe, each of which keeps, confirms, and updates its own copy of the ledger upon the creation of a new block of transactions. I don't seem to comprehend how more blocks increase transaction security. And How do blockchain confirmations work?",

But which likely that the transaction would be confirmed again.But also about the fear of using a low fee in which the mempool is congested to the extent that a low fee transaction is dropped from mempool.",

If the transaction was confirmed on the second-to-last block, then it takes the cost to produce 2 blocks to reverse it, because just re-producing the block your transaction was confirmed isn't enough; if you redo the work for that block, you invalidate the next ones, so you have to redo the work for all the next blocks.",

Higher confirmation also reduce risks of your transaction become unconfirmed again due to block re-org. See https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/chain-reorganisationWell ultimately, even in the case that a reorg happens, your transaction will be included in another block again but this time it will be buried under a bunch of other blocks, which should not be a problem to most businesses as they are accepting transactions with at least 2-3 blocks depth. So where is the risk here?",

So all this is about unconfirmed vs confirmed tx , count doesn't metter much. unconfirmed tx can be just rejected without reason specified(to you).",

All the consensus rules are clearly defined and are enforced by each individual node. There is nothing to \"pretend\", the nodes will always follow the chain with the most amount of work.Quote from: serveria.com on February 12, 2023, 09:59:07 PMOnce a node validates a transaction, it propagates the transaction to other nodes in the network. If the majority of nodes in the network agree that the transaction is valid, it is added to a block of transactions.That is not how bitcoin works.Node verify transactions for themselves not for the network. The miner is also using its own node (or the pool that is using its own node) and if that node considers a single transaction that nobody else has seen or verified, it still can be added to the block they mine.Quote from: serveria.com on February 12, 2023, 09:59:07 PMOnce a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered confirmed. The confirmation process involves adding the block to the end of the blockchain and creating a unique hash that links the new block to the previous block. This hash creates an unalterable record of the transaction on the blockchain.Not entirely correct. Confirmation is the other word for mining a block which is the process of finding a hash that is smaller than or equal to the target. The hash you find doesn't link the new block to the previous one, the fixed 32 byte hash inside the header that you mined is the link to the previous block.Quote from: serveria.com on February 12, 2023, 09:59:07 PMThe number of confirmations a transaction needs depends on the rules of the specific blockchain network. In general, the more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure it is considered to be, as it becomes increasingly difficult to alter or reverse the transaction with each new block added to the blockchain. There aren't exactly any rules about number of confirmations in each cryptocurrency. It is more like the result of the other rules that exist in that cryptocurrency. For example an altcoin with \"fast\" blocks requires a lot more confirmations to have the same security. Or an altcoin with low hashrate that can be easily 51% attacked or a centralized altcoin with a mutable blockchain can never be secure no matter how many confirmations there are.",

Binance is a centralized exchange. Whatever happens in their internal data (mostly trades) doesn't reflect on the blockchain. Only the actual deposits and withdrawals do. Plus, binance has no block explorer. Plus, Binance may convince those who don't understand bitcoin to withdraw wrapped bitcoin (ie on a different blockchain); this last one may make transactions \"made by binance\" not be visible, but not the other way around.If Binance cannot find a deposit made on the actual bitcoin blockchain, then they have an error.BSV is a shitshow, not a story. BSV was greatly centralized. This allowed CSW push code that offers him control.BTC is still decentralized and I expect the vast majority of BTC users would not accept such a change (at the very least they would not update to that version).",
