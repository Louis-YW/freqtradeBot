The best is to make your own personal research which might take some days weeks and months, and if you are present very well on a forum like Bitcointalk, you will know more about gambling sites. Just be in gambling board and scam accusation and reputation board.Know that review sites can be very fake and not all are true. As I have been in this forum now, I know the gambling site that I can use and the ones that I can not use.",

Haven't you played any games before withdrawing yet?They also have a representative on the casino.guru site, haven't you tried discussing your problem with him?",

They are just some random casino out there but not to mention, OP you have no much evidence here to back up your claims. You claimed they owe you money how much did you deposit with them? What games did you play with them to gain $99 which you claimed to make withdraw. Present concrete information and evidence here so that members can intercede on your behalf otherwise you have no or case at hand.",

But deposited a small amount after checking on casino.guru where they have a good rating. This is the first time I have heard of this casino site. I see that their rating at Guru Casino is very high, reaching 7.9/10, but haven't you seen that there are so many comments complaining about withdrawal problems and also accounts being randomly banned?  This is a lesson for you, I hope your problem is resolved soon, and never play and make deposits at any online casino again, it's better for you to only play on online casino sites that have an ann thread on this forum and have been reviewed by many senior members here.",

You are also supposed to know that reviews on casino guru and the likes doesn't mean much and shouldn't be trusted.I've checked your post history and it seems this is not the first casino you're having issues with! Are you by any chance from a restricted country or we're gambling is prohibited?",

It's crucial to be cautious when dealing with online casinos and gambling sites, as not all review sites are trustworthy. You've been trying to withdraw your funds for over a month now, and you're still having trouble which is a big red flag, other players should avoid this casino.
