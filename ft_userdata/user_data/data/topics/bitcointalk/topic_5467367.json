However most miners will still drop out of the game because the reward reaching each miners will be very low compared to all effort put into . Na wetin me I think be dis but I believe sey you guys go still get plenty opinions and ideas wey you fit add abi wetin una think.",

Bitcoin mining no go last forever, when the last bitcoin will be minned around that 2140 time, miners go come stop to dey receive bitcoin from mining but dem go still get their reward based on the transaction fees and this one no mean say dem go dey get small money because only God knows how active the bitcoin blockchain go be by that time. Just imagine what local banks dey run daily based on transaction, now imagine that amount globally for the bitcoin blockchain, because adoption go dun increase well, miners go still dey cashout. Quote from: promise444c5 on September 19, 2023, 07:06:53 PMHowever most miners will still drop out of the game because the reward reaching each miners will be very low compared to all effort put into .My own prediction na say as many altcoins dey migrate from proof of mining algorithm to proof of staking algorithm, it means there'll be more miners without a job and dem all go switch to mining Bitcoin and no forget say the price of Bitcoin today no go be the price of Bitcoin those years wey you dey see for that image. In future, while the block reward for miners dey reduce, the price for Bitcoin go dey go up so those miners still dey profit irrespective of how small the bitcoin dem dey get as share for mining a block be. But sha las las miners go still dey drop because the competition go too much for retail miners to benefit as all those big cooperations wey get mad mining facility go take charge. Ps: reduce image size to 200 or less.",

However most miners will still drop out of the game because the reward reaching each miners will be very low compared to all effort put into . Not really, however it could cause problems for certain miners if the price of BTC after the next halving falls below a minimum of $45-50k, forcing most of them to sell their HODLs or dilute shares in order to stay in the game. As the hashrate increases, so does the price of BTC, therefore miners will continue to earn unless something unexpected happens, as I explained. The fear of miners will be if the government passes mining tax and the price of electricity also go up.

That is, there are people that get paid to just mine BTC or cryptocurrency and it is a full time job, yeah.Also, BTC still got to get to 21million as already estimated and how do you think this can be achieved without mining being a main processor to this effect?I have a solid doubt that mining will get scrapped, no matter the slash in the miners fees after the halving or for whatever concerns the miners have to deal with on personal or environmental level.",

Bitcoin mining hashratesThose are images of the hashrates since bitcoin was recognized and since last 3 years. You can see that hashrates has always been increasing, except in few times of decrease which will be followed by increase.

As bitcoin price was decreasing after 2021 all-time-high of $69000, hashrates continue to increase.

Although, I can understand you, that if bitcoin price decreases, miners will not make money as it was before when the price increased, but there are other factors that should be considered.However, my previous assertion was slightly wrong because the price of Bitcoin affects the hashrate rather than the other way around. The number of miners causes the increase and decrease in hashrate; when there are less miners, the calculation (hashrate) to mine a coin becomes easy (low), and when there are more miners, the calculation (hashrate) to mine a coin gets difficult (high). Hashrate decreases reflect a decrease in the number of miners, while hashrate increases reflect an increase in the number of miners. The only thing that keep miners in business when the hashrate is high and ther price of Bitcoin is low and there's isn't good profit is their previous HODLing. Price (BTC) against Hashrate in the last 3 months.",
