      "body": "I think it's a case that they're actually being bought per share for less than bitcoin at the moment. There's a few reasons for this: the main one is it looks like it's the main part of their business, their revenue is about $500mln and their profits aren't great (they're profitible too unlike most tech stocks - this may make them less attractive). There's also news of them holding leveraged longs on bitcoin (with low leverage) but holding a leveraged position is still riskier than not.",

There are 9.33 million MSTR shares outstanding according to Yahoo Finance.  Quote from: Jumperman4 on July 28, 2022, 01:55:15 PM129,699 is the amount of BTC they own as of their previous 8-k as of June 29th, 2022.Some napkin math (no idea how accurate this is, just going off some things I found on yahoo finance).If there are 129,699 BTC held among 9,330,000 shares, that is 129699/9330000 or approximately 0.01390128617 BTC per share. With a current share price of $273.70 and a Bitcoin value of $332.27 per share, you can see that they are also using debt of which they currently have 2.44B.The debt comes to $261.52 per share.  They also have around $10 in cash per share, so we'll say there's $250 worth of debt and $330 worth of Bitcoin for every share of Microstrategy.  That means with no leverage (they are using a little) and no profit (they had profit of over $400M last year), you would expect to see the stock trading at around $80 per share.  This shows the market believes greatly that Microstrategy will continue investing in Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin price will rise.  Perhaps I'm overlooking something with my quick calculations, but it seems that GBTC gives you more BTC than you pay for, while MSTR gives you far less.  The difference being that GBTC has to sell BTC to pay management fees while MSTR buys BTC with income.",

I am not going to dump my IRA.they might be forced to sell. MSTR creates little to zero annual profit compared to marketcap and debt. They are mainly getting more and more debt and buying bitcoin. Now imagine who is the buyer of this debt. Who is investing in debt that is being converted directly into bitcoin by unprofitable or hardly profitable company. In case bitcoin success its much better to invest in bitcoin rather than corporate debt with 7% interest. If bitcoin fails ... microstrategy wont be able to pay back. The only reason microstrategy is getting cheap debt and someone is buing their junk debt papers is because of TINA (there is no alternative) and corporate debt bubble - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5344525.msg57259351#msg57259351.But not anymore. In case FED will rise rates to ~10% (low chances but its possible, in 1980 they were forced to set rates @ 20% to fight inflation). Who will lend money at 7% to mstr. They will be forced to get it @ 20% or higher. And it wont be founds for new pruchases of bitocoin it will be a new debt to roll over current debt. At this point it will be ponzi. Its dark scenario that most likely wont happend but isn't it better to buy bitcoin by your own and avoid this risk (and many more)?",

      "body": "I get how some people think that they're buying \"cheaper bitcoin\" when buying sort of proxy bitcoins through the likes of MSTR and GBTC, but really — is the fact that you don't have the non-custodial aspect of bitcoin not worrying to you?The only way I can somewhat justify such decisions is that if I can actually sort of \"redeem\" the BTC sometime in the future, which you could potentially have with GBTC if it ended up becoming an ETF, but definitely not with MSTR.",
