I don't have an overview of all precise problems. To all victims: Could you send me a PM with your email address and / or User Id and the size of the amount with which you have been disadvantaged. Please also indicate what exactly happened so that it is easy for me to make an inventory of the case. If the claims are valid, I will personally ensure that all victims still receive the crypto they are entitled to.The domain 1xbit.com is still available, but only for administration.

We're interested to hear back your thoughts too. Best Regards 1xBit TeamI understand your concern, but 1xbit never changed their management some years ago. It was a trick to lure people to their site.We can ensure you we are a legit company and we took over all the customers and like I said, I will do everything to make sure everybody who got scammed, will get paid the amount in full.For me it is okay to speak about this, since the previous people didn't care about customers and people have the right to know what they are up against now and before.Yes of course I need the account number, I do not need the password. I want to solve the things as soon as possible for everybody so we can start with a clean sheet after we have paid everybody.",

I'd say it's uncountable and you'll get a lot of spam and you may get some unwanted or even fake claims. Let's say this is legitimate but I think 1xbit.com should be the one to announce it rather than some new account or just forget 1xbit there are legitimate casinos out there.",

You can click the reference because that issue is verified. It’s nonsense to ask every victim to PM you because most them is already active long time ago here in the forum.

As you mentioned, your company has acquired 1xbit.com and what about the social networks associated with 1xbit, now when you switch from the site to twitter, you get to their old twitter account where there are no such ads, it would be nice if you created an ad on the site itself 1xbit1.com , there are also no ads in the telegram channel. You could first make a footer on the home page of the site 1xbit1.com which would lead to this thread of the forum to confirm that you really are a co-owner.",
