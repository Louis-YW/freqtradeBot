Even some high rank on here correcting me an I'm glad that there doing like this ,and maybe could  other felt like that they are really good or pretentious but my perspectives they do correcting and suggest other's cause they are concern and they love their low rank freind.   Beside we can earn we can master here in how to trade and invest and it's really important that we learn on this.    Before that I really don't know what is Bitcoin I think my mind is blowing until I'll start researching one by one and it's really pay off on my learning.   Even I've learned more things in here I'm always remain who I am Cause I believe being humble magnifies who really we are.",

It's a very important line when you're a newbie, don't think about what you'll earn here, instead, think about the knowledge that you may absorb and learn that may use to improve your skills in crypto and I'm glad to hear that in you. Many of us here love to join technical discussions, to learn and gain knowledge.  This forum is very helpful to us and as long as you've followed the rules and guidelines you are safe here.Respect for each other would be a result of a good community which we applied here. Quote from: Spontaneous on October 10, 2022, 10:28:34 PM  Even I've learned more things in here I'm always remain who I am Cause I believe being humble magnifies who really we are.Keep it up and be a good Samaritan.",

Accepting correction will encourage you to be even better. The Bitcointalk forum has many high-ranking users who are always ready to guide you to gain knowledge in order to improve your ability to continue to have integrity in the forum.Quote from: Spontaneous on October 10, 2022, 10:28:34 PMBeside we can earn we can master here in how to trade and invest and it's really important that we learn on this. The will to continue to learn must always be planted in you, there is a lot of knowledge that you can use as capital to continue to be in the forum. One thing you should avoid, never make forums your main job, because forums do not give you a guarantee that you can continue to make money.",

Even if you are really new to bitcoin and have no idea about computer science, programming, or game theory, people here are always happy to point you in the right direction for where you can find more information about the topic that you don't fully understand. So, don't be afraid of asking good questions, but before doing so, use the search button because it is likely that someone already has asked the same question and been given a helping hand. Google or forum search may save you time, but, what is more important, when you do your own research before asking a question, you save the time of others. But please, try to never ask for financial advice because there are no financial consultants or experts here, so don't expect people to give you the right answer to where you should put your money. If you lose money following someone's bad advice, you will blame that person but not yourself, which is both unjust and counterproductive.",

Another point is interesting; themes in newcomers are repeated in meaning, and I wonder what motivates their creators?Viral? Wasn't there a similar thread recently? Love and interest in the forum, as the idea of creating a topic is the same, the difference is only in the name.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5386209.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416488.msg61089156#msg61089156",

Even though how far you already achieve but always remember that when you respect your juniors you will be more respectful in their eyes. This is the reason this forum has been alive for a long time, we can't develop without the help of other users, mutual respect and respect for fellow users has been instilled in this forum for a long time.For me this forum is very special because not just anyone can easily master something on the forum, when in this position it is highly recommended to hear guidance from a senior to understand all the material contained in the forum. Users who are more senior always respect Junior or Newbie, they never feel tired of answering at length every question from their Junior. The Respect attitude of Senior users is very helpful for new users to adapt here, not necessarily outside the forum there are those who want to guide us properly from A to Z.",

I think even theres a disagreement about certain opinion, a user should not get highly emotional and get mad to someone for opposing his ideals. Thats normal and we dont have same opinion about a lot of things.",
