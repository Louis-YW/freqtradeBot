It was obvious what will eventually happen with BlockFi ever since they got $250M loan from FTX back in June in order to remain operational so people had enough time to withdraw their money.Just hours before that announcement they claimed that platform has no issues whatsoever and that it remains fully operational and we see what happened. So next time when you see similar \"encouraging\" announcement coming from your exchange, take the money and run. https://twitter.com/BlockFi/status/1590705864448495616",

All exchanges base their value/liquidity on the basis of investors' money. They borrow on that basis or even reinvest that money from their investors/customers and of course, it is a problem for liquidity when a large number of investors want to withdraw their money from there. they should be aware of that and take care of other people's money a little more.",
