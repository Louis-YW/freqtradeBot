I support him but that doesn't mean I will completely believe in what he claims and promises.    Due to the volatility of bitcoin, using it as a strategic reserve is actually a bad idea. I believe this will never come to fruition, it will certainly face strong opposition and will not be passed by Congress even if he proposes it.",

Required reading. To anyone that thinks bitcoin get the government out of debt just NO. They need to be able to print more money.Got surprise about this? Trump is known for this. For sure they would never think about bitcoin as good strategic reserve since they are afraid for its volatile feature. This people don't know how to deal with bitcoin that's why their confidence is to low that's why they always go to more safer asset. Usually they select gold since this is more stable and we can't expect that they immediately adapt bitcoin even if they have statement that US will be a crypto friendly country since they still think bitcoin is a risky asset.Although this is still a interesting article since many people would question the intentions of Trump if he's for real on his statement regarding on his intention of crypto. But want to see more actions if he win so hopefully we will not get disappointed on his future action.",

      "body": "QuoteBitcoin promotion by the White House would chip away at the status of the dollar at a time when sentiment towards the currency is likely to be tested.That is nonsense from someone who doesn't understand what Dollar is and how it became powerful.Dollar is powerful because the US regime managed to scam the world into using it. First through the scam project called Bretton Woods and later as the world learned it is a scam they replaced it with the Petrodollar scam.That is also the reason why dollar is losing its \"dominance\", since this was all a scam and the world learned it and they are abandoning it (aka the dedollarisation).Bitcoin doesn't change any of that.QuoteMoney is more than...The author seems to not understand the difference between money and currency. Dollar is not money, it is currency!Quote bought into the story that it was a democracy and that its capitalist, free-market economy made it the strongest in the world.That's another nonsense. Those who bought into the story \"illusion\" did it because they were forced to do it. Europe and most of the world was destroyed after the second European War (aka WW2) while US was the only place intact and they forced their scam on the world. Then they kept the scam going by force, meaning for example if any country wanted to dedollarise the US regime bombed it back to stone age (eg. Libya). Quote[debt]The main reason why the world is dumping the dollar is not the massive debt and the fact that US economy is now a Ponzi scheme. The main reason is because the US regime abused its power by stealing other countries' money. They've done it to so many countries that it scared the whole world. Now everyone is asking \"what if the regime did the same to us as well\". So they started looking for an alternative reserve currency and started dumping the dollar.",

People are not as naive as you think, no one trusts Trump and no one will support Trump if they don't benefit if he wins. Crypto investors who voted for Trump are just betting for their own benefit, because if he is elected and actually supports crypto, the crypto industry will benefit greatly and crypto investors will be the ones who benefit the most. Everyone has their own reasons and calculations when voting for any candidate, no one is naive enough to not know that politicians are not trustworthy, be it Trump or Harris.But to be fair, I don't believe the idea of ​​using bitcoin as a reserve strategy is viable, it's still too early to think about that.",

Of course for many, those ideals don't mean anything, and all they want is the price of Bitcoin to go up in the short term no matter what the consequences are to society, our economy--or even Bitcoin in the long run.All that said, my own prediction is that if Trump does anything at all with crypto (which is doubtful), he will make Bitcoin illegal in the US and make himself and his family trillions of dollars replacing that demand with his own fully-owned crypto. Such a move would be trivial in his position as president of the US, given his absolute control over his own party.",

Tell me, is there any politician in America who is a good person, keeps his promises and never lies for his political purposes? That's just the nature of politics and all politicians are liars.Likewise, Harris' campaign keeps making thousands of different promises, isn't their goal also to gather as many votes as possible? Besides, what guarantees that she will keep her promises after being elected? Those things are so normal and unsurprising because that is the nature of politics, so I call it their strategy.

Otherwise, you can look for as much as you like to pay it off, even with Bitcoin or another asset, but if it continues to grow at such a rate, then this problem will never be solved.",

They used to control it (more or less) by directly or indirectly controlling oil producers (directly controlling dictators like the al-Saud in Arabia and indirectly controlling others like Venezuela by sanctions, installing US controlled governments, etc.). Even that control is lost as we saw over the past couple of years that even the dictators in Arabia no longer listen to US orders.Similarly in bitcoin, the regime can not control bitcoin price by only owning a certain amount of it. They'll need to control the global market which is nearly impossible in my opinion.Similar to oil they could perform market manipulations (eg. dump bitcoin from their strategic reserves to slow down the rise) but similar to oil price they won't be able to control it (as we see oil doesn't want to come below $80-ish no matter how much oil reserves the regime releases).",
