  "content": "Dogecoin success brought about many meme coins especially those that decided to go with the name of the first successful meme coins which is Doge, one of those project is DOGECHAIN and has been receiving many attention recently. This project claims to be able to bring applications like Defi, NFT etc to dogecoin lover and that's something dogecoin holders hasn't been able to do with their coins since its lunch. Now the token is pumping with news of 80% of the current supply of dogechain been burned. The story has been all over twitter in the past weeks. As a result Dogechain has received massive investment and has done over 8x to 10x depending on the exchange you're viewing the charts from. Now that this project has pumped this much in a bear market, are you buying more as speculation are indicating it'll pump more or will you be selling your coins or keep holding. Memecoins are pumping, could this be a start of the recovering for the market that we have been discussing about?.",

But now people are turning away from meme coins.  There is not as much hype in the market towards meme coin as before. So I personally am not in favor of this coin and am not thinking of investing here",

It seems like that DC was taking a huge step just like shiba inu https://twitter.com/DogechainFamily/status/1586095566123307008The developers were trying to burn lots of tokens to the burn address. It seems like the current pump will not be so long. I think that they hype caused by the pump will be gone once people will be trying to short it again. Selling would become the best choice in this case. Im sure if the price of DC will be going down again as soon as possible. A short term pump.",

Besides, I've wasted a lot of Doge just for the quiz reward that I made, if you're from Indonesia and have an account on VIP (now Indodax) since 2016 or 2017, maybe you know that. I'm not interested in buying Doge again.",

I don't hate memes and I'm holding doge and shiba. But for dogechain to do the same thing as doge or shiba it takes more effort. Meme can't grow on its own, at least one celebrity or influencer can help it grow. Like doge and shiba get where they are today thanks to the support from Elon. Besides that, it also needs large community support and the interest of investors, especially if it can attract the attention of large companies it can make prices increase drastically, but it will not last long when the hype decreases it can have an impact on falling prices and the impact of falling prices can be triggered by some investors who sell  their crypto assets for short-term profit. That's why many people say it's not recommended to invest in themTo achieve this, Dogechain needs to deliver its road map, do superb marketing and maintain the hype of the market.  If they can do this, huge investors and crypto enthusiast will take notice of the project and possibly join the Dogechain community.",

Dogecoin has proven itself as one of the potential coins that can give you a return on your investment if you hodl.Doge and Shiba have given me a reason to believe that some meme coins can still be worth something in the future if it has a good team and community supporting their vision.  You can regard doge as a meme coin but I don't think I can regard it as one since many altcoins are making use of its blockchain(dogechain) for fast and cheap transactions.",

Congratulations on your gain but not everyone will look at that past of meme coins. Many don't like these coins because they are pure hype and no one will think of it as something valuable as of today. Since the bear market has come, many of them have become low in value and that makes people learn from this mistake that it's not worth it at all. But just as you, as long as people are willing to lose the money they are investing, that's what it should be.",

Anybody that had the token and took your advise will be thanking you by now as they were saved. Most time when it come to memecoin, is best you sell when you see massive profits as dogechain provided in the past few days then wait for the market to calm down then buy as others are panic selling. Saying you'll just hold can see you lose all your profits and capital if the market gets a bigger hit.Dogechain will just use another news to pump the project in the future, but for now we should be expecting more dump as profits are been taken from the market",

You can't classify Dogecoin or Shiba Inu as a shit coin or unserious project. Most of this meme coins are even serious than the actual projects you call serious. Wasn't FTT called a serious project but today it isn't in existence anymore. When investing in meme coins, I think we should consider those that the team are actually active and building something of use like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Meme coins in general has grown to a stage that they can't be ignored any longer.Dogechain which this topic was created about has fallen to a buying range and if the market doesn't continue dumping then we could see some rally upwards. I haven't looked deep into the project but I feel we might be having another dogecoin/Shiba Inu type of story with dogechain.",

Dogecoin's ability to be a functional cryptocurrency is just as questionable as it isn't really a \"special\" coin.If you look at the concept or philosophy, I don't think Dogecoin will ever be able to compete with the many alternative cryptocurrencies that have been introduced in recent years.For this reason, it seems unlikely that investors will want to invest large sums of money into Dogecoin in the future, leaving its market value vulnerable.",
