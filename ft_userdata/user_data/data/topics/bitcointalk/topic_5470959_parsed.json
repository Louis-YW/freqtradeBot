Victory is as a result of different struggles, Â so I believe say one day this country go better, Â it will be a country we all go dey proud to call it our own.",

We missed the opportunity for our voices to be heard and the 1% elite assume immutable and immortality same day. The electoral violence of 2023, abuse of office, human right abuse and police brutality have come to stay just because the mission of 20.10.20 failed. The same people that ordered the killings are now in power, where do we run to? I don't know how long darkness will rule over us! I am not seeing any help coming soon because all the institutions and agencies have been bought. Our solace is now on God even though He has given us everything with which to prosper.",

Nigerian government don't want to develop the country and dat was y they use the military to killed the youths. That protest was for the good of the Nigerian police and the military but they misunderstood the real meaning of the protest and killed them. That killing pain the meaningful Nigerian and not the president or it supporters. Responsible women, and men cried that day. And that shows that Nigeria is not for the betterment of it citizens for to kill them.There was a strong unity in the among the Nigerian youth and they work together to achieve the purpose of the protest. I pray for the loss souls, May their should rest in peace Amen.",

What actually transpired in that incident is a bizarre adventure to me and I don't know why we had to lose those young guys to that incident. Everyone had it's own opinion to the incident but my humble opinion was that they could have avoided that violence if they had went back home immediately after the peaceful protest. Some celebrities were at that event but they did not encounter the incident because they left for their homes after the protest was said to have been called off but the bitterness in some of the youths could have triggered those casualties. We also heard that the project was highjacked by some bad influences that were sponsored to cause damages but I think God knows best what actually happened.Regardless of whatever it was that happened, the army is nor suppose to shoot. You don't shoot innocent and unharmed citizens in the name of provocation. That's a bad decision that the army made.I also don't think the government handled the case properly. There's not enough transparency and wide condemnation of the incident and the decision of the army by the government itself.However the case, it sent some messages to the government itself and the uniform men to be more professional in their duty and value for life.",

Instead what they did was to change there name to another thing, it was so sad for those innocent people to have died in vain and up till now the federal government has not apprehended any of those hoodlums. It was actually a pity the way they died so painful, but however they will always be remembered.",
