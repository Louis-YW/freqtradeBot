The section will likely attract most of my posts and I would move majority of my old important posts there, all for more comments from high quality posters participating in signature campaigns. By high quality posters I mean members whose posts are honest/true, very important, deep/imaginative, useful, sound, creative/knowledge-based, evidence-based, etc How do we solve this if such section does not exist yet?",

But signatures are allowed regardless and it's not for a specific niche, like Development & Technical Discussions.Quote from: Ucy on August 15, 2022, 09:44:31 AMHow do we solve this if such section does not exist yet?AFAIK, such a section does not exist and for it to, we need to have extreme levels of moderation on the existing boards. (I believe existing boards, like Bitcoin Discussions or Economics would fit the idea, if it had less spam)Signatures normally attracts all type of posters as there are bounties/campaigns for different users, majority of which are spammers, so strict moderation would be necessary.",

It's difficult to answer without knowing what threads you are thinking of moving and where. Also, some threads can fit in multiple boards and moderators can have different interpretations what the perfect board for a thread is.The best thing would be if you could list the threads you want to move, state where you would like to move them, and then we (including staff) can share our feedback if that is the way to go.",

In other words, his idea boils down to how to present his content, which is fundamentally off-topic or deals with politics, to members who are not interested in such things.I would like there to be a board that could perhaps be called \"My fairy tales\" so that everyone who has some strange ideas and imaginations can enjoy their fantasies without hindrance - for example, \"how to influence the price of Bitcoin with my posts\"",

If it fits both the Serious and Off-topic discussion, it isn't allowed or isn't counted by (most?) campaign managers. Making a Serious Discussion thread means you pretty much want to discuss something outside this forum, so it's normal to not count.

I have never seen it happen though, but I wouldn't be surprised there is such an option. However, my previous reply remains accurate in the sense that OP can't move his posts. He could request and report them to be moved, but I seriously doubt the staff would bother moving posts from Off-topic to Serious Discussion or similar less important sub boards. Such functionalities are probably reserved only for quality contributions that would be a better fit elsewhere.",

It's difficult to accurately understand, because it seems you are not making sense here. Let me analyse this;First, you want a board that is neither Serious Discussion nor Off topic, then what will be discussed in the board is 40% bitcoin related and 60% off topic, and then signature quota will count there. What you are asking for is an off topic promax board , where someone can officially spam and fantasise. There is no kind of discussion that would be more serious than bitcoin discussion in a bitcoin forum. Again, someone seeking for a serious discussion shouldn't be mindful of posts count, so Off topic best fits your idea if it's not related to bitcoin.",

But there are all kinds of us and it is not right to judge someone by his views, religion or nationality, but when someone wants to take advantage of himself financially by trying to sell pure speculation and fantasy, then people on the forum should react and warn others of the possible danger. I'm not sure if the OP edited all his posts asking for donations in case his prophecies come true, but it's not normal to make such claims, much less ask for donations because of them.I think it's an off-topic board that supports everything that doesn't belong anywhere else, even though I was a bit sarcastic in my previous post and stated which name would be more suitable for members who live in various fantasiesüßö‚Äç‚ôÇ",

I think sometimes it gets forgotten, but signature campaigns exist on Bitcointalk, they aren't part of the rule set or influence our decisions on a moderation stand point. Therefore, changes aren't likely to be made with signature campaigns in mind, unless it's directly addressing the issues that signature campaigns cause. For example, spam getting so bad that they're eventually banned. Obviously, theymos has stated they don't want to do that unless absolutely necessary. Only post in serious discussion if it's (for a lack of a better word) serious . Nah, if it's of high quality, and you want to generally receive more serious, and higher quality replies.",

You should be posting casually having fun on the forum and helping bitcoin advance. If you happen to make a few bucks while doing so, then it should be considered a bonus.",
