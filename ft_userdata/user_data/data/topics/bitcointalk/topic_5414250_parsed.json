  "content": "I see this that lets go to war means let us ulter the existence of certain economic progression. Apart from death of people both soldiers and the civilian, it take back the system backward from the party in the war but the effect is more on the people not in the fighting, the world at large. It is effect more on the world as it increase inflation and reduce the living of the people of the world if the countries have major contribution for the world economy.The effect of war include rising inflation, extreme poverty, increasing food insecurity, deglobalization, and worsening environmental degradation. All the effect here are what we see in the Ukraine and Russia war, example is inflation that is affecting different country in their economy because products going out from Ukraine like wheat or corn leaving out there in small quantity and expensive. Russia is not supplying energy to Europe neighborhood and that slow access to production in the region there and causing life to be difficult. QuoteRussia is a major supplier of fossil fuels, especially to Europe. Disruptions to supplies of these commodities are driving up prices.The degradation of environment is also there if war happen and this is major effect on agricultural produce leading into the food shortage and insecurities around that. There are many negative effect of war but no profit and   rebalancing fiscal priorities could prove quite challenging even in advanced economies.",

But there are some people and companies that benefit and are not really affected whenever there is a crisis for instance, the manufacturers of guns and ammunitions, pharmaceutical supplies as well and relief materials are always in profit.",

The need for raw materials makes the economies of the world highly interconnected, and this is what makes crises spread and affect all countries very quickly in the so-called domino effect. The crisis of the Ukrainian war should give lessons to the countries of the world in working to achieve self-sufficiency while reducing the need for external resources.I also hope that this crisis will end quickly, but it seems that there are no indications that this will happen soon .",

Even though the existing victims were replaced with economic progress, I still don't really like this because apart from the economic impact, the psyche of the people involved in the war are definitely affected.",

The problem is the exploitation of densely populated cities as hideouts and fortresses, in addition to using people as human shields during confrontations.The rules of war that no one respects require that the conflict be between armies and not against the population. It also requires the availability of a battlefield and the provision of humanitarian corridors for civilians, while neutralizing hospitals and shelters .",

A way to attain a lasting piece as it is served, out of the ashes, life is birth. Its something we all hope to avoid but it happens anyway and rarely.The war between Russia and Ukraine is regrettably and it has lasted more than most of us would have hoped or estimated that it did but, we should be rest assured that its going to bring a lasting peace between both nations even though individuals will still hold on to there grievances.A little backward might bring about a galloping forward match to a better civilization, a correction towards most of the ills and its would be one that is won out of pain.",

Rising inflation, food insecurity, and environmental degradation are just some of the ways in which war can take a toll on a country. While there may be some short-term benefits to going to war, in the long run, it is clear that the costs far outweigh the benefits. Countries would be wise to invest in peacekeeping and diplomacy in order to avoid the devastating effects of war.But one can easily provide a counter-argument like how war can spur innovation and economic growth. Additionally, war can create new markets for goods and services. Finally, war can lead to the consolidation of power by the victorious party, which can in turn lead to increased stability and prosperity.  Just look at how much industrial and technological growth we saw during the World wars and cold war  It's a very hot topic.",

War is expensive, in whatever form it comes and as such it must be avoided. Although most cases require that both parties throw a few punches to buttress a point, with modernization and the ability for disagreeing parties to sit together and reach a compromise, it shouldn't resort to tearing down infrastructures or taking lives before listening ears interfere to prevent a breakdown of economic and political order. Ukraine vs Russia war is impacting the global economy in almost all facets, in that wheat, coal, gas, and other tradable necessities available, is now scarce or unavailable or the price has skyrocketed so much so that it can't be afforded. Going to war alters the economic progression of the state(s) involved.  Peace is the only solution to economic stability and growth.",

All the finances spent on maintaining wars could be directed in a peaceful direction, to help poor countries that barely survive from hunger and lack of water. But none of the wars starts from scratch; it is always beneficial to those who pump millions into weapons production. And the actions of rulers who can influence the world with diplomatic relations between countries are always correct. But unfortunately, in our time, there are no such rulers who could act for the people, not for the country's prestige.",
