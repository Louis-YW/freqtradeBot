  "content": "Ropsten, Ethereum's oldest testnet, is about to undergo its transition to proof of stake — as one of the final tests ahead of the merge on the main Ethereum blockchain. While the exact timing for the Ropsten merge will fluctuate depending on a few variables, it's expected to happen on Wednesday, according to an official blog post from Ethereum.  The main objective of the testnet merge is to practice Ethereum's mainnet merge later this year. The Ethereum core developers have carried out merge tests in the past, including a shadow fork on the main network and another merge on a testnet called Kiln.This event will take Ropsten’s two chains — one proof of work, the other being the proof-of-stake beacon chain — and combine their code together. This is the same process that the Ethereum mainnet merge will go through later.Would it Effect the Price of ETH ?",
