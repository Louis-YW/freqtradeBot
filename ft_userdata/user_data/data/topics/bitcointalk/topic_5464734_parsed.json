I thought not, because the CPFP would only apply to the B to C transaction, and not touch the A to B transaction. Is this correct?First of all, for the transaction to confirm faster, it depends on how mempool is congested with unconfirmed transactions and how much sats you are willing to replace the fee with, if you pay a high transaction fee for Child pay for Parent(CPFP), it will confirm faster( most likely in the immediate block) but if you pay low a fee, it will stay in the mempool until a miner pick it up; If RBF is enable, you can bump the fee.In addition, the CPFP transaction is paying the transaction fees of A--->B and B--->C together, but how fast it becomes confirm depends on how you prioritised the fees.",

If not necessary to use CPFP, it is better you use a wallet that is supporting RBF and use it instead to pump the fee for a lower transaction fee.I think base on my understanding of the entire question it is only CPFP that would work out. The question is actually about C address bumping the transaction, C is the last Recipient address from the question and can use the CPFP method to bump the transaction from the remaining two unconfirmed transactions. The only address that can actually use RBF is address A because it remains the original sender of the coins. B to C transaction is CPFP and yet to confirm so B also cannot use RBF. So C address can not use RBF because it is the receiver address and RBF is done by the sender address which is not what OP is asking about.",

There is a chance that miners wouldn't consider RBF transactions (fairly rare) or not consider CPFP (which can be more common). Whilst CPFP can help to convince certain miners to include your chain of transactions into your block, RBF would be more straightforward and elegant.An issue that CPFP faces is also if the parent transaction has a poor propagation. The resultant child transaction would also have a poor propagation as well.",

This is wrong.Assuming there's an RBF-enabled unconfirmed transaction from address A to address B and another RBF-enabled transaction sending the fund from address B to address C, both transactions can be replaced by a new one paying higher fee using RBF method.If the transaction made from address A to address B is replaced by a new one paying higher fee, it can get confirmed faster, but the transaction from address B to C will be invalidated. If the transaction made from address B to address C is replaced by a new one paying higher fee, it can get confirmed faster and if the fee rate used for the replacing transaction is higher than the fee rate used for the transaction from address A to address B, the transaction from A to B is also accelerated.",

The Electrum one for example talks about checking the \"Replaceable\" box, where as Electrum has actually removed this option altogether now on the GUI and made all transactions opted in to RBF by default for some time now. achow101's post makes a distinction between making an opt-in and a full RBF transaction which is also fairly outdated since most good wallets have supported opt-in RBF for years and full RBF is now becoming the standard.Given the number of nodes and the amount of hashrate now supporting full RBF, then you can essentially now replace any transaction whether or not it is flagged as RBF, and so stuck transactions should be a thing of the past.
