If you wanted to identify that either the project or coin in which you are investing will stay for longer period of time or not then you should try to check their partners and the history of their partners.And you should avoid to join such project which looks ponzi because huge return is not a real thing. They will scam you by luring into huge return promises. You have to avoid projects that rug pulled, such projects are hard to identify until they did it. But some red flags might help you like see if they are active on all social media accounts like telegram, discord and Twitter etc. Because if they do not have any platform where a user could discuss with them then its a red flag. See, if such projects are late in completing their tasks according to their roadmaps. Because this shows their laziness and less interest toward the development of the project but more focus toward in getting fund collecting.",

      "body": "For starters, what you would have to do is to study Bitcoin a bit and realize what makes it essentially different from the rest of the cryptocurrencies, which in the forum we usually call shitcoins. There are some less bad than others but they are shitcoins after all. Then you will realize that apart from some being pure scams, which are created as pump and dump schemes, the others are not worth it especially compared to Bitcoin. A general rule to detect if an economic offer is a scam is that it has a too attractive profitability. In traditional assets, anyone who guarantees you more than a 10% annual return is probably trying to scam you, let alone if he offers you 50% per month and the like, as it is sometimes seen. In the crypto world the returns are higher but there is no guarantee of anything and it is subject to extreme volatility.",

Whenever a project promises you returns that are too good to be true, then just know that they are most likely to scam you. If a project comes into the crypto space and starts promoting its project claiming that they have some remedy to a certain problem or that its project offers a certain utility without proof, then it's most likely a scam. Another red flag is, using a fake team, most scam projects I have seen always make use of stock photos to create fake team members, you should also look out for those. If they aim that they have a mechanism that will help them main a steady price and so make the proof of their coin/token rise just know that they are only BSing and they have nothing of such nature.",

But in order for them to profit, they have to successfully \"sell\" the idea and dump mostly premined coins at the right moment and take the money of all those suckers who got caught on the hook.It's a game of cat and mouse, only the mouse gets the short end of the stick almost every time and I don't find it particularly interesting so I decided not to play that game a long time ago. Of course, it's not up to me or anyone else to tell others what they're going to do with their money, but if you're already investing in various crypto projects, be aware that most of them are pump&dump schemes, and that means you need to have the perfect entry and exit if you want to profit.",

Bitcoin is the only trustworthy currency.  Reading the project materials, spotting errors in the white paper, looking for promises of rapid currency growth, and other indicators are some ways to spot a scam coin. People fall victim to cryptocurrency scams in a variety of ways, but newcomers to the field are frequently seduced by initiatives that provide free tokens. Since they are inexperienced and lack knowledge, they just fall into their trap because they want to own a coin. People I know experience this; all they want is to wakeup and see a number of tokens in their wallet. Beware of airdrops because most phoney projects utilise them to defraud their victims as it is the easiest way to attract a bigger number of victims. Participating in an airdrop is a quick way for people to get cheated in cryptocurrency.",

Run a background check on the people behind the coin or project2. Try to understand their aims and objectives for the project work they developed3. Try know there liquidity pool, market cap and those major investors of the coin project.4. Research on their precious projects and success made in recent times on same field.5.

I can infer that XRP and PEPE, both of which attracted investors, for nothing but that their value increased in a short time and if you ask them about the reason for the investment, you will find them say i invest because the value may reach $ 100 or $ 10 which is a bad investment.Identifying scam coins is not as important as Identifying good coins for investment, and definitely avoiding bad currencies for investment means that you will avoid scam one.",

When huge funds are spent to promote a coin, it's a red flag for me. Any coin that is hyped by celebrities is not also for me. I see these actions as a means to attract people. A coin should grow generically and not attain a high price overnight. Coins that come with guaranteed and huge profit also looks suspicious.You will not get a black-and-white answer OP because the crypto space is complex and unpredictable. It all depends on your goals for venturing into the crypto space. If you want a long-term investment, Bitcoin remains the best. But if you want to engage in trading and make fast returns, consider altcoins. Always remember that trading needs some skills and is risky.",

      "body": "OP, one way to avoid crypto scams is to avoid altcoins. Truly, you can try your best to DYOR about any Altcoin project before investing, and it's possible that the project can be doing great at that very moment or for a few months, but the only question is: how long do you think the project can continue? Every month, there are different Altcoins coming to do promotion here on the Altcoin board, and before you know it, after the forum here, you will not likely hear about the coin anywhere; it will not even be listed on any exchange.I was going through the bounty board here, and I have come across hundreds of projects that did some campaign here, but those tokens are no longer in existence. Imagine if people who invested that time knew that the project would not exist to date; probably nobody  would not have invested back then. Most of those projects, then, look real; you would not even think that they would fail, but a lot of them do fail.So, the best way to avoid scams is to be diligent in your Bitcoin holding and investment; don't reply to any offer trying to assist you in multiplying your Bitcoin holding; don't share your wallet security with anyone; and don't go online and click on different links that you are not really sure about. Look out for news updates or trends in the crypto space, wallet security, and privacy. In the crypto space, let security and privacy become your priorities.all that 👆, and you will be very free from scams.",

Most cases of scam is through clicking a malicious link that gives access to your wallet for the scammer.Avoid too good to be true offer and never believe on a passive income without doing anything in exchange for your money. All offer that is too good is a scam. Don’t be tempted to try on this kind of sweet offer if you want to be safe on crypto.",
