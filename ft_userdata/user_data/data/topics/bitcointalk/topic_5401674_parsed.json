Like many of us use to say, if you can't hold for 5 years, don't hold for 5mins, and if you can't bear -28%, don't expect +28,000%. Make sure to have a long term investment plan, and while you invest and wait, you can trade actively on the side. Could be P2P or actual spot or futures/margin trading on the side to make little profits on the way up.Get proper education and clear direction, know what you are doing at all time and be patient.Many might have the education, but not having a clear direction and lack of patience is one of the reasons many (especially newbies) end up loosing their hard earned money to scammers.",

Make sure to have a long term investment planThis is a different topic. Actually two of them.1. People who jump in without looking around into certain altcoin that promises to make them rich (and scam them, obviously).2. People buying into Bitcoin at FOMO and panic selling at the first price drop. This second one is not scam, actually. And here a good plan and \"invest only what you afford to lose\" does help.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on June 07, 2022, 11:55:41 AMand while you invest and wait, you can trade actively on the side. Could be P2P or actual spot or futures/margin trading on the side to make little profits on the way up.This is a risky advice and I am pretty much against it. Trading is not for everybody and can get people lose money very easy, by buying crap at FOMO, falling for pump and dump schemes, or by using unrealistic leverage and so on. This is not for beginners; by far.",

I asked him a simple question what if the market crashed after he bought what will happen to his school fees he said there will be no option left for him, so I said that is too big of a risk and if you can't hold for at list 1 to 2 years then Bitcoin investment is not for you.",

It does not matter how long, or how many years you are patient and learn how to trade, the possibility of making consistent profit is wholly slim, and can even be said to be improbable, trading is somewhat risky business, and it does not matter how much knowledge you have, you can lose a lot of money in a very short time, and you making profits consistently is never guaranteed or even feasible.I would just advise people to be themselves, do not jump into things cause of either FUD or FOMO, there is quite a lot of thing you should even know about Bitcoin before either speculating or trading, people take all of these for granted, you can't jump the process and not expect to run into problems sooner rather than later. It is also important that as you talk to people about Bitcoin, you do your very best to also tell them that it is money/currency, and can be used for making purchases.",

It is no longer required to suffer losses in the present phase of trading because things are now made simple to lessen the loss.

Actually it's very obvious that experienced person can't be victim of scam because it knows the function and criteria of investment and also can detect a project that is a scam project within the time it seems it.
