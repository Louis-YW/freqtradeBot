The truth is that crypto can never be compare with most normal work, I no there are some good work that pays well but crypto life is one of the best, were as you don't need to be moving from one company to another and sometimes even getting a job you will be treated like  a slave, but in crypto you are the boss of your own, all you just need is a smart phone or a laptop to seat at your comfort zone and be making money without being noticed by anyone, though I no crypto work is not easy also but can never be compare with some physical job. Just like the hardship in the country this time, cost of living is high most people barely see something that could be fetching them any small amount but in crypto life is a bit easy even if there are some lapses but is the best. Also through crypto awareness most people were able to navigate other ways of working online to earn a living.",

Learning about cryptocurrency and trading is not a work and it’s not reliable, so you can’t compare it with having a work in the company or with the government. Cryptocurrency is here to serve a purpose, to be used for financial transactions and not a job you can depend on or compare with a work elsewhere. I know the point you’re trying to get at, but having crypto in that regard is just the secondary aspect of it that not all welcome it because of the risk involved. Owning cryptocurrencies or trading them is not a work, know the difference.QuoteJust like the hardship in the country this time, cost of living is high most people barely see something that could be fetching them any small amount but in crypto life is a bit easy even if there are some lapses but is the best. Also through crypto awareness most people were able to navigate other ways of working online to earn a living. Now you’re on track again. Having the knowledge of crypto can make you earn a living while working for a company that needs the service of someone who have crypto knowledge. This is different from having crypto in your wallet. This is now a work and you’ll be paid for your services to them.",

      "body": "Yeah, you are right, @OP. Crypto investment is one of the easiest kinds of investment because you don't really have to go to the banks to make some deposit or interbank transfer; you don't even need to sign some documents of agreement or get involved with a third party or stand in long cues. With Bitcoin investment, you can do everything yourself by just learning how things work and doing it yourself. Although Bitcoin investment and awareness have also opened most people to a lot of online opportunities that they are benefiting from, despite Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment, I still will not advise anyone who has a real job to abandon their job and put all their hopes on crypto investment. Well, if need be, let there be a balance, like, if you have an online job you are doing plus your crypto investment, it should be something that is really able to cover all your daily expenses and you still have what to reserve. Some people, once they start earning some money from the internet, they totally abandon their job or even the business they are doing, and when the thing on which they are depending is no longer productive, you see them hitting the street again to look for a job. It's good to learn from the mistakes of others and be wise while acting.",
