Few days ago he just speculate for Twitter say the price of Bitcoin fit reach $100,000 before the end of the year, and reason why he bought his first Bitcoin, which I go like make una answer some questions for this forum concerning this, and they go like this,1. If Robert Kiyosaki, one of the best author in the world wey know all the tips about wealth creation & finance, and yet still dey buy and hold Bitcoin, and yet we still get some people for this our country wey don read him book and yet still dey see Bitcoin as scam? What have you to say about those kind of people? Or abi Sir Robert need to update him book and include Bitcoin as one of the investment asset?2. What specific price wey you as a person think say the price of Bitcoin fit reach before the end of the year? (bcos me I no think say BTC fit reach that $100,000, by virtue of its current price now, but fit manage try reach like $50,000 at most)QuoteRich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has shared why he loves bitcoin and when he began investing in the cryptocurrency. Expecting to see $100K per bitcoin, he emphasized that the crypto does not need the Fed or government bailout because it’s “people’s money.”In a recent Rich Dad Radio show, the famous author revealed that he bought 60 bitcoins at $6,000 per coin. He also previously said he bought some more BTC at $9,000.Source link:https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-shares-why-he-loves-bitcoin-expects-btc-to-hit-100k/",

We Naija dey believe watin we experience pass watin another man talk and since some of us don first taste the bitter taste of some promising investment that turned out to be a Ponzi scheme we kon dey still use that eye look bitcoin.

      "body": "You can not compare Robert Kiyosaki to others, everyone has their views on Bitcoin. Many people disdain Bitcoin because of what they have pass through in life. They have been scammed 4 time without number so dem dey afraid 2 do things online. U remember weti happened in MMM. So if piple dey afraid of bitcoin, no crucified dem but if u go try convince dem, den try ur best. 4 bokiri matter, dat won e dey some how. No bi everyone dey read books, and also reading books e dey different from achieving ur financial  breakthrough. So those piple wey sae bitcoin na scam, na bcos of weti dem do pass through. Robert Kiyosaki knows di financial system and im country, big piple dey invest on bitcoin and im dey see their progress well. But we naija big piple dey even afraid more dan di ordinary piple. 4 di price assumption #100,000 is just like a dream. I don't think Robert Kiyosaki give that prediction, probably it's from di bloggers articulated it.",

I am not at all amazed that he too has come to realize the future of money, trade and investment as Bitcoin. His claim for it to get up to $100,000k before the end of year is only speculation but it could be close to the amount he mentioned, if not half the amount of $60,000.Tip? Buy BTC now, tomorrow may be too late.",
