That's a lot of money and I don't think the coin will ever touch $1.Then with the business model they offer. Isn't that a standard business model with new projects in general? I think there is nothing unique about this.Eco-friendly transportation? How do they make that happen? Isn't it better to seek funding from large investors like Softbank?Quote",

This is the first link you made https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465588.0Is it because the staff here in the forum that this project you are promoting is a possible red flag right away, and this is what I saw on your website? Do you avoid criticism that you read about the subject you are working on? The way you promote here on Qizoncoin is not good, to be honest. No offense to you, op.",

Previously you made the same topic here, hey mate, if you act as a promoter of the project and want everyone to know the latest updates on your project, you better make [ANN] on the appropriate board.A little advice for Qizon Coin team, it's not 2016 where people still trust buying tokens directly, so it's better for you to at least use a third party like PinkSale so that people have the confidence to buy, because even if you guys have a good idea but people don't have trust it will be useless.",
