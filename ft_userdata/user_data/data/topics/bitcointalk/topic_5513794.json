  "content": "I'm new to this forum; joined in order to do some research for this podcast episode of mine discussing the allegation in Money Electric that Peter Todd is Satoshi. I talk with crypto expert Jeremy Clark (pulpspy) about the allegation, including the forum post in question and Peter's behavior in the documentary. Hope it's okay to post something like this here; sorry if not. If interesting, Peter Todd watched my video and said this on Twitter: \"So far this is probably the best video on it! Admittedly, all you needed to do to achieve that was some basic research and logical thinking. But you actually did it unlike everyone else.\"The episode: https://behavior-podcast.com/is-peter-todd-bitcoins-creator-a-talk-about-his-behavior-and-language/",
