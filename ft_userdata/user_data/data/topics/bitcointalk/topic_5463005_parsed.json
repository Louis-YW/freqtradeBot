You can also visit their ANN thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=333552.0The OP on the ANN thread which is their official account on this has been inactive since January. I do not see any point of visiting the ANN. Quote from: joeperry on August 12, 2023, 06:05:24 AMThere have been previously accusation regarding the holding of funds from the players against Cloudbet but all of them were resolved.The last one from this forum member was still this week or last week. Let me look for it if I can still see it. Edit: this is about verification though, but all are related to withdrawal. (RESOLVED) Cloudbet verification stuck for more than 1 week. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462563.msg62666385#msg62666385Although the person has been able to get verified and has withdrawn the money he wanted to withdraw from the casino site. I will also advice dannesliu to be patient, but to contact Cloudbet customer care if the withdrawal is getting longer.",

The statistics they must have on how many people lose their earnings it they make them wait in order to complete the withdrawal must be overwhelming. That's why they do it. Instant deposits but delayed withdrawals, which are delayed the longer the larger the amount. It is true that for security reasons it is better to review and not allow instant withdrawals of large amounts but this and other cases are way out of line.",

That's enough to scream scam to a casino for holding it too long. Especially since we have seen many casinos just don't care about bad reputations as long as they still can operate.",
