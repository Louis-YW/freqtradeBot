If you are in need of more advice for cryptocurrency or about the crypto world in general. You can immediately read it on several trusted sites such as at cointelegraph.com and at bitcoin.com because there is a lot of interesting knowledge contained in these two sites. But if you are a very new Newbie here, I think the advice given by a forum user @Aliosky who is right above me is very suitable for you to read (OP).",

If cryptocurrency is already spread awareness on your locality then why not find a friend that will guide instead of starting from scratch. Also you should define your purpose on what kind of information needed since crypto has broad scope. Do you want investing, mining, developing or trading.You can browse the forum board and choose the category that you like. Just enter on the board topic that you choose view the sticky thread since it contains important info for newbie then use search bar inside that board for your specific questions to find answer on all the thread written there.

Like fiat, bitcoin is just money. Did you anticipate earlier that the traditional fiat system would grant you financial freedom? While its long-term value may rise, there is no assurance that it will grant you financial freedom. In order to invest or start your own business, you need a steady income, which means you need to put in more effort.",

My 2cent advice to you on crypto: If you want to learn more about cryptocurrency, this forum is a wonderful place to start. Look over the forum and familiarize yourself with it. Keep in mind that investing in crypto does not guarantee financial success. Although there are thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies, bitcoin dominates the market (number 1). On coinmarketcap, you can learn more about the rankings of all coins. When investing in cryptocurrencies, only use money that you can afford to lose. Don't invest all of your savings in bitcoin with the expectation that you will become financially independent soon.",
