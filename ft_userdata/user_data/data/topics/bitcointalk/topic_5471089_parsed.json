The sad thing about most of these herbal drugs is that they have serious side effects both at the present and in the future of the user.According to health practitioners, sex is supposed to last between the range of 3 to 15 minutes, and our youth have to understand that it is not a do-or-die affair, it is called love not a show of one's strength as a manI strongly feel that the pressure that if you don't last up to a particular time, that you're not man enough is the reason why most persons have resolved into the use of energizing/ herbal drugs.If una get wetin una wan yarn about this matter, make una yarn am.",

Sex isn't a marathon that you must last for a speculated minutes or hour before it should be termed enjoyable.People that takes drugs before having sex to satisfy a woman are causing a future health hazard to their body system and organs of your body. The side effects of those drugs is what you don't want to know reason been that if you do you won't dare take it. The more you take sex enhancement drug the more your system gets weaken that you can't sleep with a woman without taking those drugs and anytime you don't take it your manhood won't kick because it has gotten used to been kicked through sex enhance meds.¬†Now the question is this how long do you plan on taking those drugs all your life?¬† It's quite unfortunate that sex has caused a lot of young men to turn into drug addicts and very soon we might be having countless cases of organ failures diseases in the future 10 years from now among people that would be age 40 by then.",

Internet is a place to promote business and only the interested one's go for it. It's not a must.Quote from: Hewlet on October 20, 2023, 08:25:09 PMMost social media ads and advert is now centered on selling energizing drugs that will boost how long one lasts in bed and youths are seriously taking it at an alarming rate without considering the implication it will have on them in the future. The sad thing about most of these herbal drugs is that they have serious side effects both at the present and in the future of the user.Some of this drugs being advertised on social media are not really what it's painted. there are also herbal mixtures which can cleans your body system and make you feel like a real man. The problem of drug addiction is as a cause of the female gender not always being sexually satisfied. Normal sex is supposed to last for some few minutes maybe 5 to 15 minutes, but due to the female sex drive is always higher than the male, it becomes difficult to satisfy them except you go for 2 rounds. Lack of satisfying your female sexual counterpart always cause relationship breakup even in marriages. Sometimes married women who lack aprioprate sex from there husband commits adultery. Men now decided to keep there relationship by all means which now involved had drug. There is a pharmacy within my area when ever I go to buy medicine, young able and vibrant men both married and unmarried always come to buy sex pill.

It's good to do your work well, as that always make her to love you more. Women always love men that do the work well.I think you are misinterpreting drug for herbal mixtures. herbal mixtures is not a drug and it's preferable than drug because it's a mixture of natural roots and has no Side effect like drug. I don't want to mention any drugs but you go serch for yourself on Google.",

There‚Äôs no drugs that can enhance sex we shouldn‚Äôt be deceived that there‚Äôs drugs that can boost sex drive, quack pharmacist will say anything to just to sell their market, so that they can make their money, and if we continue to use this enhancing product may damage our system. ¬†¬† Sex shouldn‚Äôt be a do or die thing, after all women prefer romantic intercourse rather than all this hard core type. They feel more level of satisfaction when you make love to them rather than fucking them. And even if you come across those that like it hard there‚Äôs nothing to prove and no award attached to having the best sex, sex should be enjoyed by the both parties and not the man killing himself just to prove a point. Try some thing different this time maybe a romantic date out with your partner, all this experience are always the best.",
