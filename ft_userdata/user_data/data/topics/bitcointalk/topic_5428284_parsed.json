  "content": "This is something I don't normally do but I thought a few Youtubers are different judging from the quality of the project they talk about but since the beginning of this bear market i've noticed that three Youtubers that I have respect for are talking about the same projects and guess what happens in minutes ...The projects start increasing in value and after a day or 12 hours time the projects value start decreasing, ive monitored them so much that this claim is so damn accurate and now it happens every damn time..I'm starting to think, are buyers just getting them YouTubers rich in minutes to few hours time? Are they all Co-op in all this or its a coincidence? This is far too curate because it's now 5 different projects that they pump.I don't want to jump into conclusion here, are people buying because they are talling about the projects or these Youtubers are running a pump and dump schemes with some other people?No single Youtuber can be trusted, even if they claim that projects aren't paying them to talk about them trust me they have other ways to get fat taking advantage of you. I've I followed them anyways",

      "body": "It is most likely that these YouTubers have a stake on that certain coin. With the amount of influence and subscribers they have, the obvious outcome is that certain coin would definitely pump. Once the price increases at a certain level, these people now will suddenly sell all of their coins diluting the market, thereby creating this so called pump-and-dump scheme.Again, like what your thread title mentioned, it is all about money. People are taking advantage of their assets nowadays to earn the most profit they could get. That is why, be cautious and be careful on the altcoins you invest on. Make sure to get your influence from the knowledge of the market, not because some YouTuber said to invest on it.",

Make sure to get your influence from the knowledge of the market, not because some YouTuber said to invest on it.It is usually all about the money, you have no personal relationship with these Youtubers, so they are not talking about these coins just because they love you, have your interest majorly and want you to make profit, it is mostly a personal agenda to make money from influencing that make these people to talk about a project. If a Youtuber talks about a project, do your own to find out more about the project before investing, don't take their word just like that, the Youtuber has no personal relationship with you, and he has no business safeguarding your interest.",

Infact, when they haven't gotten the fame, they'll post trending things (real or fake) just so they get more traffic... But when they get verified, they'll simply be paid to promote whatsoever, as long as THEY ARE PAID.You don't have to hold any influencer as being responsible for any misinformation cus MOST of them don't even know too much bout what they promote... It's in your place to be guided by whatever informations you see. This could be collated with signature campaigns in here, right?!Sandra ðŸ§‘",

Their combined followers sharing the same decision to buy or sell could indeed affect the market. This is how a pump and dump scheme is created. They hype a certain coin or project causing many to buy. The price increases, as a result. People would then believe what they're saying is true. When the price reaches a certain point, those influencers, and whoever is with them or paying them, would secretly sell their coins causing the price to fall. They get rich, the flock gets poor. So be wary of these influencers.",

Although I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast that always recommend to invest Bitcoin because it's 100% decentralized and has very high security, I wouldn't advice to newbie to invest since they would call it scam when the price suddenly drop for 10%.",

I have been active on some youtube channels and realized that subscribers are so glued to the YouTubers that they buy any coin the YouTubers promotes and when the prices go up they'll hail the YouTuber and sometimes they're under the comment box crying over lossing money. Considering that they're marketers and the influence they've got on these people, affiliation is the only means of hitting big profits. I think it's their business and those who abide to the advise given on YouTube channels will have to pay for not doing their own research.",

It's the same with this stupid Youtubers out there and there are some who are really supporting them to a point where they are buying only the tokens these influencers are recommending. Well, it's always about the money, money and more money in the end. Why trust a Youtuber at first place? Why not trust yourself? These Youtubers are doing it for money purposes. I will not say any Youtubers, but there are many famous ones who are promoting different projects just for the sake of money. We can't blame those people who are still following their recommendations despite some saying that they mustn't. Let them do and let them realize that they're doing the wrong thing when it comes to investing.",

If you take these YouTubers at their word, theyâ€™re all just trying to help you make informed financial decisions through the reviews they provide. But if you look closely, you can see that they often use manipulative tactics to get viewers to invest in a certain coin. The main reason for that is people who bought the coins just for short-term gains and immediately sell them once it reached its peak price. The moral of this story is that if you really want to invest in cryptocurrency, then you should do enough research and serious due diligence. You should allocate some of your time seeing what different coins are about, not just try to chase after the ones with the most views on YouTube. Just try to exercise caution, do your research, and look at the market from multiple perspectives if you haven't already done so. Try and keep any emotions out of the picture when making your decision and stick to the facts. If you do, there's a good chance that you won't make any big mistakes and your investment will pay off in the long run.",

You have to understand that these people use the internet and available platforms to earn money and that they do it in a legal way - the content they present to the public is another matter.Pump&Dump schemes are nothing new in the world of cryptocurrencies, and some people certainly profit this way - but I'm sure most only have losses.

Many of them accepted payment for following the project's advertisement or the project team's promise to pay a portion based on objective achievement. It is extremely difficult to make money through those projects, unless you are lucky. This is because they constantly have a large number of influencers ready to buy their shitcoins and tokens in order to influence others.It will better for you to follow the foot steps of market price by having good research about the project you are going for. This kind of project prediction advertisement are also done by some artists especially musician buy telling their fans that they have bought some huge amounts the project and is strong project by hyping does shitcoin, not knowing they are doing the work for what they have been paid for.",
