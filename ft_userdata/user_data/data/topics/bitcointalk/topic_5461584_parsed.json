This comes after Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal, which affected global food prices.Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal led to a spike in wheat prices after they attacked key port infrastructure in Ukraine, disrupting exports.The six African countries receiving free grain are Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Central African Republic, and Eritrea.Most of these countries refrained from criticizing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making them beneficiaries of the grain pledge.Putin pledged 25,000-50,000 tons of grain to each of these nations, a significant portion of their imports but only a tiny fraction of Russia's overall sales.The move is seen as an attempt by Russia to position itself as a benevolent partner to emerging economies while removing substantial amounts of grains from the global market.Some of the recipient countries, such as Eritrea and Mali, were among those voting against a UN resolution demanding Russia's exit from Ukraine.Somalia, Eritrea, and Mali have previously received food shipments from Russia, and Somalia also imported grain from Ukraine under a collapsed safe-corridor deal.Genuine humanitarian effort? I think not. There are definitely underlying geopolitical motives involved here.",
