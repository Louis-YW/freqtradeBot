It also expresses frustration with the apparent contradiction between the statement of the RBI governor and the IT minister. Yes, these contradictory statements are creating confusion among the Indian cryptocurrency community, and it will lead to a lack of trust in the government's ability to make clear and consistent decisions on the matter. Furthermore, it is stated that the government will likely follow the RBI's decision, which further diminishes any hope for clear and consistent regulations in the near future.",

This is a new normal for us but it clearly means the future is not that rosy for the cryptocurrency community. I am not that confident about the government understanding or the RBI. What I have understood is that they don't have any clue and that they only think crypto as a tool to exploit as well as use it to destabilize the country.",

      "body": "I think government is quite clear as to the fact that ban on Cryptos is not a solution moreover even if you put ban on Cryptos enforcement of the ban. Government will end up making things more complicated  if they decide to ban Cryptos. RBI on the other hand has always been in favour of banning Cryptos because their intent is to remove it from banking system enforcing which is pretty easy, so technically there is a issue between RBI and govt, as a retail investor you really shouldn't be worried about anything until any concrete announcement comes from any of them.",

I think the government is only stalling the ban as the central election is scheduled in 2024. I am sure after that the government either will apply more harsh rules to completely eliminate cryptocurrency in India. They cannot go out and ban it as it opens the possibility for the community to challenge it in court. They have already reduced the volumes on Indian exchanges by those harsh tax laws and they will do something similar after the 2024 election.",

So the chances are there that there will be harsh rules against crypto in India.",

Nothing has been classified yet. It was only a point mentioned by our FM during last budget session. I am eagerly waiting for 1st Feb budget session to actually know what the government is thinking about cryptocurrency. Also cryptos really doesn't come under the purview of IT minister. It is really a finance matter so IT minister doesn't hold any say there.",
