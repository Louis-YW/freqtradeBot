  "content": "Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: Bitcoin Core RPC client version v24.0.1Operating System: Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)System Hardware Specs: ARMv7 Processor rev 4 (v7l), 1GB RAM and 1 Tb free hard drive space.Description of Problem: My node is up and running but is not reacheable from the internet. I use Code:curl -sL https://bitnodes.earn.com/api/v1/nodes/me-8333/ | jq to test itThis is the output of a nmap scan of my raspberry in my LAN:Code:Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.138Host is up (0.0048s latency).Not shown: 998 filtered portsPORT     STATE SERVICE22/tcp   open  ssh8333/tcp open  bitcoinNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.06 secondsI recently ask to my ISP to get me out from CGNAT and now my public ipv4 in my router config is the same as the one whatsmyip.org shows me. I also added a port forwarding rule in my router config:Code:Protocol: TCPExternal host: 0.0.0.0Internal host: 192.168.1.138External Port: 8333Internal Port: 8333But my node is still not reacheable.",

I don't understand how to make it listen to 0.0.0.0, what do you mean?0.0.0.0 is a special network address that causes a program to listen on all the network interfaces in the system.Try running Bitcoin Core again using the options -listen=1 -bind=0.0.0.0 , if that doesn't work, then try testing your SSH port to see if you can connect to it from outside the internet. I see it is listening on the local network (interface), but is it also listening on your internet-connected interface (that is, whatever IP address your ISP gave you).",

So it is something that OP should look into as well.<while we are at the topic of firewalls, somebody should make a firewall that monitors port 8333 for malicious traffic utilizing patched security vulnerabilities.>",
