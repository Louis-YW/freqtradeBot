Secondly, I use tradingview quite to often, why would they use another domain... honestly too many red flags here and you are right to call it a scam!!!Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on November 20, 2023, 02:43:25 PMMy question is how the scammers managed to pull this off? I mean using the official email of TradingView to spread their scam.Email spoofing...And unfortunately they don't need to have access to the official email address as they only need the targets address and good email layout to get to you and they work is done, it's upto the end-users to know this is a phishing attempt / scam not to fall for their tricks.***-off topic-I believe these are the same tactics they use to unlock iCloud locked phones as they send out some nice looking found your phone emails and once script is run its an auto off process **",

I didn't get any of this either but I was curious to look into this thread whether $TRADE was real.I can imagine how big this token would be if it's real. almost everyone in crypto I think is in tradingview and if the use case of the token makes demands, that airdrop will be huge.A careless trader who will be eager to receive an airdrop would probably connect.",

I mean using the official email of TradingView to spread their scam.TradingView has ever disclaimed all airdrops, but this one coming from their real domain is surprising. Initially, when I saw this, I thought you might have mistakenly not checked the domain email sender, but indeed you did and thanks for putting it across.On this, my takes are two, and the first is that we shouldn't totally conclude that this is not from TravingView itself. At times, some companies with that reputation take the backseat to observing the situation and mailing their lists might be the first step to the awareness.For the second take, if this is indeed from scammers, then it's possible that TradeView has been compromised either by an insider or it was hacked. And since there was no such hacking news, it's possible that TradeView insider work is involved or the company itself is involved but just pretending.Also, the domain \"trade.io\" that I could find online which matches the $TRADE token doesn't show any information, but just placed the domain name's text there.",

I mean using the official email of TradingView to spread their scam.It's Email spoofing, in short, when you send a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email. Since there is no second authentication to ensure that the sending system is authorized to send from that address, it is easy for the recipient's address to be headed to any address, but the internal data is different.Activate the whitelist for specific addresses and move the rest to spam. This way you will be sure that you will not receive phishing messages from a specific address.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofingTry sending me a messageCode:noreply@tradingview.comYou will find that the receiving destination is differentIf you open the email page source from the browser (Right-click and select View Page Source), you will find the real data for the sender in x-original-to email header, and then you will know the real email.",

This notification was relayed to your email address from the real TradingView domain. This is a reasonable explanation. My attention was drawn to the header which stated: \"Mentioned you in a comment to a mind\", I think the scammer created a chat group with the name \"mind\" and added new members randomly.

If it is the former then it would be really weird. I don't see how difficult it is to provide a template for something like that. Just a quoted message from the members tagging you will do that, including their names or something similar. Really an odd choice imo, good thing they solved it quickly.",

What the scammer does is to mention you in a post but this time round the post is advertising his malicious airdrop or token. Now, any average user who receives the notification may think it's directly from Bitcointalk because the sending email address is official.",

I mean using the official email of TradingView to spread their scam.The advancement of scammers in the tech space seems to be at an increase, most of the time, they break the very defences that you have so armed yourself with and you wouldn't even notice. Part of the reason why I always keep researching. Initially, once I get this kind of email, I check the sender's address if it has the same domain name as the orginal company url and if it doesn't then its a clear case of scam but for them to have pulled this off, then more research is to be done to stay ahead else one can become a victim.Tradingview on the other hand has nothing to do with tokenization as a business model, they already have subscribers and their clients are numerous and they are not complaining about it.",
