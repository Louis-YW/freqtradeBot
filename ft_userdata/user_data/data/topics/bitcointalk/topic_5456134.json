There his attitude is very clear, he will not revoke Red trust for any reason. It's hard clean up your account's reputation if you refer to references used by DT members, especially since some of them have long since left the forum.Give us one reason to support your accusation by calling This reputation system is pure garbage, your anger is so groundless, DT members will not act rashly when throwing chili peppers into someone's ass.",

Given you utilized the very same system to try to remove one particular negative feedback from sticking to your profile?Quote from: Thule on January 30, 2019, 11:09:35 AMSince i always demanded these DT members to be excluded from DT since the community has no trust in them at all ,only some leading DT members i will adopt that list into my trust setting to activly push Lauda and its cult out of DT.",

If you have a better and maybe flawless approach to the trust system, kindly suggest same to theymos. He'll be glad.1. If we saw that there are good arguments for that that feedback is all wrong we can do many things. In another topic some users decided that one from DT was wrong and distrusted him so his voice become less important. It is a hard decision so there could be other possible decision: if it was obvious we could write a good explanation why some DT members were not right and why their tags should not be taken into account and then leave neutral or positive reviews with links on that. And these are just two options we can do ourselves, not asking admin for help. So we are not so powerless and helpless.2. There were not all DT members who left the tags for him. Just several. And even a group of DT members of course can be wrong. And while I was looking through the reviews with blaming him in DT manipulation I thought it could be something like that, because DT manipulation should lead to distrusting not to negative tags. But then I saw some tags left for accounts trading and it is not something wrong to tag for it. So I decided not to waste time on research if later tags were right or wrong as it was long ago and matters not much in this case.If OP wanted to get some help from community it is he who should give arguments case by case. It is not what others have to do for him. And I see just his emotional harangue but no arguments to think about.",

I agree that a situation when several DT members are wrong in the same case is something unusual, I just say that it is possible. And as for this case if there will be no strong arguments from OP I suppose there's no reason for own research. Red tags for account or merit trading is what I support. So even if other tags could be revoked some way it has no real sense to waste my time on that.",

DT members don't have any arrogance or personal grudges when sticking someone's butt with red paint, they work according to the rules that apply in the forum.Op thinks like that because he feels he is standing in the right position, according to his point of view he has never felt he has ever made a mistake so he assumes that DT members have abused trust by damaging his reputation. I am one who believes in the workings of DT members who are still in a neutral position, they will not touch anyone if they have never made a mistake that has crossed the line in the forum.",

But there is some cases feedbacks become wrong. Let's say user receive negative trust for not returning loan. And after some time user who left him feedback dies or simply become inactive. User repays loan, but he still can't get rid of red trust. Offcourse, it would be wrong to remove all feedbacks left by inactive member or remove him from DT because all other his feebacks remains legit. For now such issue doesn't happens often, but eventually it will become more frequent.Sometimes DT members leave negative feedbacks when they have personal war against certain member or giving relatiory feedback, but that's not one of these cases.
