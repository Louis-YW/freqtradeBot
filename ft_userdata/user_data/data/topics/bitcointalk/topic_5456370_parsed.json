Even though bitcoin is still trading above $24k at the moment, the possibility of a drop cannot be ignored. I don't think prices will hold well over the next few months, so of course I need to set up a budget to plan my purchases and build a strong portfolio.Don't panic, do some analysis and collect some bitcoins if you have more budget. I will be doing this for the rest of the year and hope it will benefit me for years to come. Don't sell at loss, that's good advice for anyone holding it so far.",

There have been many speculations of a further deep price but the question is that when and how this deep will happen. So for that one need to buy all the way down and sell all the way up,  that is the best DCA practice for maximum gains for the short term. But for long-term gains then one needs to continue to hold and starch more at every chance.",

The volatility in market prices right now has something to do with the SEC, but don't worry too much about that because we're probably going to get more disapproval about it.I'm not sure what will happen in the short term, but today especially in the last hour bitcoin price has found a new dip.

An excellent strategy when bitcoin has decreased very well.Should bitcoin test the $20k support and the current economic crises doesn’t suppress and the exchanges continue to face the challenges they are currently facing then I see it also going down to like $16k again. Some few weeks to halving seems like a good idea to accumulate because I just sniff into the past price of bitcoin two months before halving and I saw that it normally experiences downturn and I think I would be looking into getting more around January next year. Even immediately after halving the market normally remains and only it the bull run at nearly a year after the halving. So immediately after halving is another good opportunity Quote from: Wiwo on June 14, 2023, 09:39:07 PMSo for that one need to buy all the way down and sell all the way up,  that is the best DCA practice for maximum gains for the short term. But for long-term gains then one needs to continue to hold and starch more at every chance. DCA can also be utilized for accumulating bitcoin for long term holding too, most especially a period like this that the market is fluctuating. If you are having extra income and need to accumulate then probably weekly or monthly DCA might seems better. Because if one wants to wait till the price hit the bottom a bit he might miss an opportunity because bitcoin still remains unpredictable",

The part that I see will always trigger a huge fall is the crashing of big firms with huge amounts of Bitcoin holdings, which always puts fears in the eyes and minds of some investors and will trigger massive panic selling, which I see as the reason to price dump. If such bad news comes out and people seem to overlook it and see it as one of those things, the Bitcoin price will just remain the way it is because there won't be any recorded huge sales or huge withdrawals happening from a particular exchange or private wallet.",

I thought with insane inflation that this pattern might have difficulty completing, but today it definitely seems to be moving in that direction. If we do see a drop to $20K, I’ll be a buyer. With the 3.0% drop within the last 24 hours is something we must worry about and start to redirect our speculations of bitcoin price towards the direction of 20k price as the baseline for bitcoin deep walk in this period even though it is not clear the direction the price is going to take next,  but we are certain that touching the 20k region once more will give a lot of investors to chance to get in at a very discounted price. But the question now is that should long-term investors wait for the price of bitcoin to touch 20k or below before they get in despite knowing that that price may not become a reality if bitcoin decides to go in the opposite direction or should just buy in the current price which is low enough compared to when the price was around 28k-30k a few weeks back?",

It seems though as of currently, the price is just within the support line of $25k. Again, we don't know if this is going to hold or now. But base on the sentiments right now, it could go down and then we see support at $23k and so on.The thing is that we should know how to react in this kind of price drop.",

We dont really have an negative news in the market but there are some sell off with those whales onBinance basing up on Whale Alerts on TG on which this one indeed cause such that red candle.Is this a hint that there might be some further sell off later on? Lets see and this is what im anticipating.Not all would really be that emotionally stable or having that endurance on seeing a declining market but instead they do freak out and whine instead of making up some position or buying on the bottom.These are the times on which you could really consider yourself bagging up which its still cheap because there would really be in our mind that this might be the lastdip or decrease before we could moon. Well, its just anticipation but most likely this is something that mainly in our minds.",

There was a panic for sure after the SEC wants to freeze some binance asset, but luckily the judge didn't allow it and let binance continue to do it's business like usual while the lawsuit is on going.

Bitcoin is not like every other altcoin that is pumped and also gets dumped. The bitcoin market can be volatile, and anyone investing in it should be aware of that. I don't believe that Bitcoin could drop to $20k again this year just as you've mentioned, but even if it does, investors should hold tight to their portfolios because if there is a big dip, the uptrend will also be big😜. Also, the market is not usually so predictable;  someone can speculate for $20k,  but instead, it will go below $20k or above $30k. The approach for Bitcoin investment is to hold until you have earned your desired profit, otherwise the person can continue to DCA.",
