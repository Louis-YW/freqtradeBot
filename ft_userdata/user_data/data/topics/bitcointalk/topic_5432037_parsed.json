After the last down cross, BTC went down 50%.Currently, 5th Down Cross happened on 5th Dec, 2022. Let's see if Bitcoin follows the similar pattern.It took Bitcoin 5 weeks before it started going down. 5 weeks from 5th Dec will be 9th Jan, 2023.",

It doesn't usually happen within a year of ATH, though, then again, this cycle's keen on chucking away the wisdom of past cycles.Expect more down crosses first before that flash crash -- and then a powerful rebound.

Fed rates are falling, but the recession is closer than ever, even many countries have already into recession, so expectations of a bull run in 2023 are highly unlikely. I don't think bitcoin can drop to 8k, but 10k-12k is possible.Honestly, not only big investors but even myself can say that bitcoin has never been a safe haven or a safe haven in times of crisis or inflation. Bitcoin has yet to reach that level, it needs more time to do so.",

But, the bulls came to action at different times which may happen for 2022 bearish trend as well. In 2015 January, we had mt.cox collapse and in 2018 December we had BCH-SV fork and these 2 incidents led 50% down fall in quicker time. Overall downfall from respective ATH was around 80% and unfortunately we are already trading into that zone hence I am not expecting another 50% downfall from here before bulls get into action.Like elliot wave theory, bitcoin is suffering up to 80% downfall in its each cycle from the ATH. So, the bottom for current cycle is around $15k with give or take $2k hence we can assume that we had passed the bottom already. This means, we do not need to be worried about another pullback from here.",

Does that mean that for you the halving that will happen in the first half of 2024 will have absolutely no effect?I think that 2023 will still bring some positive change, especially if inflation is stopped and if the EU and the US successfully survive this winter. This would mean that ordinary people will have more money to invest, and they are the ones who need to start the market at some point.50% crash can always happen, but not because something like that happened in the past, but because of some new extremely bad news.",

There's no strong support nor strong resistant. When I thought btc formed a support at 20k,  just FTX fud pulled it down very fast.",

Basically very similar ranges at obviously different prices but similar points in time. We are at the point of where Lehman collapsed and stocks went down massively. So it’s not hard to understand another 50% drop.However keep in mind. If it were this easy to just look at past charts then everybody would be rich. So DCA just in case.

For 68k to 34k, bitcoin took more than 50 days and for 34k to 17k, it again took more than 5 months of time. But, at the times of bottom, another 50% fall may happen in one or two days of time itself. Yet, not all the news are capable of taking down to 50% fall; so do not need to be worried as market sentiment is changing to positive on the verge of new year.Like other people here, I am also confident about bouncing back of bitcoin market from here after instead of thinking about another round of bearish trend any more.

The accumulation phase obviously has to last for some time, and those who have knowledge, power and money definitely want to maintain that phase as long as possible because their bags are never full enough.

When really; the analysis should be looking at the current situation, what happened in the past, what's different now, and the current risk factors. For example, rarely do I see users thinking about how the recession will impact their previous historical cycles, which is quite obvious to me. We aren't going to see the same pattern; since four years ago we didn't have a pandemic, and recession to recover from. The four year cycle is nothing more than a market that's relatively stable because of the lack of massive events that effect global investment. Such as; pandemic, war, and the recession.",
