I also wish to remind everyone that we should spend money wisely and be very prudent. We should remember that by January of the next year, there would be a lot of bills that would need to be paid. So remember that while shopping for those items that may seem to be relevant and cool to get now but would be definitely irrelevant later on. By January, a lot of people would probably be heading to the bank after going all out with their funds during Christmas to take loans to settle whatever bills would arise and there would be a lot that would arise! I think money is always tight for most people in January cause they spent a whole lot of money during the Christmas period. So while having a good time with friends, family and loved ones during this festive season, please remember that January, with all its bills is around the corner. A very merry Christmas everyone!!!",

This is not the time to start spending money extravagantly because we want people to fill the impact. Even though we have enough funds to spend, we can always cut it and send some to the needed because I believe there are some persons who do not have the fund right now to foot there bills. I hope next year is going to be a great year to us all, accomplishing many we couldn't achieve this year. I wish everyone a great year ahead!",

Is really good to make the festive season a happy one, I mean what's the reason of hustling from January to December and you have to save all you've worked for, instead of enjoying yourself, you just act like you're broke because you're avoiding January stress.Life is too short to be letting worries take away the time we're suppose to use to celebrate with our loved ones, am not saying you should go all out spending money just because you have but what ever you're doing mate, do it with wisdom. All am saying is, spend and enjoy yourself but have a plan B.",

I'm sure they'll understand that my finances are very tight albeit earning quite comfortably for the past few years. Luckily I avoided gifting a lot of cash unnecessarily this year, and have kept from withdrawing a large amount just to give it away. Even though it's a once a year thing, we should still check our spending and steer away from irresponsible spending.",

But with financial freedom, comes the liberty to be able to spend a bit more, as they have a much higher profit margin.Let us aim to be able to afford those things we could not this season.

Financial advice is very useful but not so that we are afraid to spend after a year of hard work, the end of the year is when we should take some time to enjoy life with our loved ones. The new year is coming with diverse expenses and bills to pay. School fees, house rent, car maintenance, subscription bills, etc. My family knows my financial strengths, hence they understood that I can't spend so much this Christmas because this year was very challenging. They know that we don't need to borrow or use our investment funds to celebrate this year's Christmas because we still have more Christmases to celebrate in the future. It is advisable to spend within one's means and don't try to please or compete with people when you don't have the financial means. Merry Christmas to all.",

A very merry Christmas everyone!!!As others have said, it's a warning that came too late when you post it on Christmas eve. If bills are due and the money has already been spent then what good is it? It would probably make more sense to tell people to consider what they are doing ready for next Christmas. If you budget throughout the year, put aside a little each month then you can prevent being without. Better yet, try to improve your situation in the next year, look for new jobs or ways to boost your income, maybe sell some unnecessary junk if it has accrued in your home over time, put spare cash into a bank account that pays the highest interest and set up a proper budget to see where you can cut costs.",

So remember that while shopping for those items that may seem to be relevant and cool to get now but would be definitely irrelevant later on. I don't do shopping every year for my decorations of my house for the Christmas, I reuse item from the previous year celebration and store them after the holiday are over. I found this to be very helpful as it save me expenses as things get costly by this time of the year. Now if there are new things I'll love to add to my design then I buy those that are reusable so I can use them for the holidays ahead.This time of the year can be very expensive if you don't have plans. Sadly people spend so much around this time of the year that they begin to struggle when the new year starts. I wouldn't wish that for anybody but instead of over spending, why not invest during this periods as market always tends to be on a discount. Spend wisely and invest correctly that's all I can say to everyone. Merry Christmas.",

I think people who did not take the advice seriously last year, had their own experience the January of this year, Likewise, people who will not take this advice now will also learn their lessons in January. But as said, this advice would have been more timely, people have already squandered a lot of money that took them a while to gather.",
