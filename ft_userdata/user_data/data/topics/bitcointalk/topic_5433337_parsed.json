I think it's a good investment, but don't take my post as financial advice. Hamsters have bought this coin between $15 and $55, so buying $4.6 won't be a big mistake. The price could drop even lower, but I don't believe in the $1 price unless there are new black swans in the market. I also bought this coin for about $5, but sent my coins to auctions for parachains. It was better to sell at 40-50 dollars, but the profit of 800-1000% seemed small to me.",

In terms of old altcoins, DOT is one of the good investments, but investing in altcoins is very risky and there are no guarantees. Although according to most people, DOT is potential, but that does not mean it will rise again in the next bull season. I think you should do your own research and make your final decision instead of investing based on other people's advice. It's hard to give investment advice in altcoins, if it were me, I wouldn't buy DOT, but instead I would buy ETH.",

It was once priced as high as $55 but currently it is also priced at $4.66.  And it is still in Top 13 position in CoinMarketcap. So I don't think it would be a bad thing to invest in it now. If you have enough funds and don't need to spend them on your daily activities then you can invest in these coins for long term.Long term investment may be able to give you a good profit but I am not giving you financial advice I am just expressing my opinion so you must do your own research before investing.",

For a short term hold you really shouldn’t be taking too much advice from strangers online. You need to do extensive research yourself but even then we are in the middle of a bear market. Looking for short term profits is like playing roulette. You just can not with any confidence pick & coin or token guarantee profits. The whole market is tied to bitcoin & right now we see no sign of going up.Polkadot is a good coin, could bring great profits in the next bull run but to turn a quick profit from a short term hold, nobody can tell you yes, it will rise soon sadly.",

The market now is not set up for any growth and the volatility of many projects is at a minimum, and at such rates trying to extract short-term profit from something is almost impossible. If one invests in Polkadot, then on a long term basis, much more profits will come out than on a short distance. I'm sure DOT will hardly show itself at all on a short range.",

If you only want to trade for the short term, you can buy any time. You will be able to sell back when market conditions reverse towards the red chart. In one week, generally the Polka Dot price changes around $ 0.5 from $ 4.2 to $ 4.7, and you can sell when the increase has reached that price. And so are the down prices.",

Probably a good idea as the market will start to recover again and Polkadot seems to be a good old project. Compare to its all time high value to its price right now, its very tempting. Short term position might be a good idea for Polkadot, just know when to sell so you wont regret it. Staying on a top 13 spot after the bear market is still a good one, you might consider this for your short term goal, just try to analyze it again before making any decision.",

As per what I see, Polkadot is good so far.",

Is this time a good entry for buying Polkadot or should I wait for more? I'm not considering holding a long time for a bigger profit. Just looking for a short-term hold.Any ideas? Polkadot is a good project backed by solid fundamentals. It was created by one of Ethereum's co-founders (his name is Gavin Wood). With parachains technology, Polkadot will be able to scale to millions of users worldwide. It can rival competing smart contract platforms such as Polygon (MATIC) and even Cardano (ADA). You can start by buying small amounts of DOT to begin staking for profits. If you keep accumulating, you'll obtain big rewards in the long run. I can't recommend Polkadot or any other cryptocurency for short term profits because the market is in a very bad state. Just focus on solid projects that actually provide real use cases to the mainstream world (like Polkadot and Polygon), and you'll have nothing to worry about. Who knows what the future holds for the entire crypto/Blockchain space? Just my thoughts",

Polkadot is a top L1 project and one of the major contender with ethereum, so seeing its price now at this bargain is definitely a gift. Who knows what could be the future of one of thw biggest project. But of course, in terms of trading perspective, we dont know if theres more going down with the current market.

Its blockchain was the most complicated blockchain that i have ever seen. it's not user friendly but consider DOT already dumped to the bottom and im feeling fair for you to invest in this shit even though for me it's over rated blockchain. The only good thing is DOT already traded at the bottom. I see no good aspect other than it.Quote from: drac970815 on January 07, 2023, 05:53:43 AM Is this time a good entry for buying Polkadot or should I wait for more?

You can consider the bottom that already reached by DOT as the best entry to get in. You shall not wait even longer. Buying at the various price would be good enough for you to decrease the risk",

Several veteran members have commented that this is a pretty good choice even if it's not financial advice, so you should do your own research and decide which one is right for you and what fits your budget. If this proves to be a good choice because I can't think of this as good, seeing as the decline has been 91% since the last ATH, then you can lower the selling target later, unlike the last ATH, but just getting 5x profit is already good.",

My question for someone looking into buying Polkadot is...  What are you going to do with it?  I've heard a couple people mention buying Polkadot, but it's never to use it for anything.  It's always about staking it to get more Polkadot.  I think that's a really piss poor reason to buy a currency.  I honestly couldn't even give you one example of something you'd need to own Polkadot for.  I've never even heard of a project running on it.  Granted, I'm sure there's some activity out there, but is this activity that you need to participate in, or are you fooling yourself into thinking you'll buy this coin and then sell it for more later?  If that's your thinking, keep in mind the coins you're buying are someone else's sell it for more later.",
