Maybe I am going to try Ebay auctions, people are selling them for around $60 - $70 or even cheaper.",

Woah, I checked their site this past weekend and I could have swore they were asking $179 (USD,) but now I see they're asking $149 (USD, not Euros.)  I agree, $125 is too much, I'll drop it to $100.I'm not in a hurry to sell any of these, I just got tired of these things taking up room in my drawer.  Give the ad a few more days, and if I don't get any bites I may be willing to entertain offers.",
