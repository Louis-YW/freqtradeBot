      "body": "Take profits regularly with copy traders that do well on shorter time frames. They can often do badly on longer time frames (especially considering one with a 4000% return has to lose the majority of their investment before they're considered loss making to those exchanges). If you can take a profit often enough, you might do well trading with them as long as you diversify too.Isolated and cross are also not too different in how they work. A smaller amount on cross margin is similar to isolated, if you can segregate accounts well then it's easy enough to consider cross isolated as long as you're focussed on what you're doing when you set it up.",

In worse case scenario 1 bad position will force-close all your other trades and whipe out everything to the last cent. You can protect your wallet by well placed stoploss but in extreme situation like instant flash crash even this won't save you. I advise to use isolated margin and always take care of enough collateral.",

But, in isolated mode, you only risk the margin you invested in that trade.If you always set a stop loss when you trade, using cross mode or isolated mode won't give you any problems because it will quickly close the position if your SL is hit. Moreover, using cross mode when your SL exceeds your liquidation will deplete funds in your futures account.You must train yourself to constantly use ISO in case you forget to put a stop loss.In terms of copy trading. You only have to identify traders who have a high win rate and consistent in winning. Don't afraid of copy trading because your money is just nothing to them, so if they lost, your lost is just a cent to them.",

      "body": "Indeed, cross margin is more risky... but as Bitcoin_Arena said, it also matters what percentage of your fund you \"play\" with. If the guy you copy is using 1% of his funds and opens some risky 30x levarage positions he can sustain some losses and can set his stop-loss lower. If you use 30% of your funds for the same trade you will get liquidated as soon as that coins goes 3% in the wrong direction.Lost my share to futures trading in my noobish days. It can go well or it can go bad. Just make sure you understand what you are doing before starting.Good luck !",

Accordingly, if you use a higher leverage, you can quickly lose your deposit.",

But if you really want to test it out, don't exactly copy the trade since you might have a big difference in the funds, the trader you would copy could hold that position in a certain period of time but you couldn't, so always be aware on what you need to adjust before entering that kind of trading.",

      "body": "You are probably copying the wrong way and trying to make faster and quicker money. If you are trading with high leverage then you are likely to lose more when market direction doesn't go your direction. As always in trading, you need to have a reasonable amount in trade equity so that if something goes wrong in the trade then you can haya little more capital to sustain the rush. This may be the challenge for your copy trade so if that is true then you have to adjust your leverage lower",
