  "content": "Just an interesting note for the development of physical bitcoin collecting: PCGS has allowed Casascius coins into their registry sets program. I'm not really familiar with registry sets that much. I understand intellectually how they work, but have never made one. PCGS scores different sets each year and elects a winner of the best sets. There are hundreds of different categories. For example, you could be a collector of coins from the Congo, enter them into the registry set program and be declared the winner of the best set for that category. Only coins graded by PCGS are allowed. IMO, registry sets drive a market for nicer graded coins. I have always believed that at some point the grade of a physical bitcoin will matter a lot for valuing it. Now that Physical Bitcoins are being graded, here is what they accept for registry sets8/16/2023New Set Composites OnlineCasascius Bitcoin Brass and Gilt Type Set, Circulation Strikes (2011)     Casascius Bitcoin Brass and Nickel Plated Type Set, Circulation Strikes (2012)     Casascius Bitcoin Brass Type Set, Circulation Strikes (2013)Casascius One Bitcoin Brass Type Set, Circulation Strikes (2011-2013)Casascius Bitcoin Silver Type Set, Proof and Specimen (2012-2013)     Casascius Bitcoin Silver Type Set, Proof (2013)If you want to see the coins included in each set then here is a linkhttps://www.pcgs.com/setregistry/news",
