It’s a bit more time consuming but yet it’s better than sending your coin to a completely different address due to an unknown malware. In your case you could have lost more than usual due to high transaction fees, but if the network wasn’t congested you could have only lost a few cents since you’ll still be the one receiving the coin back into your wallet more like you just gifted miners your fee, lol.",

      "body": "What I think you did was to just copy and paste the address from the last transaction you sent to that account. This is a very bad way because first there is an issue of getting affected with the clipboard malware and without checking your receiving address properly you could send your bitcoin to scammers address. Also there is this dust attack you could also get caught with copying address from last transaction sent. If you plan to copy your address right it out in another file and whenever you want you can go and copy it from there. And yes you’re right bitcoin can be sent back to the same address it is send out from, that’s probably what the Cancel options you see on wallets actually do or when you designate that particular address to receive the change again",

This is helpful, but it could become stressful because the person needs to input each alphabet and letter individually. It won't be practical for multiple or bulk sending. In my opinion, it's better to compile all addresses in a spreadsheet. Then, whenever you want to send, you can simply go there, copy, cross-check, and send without having to type all the time.",

With the use of QR code, there is nothing copied to the device clipboard for clipboard malware to change.If you want to avoid clipboard malware, the best is to avoid malware generally. Also checking and rechecking the bitcoin address will also be helpful. Even while using QR code, I still check and recheck the address again.",

Manually typing in the address can also risk typing errors, especially for users who often experience typographical errors when typing.Copy and paste addresses can still be used, but double-check the address before sending the transaction.If it turns out that the pasted address is different from the copied address, most likely, there is clipboard malware. If so, I don't recommend using the device for transactions before it is completely cleaned from viruses and other errors.",

I only have this weird feeling of copy pasting on PC, I believe it's the home for malware attacks on your PC, I have witnessed few Clipboard malware before and I haven't seen such on mobile smartphones, so if you are a PC user, your chances of getting this Clipboard malware is very higher compare to using a smartphone.",

Bitcoin addresses are typically 26-35 characters long, and it is difficult for an individual to write 26 characters with zero probability of error. Therefore, scanning the QR is the ideal solution, or copying and pasting the address, making sure of the first 7 characters and the last 7 characters, or the entire address if you have time, but The first 7 and last 7 can be considered safe.",

Solution is copy and paste it or print it on paper that are safer than writing or typing manually.Double check with first few and last few characters are good steps to avoid mistakes when broadcasting a transaction, of course with a condition that a device is clean. Years ago, exchanges did not have pop-up for checking first and last characters but nowadays, I see they require users to check addresses or first and last few characters before making a withdrawal request. I think it is their good preventive protection for their customers.",
