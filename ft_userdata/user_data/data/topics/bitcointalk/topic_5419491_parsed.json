Matic and optimism just making me smile this morning May I just advice not to celebrate too early, we are not yet in the bull run. Maybe we are just waking up this last quarter or at last this last 2 months. But we are still a long way to go before we can actually see what a real bull run is.I'm not familiar with the coins you are shilling, but regardless, you just need to be very careful.And if you think you have made a lot of money (it looks you are before you seems to be very happy), then it's better to take your profit and not to be greedy and wait for more, in my opinion.",

Matic and optimism just making me smile this morning I want to remind you that this is not yet a real bull season, just a short-term bull run in the crypto winter. So don't get so excited that we forget what is our main mission in this market, taking profits is never wrong and the money in the wallet is really our money. Just have money to have an opportunity, don't be too greedy, expect too high lest you regret it.Bitcoin has passed $21k but I'm still not really excited because I know this is just another of the many traps of this bear season.",

Matic and optimism just making me smile this morning Good for you. I saw my Matic having the pump time and made me sell some amount to take the profit and still hodl the rest But I am not sure if the altcoins season is coming soon, but I still hope it will come this month or next. Although not many altcoins can rise higher like their ATH but it is enough to take profit in this situation. Now, I am still waiting for the other altcoins; hopefully, more altcoins in my bag can increase.",

This is not a bullrun but a small recovery by bitcoin that can trigger everything. The fact that if the pump will never last long. It will be going back again as bitcoin time will be over. The bitcoin's recovery is also helping some major coins to be pumped so hard. A small pump in bitcoin can trigger the price of token. I can imagine when bitcoin will be getting a big bullrun and this will be so crazy to see that whole of altcoins will be going to the moon. My portfolios were also increasing more than 10% this day. I have been stocking more and more altcoins as a preparation for the next recovery phase. Crypto may get more adoption very soon. More world class companies will be starting to pay more attention to the crypto",

We might already see a little pump but that is not enough to call it a bull trend. Lower your expectation for now because we have to break a lot of resistance before the bull happened. Though its good to see altcoins catching up with the market, those who will survive the bear will have a better chance of making their new all time high again, take profit when necessary.",

Matic and optimism just making me smile this morning It doesn't look like a bull run, but more like a bullish correction. You need a big surge in volume across the whole market, not just a few coins, for a true bull run to occur. Some coins are starting to show growth, and that's a good thing, but I wouldn't call it a bull run. People tend to call any short-term momentum a bullrun and think it's the start of something big. I have seen such bullrun joys in the spring and summer of this year.",

No one seemed to see it was bear run until they lost at least half of their porfolio, and even then almost everyone unanimously said that holding is the best option, or that we should buy more now. Some of these people lost 70% some 90%. And NOW they are afraid to buy when they would get 90% discount from their bags. They won't buy because it could drop another 90%, i understand that perfectly. But when someone is making money and is happy about it somehow he gets greeted with \"i got bad news for you\", i get weirded out.Wasn't the old advice from Buffet that \"Be greedy when others are fearful'\". I guess for me it's time to be greedy because i see so many people being afraid now. I admit that i don't know if bear run has ended, but i sense the fear for this being sucker's run so i am one of the bulls now.",
