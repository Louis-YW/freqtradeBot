As for Trezor, I think they are integrating with HodlHodl to get more people into using Trezor Suite, which is understandable. However, in my opinion, spending directly from a hardware wallet (cold storage) may unintentionally compromise your privacy, especially in cases where KYCed and non-KYCed coins are being mixed upon sending to a P2P exchange. Your counterparty may peer into the history of your transactions and figure out your real identity, so it is still optimal to CoinJoin UTXOs before spending. The situation may change when Trezor adds mixing into their Suite: it will enable your transaction to go through a full mixing cycle before entering a P2P trade.",

The situation may change when Trezor adds mixing into their Suite: it will enable your transaction to go through a full mixing cycle before entering a P2P trade.I have the same concerns.  A decent solution for me is to simply use a Trezor to quickly create a temporary wallet by using a BIP password to create a unique wallet with a different MPK of course.  This would be a one time use for buying P2P.  Then simply \"mix\" those coins into your permanent wallet.  Thus the trail/association is removed.  It works.",
