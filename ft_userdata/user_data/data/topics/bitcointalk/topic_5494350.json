Your first question is basically what I am asking our dearest members  Any ideas...If by proof you meant the keys etc. then yes that it is a challenge, but was hoping for some creative thoughts",

Ones the seed phrase or the private key is not accessible again but lost, your coin has already been lost also.",

A lot of persons lost access to their wallets due to carelessness or environmental disasters. But the truth of the matter op is that, you cannot recover your lost wallets and by watching it's value increasing, you will only cause health issues for yourself. So just ignore that you ever own the wallets to avoid being in such situations. There's no going back now.",

This is for cases like OP's. This is about our personal funds as key owners.It's about how we are responsible for our funds and their safety. It's about how we decide to spend it.If the OP doesn't hold the key at all, that means the OP is handing everything over to a third party like we use an exchange address. There we do not hold the key or seed. We are only given a password with an active email when registering. The coins there are not ours, but theirs (exchange).",

There's no need to create a digital art piece for this and for what?No need for worrying about my mental state. I am well aware that the funds are inaccessible without seed and password. I was just brainstorming and looking for input to learn of it is interesting to turn it into for example an nft or whatever because eventhough the btc can not be used, simply the fact that they are out of circulation may somewhat contributed to the hype and scarcity we see today. Again, just brainstorming but thought it could be an interesting story to tell and who knows a nice hold for the right collector",

I would also ask the question about what would you do about this wallet address or what are you going to do in order to make it into a digital art piece. I don't think it bring something else but you are right about the lost bitcoin that it can help about it's scarcity.",

Thoughts on this topic?Sorry to disappoint mate but I don’t think there is any creative way for you to turn this lost wallet into an art piece. Do you want to sell a screenshot or something? I mean you could draw it but it would seem like you just took inspiration and nothing else. I don’t think there is any way you can benefit from this poor wallet anymore. Such a regret but you have to accept that and move on.",
