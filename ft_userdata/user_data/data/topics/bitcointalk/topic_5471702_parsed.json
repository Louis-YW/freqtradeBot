In my country, one Bitcoin buys you a mid-range car.The weird stuff you might buy will be related to the dark web or digital stuff like porn and movies.",

So, I was not able to close the deal but may be in future, I can buy something unique with crypto. Nah, I'd say keep that crypto and let it grow. The real estate business is only good if you have a large capital to run it. I'm sure with the Bitcoin you're holding, which is expected to grow in the long run, you might be well-prepared to invest in real estate eventually. Don't divest all your Bitcoin; use it to diversify your business while Bitcoin remains the largest asset, as it has a huge potential to rise in the future compared to a real estate business.Quote from: krishnaverma on October 26, 2023, 06:31:11 AMWhat is the most weird thing you bought with crypto? Just some art collections but just a small amount of my bitcoin, majority of it goes to different gambling platforms which does not belong the weird group.",

So, I was not able to close the deal but may be in future, I can buy something unique with crypto. What is the most weird thing you bought with crypto? There are not a lot of things one can use bitcoin to buy until you convert them to other currencies before you can spend them. I have purchased a lot of things through bitcoin I earned in the past, but I never bought anything directly with bitcoin. Although, bitcoin is still increasingly becoming popular, I’m confident that more services will allow the payment of products with bitcoin soon. But for now, I haven’t bought anything with bitcoin directly, maybe because the products I require at that time haven’t allowed the use of bitcoin for payment purposes yet.

I hope I'll be able to buy a house someday with my Bitcoin.Most of the VPN providers I have used take payment with cryptocurrencies. I once bought a VPN with another cryptocurrency and not bitcoin itself. The VPN provider didn’t have an option of paying with bitcoin but the price of the VPN was so negligible if converted to the bitcoin value of it.",

I think that weird kind should qualify as something that's not normally bought by a lot of people and when bought would elicit a sort of reaction that you normally show when you're disgusted or repulsed, and in based on my definition of weirdness, I think that you OP haven't bought anything weird yet which is the same for me or almost close to 80% of people that are buying stuff using crypto or bitcoin.",

So, I was not able to close the deal but may be in future, I can buy something unique with crypto. What is the most weird thing you bought with crypto? Here, it is difficult to buy anything with cryptocurrencies. There is practically no single store in Nigeria that one can say accepts cryptocurrencies officially. In other states, you find stores, shops and malls that will transact using cryptocurrencies. But here, there is nothing, not even a peanut or an icing on the cake.This is one of the reasons why we are advocating for the use of Bitcoin amidst other stablecoins in the country so that people can freely go about there transactions using these method of transaction. We should not deny ourselves that opportunity to use the format we need to make transactions.The only thing that I reason, is that we must enlighten people more on what it means to make use of the Cryptocurrency. It's advantages, it's benefits, it's long time benefits in terms of its rise in market value.We must also learn to expose a lot of businesses to the advantage of investing in Bitcoin especially in the Bull Run Period where virtually every coin is rising following the rise of Bitcoin. Investing in Bitcoin is yet one of the safest options businesses have right now to sustain their business with little or no lose.I wish we can come up with ideas and programs that will impact the lives of individuals and businesses out there from this forum, so we can extend our ideas and programs out there.",

So, I was not able to close the deal but may be in future, I can buy something unique with crypto. What is the most weird thing you bought with crypto? I believe that buying a plot with crypto-currencies or Bitcoin is just like buying it with fiat and there is nothing weird with such approach. I have not bought much with crypto-currencies or Bitcoin other than some digital items but many people have bought physical things with Bitcoin and that doesn't make their purchase weird. I used to be very active on the digital goods board of the forum and I purchased AWS credit codes from this forum back then and if that sounds weird then that's the weirdest thing that I have bought with Bitcoin.",

There are a lot of things that sometimes, looking back, really make me laugh.But actually using money for strange things is something I often do, if in the future bitcoin becomes popular and there are many willing to accept transactions to it. And then I was able to come up with this, paying Bitcoin for packs of cigarettes. But this habit is harmful to health, I hope everyone does not fall into it.",

I find this weird.Such things were known to be sold on darknet before but now those sellers are expanding their dirty business and selling such things directly to public on social media sites like Reddit. The sellers who sell such things like drugs will most probably accept Bitcoin and Monero as a way of payment because they know how to be safe from the authorities by selling their dirty drugs to the public when accepting those crypto-currencies. I can say that such things are very weird but those sellers mostly sell drugs to local public and they accept fiat as well for their negative activities. I hope that number of such sellers will reduce and because of those people some so-called authorities and their spokesperson say wrong things about Bitcoin and neglect the fact that most of the drugs are purchased with fiat not with Bitcoin or any other crypto-currency.",
