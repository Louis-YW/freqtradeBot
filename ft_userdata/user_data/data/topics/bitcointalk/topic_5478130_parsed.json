  "content": "LE as I am reading the repliesMaybe thrilling was more appropriate than entertaining so feel free to use that!As it seems I'm the only one betting on horse racing around here we need a bit of intro for thisSo, two races out of 4 done by 12:18 GMT time and both horses I was backing, favorites,  Hunters Yarn and  Kourosh dropped their jockeys at the last hurdle, the first did it while being in the lead by 10 lengths, the second when battling for the first place, lost a bit on them and probably more to come as I'm 1 out of 5 bets right now but I didn't feel any remorse or regret or anything like this, moreover I feel really good because I saw some really entertaining races with a change in the last moment.On the other hand, whenever I trade even if it's just small, really small positions and I lose a few $ I feel bad, I always tell to myself why I even bother to do it.So hear me out:With gambling, you chose on who to bet when to bet , once you do you you wait for the outcome at a fixed time!With trading you chose your pair coins, you have to wait for the price to reach what you think it's an entry point and then set limits , watch the damn numbers even for days, even if you cash out in profit there can always be a regret you haven't kept the position opened.Three is little that can influence a sport event outside of what you know, with coins it just takes a stupid hack or some gov going bananas on crypto out of nowhere while you sleep and you have your house full of trading alarms like you're in a police raid.TA analysis is just Timeform, there is no difference between them , they show something that happened in the past with a coin and the form of a horse , in both cases you're looking at past performance and trying to figure the outcome.I can't find numbers on the screen entertaining, if somebody tells me numbers and lines are more entertaining that this, I think there is something wrong with you!  So prove me wrong (if you think I am), what am I missing?",

If asking which one is more entertaining, trading is not entertaining but exhausting.I agree with you- everything boils down to preference.Mostly, when people trade, they do it for profit and not for fun. I mean, as someone who traded before, believe me that it was not fun to see your trades on the red; and it was definitely not fun to see and wait the prices to decrease while losing at least 50% of the value of your investments.Gambling, on the other hand, can be viewed both as a form of entertainment and as a means for profit. This is the reason on why people enjoy gambling purely on the entertainment side as they want to feel that adrenaline rush regardless on whether they won/lost their bet.",

For some people, I think gambling as a source of income is not right, so I think gambling is to get peace. That's definitely for those who are looking for calm and entertainment, but if it's said that gambling is more relaxing than trading, it's definitely wrong for me personally because I think both are equally relaxing.",

Trading is more certain than gambling meaning you are more in control of your trade to close them when in profit as compared to the gambling results which are luck based and no one have control over the win and losses.For me, if i win money, then i become relaxed and it is also entertaining for me, no matter it is trading or gambling, As money makes you relax and you only feel fun when you are on the winning side.So, from this point of view, Gambling has less chances of winning as compared to the trading but still, if you can make money from gambling, nothing is more relaxing and entertaining than gambling.",

Gambling can not be seen as a way of making money because with experience, you have more chance to make money in trading.Of course these two things are very different between gambling and trading, where gambling is only recommended as a place of entertainment when you have free time or feel bored, while trading is specialized as a place to earn, another difference is, can you learn gambling? or does it mean that the strategy you bring to gambling will be useful? No, because there is absolutely nothing to learn there, which means that it remains in the initial understanding that gambling is nothing more than entertainment.While for trading everything you can learn and qualified knowledge and experience will be able to make it easier for you to be able to achieve a pretty good profit, on the other hand I agree with your idea that trading activities are not fun because the place is not to seek pleasure but to earn, but maybe there will be some situations that can make you quite happy and one of them is for example when you can reach your daily profit target if you are a day trader. In terms of opportunities are also clearly different, not least because in trading if you have good enough skills and knowledge then obviously your chances of profit will also be easily achieved, while in gambling there is no such thing but everything depends only on how lucky you are. But on the other hand there are indeed few similarities such as in terms of risk management, both of these require mental and psychological calmness to stay fine and so as not to suffer significant losses.",

Trading is for investment and I don't find it entertaining since I always feel that we need to be more serious dealing with our investment since we can't play lame around with that.",

The pro about trading is you don't lose all of it and if analysed better, you have better odds at winning. But it's not as fun as gambling.I was lucky today and doubled my $50 to $100 trading a coin in 12 hours. But I could just bet all of my $50 bankroll and have x4 profits in seconds or a complete loss.Personally I believe trading should be taken as a way of earning rather than a fun place to gamble like casino.",
