  "content": "I personally think that the phrase \"gambling for fun\" is widely misunderstood by many gamblers.They think gambling for fun means gambling without any interest or hunger for profit, no body enjoys loosing money, and this in the other way simply means, loosing money is never fun, but how we choose to react is what makes the difference... I wil tell you all what gambling for fun means to me personally.. Here Is What Gambling For Fun Mean To MeTo me, gambling for fun simply means - gambling, with hopes of making profit, but with the consciousness that if the profit does not come, I choose not to react negatively to the loss, or allow the loss way me down or make me feel bad, I just focus/put/fix my mind on the fun I had playing the game rather than focus or fix my mind on the money I lost.If gambling for fun means gambling without any need or hope of making profit, why throw away or waste my money then? I would just put the game in a demo mood and play - I believe a lot of casinos have this feature.But like I explained above, gambling for fun for me is not gambling with no interest in making profit, in gambling for fun, I hope to make profit, but I just consciously don't make the profit a priority, this means that if at the end of the game, I make a profit, i am happy, because I hoped for it, but if I don't make profit, I am not sad, I am not unhappy, because it wasn't a priority, and for me not to feel sad, I get my mind off the money lost and focus on the fun I had playing the game - Being happy is a choice, I hope we all know this.So over to you now, what does gambling for fun mean to you as a gambler,? As I know that this phrase might mean different things for different people, would like to know what your understanding is on this.",

Gambling is risky yes, this is why we should not take this seriously if you don’t have much money to spend in gambling, you might lose everything in gambling so better to have fun instead of making any stress.",

Assuming you are earning $1000 and you just take $50 to gamble, is that not fun?

      "body": "I gamble for fun, and believe it or not even after I make a profit on my account, I will just leave it there in the casino and use it for next week once I play again. People like us exist, and every time Saturday comes, I already look forward to losing $20 in the casino because I know I won't win anything. It's not like I hate winning or that I don't care about winning, it's just that I already accepted the fact that the small wins here and there will never be a permanent streak, and that's what I'm chasing - the small wins.But of course if I win big on the casino, I'd probably think twice in leaving that amount or cashing it out. The most I've won with dice is $100+, and I still leave it there and thought that it will be 5 weeks worth of gambling budget for me. I enjoy playing dice, especially if I see my balance slowly going up after a series of bad beats. Then again, I'm just after the thrill, the excitement - basically the emotions that one can get when playing with something that involves luck and chance in the same sentence.",

But of course, since gambling is mostly a game of chance, you cannot guarantee profits all the time. That’s when we have to be open both losing and profiting. So yes, I also share the same thought, when I won, I became happy, but when I lose, that doesn’t mean I need to be mad. As long as I still play with satisfaction, that reason alone is profitable already.",

I gamble knowing I'll lose all the money I have dedicated for gambling for that day, and thus far it has given me outdtandingvresults in my mental health and handling my emotions. When you don't expect anything, the simplest things will make you happy. And that's just what I did. I never expect to win any games because I know for a fact if let that mindset get to me, I'm gonna spiral into madness and will ultimately find myself addicted to gambling. So gamble with less expectations except to have fun and enjoy your time inside the casino, savor every win and shrug off every loss whilst maintaining a clear mind on what your spending limits are, and you'll find yourself gambling for fun.",

Since we don’t also want to gamble losing all the time, of course that would be a waste of time and money if that’s the case. Personally, I have to say that I can only enjoy gambling when the game is of my high interest, and it’s always challenging me. And it would be more fun if course if I’m also making profits from it. But if it’s not, that would be fine as long as you are only gambling your extra money.",

This time you lose it. You are down to $50.Upset and try with $20 again. Lose it and you are down to $30.In the mean time it's bed time. You feel you have nothing left so you put $30 in a random match. The balance is zero now.Wake up in the morning you wait for the match to start. Match starts and you win. You balance become $50 again.This way your entire weekend is wasted and you are down to $50 from $100 initially deposited.You wait for the next week.This is gambling for me. Well it used to be. Gambling means, taking stress while you are having fun.

As I know that this phrase might mean different things for different people, would like to know what your understanding is on this. There will be a different definition for each gambler. as you said in this thread, that many gamblers misunderstood. and as with what you explain in this very long article. however, in truth we cannot force someone to follow what we understand.To be honest, I personally often say that I gamble just for fun. however, many do not realize the meaning of what I say. because I'm sure, no one cares much about what I say in my post.for me personally, when referring to gambling for fun it is to casino gambling. yes and why, as we all know, that the probability of winning a bet during a betting session is very small. I can understand it, because casino games prioritize luck. know that in fact, we are staking the same fate as other gamblers. So, I never expected more to get big rewards. especially with limited capital, I play loose without caring about winning or losing. Don't say that I don't like luck, of course I do too.it's just that, because my priority is to bet on a sportsbook, namely football betting. of course, I have to involve a lot of knowledge, information, new news sources and all kinds in order to minimize the chances of defeat. and sportsbook gambling is different from casino gambling. because in sports, we can have a greater chance of winning because it involves skills and knowledge. however, I will also say that it is also a fun bet because I love soccer.The point is, I don't expect to always win bets, let alone casino gambling. but in football, we can choose according to what we know. if I lose today, I will end the bet as well as when I lose the casino game. if I'm lucky, I will still end the betting session because there is still tomorrow that I can continue, to get back to having fun.",

But it would be more fun and satisfying too if you gamble and then you won eventually. But I believe if you see gambling as another way of making money, that won’t be fun anymore if you gamble and then you keep losing your funds. My idea of gambling for fun, is that you do it naturally with your good friends, without being pressured that you also need to make profits as well.",
