Even you find out the site the person sold his coins at that time. The site the person used might not the same with yours. Now if you can remember any of the old sites that were selling and buying bitcoin then you can make some traces from that angle. But asking people in the forum to tell your if they have sell bitcoin in that year is looked like childish. You can even google them to know if there was any existing exchange platform in bitcoin since 2009. Or you can restructure the clause to suit your taste. Most of the platforms that were selling and buying bitcoin in those days of 2009 to 2011 are no more. They have been replace with smart exchange. And since there is no trance, remembrance and knowledge about the whole stuff will be very hard to recovered. And you are the only person who can find it out if it is possible. But I don't think it will be possible. You can cognitively remember the forums you used at that time and if not then forget about the coins.If like research : you can visit this https://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/boards/index.php",

I'm not sure there were quite several forums you were in at that time, but you saw some interactions you had in the past with other members. maybe it will take a longer time.I only know this forum, and it so happened that when I found out about Bitcoin, there were already several exchanges that could help me to own Bitcoin.good luck getting what you're looking for. it's a very long transaction. unfortunately, it will take longer for you to find it.",

It is really true that we can only give importance to any stuffs when it becomes valuable. It's like a lost opportunity. I remember there were faucets before that are now worth some dollars per claim. If I knew bitcoin would be as valuable as today, I would've put all my money into it.What we can do now is to take advantage of its price while it is still low compared to its ATH. Still very very far from the 2009 price but at least profit is profit and more realistic.",
