Can I regain access?Thanks for any assistance.",

      "body": "You can not recover a wallet with just addresses and passphrase, you will need the wallet.dat or the master private key for the recovery.You can extend the seed phrase with passphrase to generate different seed, different keys and addresses. Are you sure it is Bitcoin Core or a seed phrase wallet? Because passhrase is not needed with private key, it is used with seed phrase not keys.Which wallet?",

You can wait for other people to respond if it is possible to use a data recover to recover your wallet file after the OS has been reinstalled. The last I remember was a discussion about formating a phone and how possible the deleted data on it can still be recovered, but I do not know if this is possible after computer OS has been reinstalled. But I guess definitely that the data that has been deleted on computer will still stay for certain period of time until it is replaced by new data on the computer, so there should be a way about the recovery.",
