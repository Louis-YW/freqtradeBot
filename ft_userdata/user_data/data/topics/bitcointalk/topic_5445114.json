You have your seed phrase simply means you have your coins.",

That your seed phrase can generate the keys and addresses needed for your wallet or  coin recovery. If you import the seed phrase on Electrum, it will (connect with a central server and) synchronize with the blockchain and you will be able to access your coin.Good to take note that Binance is centralized, it is not your coin on blockchain if you have coins on Binance, Binance have the private keys to the coins, they only give your addresses.",

When you make a transaction, what you actualy do is transfering ownership over these assets. The ownership is established through special keys called \"private keys\". For example, Binance has private keys to some coins stored on the blockchain. Given that they own these coins, they can make transactions with these coins and move them around between their wallets. Once they move these coins to a wallet to which they have no private keys (your wallet for instance), they essentially stop controlling these coins. Private keys is what that really matters. You can import them in almost any wallet you want and they will work. If you lose your private keys, your coins remain on the blockchain but you will lose the ability to move them because you stop owning them. Because, as mentioned above, the \"ownership is established through special keys called \"private keys\".",

To recover, you can recreate your wallet using a private key or run a file recovery software. There's a fair chance you can get your wallet.dat back.Personally i disagree with \"fair chance\" considering these condition,1. Many laptop these days use SSD which has capacity ranging from 128GB to 256GB.2. SSD has TRIM feature which used to permanently remove deleted files. IIRC Windows run it once a week.3. Windows 11 has 64GB storage requirement[1], while Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has 25GB recommended storage requirement[2]. Combining that and other written file (e.g. installed application or swapfile), the chance dropped considerably. [1] https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications[2] https://ubuntu.com/download/desktopYes, you are correct unfortunately. I was doing some file recovery on a daily basis some time ago and success rate was quite high. But man, time flies and I realized that it happened ~10 years ago and most drives were like 2TB HDDs and barely 10-20% full. So I have to agree, with TRIM and smaller SSD sizes you're in trouble!",

In electrum, you connect to a server and get only the transactions data of your own wallet, so that it can display your transactions history, the correct balance of your wallet and the list of your UTXOs. If you have made/received many transactions before, it may take a few minutes. If you have never made any transaction, it would take a few seconds.",
