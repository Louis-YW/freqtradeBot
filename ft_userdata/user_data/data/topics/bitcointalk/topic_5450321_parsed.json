  "content": "Good evening guys.I have recently carried out some repairs to one of my miners, all tho I think i have correctly soldered the elbow power connectors, I'm having some issues which has led me to create this post to try and determine if I am choosing the wrong products.I have watched several videos on youtube and I have found one video in that the creator claims that it's vital for \"gold solder\" to be used. upon searching for \"gold solder\" I only seem to find jewelers solder? Surely this isn't the required solder in order to carry out repairs?Here's the flux and solder I have used to replace the sockets with no success. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/393138762971https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225464766264?var=524458659746Could anyone confirm what the best flux and solder are? also when using this rosin flux I have, is it crucial to remove all remaining flux once soldering is complete? is it conductive? I have struggled to find answers elsewhere, thanks in advanced to all.",

      "body": "Do \"bad\" flux actually exist? Aren't they all ok ?Personally, I'm using this one : https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=272And https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=86I don't know if it's the best or not, but for the little I use it I'm happy with it.I always remove everything once the weld is done because that's how I learned, but I don't think that could be the cause of your problem?What exactly is the problem you have experienced with your soldering? Your hashboards are not recognised?",

      "body": "Good afternoon.I saw that stuff and ill be sure to try that next. As for the S9 in question i just removed the old solder (it appeared to be oxidised) and applied fresh solder and its hashing perfectly.To the member who asked if my hashboards are being recognized, this miner is now fine however i do have on a1 lovecore Chinese copy that i have replaced connectors and its allegedly not detecting hashboads? could you help? link - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449975.msg62159620#msg62159620Strange because it shown no signs of burning etc!Thanks to all your help tho, i really like this place!Great day guys.",
