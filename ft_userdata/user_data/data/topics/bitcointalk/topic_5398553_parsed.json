I can send you the HTML CSS codes of my previous works, so you can check them out.  And I have made few responsive designs also, using bootstrap.Also, I have my own web design portfolio: https://www.unikbrushes.com Please check it out. Please DM me your Skype ID. So I can send you the codes of my previous works. Thank you and best regards,Amar",

Luckily, you're one of those Web designers who can create something functional and attractive, but for a small price, and that is  a good thing.But I suggest you try to get out of your comfort zone sometimes , make something that will cause a little bit of a stir and stimulate people to talk about it, so you're creating a buzz about yourself and your portfolio. Good luck to you. I wish you great success with your business.",

I will consider it. Basically I was doing 90% of my work for Paid To Click websites, that's the reasons it's looking like that. And of course I have designed many websites including traveling sites, hotel sites, etc. But was getting more orders for PTC designs.Best regards,Amar",

But I displayed the designs which I have made for the reference to the buyers. These designs are just a showcase of my works. So buyers can check out the designs and they can get to know my designing skills.  After completion of the design, I have no connection regarding the website fraud scheme. Anyway I have removed that doubler template, I don't want to get any misunderstanding from anyone for my designing services. Thank you very much for your suggestion. I appreciate your patience on checking my portfolio",
