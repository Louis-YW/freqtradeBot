However, this can be misleading. The Security Ratio (SR) is a more reliable metric for understanding the real security of a PoW chain. It's important to note that higher hashrate is primarily a function of Moore's Law and does not necessarily translate to higher security. On the other hand, the Security Ratio offers a better perspective on the economic security aspect of PoW chains, providing a more accurate assessment independent of the currency used.We consider the Security Ratio (SR) to be the most fundamental metric for tracking economic security, as other isolated metrics, such as hashrate or dollars spent, do not take into account the size of the system they are securing. By incorporating the system's size, the Security Ratio provides a more comprehensive understanding of a PoW chain's true security.Security Ratio(SR) is calculated as follows:SR = (Total Block Rewards / Total Circulation Supply) * 1,000,000SR is calculated for block rewards and circulation supply in each specific time period (block, day, month, year...)https://i.ibb.co/xFLpg7Z/btctalk.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/tLq04Fk/btctalk1.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/rwrjxnS/btctalk2.jpgLinks:webpage: https://SecurityRatio.comtwitter: https://twitter.com/securityratioPlease feel free to share your thoughts, questions, and feedback.
