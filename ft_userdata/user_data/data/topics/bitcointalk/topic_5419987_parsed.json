The mega thread gives them a lot of freedom to operate, and it makes tracking and reporting difficult because the pages move in the blink of an eye.

However, I do believe that the decision to let these threads exist as they are is a good one; most mega threads are harmless and aren't just for of spammers. They contain long discussions on various topics, and people usually update them regularly with new information as well. On top of this, deleting signatures in these threads would probably just drive any discussion that does take place into other threads on the forum, which would defeat the whole purpose. So for now at least, I think we should keep mega threads intact.",

For the first time I have managed to accept an appraisal, not because he's Igehh but for the fact that I've realised a kinda - hidden logic - in that alot of users are afraid of JG and his recent development, AFAIK - they don't wanna get that fine-red paint on their profile, that'll be expressing who they really are and the shit in their ass- queekin' goo. So if every mega-thread is nutured in the same 'modus operandi', then they'll have no choice that to go 'hard' or go 'home'.But, on the other perspective of thinking, mega-threads are essential in here as several questions will be asked Incessantly without 'em. Threads like the FAQ (yeah, even in gambling sections, there are.) Shouldn't be tempered with or sometimes, mega football prediction threads too. The whole thing is confusing ASF. My opinion is: if anything be done, then let it be: designating peeps to make 'em self-moderated, that's it. Deletion will do much harm than killing their guts Sandra ðŸ’‡",

It is easy to create new threads after locking past mega threads and spam will be continued. Spam in new and smaller threads are not better in quality than spam in Mega threads.If people can make repeated topics to hunt merit, it is not a minor issue for them to create new threads to get post quota whilst post quality would be the same (low).You can extrapolate it to ChipMixer campaign. In gambling, most of posters are spammers but there are a few posters chosen to join ChipMixer gang. Their posts have good opinion and quality so that DarkStar_ have reasons to pick them.Generally, it depends on managers to set up rules for their campaigns and criteria to count eligible posts and it is a complex combination of many factors",

I tried to check their posts for plagiarism, and surprisingly, the posts show uniqueness, but the idea and meaning of everything said are repeated in many posts.Perhaps it was worthwhile to establish a rule that any post whose meaning is no longer new should be deleted. If we complain about positions that are similar in essence and the moderators delete them, it will probably create a task for spammers to think about what they write.",

Btw, its not any better in other parts of the forum as the moment there is some big news, bunch of duplicate topics pop up, and they rarely get deleted/merged (I don't know if latter ever happens).",

Additionally, some managers use Ninjasty.space to count posts without properly evaluating the posts' quality as long as the user met the weekly post requirement.Some of the best campaigns simply don't pay for the posts made after a certain page of a megathread. Of course, it depends also on what's the thread about and the quality of the post.Also, of course that in many cases the campaign/bounty managers could do better if they would care about the forum. On the other hand, the advertiser wants visibility and some don't care where that visibility is, so the managers will also just do the counting and that's all.Of course, in altcoin announcements I've often seen threads very long and filled with spam. In some cases they were even paying for that spam to keep their topic look alive.

Signature campaigns provide a good way for members to generate some income, and to help support a community. It's easy to look at them as a bad thing, but they really can be both negative and positive. Managing campaigns can be time-consuming, especially if you are running multiple campaigns. This is not always a problem, but when hundreds of members signup on an campaign, it is a challenge for the manager to sort out who is posting quality content, who is posting low quality content, and who is a regular spammer. However, it really is up to them to set the standards for engagement that they expect from their participants. And it is up to us to report spam and low quality content to the moderators and thus help keep the forum clean.Quote from: hugeblack on November 09, 2022, 08:36:49 AMI suggest that there should be a minimum level to show the signature in all forums, such as 1 merit per month or 20 per month in some spam boards, if you do not get those merits, the signature will disappear.It's an interesting idea.
