The Rehab center helps in treating of alcohol, drugs and behavioral health addictions. Recently it is adding trading addiction to its list and I was surprised to see that. You can read more about it:The rehabilitation center cited estimates that about 1% of cryptocurrency traders will develop an \"extreme\" addiction to crypto trading.https://cointelegraph.com/news/spanish-rehab-center-adds-crypto-trading-addiction-to-services-listI think it would be perfect to bring this trading discussion. Are you addicted to trading? I am thinking that making profit from trading or making losses, there is a chance that some traders are addicted to trading. What are you doing naturally to stay away from trading addiction?",

Gambling may not bring any hope of profit if you learn about it, but trading can bring that, I understand too. But some people are losing in trading just like some people are losing in gambling. This can be for such kind of people. Some people do not know the strategies that they can use to trade and they keep losing, it may be possible that this kind of people can get a solution of their addiction from the rehab center. I do not think the rehab center just added it, it would be because many people are asking if they are rendering that kind of service. It is a guess though, but that is how business is.But as for me, if anyone is making money from trading but addicted to it, it can still cause problem for the person later, the person need to find some time for himself for recreational activities that can help his health, no need for rehab center for that, it should be for those in losses, having time to trade more and lose more. If trading is well studied, you can make profit, but some people just use it to gamble while some people just do not have enough knowledge and experience about it.",

But there are also many cases of continuous losses and many people also can't control their behavior, even leading to debt because trading clearly needs detox. Once called addiction, I think it is no longer good but bad, trading addiction, I will call it like gambling addiction. No one calls those who make profits addicts, but those who lose continuously and keep trading will be called addicts.",

I am thinking that making profit from trading or making losses, there is a chance that some traders are addicted to trading. What are you doing naturally to stay away from trading addiction?Very few people can realize that they will get better profit with investment than with trading. Because investment requires many special and hard-to-meet characteristics: patience, determination and strong mentality to stand with our investment decisions.Many of us choose Bitcoin for investment but most of us failed to hold it long enough to gain profit.Trading is very opposite to investment. You can gain profit after a few minutes, few hours or few days and it is more attractive than investment. As a consequence of its attraction, people are more addicted with gambling than with investment. After they have one or a few successful trade positions, they can not wait for market correction and they always look for other opportunities as fastest as possible.Unfortunately by addicting to trading like this, they will be more vulnerable with market corrections, liquidations and will get big loses.",

Investing isn’t addictive but trading surely does since it requires one to be continuously checking charts frequently. If we look at exchanges they have features like spot and leverages. Traders in leverages will continuously be hoping to gain profit every time and once this is achieved it sometimes creates dopamine which is an hormone that transfer feel good pleasure to the brain and thing apart from this create gives the trader some shock since he is expecting a profit always and this is certainly an addiction.",

This is called introspection to find out what has happened and to be able to learn from experience. But sadly, not many people are able and willing to do this and they tend to repeat the same mistakes.And if they get addicted to trading, it's fine as long as they can make a profit. But if they suffered a loss, they should fix this. Maybe they need to arrange a schedule for when to trade and when to do other things, including recreation. Maybe learning to time trade is really needed in this case so he can do other things.",

I do not think so. Someone can trade and lose, look for money again and trade and lose again and again. This happened to me when I started to trade as it happened to me when I was addicted to gambling also.

Quote from: Zaguru12 on February 07, 2023, 11:03:34 AMGambling of any sort creates addiction and in cryptocurrency trading seems more like gambling especially Altcoin trading.Trading bitcoin can also be very risky, at least I traded altcoins and I gained before, I traded bitcoin and also gain. I have traded bitcoin and I lost and I have traded altcoins and I lost. Trading a particular coin require different leverage. You can even reduce the leverage while trading altcoin because of higher volatility and trading fee will reduce.",

People are usually recommended for rehab if they become a danger/risky to themselves and/or to other people, and money is pretty much vital to live normally hence if one becomes addicted, then they're likely just blowing money... keep that up and you'll be broke soon.From a non-professional perspective. One way to tell the difference between normal and addicted traders is how dependent they are to it. For instance, those who suffer from addiction could experience withdrawal symptoms if they stopped trading and is basically mainly trading to feel good/satisfy themselves.",

But can the effects of trading addiction be positive or even more detrimental.If there is too much loss, this is because addicted traders continue to have the ambition that they can benefit from several series of losses that have been made, so a lot of money is wasted because there is no more control over the trades that are made.Trading addiction may occur due to a number of reasons such as the urge to continue to seek profits, overconfidence, and dependence on the sensations and emotions associated with trading.This addiction will also lead to depression, stress and some serious financial problems for those involved.To avoid trading addiction, it is advisable to understand and limit the risks associated with trading, create a clear trading plan and discipline to follow the plan, and limit the time spent on trading. If you feel that trading has taken over your life and affected your emotional and financial well-being, it is advisable to seek professional help.",
