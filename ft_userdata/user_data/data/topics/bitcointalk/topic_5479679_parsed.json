My friends will say you must lose before you gain or rather have more experience investing in Bitcoin. This is not always true because you can have an early success if you will just hold on Bitcoin without being a weak hands when the price go down. The only time this saying is true is if you enter on investment while you don’t know what exactly you are entering because you will always be fearful when the price going down.If you will just hold Bitcoin, You will never experience realized loss but rather just a paper loss which you can recover by just holding. You are not really losing your money on Bitcoin if you will just hold tight until the price is high that is good for take profit.",

That is, accumulate just like the way Michael Saylor is doing with Microstrategy and after a long duration maybe close to a decade, you sell it off and reinvest.  Also, if it is to trade BTC or cryptocurrency that challenges you most, it is the truth they say that you would make much losses at first until you learn the right practice to secure your trades.

In order to be successful in Bitcoin investment, you need to have certain skills and experience. You cannot learn them overnight and even after learning you cannot put that into work to make profit quickly. Bitcoin investment has always been a long-term plan and you need to be able to wait for that moment to come if you want to be profitable. It is not necessary that you lose in Bitcoin investment but the person who lose must not have enough knowledge about it. Then again, profit and losses are a part of any kind of investment. It's a risk that you have to take in any kind of investment which does not exclude Bitcoin.Everyone will say this and I will say this too, if you have the will to hold your investment till the right time, you will be profitable. Holding is the key when it comes to Bitcoin investment but it is also necessary to learn when to sell. Because it will not keep on growing infinitely. What goes up, comes down too. Buy and hold. Also, wait for the right time to come so that you can sell and make a profit.",

But to say that you have to lose your money that is both value and an asset as a feature of Bitcoin investment that means we relating Bitcoin to some altcoins or even Ponzi schemes, no one loses with Bitcoin unless you choose to liquidate your holding at a less price compared to the price you bought the Bitcoin. But anything other than that means you will recover,  so if this is the assumption of those making such misconception statements, it then means that they do not really understand what Bitcoin is and stands for as an investment.",

Even if it is not a guarantee that bitcoin will rise today or let say this month, there so many people who are speculating that it will sky rocket in value when the bull market arrives. So if you have bought your bitcoin and you make it stay in your wallet without selling it until the right time, you probably will get a profit. If bitcoin goes down below your buying price, you still have the whole portion of bitcoin that you had bought, the logical thing to do is to just wait for it to rise in value.New investors lose because they sold their bitcoin because of fear or panic, that is why they lose. You don't need to experience it that's why just hold it long till you are satisfied with the price.",

If you invest at the same time as before but decide to wait for more bull markets for a bigger profit, you might lose before you gain. If you consider something like a 5-10% price drop a loss before gaining, then it's extremely likely that you will lose before you gain.But if you aren't selling, you aren't really losing when the price is temporarily down. You can just wait it out and gain. At least, in theory.If you're worried about volatility and losing what you invest, I think it's better not to invest because there are no guarantees that everything will go smoothly.",

If its how it work, Bitcoin isn't for a low income earner as well as not gonna make you rich when you can't invest something tangible to it.  Bitcoin is a volatile asset and is subject to up and downs in price. You’re right, bitcoin isn’t going to make you rich overnight. It takes time to reap the rewards of your investment. Even if you’re a low income earner, you can still buy bitcoins, you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can buy fractions while you DCA. The most important thing to remember is to invest only what you can afford to lose.

Those days are gone now, Bitcoin has become more popular and more valuable. I don’t think those guys were 90% certain Bitcoin would reach this price in such a short time. If they did, we wouldn’t have the Lazlo story and other stories of people misplacing their wallets hodling large amounts of Bitcoin.

If they're up, they're happy, but when they're down, they feel the pressure to sell.Give them enough down days in a row and their conviction will fail, forcing them to sell. That's how it usually works for first time bitcoin buyers and that's why most of them lose money.Use my advice. When you buy some bitcoin, treat it as a loss. Don't go back to it to check what it's worth every day or even once a week. Come back when you see mainstream media write about bitcoin and how much money it made in the recent year. You lose only when you sell at a loss.",

It is not about a person who's a low income earner or a big earner. It's about understanding the entirety of Bitcoin about it being a very volatile asset. If you have understand that then obviously, you're aware that there are some thoughts that you'll get to see along your investing here that it's not always going up. There will be times that the market is going to be lower than you are expecting but at times, you'd see it moving up a lot.Quote from: shepherd_gee on December 29, 2023, 04:11:47 PMMy biggest fear is losing my hard earn to something as volatile, vulnerable and uncertain as btc. Then invest somewhere else which don't have a lot of volatility unlike Bitcoin. How about go with gold, real estate or any of those typical assets that are tangible and you have no worry that they are not going to show random volatility as you buy them. Bitcoin isn't for the fainted heart so if you've got one then you better step out or keep on learning.Quote from: shepherd_gee on December 29, 2023, 04:11:47 PMWhat's the possibility you invest without losing.

However if you are in profit without any loss then that's good as well. We just romanticize the idea that losing is part of our Bitcoin investment journey. But there are just people who can handle things better than most of us. Bitcoin's market value is just too volatile wherein losses is a bit impossible to avoid. In most cases, loss is temporary especially if you are into holding and not with swing trades. You have an option to endure sudden price dumps but since we are talking about Bitcoin as an investment, then it has less risk than with other projects and coins we can hold for a period of time. We should just avoid thinking that profit will be easily earned if you will invest and hold for years. However, things on lower timeframe reveals this idea more.",

I will not consider the volatility of bitcoin that leads to some occasional decrease in value of bitcoins to be a loss, that is just normal. You must be prepared to loose money if you must invest in bitcoins, but some looses are not severe, while some can be really damaging that you may never be able to profit. To avoid the losses that completely can ruin your chances to make profit, try to learn from other people's experience so it does not become a must in your situation to experience loss before you can then profit from bitcoins.",

However, it is not all starters who lose at first, some might, some might not, and some will win at first and lose the money somewhere later. Above all, and whatever your case is, it is all about the learning process to gain experience, and that is why it is very crucial that you do not invest big money in the beginning. You must ensure that you know how to trade very well and are capable of managing your portfolio actively before you get to invest big.Again, you should know that trading and investment are not the same things, and if you strike a good asset at a lower price, then the possibility of not losing is so high, yet, being a good speculator is very important. Finally, there is no guarantee in any market, be it investment or trading, it is all about your experience, smartness and managerial prowess.",
