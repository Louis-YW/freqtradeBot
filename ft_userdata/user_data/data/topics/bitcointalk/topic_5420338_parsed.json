You can find several articles online and most of them are pointing out an increase in crypto remittances and tourists as the positive effects. If you're from a developing country, improvements in those two areas will most likely help your Government in fighting the economic recession.",

I know that  bitcoin  didn't  come to the world  to take over fiat currency but is there anyway bitcoin  can resolve it? While Bitcoin does not solve all the economic problems that arise in different countries.  The first cryptocurrency very well helps to overcome the sanctions associated with the ban on the use of settlements in dollars and euros, as well as the freezing of settlement bank accounts.  Bitcoin is innovative money, this is what encourages people to use Bitcoin in certain situations. At the same time, the reasons for the economic problems of states may not be in the monetary plane, but have other fundamental reasons.  In this case, Bitcoin will not be able to help resolve the situation.",

But to be whole dependent to bitcoin for your entire economy to get up, it won't be enough.Bitcoin won't be the only thing that will help to resolve that. If we're talking about an economic crisis then it's going to be composed of many sectors that has to help each other.But that's a good thought that you have as it means you're really believing on it so we does.

I'm not sure bitcoin will reduce the impact on the deteriorating economic conditions of a country, but to some extent bitcoin has helped its users to reap the benefits. This will help users earn profits which in turn can give them financial stability, but volatility often creates a lot of problems for those who have no control over their assets.Bitcoin won't be very positive about the impact of a country's recession, but it will probably be the best option for those who really care about a good store of value instead of fiat.",

      "body": "An economic recession is the increase with unemployment due to the decline on economic activity. So how come Bitcoin would aid this problem? Most of the people will have no job ef there is a recession, so when would they get money to invest in cryptocurrencies? Also, would it be an assured profit? Ofcourse not. It could either bring temporary food on their tummy or leave them in huge debt from enduring market downfall. Many people are confused with how investment and this industry in general works. There's still that stigma that once you've invest not only in bitcoin but also other tokens, you'll earn profit easily. Think of how many investors gave up and reflect why did they quit if it is an easy money.Quote from: woez on November 10, 2022, 09:00:59 AMWhen a country or economy faces a recession, recovery will be difficult to achieve.

This technology is free of tax, governments won't make use of it. Even if they would use third party wallet or banks accepting cryptocurrencies, do you think investors would comply using that 'bridge'? There are other ways to get their money from this industry. For sure they'll avoid being taxed by the government, which closes the idea or tendency for such plan to work.",

I know that  bitcoin  didn't  come to the world  to take over fiat currency but is there anyway bitcoin  can resolve it? Regarding economic problems in all parts of the world, it is clear that Bitcoin cannot solve all the economic problems that exist in every country unless all governments want to buy Bitcoin and legalize Bitcoin into the payment system. Because Bitcoin only helps everyone who believes in profit when they buy at a low price, so they can overcome the problems they face in their own environment.As for tackling the problem of an unstable economy in a larger scope, I don't think it's Bitcoin's job because Bitcoin was not created for that. But Bitcoin is here to accompany everyone who doesn't hesitate to continue to have it all the time so that they can benefit from it, indeed in general you can use Bitcoin to invest and try to make a profit, but basically you also need to be patient and also have to be prepared with the risk.",

I know that  bitcoin  didn't  come to the world  to take over fiat currency but is there anyway bitcoin  can resolve it? No! Bitcoin is not a magic wand which will be able to solve an economic problem or instability. Rather bitcoin is more unstable than any other fiat currency. Its price moves from one pole to another in a matter on minute. So when it comes to stability, bitcoin is not a great choice to be made. Bitcoin can do wonder only if you can hold it till the next bull cycle and get out at a correct time. Bitcoin can help where there is no banking service. Bitcoin can help the people to pay and get paid digitally. When it comes to resolving the financial issues, an economist will be a better choice rather than adopting bitcoin.",

This is unlikely, unless bitcoin is widely adopted on the country in which you live the effect of bitcoin will be minimal, however for the few fortunate people which have bitcoin then it could have important benefits but only if they can keep holding their bitcoin until the next bull run, something which will be difficult to do for most people as they have to pay for their needs, utilities and debts.",
