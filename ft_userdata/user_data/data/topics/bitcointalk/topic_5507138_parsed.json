Only 21 million coins will ever be created; This means the more demand there is for BTC, the more Bitcoin will be distributed in the world. And greater demand will drive the price up for each tiny piece of that distribution.And demand for Bitcoin has been growing steadily over the years.",

If you can hold it for that long till the price passes this face till your next generation takes over, which I'm sure will be more than a decay, the price by then will definitely be something worth keeping a small family generation going. How they manage it will then determine how long it will serve.",

From observation all the folks who have make a lot of money from bitcoin holding for years did it out of very strong and determined personal conviction. One guy on reddit put his owe savings in bitcoin 11 years ago out of personal conviction. Do your homework and follow your personal conviction on creating generational wealth via bitcoin. I am yet to see anyone who had personal regrets in going all in in bitcoin. Some basic questions to ask yourself, what was the price of bitcoin 5 years ago and what are the predictions of bitcoin in 5 years? What are companies and government outlook on bitcoin? These questions and more will help you.",

To me generation wealth is a wealth that can not be exhausted by your children, or your children children upto the 4 to 5th generation are the kind of wealth i assumed to be called a generation wealth. But however, one needs at least 100 to 10k bitcoin to say they have a generational wealth if carefully and properly being used. What creates a generational wealth is a running real estate, shares in a company as well having some thousands of bitcoin. But say one bitcoin, except you won't temper the investment for the rest of your life.",

If we are to bring it down to individual levels, I would say that this completely depends on what or an amount an individual considers as a generational wealth, like for example, some may consider nothing less than a million dollars as a generational wealth, while for some people, even the current price that 1 btc is at currently is already a generational wealth if only they can have it.For me in particular, any amount above a hundred thousand dollars is a generational wealth, this is very achieveable for 1 btc, so if somehow, I can get up to 1 btc and hold it until it's worth that amount, I consider myself generationally wealthy though I may even hold it for much longer.",

In that case, I don't think so, at least not during our lifetime, maybe it could be for our nephews. Let's consider a couple of things for your scenario: the value that 1 BTC should reach in order to make generational wealth, and from there we should think about the total BTC's market cap which would be pretty insane.Last thing, let's not forget inflation because maybe some day we'll have 1 BTC = $1 million but at the same time an average car could cost $100k...",

Bitcoin can create generational wealth but if your kids are not smart they will lose it. Imho generational wealth goes beyond having assets you can leave behind, for a family to sustain their wealth in the future the parents have to teach the children fundamentals about money and personal finances as part of the family values. So whether it is real estate, bitcoin, or stocks, maintaining generational wealth will depend heavily on the financial education of your heirs.",

It also depends on the when though since there's a difference in buying it at $10k and seeing it grow to $1M compared to buying it at $900k and seeing it grow to $1M. Pretty obvious though since it's always early investors that profit by a h uge amount compared to late ones. I'd still buy Bitcoin even if it doesn't make that much though. It's at the very least going to let you profit anyway, big win already imo.",

So you only have $19.5K, we shouldn't forget with the inflation rate too, $276K capital today isn't same to $276K capital in the last 20 years. On paper your investment grow 4x times, but in purchasing power your investment only grow 1.5x times.$19.5K a year in US is small, imagine you've invest for 20 years, but you still not able to live from your investment.https://ofdollarsanddata.com/sp500-calculator/",

If history repeats its rhythm, Bitcoin will give the youth good ROIs if they can own and hold bitcoins.That's the thing, for it to be generational what you have to do is not spend it and be able to pass it on to your descendants. Normally that is easier to do with large amounts of capital, and for the specific case of Bitcoin it would be to buy at least one now, or have it before and be able to hold it to pass it on to your descendants when you die.
