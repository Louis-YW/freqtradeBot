  "content": "USA and russia so the dollar is oil and ruble currency is oil it's all oil.Now the USA sell oil on his block the west block.And russia sell his oil the east block It's like a blood and crps the west hood and east side.The red and blue the ying and yang it's balance.Before war russia was selling oil to USA hood countries usa did not like that now the russia dont role in USA hood.So until USA and russia respect esch other rules no beef inda hoods.The russia has less oil to sell so he can sell no because of sanctions with higher price ( limited supply higher demand higher the price)The USA have a lot more but cheaper ( higher supply...u know i mean Same things goes to street business Inda hood.The people from the hood could be good in the business and economics because they got allready the basics the supply and demand. But but but...USA don't mind russia until the russia don't try to sell on the USA block , off course now it's been discovered that someone was \"rat\" like 2 face probably USA Will clean up and change those countries regime and officials so we Will in Europe USA will work on shadows to deal with \"rats\" u know USA are true mob they are old School you keep your sht together they ain't gona mess with you. Another but big but is Canada USA don't have beef with russia until Putin don't come on to USA block Canada Also sell oil and Canada is west block so USA will make Canada either to go East Side Join with china russia or stop selling on USA block or Canada can sell but need to pay to USA And Donald trump knows how to make people to pay trump knows mob rules and how it's in da hood.But USA Also knows If he don't deal with betrayels the \"rats\" then the rats might go over the russia side so he will lose power and rats Will join with Canada Also so then the USA will be done.The USA need to see now how to play out this game who to trust and who to not USA knows If he try to do something for rats it gives more power russia so instead of punishing revealing the betrayerls rats sniches he will make those countries weak as possible people to suffering and buying USA oil Even more higher price then now so the next one will Canada whos offering cheaper oil price to compete with USA so USA can deal with the china can deal with russia easy and Europe but Canada it's a problem. So USA can use china to weaken Canada so If Canada is out of the pictuere then nobody can't compete with USA.Canada knows this and likely Canada will going to east side becouse it's too damgerous to play on both sides.But then again too much east influence over Canada USA security might not be good then USA will have to work together Mexico so to work out the Mexico USA partnership in military and economics then nobody can't beat the USA and that's what they do it. While Europe and UK knows USA want to be boss and only power they try to reemerge together... Remember guys USA was a lot interested that UK brexit was happening.Finally USA don't care about Europe as longes USA working together with latin america to build strong relations with them. But If Europe will make USA mad than USA might take out the NATO of Europe and then russia can invade all the Europe without problems.The single USA aircraft carrier are more powerful then all the army together of sweden so now you have idea how powerful Are the USA.And we gona see more the world divided to west and East Side and If the Europe all this situation is good for oil business and USA is happy about profits russia don't sell on USA block and USA is only seller again.But now russia been selling secretly on the USA blocks...so there might be beef u ain't do that ithe hood So russia knows that USA can find out that so Putin might be ready for beef but remember hood beef is conducted that way that another side will ride unexpectd surprised way to other hoods and will stsrt whacking there.So there is possible that USA Will come into the russian hood becouse russia was giving the reasons for beef but the another option will be that no beef just USA will not cooperate with rats and rats sniches in Mafia their destiny will be worse you can't even imagine how bad it might be.So people just think before you LET yourself govern by wrong people If they mess around and brake unerwriten street rules you Are responseble aswell.And since USA placing santcions those rats they can't run away anywhere then just east countries but do you really think that East will respect those snicjes? In the street w,e all know the Putin knows the biden knows If the rat not trusted by one side then nobody can't trust it.Once you Are on USA team u got be loyal that's how the streets are run the rules respect and loyalty So we either have some more sanctions more restrictions or we gona have beef, but USA knows it USA own allies who LET them russia to sell on his block So world is about who's selling whos block that's Also the china been selling too much on USA block and USA don't like that too.If world don't listening USA and too much things going on what's not beneficial to USA then USA will wage Wars becouse war IS the russia and USA strenghts and in the USA russia war those 2 faced people Will be destroyedDon't forget that danske bank money loundering case it's shows exacly that some countries dont respect USA and things like that USA dont like itThat's how it goes the world is one big hood the west and East street rules applies on military goverment and economics finances Right now the main dope Are oil it's all about oil who sells whos not and in what hood",

You're forgetting Iran, and most of the gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE also sell oil (to the west).",

      "body": "The antagonism between the United States and Russia over the marketing of their oil arose in large part due to Russia's military attack on Ukraine and the sanctions Russia faced as a result. In addition, Putin's Russia itself began to blackmail Europe with oil and gas supplies, trying to force it not to interfere in the seizure of Ukraine and not to condemn these aggressive actions. But this time the countries of Europe did not succumb to Putin’s blackmail; they decided, as far as possible, to completely abandon Russian oil and gas as soon as they had the opportunity to switch to other suppliers. Therefore, Russia, through its actions, has cut off the largest European market for its oil and gas. And since Russia has continued to attack the territory of Ukraine and conduct military operations against Ukraine for almost two years, it has practically made itself a pariah on the world stage.",

And they buy it not for DOLLARS, but for rupees and yuans, the use of which is very limited, unlike the dollar. Yes, they declare the indicative price of Urals in dollars, but the real dollars and real income of the Russian budget does not get any more. The gray scheme - although it allows to sell oil on a good market, but does not allow to withdraw all the funds to Russia. This money hangs on the accounts of Russian companies, which managed to legalize themselves in the EU, for example, and they do not hide this problem, Russia is a rather backward, resource economy, which cannot live without a stable currency and Western technology.So now there is a new conflict between Russia and India, where Russia is demanding India to stop paying for oil in rupees, threatening to cut off supplies  The only question is where Russia will put the oil if it stops supplying India ? Because the noose is tightening around the neck of Russia's \"shadow fleet\", and China will not buy more than it needs, and will not buy above the price Russia is told by China.....",

At this point for majority of countries it is all about getting back what is rightfully theirs. For example a lot of African nations want to regain their independence and kick out the colonizers so that they can start developing their countries and improve their quality of living from their vast amount of resources (wealth) they own but has been getting stolen so far from them!Of course as you may already know, different countries are acting differently and have different goals. For example India is playing both sides trying to become an economic power in the near future and has the potential. At the same time Turkey is also playing both sides but only to survive.Even though there are only 4 impactful geopolitical players (US, Russia, Iran, China), we definitely can not limit what is going on to two of them or even a handful like OP did.",

But there are nuances...The first nuance is that until 2022, the confrontation was at the level of capturing new markets, economic tricks, etc. moves. And this “economic struggle” was not between the West and the East, but between economies - the USA against the EU, the EU against the USA, China against the USA, the USA against China. the rest tried to find their niches and hold them. And many of the “warring parties” were looking for compromises, mutually beneficial compromises, or mutual concessions. This is how the civilized world lives.Second nuance - In 2022, Russia decided to unleash the second stage of a global war against Ukraine, being confident that the Western world would again pretend that nothing was happening and would not help Ukraine fight for its survival. But they miscalculated. And in addition to the terrorist war in Ukraine, they launched an economic war against the Western world, provoking and pushing their “friends” to sabotage the global oil and gas market.This, in general, is the reason for what we are seeing now.PS And please clarify - what does Putin and Russia have to do with the territories of the USSR, where Russia was ONE of the republics, called the RSFSR, and the territories of other republics never belonged to the RSFSR?!And if you remember Putin’s speeches at the beginning of 2022, he generally spoke not about the borders of the USSR, but about all the territories that were part of the Warsaw Pact. And as you understand, these are just painful fantasies and complexes",

Well by looking at the economy of both nations, after the war Russia got a lot worse but even before that China was the emerging easter leader, and it's even better now. I understand that it may not look like it's an easy job, but it's definitely their time now.The problem is that while Russia is dealing with sanctions and troubles of their war with Ukraine, China has been dealing with issues of real estate crisis, they have spent way too much money on huge projects that basically got left alone and wasn't needed.

West on the other hand seems to be corrupting itself from within, and not looking all that decent.Yes, the Chinese economy is now causing concern, and many facts indicate a growing crisis. But China, “thanks to” the terrorist war Russia unleashed against Ukraine since 2014, received in the person of that same Russia a wonderful gift - an appendage of raw materials that will “exchange Chinese beads for its gold.” Translated into modern times, Russia will sell its resources to China in exchange for Chinese consumer goods such as drones, microelectronics, etc. things that “great Russia” does not know how to produce, and without which the “second army of the world” loses to small Ukraine. I assume that soon, in addition to gas and oil, Russian territories will be quietly transferred to China for pennies. By the way, I’ll make a forecast - after a while, we will find out that Baikal has been transferred to China. With the surrounding territories or only the exclusive right to water, but it will be. A promising critical resource, especially in Southeast Asia, is drinking water. And China's ownership of the largest reserves of fresh water will give it a chance to maintain a leading position in the regionPS By the way, today China is pumping water from Lake Baikal at full speed... True, in Russia they don’t like to talk about this out loud...",

Geopolitical dynamics between east and west involve the complexity of relations between countries and economic policies that influence the global economy. Many feel this is not just about the US and Russia but rather many regional players and blocs influencing each other. The solution from the sources that I know of is by increasing awareness of the importance of each other to build good cooperation, and there are also those who state that peace is the best solution, and in my opinion the goal is all the same.",

If we take coffee, for example, and the potential problems with this product, we can assume that the price of coffee will rise, but consumption will fall. some people will simply give up, some will switch to alternative drinks, because coffee is not a critical product without which the economy of the world is becoming.Regarding the development of the world economy without war - it is silly to argue ! War brings only destruction and woe to people. World terrorism, both classical and economic, is the choice of totalitarian, terrorist regimes. Therefore, the world should unite to destroy this key problem of the last decades. Otherwise the whole world will plunge into chaos, poverty, suffering.....",

The US and China are the two superpowers that were competing in this rivalry. If we try to look at the current events we can clearly see how this powerful countries are securing their interests in it's respective region. I would rather call it threeway as we have no idea about the hidden agenda of Russia and Russia has always been on the opposite side of USA in any tensions be it Syrian civil wall or Iran related issues. China is class apart as west cannot match their productivity or manufacturing boom but there has not been so much standoff between China and USA like it has been with USA & Russia. Had it not been for USD and use of USD for trading export-import it would have lost it's status as superpower.",

Right now you are too focused on a very tiny portion of what is actually happening in the world which makes your view very limited.The East vs. West is far more complicated than just Russia and US and only oil/gas. And even though there are only 4-5 actual geopolitical players, this affects the entire world and the rest are picking sides making a big bloc versus bloc.I was like this too, it's East vs West but when you look at international news and politics, it's more than just the East trying to dominate the West, there's no countries united in destroying or one upping the other direction because there are countries in east that leans toward foreign policies and international relations that favors the west and vice versa, I mean look at Ukraine, that's a glaring example that not all of East are against West. I do agree that it's complicated as just East vs West but I believe that this is more like a Neo Cold War but with oil and global influence as a way to fight against each other, I mean Putin was mad that Russia lost a lot of land during the collapse of the USSR so in a way he's trying to start something again but it's more different now because a lot of countries have learned already about which side they're choosing.It's not really about domination. At this point for majority of countries it is all about getting back what is rightfully theirs. For example a lot of African nations want to regain their independence and kick out the colonizers so that they can start developing their countries and improve their quality of living from their vast amount of resources (wealth) they own but has been getting stolen so far from them!Of course as you may already know, different countries are acting differently and have different goals. For example India is playing both sides trying to become an economic power in the near future and has the potential. At the same time Turkey is also playing both sides but only to survive.Even though there are only 4 impactful geopolitical players (US, Russia, Iran, China), we definitely can not limit what is going on to two of them or even a handful like OP did.Russia is still a prison of peoples who were previously forcibly annexedTo her. Therefore, indeed, many of them will now take advantage of the weakening of the central government of Russia by the war with Ukraine and will try to gain their independence. Previously, such attempts were brutally suppressed by constant repression, but now the situation is gradually changing. The Kremlin's power is now weakening due to the significant absorption of material and human resources by the war, or rather, the weakening of the repressive apparatus. Russia practically does not have its own oil and gas. She shamelessly takes them away from the indigenous peoples of Siberia and the Far East. Defeat in the war will certainly exacerbate these internal contradictions and lead to the actual disintegration of the Russian Federation into separate republics. Great Russia will come to an end.",
