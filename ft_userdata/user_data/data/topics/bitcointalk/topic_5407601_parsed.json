Newbies can not post image, but you can just use the image on https://imgur.com and paste here the link in a new post reply here on this thread. Before it can be concluded that a gambling site scammed someone, there should be enough proof from the victim. You have no proof yet that you were banned for no reason.",

Some of the side do not let their customers know before banning them. because they feel like before you partner with them all access their site you might have read there are rules and regulation so informing you before burning is not proper from the way I understand it so that is why anyone who is operating to any site have to read the rules and regulation before the person start working with the site",

I challenge him to do and post a proof of his claims and that he didn't break the casinos rules Also you posted a link to a post sis you read the post about that OP he admitted to his wrong doing and the loop hole he was using. .untill now yes I believe you are naive sorry but yes you are for believing one side of the story. .. without a single proof",

But if you think breaking some casino own rules is a sufficient reason to steal customers funds, you are defending casino scams. Because if you are not aware of that, it's precisely how worst reputed casinos like 1xbit are scamming people. They just claim you have breached their ToS and they steal your funds. I'm sure PD could be able to find one so called rule you've breached for example. Cases leading to lock or cancel customers winnings should be clearly defined and reminded, and cases leading to the lock of all customer funds should be the most serious and uncommon cases and should be always handled by a separate and independent entity.",
