      "body": "So far, Aleo is being mined in the test network and more than 14,000 full nodes have been launched, the developers promise to transfer everything mined to the main network after its launch. Besides, mining is possible only on Linux, I wanted to try how the RTX 4090 and core i9-12900KF assembly will mine, but so far there is not enough time, and then maybe there will be no sense anymore.Upd: I tried mining on a pool anyway hpool.in and I turned it off, because the processor loads heavily, besides, after the launch of the main network, the coins mined in the test network will be converted at the rate of 5:1. RTX 4090 outputs 370 h/s somewhere, another damominer miner reports at startup that your gpu is not supported.",

It's not like they are trying to launder money or finance terrorists, they are actually helping the network run.Does anyone know a good reason why they KYC miners?Well, this is the decision of the development team, I think these are the requirements of regulators, but in general it is strange to say that the purpose of Aleo is to create private applications on a private blockchain and at the same time introduce mandatory KYC. Also, if you mine on a pool, then the pool will undergo verification and not individual miners, there are no details for individual verification yet. Probably, the list of countries under sanctions will be the same as for ambassadors, these are countries such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Crimea, Donetsk, and Lugansk Regions of Ukraine.",

Just like how crypto exchanges start with no KYC, then partial KYC verification and then eventual mandatory KYC verification. It will be more like a requirement for the pool to do before receiving rewards.Quite strange to me that they even have a blacklist",
