It seems that the price of Bitcoin has increased by 3% from before. Maybe this has something to do with reduced inflation in the US. But we will see until the end of the year, because Bitcoin will dump again after the holidays and the new year. In general, the initial start will be in April if we look at previous years.",

This had happened in the past for no reasons. I mean for example, even if a big exchange gets a hack, that would not impact bitcoin prices deeply (same may affect bitcoin prices heavily in bearish trend).In the first quarter of 2019, after the big bearish year of 2018, bitcoin recovered from ~$4k to ~$15k levels in less than 3 to 4 months of time. I am expecting similar rapid recovery in next 3 months which might be up to 80% of current ATH. Yeah, history repeats itself.",

Bitcoin is going to retain it present a resistant benchmark of $16,000 to $17,000 price for the next few months ahead, most especially now that the impact of all the negativity resulting from FTX bankruptcy and other ugly events will force the price to stay down for a while before recovery will come.",

      "body": "As long as there isn't another major crypto protocol/company collapse then yeah we've probably seen the bottom. Honestly if Luna had never collapsed the bottom probably would have been the $33k Bitcoin hit in January. Bitcoin was high $30,000s when Luna collapsed and that made Bitcoin crash all the way through the Jan bottom and down to $25k. Then a series of other collapses, hopefully ending in the FTX (and well BlockFi as well but the market didn't much care about that one), caused Bitcoin to break $25k and bottom and find a 5 months bottom at $17.5k which looked like it would definitely hold before FTX collapsed and we saw $15.5k. As long as there isn't another crypto collapse to knock Bitcoin below the bottom then yeah we've seen the bottom.Bitcoin is now back above the old bottom that lasted all summer and half the Fall before FTX killed it.US inflation falling is great for Bitcoin because the main thing keeping Bitcoin down after each crypto collapse has knocked the price lower, is that investors are scared of doing anything while the Fed is raising interest rates (of course interest rates have no effect on Bitcoin, as opposed to how they affect companies, but people don't understand Bitcoin so they are just playing it like a tech stock even though if people were educated on Bitcoin the interest rates wouldn't affect the Bitcoin market at all lol). If inflation continues dropping each month and is like under 5% by the Spring we could see the Fed just hold the interest rate steady and stop increasing it. This would allow investors to not be afraid to invest in things and we'd probably see Bitcoin start shooting up pretty quickly.But since Fed will probably raise rates in at least the next meeting in a month and a half and the meeting after that in March, I think Bitcoin will just tread water in the high teens or low 20s through the winter. By April or May we could see Bitcoin finally break out of this bottom range and move past $25k and start heading up for good again. Again, assuming no more big crypto bankruptcies or a global recession.So as to what is next, probably stay above the FTX bottom of $15k/$16k, but stay around $17k/18k/19k for a while.I expect 2023 to be a good year for Bitcoin, could definitely see it back around $40k in a year, but most of that rise will probably occur second half of next year. But second half of 2023 and first half of 2024 we could see some real solid market growth. And then of course that'll continue after that with the halving occuring.",
