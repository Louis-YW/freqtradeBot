I could say, it's pretty much the same industry that people tend to speculate to die just like the internet where people tend to think, WWW is just going to be for the computer guys but look at how the web developed that we send money across the internet eg. Paypal. It took years how the internet becomes available to the masses but it starts as a tool for the military and then in the 90s is where I first used it.Crypto is in the early stage yet. But most important of all is how the blockchain will be used by companies on the web. Right now it hasn't popped out yet but many blockchains are already promising use cases like Vechain.",

Time will tell if people accept the \"dot com fallout\" as a good explanation. Check back in 6 to 12 months and see if the idea has taken off. Or if people have chosen to dismiss it as being counter intuitive.What happened with the silicon valley dot com bubble is, people threw money at everything vaguely dot comish expecting linear returns. Instead they received steadily diminishing returns, severe enough to result in a bubble. Does this draw direct parallels to our current state of crypto? Will the general public accept that as a good explanation for the crash of crypto assets in 2022? I would be curious to know the answer, myself.",

However, crypto punishes the errant at speed, giving bad actors few places to hide.Read article: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/future-of-cryptocurrencies-davos2023I'm not going to talk about the connection between the dot com bubble and crypto from a technological point of view, but from an economic point of view. We know that the dot com bubble was a period when many technology stocks went up very high and eventually plunged and this resulted in many technology companies going bankrupt and closing their businesses. And that has just happened to the crypto world as well. The crypto market experienced a peak when the Bitcoin price briefly hit $69K and then fell sharply, until now the price of BTC is around $16K. This downturn in the crypto market led to hundreds of crypto projects going bankrupt and closing their businesses, and it was most felt in the Defi sector.With the loss of crypto market capitalization this is causing many investors to suffer losses and crypto projects are no longer running their business, and this makes the crypto market seem unstable. However, it actually makes the crypto market healthier as what CZ said \"the market is much healthier in the current winter conditions because only the crypto-believers remain in the field\" ( https://cryptoslate.com/binances-cz-thinks-crypto-market-is-much-healthier-with-btc-around-20k/ ). The crypto market is getting healthier these days, with lots of \"true\" crypto projects, rather than projects that simply offer returns and then disappear. Maybe this will cause many people to be skeptical of the crypto market, but believe me crypto will be more attractive and will be more and more used in the future. Maybe in the future the crypto market will experience another significant increase, but it will also be accompanied by a significant decline and that will make this market even stronger with more innovative and real projects.",

True cryptocurrency will continue to exist in decentralized manner while the false ones will be centralized and controlled/regulated by power hungry tyrants. True cryptocurrencies will be decentralized and controlled by codes and community of global participants... And anyone is free to join and leave at will... It will be voluntary.This is why I choose Bitcoin because it can never be controlled by power hungry  tyrants.The false cryptocurrencies will be controlled and Centralized by them via Trojan horse like Proof of Stake.Lest I forget, internet is still very much unsafe and riddled with scammers, crooks etc. The ones who control the internet failed massive in this areas. They need to solve that first before talking about crypto.The massive crash was general. It affected both the stock market and online websites like Facebook. Cryptocurrency's was very much expected by few people who matter or those who are really at the top in true Crypto space. They are predicting a massive bull run soon and I believe them. So, thanks for the concern. You can now go and fix the massive corruption of the internet",

There are still alternatives out there that they can use but not if the internet disappeared all of a sudden. Now talking about the Metaverse; They are not a new thing as well but their graphics are still poor. It may still take time for them to look real like on what we see on most video games right now like for example in GTA V.",
