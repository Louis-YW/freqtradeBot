      "body": "As far as I know, Kraken is a CEX (centralized exchange), meaning you don't have control over your private keys, so I'm not exactly sure how you've managed to copy them. Are you sure you have the right keys ? Anyways recovering a crypto wallet while having the private keys is a relatively simple process, this guide should help you out:https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-import-a-wallet-via-private-key/844",

I've never heard of a centralized exchange providing a private key for their wallets before.Quote from: legend666 on January 29, 2023, 11:35:01 PMyes, when i created it, i saved them and i have the right one.Are you sure about that? I don't know what you saved, but I doubt it's a private key.",

Or another scenario is that what you have is a private key but not in Kraken, maybe its a personal wallet, a non-custodial wallet like Electrum or Bitcoin Core.And please, if someone message or PM you and telling that they are willing to help but you have to give them your private key, don't. Because if you give them, then they have control of your private key then and if by chance you have something it it, they could steal it from you.",
