This prophecy is to deceive members and seek favour from political candidates. Religious leaders should not take advantage of their position to influence the mind or their members about a political candidate. Members of a religious body should also be enlightened enough to have a choice in who they see fit regardless of the person's religious beliefs. Religious leaders who begin to involve themselves in politics are after their stomach and are already deviating from the purpose that their position has.",

Religion is a mind control tool that can be used to lure masses into following a certain political leader/ruler or aspirant. Religion can build or destroy a political system. I think you have already seen such examples.",

The problem stems from some of our religious leaders who have sold out their value for money and are constantly attempting to maintain the faith of their followers.",

      "body": "Culture is more important if you're viewing this from a political viewpoint, and of course, religion is a subset of culture.Religious affiliation itself is going down worldwide and even then you'll find emphasis on religion during political discourse. Not necessarily because the religion itself is important, just the underlying value systems that a religion adheres to. You look at any \"western\" democracy and you'll find judeo-christian values will have shaped those democracies for many centuries. Naturally, the leaders of those nations have all been from christian backgrounds. The islamic theocracies in the middle east shaped by Islam have divergent paths compared to a judeo-christian democracy in the west.Culture can be eroded rather quickly and those that find religion antiquated may not realize that it doesn't even take a generation for value systems to be shifted entirely. Not that you need religion to live a moral and ethical life, but it helps.",

I remember in the bible times where the person who is to rule a nation has already being shown to the prophet and if he doesn't say it, severe punishment, but now just so thier pockets will be lined, they tell lies. It's now safe to say some religious leaders are part of the problem of a nation.  Quote  So my question is how significant is the role of religion in the politics of the world today and how good is the effect on societies so far?In my opinion, there's no significance. A religious leader can choose to turn his congregation against a political leader simply because he has the wherewithal but it's not supposed to be so.",

Because if there is no really important reason, in the religion that I follow too, religious leaders are not allowed to get into the world of politics, unless there is a very important reason, be it for the benefit of religion or the state. So the role of a religion in the world of politics, is actually not bad. Because all the goals that are made the basis of it are goodness and peace. So I personally don't blame this, because the most important thing is that all of them have good intentions for the progress of the nation and state.But there is one thing I don't agree with, about the role of religion in world politics. It's not that I don't like the religion. But sometimes with the decline of parties from a religion into the world of politics, not least sometimes there are always those who take advantage of this for their personal interests. By pretending to be someone close to a religious leader, after his goal is achieved all his behavior changes 190°. So in essence, religious parties coming into the world of politics is not bad, but what makes it bad is that a few people use religion for personal gain.",

Whilst in my country, there's really a certain impact for having a religion's back on a politician. It's because whenever there's an election, each vote counts. And whoever is the candidate that the religion will support, that's also the one that will be supported by its members. Although many of them are giving free will on who to cast their votes but certain religions do have block voting and that's why whoever gets that support of that certain religion, they're likely having a huge flock of voters gonna support to them whether they like or not its platform.",
