I know it's only $2 but check out the links before you pay.Somewhat I am looking for those also, I am interested in gathering local groups from those specific countries where people meet and do transactions using crypto with the final purpose of more research for AML.I will edit OP, by big communities, it may mean 5000 people on telegram, active groups, forums, discord, facebook groups.The price may seem low, but someone from India can easily share 20 forums, 20 tg groups, 20 discord channels, 20 facebook groups etc and make easy 160$.",
