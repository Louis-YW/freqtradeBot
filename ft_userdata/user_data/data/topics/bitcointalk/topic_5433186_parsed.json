This kind of hack occur when hacker get access your private key. They have a special type of bot which will automatically send Eth,bnb and matic to hacker address. Some hacker use this trick to fool newbie and they say that we have 500 usdt in address but cannot withdraw and will give you phrase key. Newbie send gas fee which automatically sent to hacker address. There is no possible solution for this .",

Just like what you have said, in order to move your USDT you need to have ETH. But their bot is programmed to steal your ETH only and not the USDT that you have. So you are in a dilemma on how to move your USDT then without the hacker accessing your ETH. Not sure how much USDT you have in your wallet, but it could be dead end for you.And it's obvious that you have been hacked, there could be a malware in your system right now monitoring your wallets every move.",
