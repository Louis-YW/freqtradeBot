Do you believe that price action is more essential than trends?That's why it's a prediction, the degree to any certainty is miminal but, bitcoin was able to attain its ATH at $69k and that's pretty close to the earlier prediction of $100k. $30k is still a good some but, you could as well commend the currency with how far it came.When we come to trading the market, its always a matter of strategy and what goes with a trader. No matter what your approach might be, one thing I feel you cannot do is trading against the trend. It would take a lot of nerve and assurance in your trading skill to do that. Unfortunately,, such assurances is the one thing you can't get in trading the crypto market.Also, there isn't a particular design ot procedure for the market. It just assumes various forms and figuring it out is a matter of how well informed you are on analysis.I think this thread though it focuses on bitcoin, it's more related or better fit in the trading subboard than bitcoin  discussion.",

While trends, come occasionally. For those that do day trades, they have to follow the trends and that's how they're making money from it. Jumping from one trade to another and that's making them realize that it is what they need and understand how it's staying for so long. Because they're all temporary, the timing and how long it last will also determine them when they should get out from it.",

Most traders predicted that trading bitcoin would completely disrupt the market. Do you believe that price action is more essential than trends?your query is more similar to this one -->When Bitcoin will become stable currency?. Because in the topic, OP also asked about BTC as being stable currency not as an asset. (similar context). Well the point is he aslo wants BTC to be used as payment method not just for trading purposes to make money out of it because his intention were reflecting that doing trading of BTC will hurt its image. (you should read this thread out to get better idea of your query).Now in my point of view, \"Halving of BTC will bring bullish then bearish cycle\" is a Market trend that you mentioned, will bring FUD and FOMO and we should avoid it, and focus on price action to buy at low and sell at high. Well, i think you are wrong, because price action is only applicable for short period of time and market trends are for longer period of time.For example, to predict the price of BTC in 2024 we can get help from past charts and many market trends, but if we want to make profit today, then we have to find market trend too, it could be based on week, days, months or years too. So, both price action and market trends are basic fundamentals of trading BTC.",

Whoever is living on the market trend and has not yet gotten used to how the situation in the crypto market can be is just a newbie who has not yet had experience with how the market can be. For example, in the month of March, there were a lot of speculations that Bitcoin would reach $30k, but it failed those who believed so. It was in April that Bitcoin finally reached $30,000. That is just how the Bitcoin price fluctuates and is so difficult to accurately predict. Those who are not yet aware of it will get to know more about it sooner or later.",

Price actions indicated historical data, analysis, prediction and many other things. You can implement those in order to choose the best position for a trade. But with trends, it is hard to guess what will happen next. So in order to make the best decision, we can use both of them according to our needs and if applied correctly, it can give us a good result. Where you have the option to use both of them, why would you ignore one and focus on only one?",

Do you believe that price action is more essential than trends?Price action and market trends are both important aspects of trading for me, each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Price action refers to the movement of an asset's price over time and can provide traders with valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. While market trends are patterns of price movements that occur over an extended periodand can provide you  with an understanding of the broader market sentiment and direction.Overall, for me both of them are useful but they should not be considered in isolation. Us traders should use a variety of tools and techniques to more develop a comprehensive trading strategy that incorporates both price action and market trends.",

This has been the only way I haven't fallen victim to involving myself in a trade that will liquidate my assets.How I decide and buy a few coins that I find worthy of holding: I overlook the current market price and have a very low ROI budget. A lower demand for high profits actually reduces the risk of losing a trade. Let's use Bitcoin, for instance. I don't buy and hodl Bitcoin because I want to make 10–20 times the profit from my invested capital, or I even buy because I notice the price was about $30k last month or year, and so I expect it to be the same price or more in the coming weeks or months. This is called higher expectation by assumption, which is actually something I avoid. I buy Bitcoin using today's price with the calculation that I will hold it for a certain number of years or until I hit my selling target. This makes me not in a hurry to take out profit.

Emotions become easily influenced when the market experiences a bearish trend, and indirectly, this lack of discipline in controlling emotions can be detrimental in the future.There is an applied strategy of emotional control, but that's not the case here. I practice this emotional control strategy when I am day trading; I know when to stop and when to start, and when to call it a day regardless of whether the trade is in my favor or not. That's where emotional control comes in. I have to control my emotions when I am losing a trade in order not to incur more losses. I also have to control my emotions when I am having a bad day, either with other work activities or with something around me. This is where I have to also control my emotions and not transfer them into trading, which poses a higher risk and trait to every trading practice.I agree with the greed part. I call it control of greed: me not being too greedy, which might result in me leaving myself with nothing because of a higher expectation of a higher profit. Because I have seen a craze bull run, instead of sticking to my mapped-out take-home profit decision, I started longing for more profit (greed). What I do most times is this. Let's say, for instance, I bought $1k worth of Bitcoin at $16,000 per BTC, which should give me 0.065 BTC, and my target is to sell when the BTC price hits $20k, which should give me an extra $300 as profit if I ever hit my target. In the process of waiting, I see a quick bull run, and I meet the price at $21,000, which is more than what I have been expecting. Looking at the market price chart, I believe that the market will go up higher again. The best thing for me to do at that point is to share my holdings into two parts: sell one part and take both my profit and my invested capital, and hold the rest. By watching the market closely, if the market is to go higher, I will still gain more, but if the price is to drop a bit lower, I will also use the sold-out funds to purchase more and add to my holdings.",
