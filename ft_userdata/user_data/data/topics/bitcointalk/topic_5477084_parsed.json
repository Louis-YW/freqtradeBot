Can you implement that in the bot? I don't think so. And that's my point. I don't like trading bots at all. You can calculate analyze the market as much as you want with your strategy and data, but the real market movement does not always happen based on calculations. There are human sentiments and emotion attached to it which could lead the market to go entirely the opposite direction of your prediction. Or should I say your bot's prediction. If you can't do it on your own, then trading is not for you. As I said before it's not always about calculation and mathematical terms. So you can't always win even if you have your dream bot with all the feature, if it does not have human emotions.",

With what your question is, I think the answer is simple. If developers can be Abel to build a very smart bot that can outsmart human traders and be able to make more successful trades than humans, then the majority of traders will be satisfied with it and will definitely start to use it.",

So, my question to you is what do you want to see in your dream bot?The truth is, AI, or bots, trading bots are still not advanced or cannot manage to automate the trading. Its because AI now a days, yes, is being advanced, but the thing is, in the field of trading, AI can't handle this field. Why? Simply lack of information, AI rely on information or data stored to them or programmed to them, and as we know, trading is unpredictable, especially since coins or cryptocurrency are volatile and their movements depend on many factors, so jow can. Can artificial intelligence handle it? Yes, trading bots will be really helpful if they are reliable, because trading bots are now vulnerable to failure as they are still not optimised to handle such trading. But even if AI or trading bots can handle trading in the future, I will still be against it. Imagine all of us using this tool and keeping on winning; then there will be no balance.",

What I have learn is that, nobody is able to predict when it’s the perfect time for entry and exit.Trading bot are also programmed by human people, so If you understand or learn a strategy. It doesn’t matter id you apply it manually or automatically with a bot, your dream bot is just the one that can make you profit most of the time but the hardest and risky part is if the bot doesn’t break and do the opposite when your strategy have issues.",

If it were possible them everybody will be millionaires, because we'll be very sure will of what the outcome of trading will be and put all our money into it. In the end crypto trading will definitely shut down, including other forms of trading like forex.So for me bot is to aid in trading, not to replace the human factor of analysing and predicting the outcome of trading. We can not expect more from bots, because trading depends on futuristic outcomes, so either humans or machines have to depend on analysing probabilities of data's available to be able to predict results, and this can not give accurate results.",

I personally don't fancy trading using bot despite their features but for the sake of question you asked, I will like to see a bot that would be intelligent, intuitive and adaptable. It should be able to learn from the rapidly changing crypto market and adapt its strategies accordingly with some advanced features such as the ability to automatically place orders and execute trades without my notice if the market is conducive and I am not around to give order.Quote from: beerlover on December 09, 2023, 07:44:49 PMPersonally my biggest regret is the fact that bots are buying based on some data, and I can buy according to that data, if there is a both that can buy based on something that I can't replicate myself then I would consider that as good and understand that it would be my benefit, of course depending on the results, but I want a bot to be able to do something I can't do.All the bots that we have right now, are software that does stuff that I can do too, but it does it 7/24 non-stop, that is literally all that it offers, be able to do it constantly non stop for things that I can do myself as well.

The difference between this bots and human is emotion. Since they are machine programed, they trade without emotions because they have no feelings but as far as they still lose trade, they are not too better than humans. Some people believe that bot can give them 100 percent accuracy based on what they read online but that's very far from reality.",

These things you mention are the things that make someone a trader, so if you are complaining or still yet to know them or complaining that you get exhausted while going through them, then definitely you are still yet to be successful traders because a good trader doesn't even think about AI bots; all they know is to work with their knowledge and analyse the market and take the next step to their trade, not until they use the AI bot. However, a trader who uses AI doesn't know how hard it is to trade or how hard it is to analyse the market because they don’t use their brain to analyse; they wait for AI to do things for them, which is wrong and can make a trader too lazy to even learn some new things.QuoteCrypto trading bots have been extremely helpful in that regard, with the promise to automate the process and help us make informed decisions.But let's be honest, most bots out there fall short.

However, AI bots are not functioning properly at the end; they only work when they are newly started, but when time goes on, they stop functioning properly, and that is why I don’t trust or use them.",
