Imagining what happened to them after the hospital was bombed is just gut-wrenching. I also just heard that the Israeli warplane bombed a bakery that provides food to people in need not long after targeting and bombing the hospital.",

Peace is priceless and a call of war can be boycotted.At times of oppressions if you have children and children with defend less people around you and you goes out to price a war what happens? Of course the product of war you priced would be delivered at your door step and if you the war vendor is not there to attend to them the war drop barbaric and terrifying messages to your defend less people.With due respect OP, the Israeli and Palestines crisis has been for years now but there came to be a \"seize fire\" aftermath.Wasn't it obvious that the Palestine's woke up the sleeping dogs by attacking the Israeli's during the seize fire? And they basically targeted on the defend less citizens such as children, pregnant women and aged citizens including taking others on hostage making a barbaric sluttering video of the hostages and raping of their females. Oh damn.Apparently the Palestine's terrorists are being disguised and anonymous living amongst the said defend less civilians which triggered the action of \"no mercies\" by attacking the hospital.What did you expected the defend less civilians of Palestines to be considered when the Israeli civilians were not considered on the Palestine's first attack? Couple with the terrorists amidst the civilians in the hospital.And why didn't the Palestines terrorists stand to face the war they called upon after invading Israel with the terrible activity that was carried out there in Israel?There better be a path to seize this fire because even after winning the war the victory is not worth lives lost alongside.",

There is no crater. When the MK-84 explodes theres catastropic damage, the damage at the hospital looked way different. The main impact site was 3 cars and even those seemed relatively structurally sound. The surrounding area around the blast was also damaged in a way that is in no way relatable to MK-84. It is way more consistent with some sort of fuel based explosion. Theres just no argueing with the forensic image. You could argue that another type of a warhead was used by the Israelis, and thats fine, but this was not done with the MK-84.For reference - this is the impact crater near the hospital:https://twitter.com/clashreport/status/1714575575749161388",

Thats the impacts site, now go and look at that with a straight face and say thats a mk84.I even added the image below. Thats the mk84, a 2000 pound bomb ? really ?image uploader",

But some questions are running in my mind which include 1. Where is the wreckage from the projectiles? Were they immediately removed to cover up shreds of evidence? This question cannot be answered now because information is still unfolding. 2. Have the Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired any missiles that malfunctioned? The answer might be yes based on some reports. In August last year, there was a report that misfired rocket by the Islamic jihad group killed fourteen Palestinians. I cannot verify this report but the group didn't take responsibility or deny this allegation. 3. Has Israel ever attacked any hospital in Palestine since October? Yes, Israel has attacked hospitals without remorse. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), since the beginning of this conflict Israel have attacked Palestinian health facilities for about 115 times. I saw a woman grieving with a wrapped dead child, I hate to see people suffer especially children. I am currently in a mournful state.",
