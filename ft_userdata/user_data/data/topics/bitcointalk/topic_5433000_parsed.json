      "body": "If you want to buy some it's better to buy through their blockbank app and make sure you use a refferal code (you could use mine or not up to you) that way you buy 25$ worth of bbank and you get 25$ bbank. You have to lock the bought tokensNever mind just check the project I think it's worth investing in",

Since you are already with this project 2 years ago, probably you should already know it there’s still a chance for this project to recover, know if they are still making a good progress, ask them for their future plan and see if its a good one or not, if you trap on this project better to hold instead of selling it at a big loss.",

Why would this be anything else then that has been done 100 different ways already.Also teams who list their token on Bitmart as their first choice don't know what they are doing and that's a red flag for me. They would be better of keeping their token on DEX trading with just a contract address to be more credible. Listing to CEX isn't a good thing when CEX is known for fake volume (it was stupidly visible in the orderbook spread activity, low liquidity, high volume).Also bitmart is shady as hell. If team doesn't know this, they are not taking their token very seriously.",

You carelessly buy their token after seeing the price went down which is common once they gained the profit. We are in bearish market now, but I've seen most of these token after getting listed they never went to go up anymore unless if someone has to put huge investment in it or everyone would hodl but the I have a doubt about the investors and the dev of that token. They were all the same that I've seen in the past but if you know what you are doing or how their market move your better take that profit already and leave because the longer you stay the more you will likely to lose that investment.Anyway, I've never heard about this project since I don't like to bother on bounties or tokens anymore. I've had my lesson in the past although it seems like you are shilling it here.",

If I were you, I'd stay away from that project since I did not heard about it.First time as well I'm hearing about blockbank. The lack of notoriety isn't a good signal for this project. They offer up to 24% APY on their native token BBANK, what isn't a good signal too. I think they want to copy business model from Crypto.com and NEXO, and since it's the goal of OP to look for such investments, why don't go for one more popular and notorious already?This blockbank seems too sketchy. If you look their Twitter you will see they are distributing 100$ in their native token for people asking them the best questions. That means their token has no value to be distributed like this.I think interesting they offer a Visa debit card, though, and I ask myself if that is for real.",

How about an update from the developer? if there is never news of an update it could be that the development team has given up and left this coin project.",

They are making progress you can check their telegram. And about staking the guy mentioned no it's not 24%anymoreThat ended on OctoberNow staking on their app has tiers starting from the first one you have to own 250$ worth of bbank to get 2%apy highest tier owning 50k$ to get 10%And yeah they are rolling out visa cards to beta testers will start on eu and uk. They have made great partnerships during the past year and a half.",

If they have future plans you might expect for a price recovery in the next bull market, they also need to increase their marketing strategy since their volume is low and their market exposure is not that ok. Better not to increase your holdings anymore and just wait if there’s still a chance for this project to rise.",
