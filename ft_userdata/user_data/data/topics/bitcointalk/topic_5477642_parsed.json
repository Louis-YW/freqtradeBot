Make we try to not be a hypocritical member for the forum, make everything wey we talk and advice make e be weting we they do and pracrise.I believe that before a post is considered for merits there are criterias it has to meet before it can be merited. So anybody posting something that is irrelevant or misleading stuffs cannot get merits from such posts. So it's left for whoever that's giving the merit to determine if the post is meaningful, helpful or it's a lie or Truth. But if you notice someone posting misleading information you should let the person know that what he/she is doing is not good and should stop posting such in this forum or LB.",

We have seen many posts wey dey very obvious say na just cooked up stories and d person wey post am go was defend am so dat them no go regard am as liar or a person dat misleads others. He no bad to share life happenings here for people to learn but trying to frame up a story that is not true is very wrong to do, it is better you refer to it as a case of caution for someone to take instead of lying and saying that it actually happened. Also, informations shared here are subject to more research before you will take action on the course because not everything you see online is accurate as it looks.",
