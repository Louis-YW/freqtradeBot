You are correct. Escrow is good for a fresh manager like him starting a campaign. But we have also seen managers who never escrowed payments yet they paid. Am hoping he will pay as a member who has some positive trust on his profile. He has some site running and I do not think he will want to mess that up with scam accusations on his person.",
