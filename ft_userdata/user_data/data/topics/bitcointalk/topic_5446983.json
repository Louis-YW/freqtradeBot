  "content": "Aka, Yet Another Ordinals Thread(warning: this topic is self-moderated. post cranky opinions for the 40th time elsewhere if you don't want them deleted.)It appears uninscribed ordinals are now being purchased in addition to their inscribed counterparts.Now that Bitcoin has been de-fungified down to the last satoshi, the Ordinals system of satoshi numbering is giving rise to some novel (perhaps exceptionally bizarre) value propositions. One of them is the idea of rarity levels within the existing ordinal database of satoshis.Here's how the ordinals rarity system is described & defined:QuoteHumans are collectors, and since satoshis can now be tracked and transferred, people will naturally want to collect them. Ordinal theorists can decide for themselves which sats are rare and desirable, but there are some hints…Bitcoin has periodic events, some frequent, some more uncommon, and these naturally lend themselves to a system of rarity. These periodic events are:    Blocks: A new block is mined approximately every 10 minutes, from now until the end of time.    Difficulty adjustments: Every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, the Bitcoin network responds to changes in hashrate by adjusting the difficulty target which blocks must meet in order to be accepted.    Halvings: Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the amount of new sats created in every block is cut in half.    Cycles: Every six halvings, something magical happens: the halving and the difficulty adjustment coincide. This is called a conjunction, and the time period between conjunctions a cycle. A conjunction occurs roughly every 24 years. The first conjunction should happen some time in 2032.This gives us the following rarity levels:    common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block    uncommon: The first sat of each block    rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period    epic: The first sat of each halving epoch    legendary: The first sat of each cycle    mythic: The first sat of the genesis blockThe ordinal sold above was first wrapped for Ethereum via Emblem Vault, meaning it is \"vaulted\" and locked on the Bitcoin blockchain side and bridged to Ethereum as an ERC721 NFT token. These make Bitcoin assets sellable on Ethereum NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea.It is traceably the \"first\" satoshi of block 781463, or satoshi #1932164375000000, which was mined on Mar 19 of this year, which makes it an uncommon sat according to the system of levels above.Here is the OpenSea listing:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/55140395024419181You can see the BTC address associated with the vault is this one:https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LmRqGW1vFzkNKqKShMN5FZwvi19xvwJKJYou can match the output containing the \"uncommon sat\" in the address to the entry for it on the Ordinals explorer, as its current \"location\":https://ordinals.com/sat/1932164375000000So essentially somebody paid $3,600 for $2.24 worth of BTC. Its more than 1 sat b/c there's a buffer of 7,999 sats around it that can be used to pay for tx fees if it should be moved again at some point.And it doesn't even come with a monkey picture. LOL.",

Would they see it as valuable or not?The sale was the first of its kind, and most likely designed to be a marketing stunt. Hard to say if \"sat hunting\" or collecting will catch on as a thing.Every 10 minutes a new \"uncommon\" sat is generated so I doubt that's going to mean 2 free ETH for whoever finds it first, forever, lol. How this particular one worked was somebody bought 10 BTC from Binance that was from recently-mined blocks and then located an \"uncommon sat,\" isolated it, and vaulted it. Clever but you need at least $280k to stand a chance at getting one that way.Quote from: Nwada001 on March 31, 2023, 08:12:13 AMOut of curiosity have lots of questions in my mind: What's the point? Since NFTs are limited to one holder that's until it's sold out again, do the buyer think this will be more price and higher value attached to it in the nearest future ?? I guess the point is its a \"fun\" way to introduce collectability to individual sats. I would think \"uncommon\" sats that were mined in 2009-2010 would be more fun to collect, but you won't catch me shelling out big bucks for them.The buyer was likely thinking in terms of resale value but we don't know for sure until they put it back up for sale at a higher price.",

One of them is the idea of rarity levels within the existing ordinal database of satoshis.This is kind of wild, but also interesting, thanks for sharing. The bottom line is if there is the opportunity to make individual sats into collectables, then collectors will trade them, whether valuable or not! Not convinced this makes satoshis de-fungified (non-fungible you mean?), because already each individual satoshi was already non-fungible as it isn't divisible. The only difference is some are apparently worth more than others. But if you wanted to spend this 1 satoshi (that was sold for 2 ETH), then you'd still be able to spend it as 1 satoshi. It's not like it's value has been altered or would be rejected in relation to Bitcoin.Quote from: nutildah on March 31, 2023, 08:41:43 AMI would think \"uncommon\" sats that were mined in 2009-2010 would be more fun to collect, but you won't catch me shelling out big bucks for them.Think about how many millions of \"uncommon\" sats were mined in 2009-2010, then you realise why they wouldn't be that uncommon, only old",

Art is not fungible. Collectibles are not fungible. Even rare coins become not fungible by the fact that they are taken out of circulation and made rare. What we're seeing here is arbitrarily deciding certain $1 bills are worth more than other $1 bills because of the serial number. Nobody is collecting and paying extra for bills based on serial number. I mean people are free to decide that they value anything for any arbitrary reason, but that doesn't mean that value is worth it. This is literally someone pretending the serial number of a satoshi is worth a vast amount of money based on an arbitrary assignment of value by I believe the creator of Ordinals in order to sell his product to gullible people.It's just sad.I mean hey if someone wants to lock away 8000 satoshis forever at a high price in order to have 1 specific satoshi for an arbitrary reason, whatever, it takes 8000 Satoshis out of circulation and makes the circulating supply that tiny bit less for the rest of us. But it is sad people are this gullible. People this gullible are the reason why politicians/regulators think they need to make laws to prohibit people from using money however they want, and once politicians get that idea in their head they run the risk of getting in the way of people's lives for no reason.I mean hell if someone told me a small gullible community of people arbitrarily values one of my satoshis for a lot more than its worth and they are dumb enough to pay me many thousands of satoshis for my single satoshi, I will happily take their money. That's just trade. It's just sad there are people that foolish/dumb/gullible and that they've found their way onto something as cool as Bitcoin. Altcoins and altcoin NFTs had been sucking up all the extremely gullible people in crypto, but now they are finding their way to Bitcoin but using it in the most gullible and silly way possible lol",

Some would say that collectors are stupid or too addicted to owning special or rare coins. However, this phenomenon can be compared to the artworks of famous painters sold at auction for exorbitant amounts of money or items that belonged to famous football players, such as a t-shirt or shoes. Some people are willing to spend a lot of money to acquire these items.",

These make Bitcoin assets sellable on Ethereum NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea.It is traceably the \"first\" satoshi of block 781463, or satoshi #1932164375000000, which was mined on Mar 19 of this year, which makes it an uncommon sat according to the system of levels above.Here is the OpenSea listing:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/55140395024419181You can see the BTC address associated with the vault is this one:https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LmRqGW1vFzkNKqKShMN5FZwvi19xvwJKJYou can match the output containing the \"uncommon sat\" in the address to the entry for it on the Ordinals explorer, as its current \"location\":https://ordinals.com/sat/1932164375000000So essentially somebody paid $3,600 for $2.24 worth of BTC. Its more than 1 sat b/c there's a buffer of 7,999 sats around it that can be used to pay for tx fees if it should be moved again at some point.And it doesn't even come with a monkey picture. LOL.Shocking to say the least... I can't think of a reason somebody would want to buy that crap. Crazy m(b)illionaire? Clueless person who's not sure what he's buying? Reseller planning to sell later for more $$$? In any case, the next level of retardation...",

In any case, the next level of retardation...  the game is simplecreate a story, a narrative. then have 2 accountsone selling a story. and one buying the story. in both sides its the same person. but now the story is published and seen as being sold. years ago back in the early days of ebay. people were putting a regular UK 50p coin on ebay for £25 and saying its a special coin.. (real world its not)the seller is also the buyer. thus it registers as \"sold for £25\"the game is to then find an idiot to pay something between £0.51-£25.00 due to them seeing a \"sold for\" listing to make it appear that it must be worth upto £25sellers usually say things like \"im offering it half price for £12.50\" where they try to convince idiots that they are getting 50% off when in reality they are paying 25x (2500%) morebut the important thing to rememberthese listings of the first sell are the seller and the buyer being the same person thus no actual money win or loss in the listing happens in the real world bar a £0.20 listing fee",

Of course, that 2 ETH would just have reduced fees but still, to have some kind of transaction volume on the Ordinal itself is okay. I'm not sure how they would have that in effect at the market. Would they see it as valuable or not?The sale was the first of its kind, and most likely designed to be a marketing stunt. Hard to say if \"sat hunting\" or collecting will catch on as a thing.I also think that it is just a marketing stunt.  I do think that the person who bought this one knows the person who is selling it.  They are creating a marketing trend somehow, I don't know how many wealthy people will fall under this scheme and take the bait.  Quote from: nutildah on March 31, 2023, 08:41:43 AMEvery 10 minutes a new \"uncommon\" sat is generated so I doubt that's going to mean 2 free ETH for whoever finds it first, forever, lol. How this particular one worked was somebody bought 10 BTC from Binance that was from recently-mined blocks and then located an \"uncommon sat,\" isolated it, and vaulted it. Clever but you need at least $280k to stand a chance at getting one that way.These people do have lots of money and don't mind spending just to create a brand trend.Quote from: nutildah on March 31, 2023, 08:41:43 AMQuote from: Nwada001 on March 31, 2023, 08:12:13 AMOut of curiosity have lots of questions in my mind: What's the point? Since NFTs are limited to one holder that's until it's sold out again, do the buyer think this will be more price and higher value attached to it in the nearest future ?? I guess the point is its a \"fun\" way to introduce collectability to individual sats. I would think \"uncommon\" sats that were mined in 2009-2010 would be more fun to collect, but you won't catch me shelling out big bucks for them.The buyer was likely thinking in terms of resale value but we don't know for sure until they put it back up for sale at a higher price.Once they put it at a higher price, I think another related person will buy asap.  I don't know, I just feel that some group of wealthy people are creating some scenario here.  Maybe I am wrong or...",

A similar concept would be identifying satoshis that have been transacted the least number of times and trying to sell them for extra based on the arbitrariness of least transacted. Or like if Satoshi suddenly appeared and tried to sell all his bitcoin at $1 million per Bitcoin based on the idea that the bitcoin he mined are collector items lol.Just convincing people that arbitrary valueless things have value and then parting them from their money. Con-artist stuff",

Art is not fungible. Collectibles are not fungible.That's like saying because dollars are fungible people can't collect rare bills. You can't dictate what people can or can't collect. Its not up to you, its up to the collector and the free market.Quote from: franky1 on March 31, 2023, 07:58:51 PMif you follow the taint back to a previous spend where the lock amount originated from.. its not the first or last spend.. its a middle spend of a previous spendIt doesn't have to be a first or last spend.Quote from: franky1 on March 31, 2023, 08:57:46 PMthe game is simplecreate a story, a narrative. then have 2 accountsone selling a story. and one buying the story. in both sides its the same person. but now the story is published and seen as being sold.

BEFORE it is even gives the REMAINDER of the utxo to recipients. the mining pool firstly takes out the mining pools tx fee from that utxo.yep recipients get the remainder (the change) afterthe recipients are at the end of the process, the mining pools are before the recipients(at the spending block the mining pool claim the fee first. becasue the rewards are at the top of the block)thus all \"first sats\" go to pools. if you follow any logic/data flow science (which CODE is based on)thus in logic and data flow.. the mining pool gets the first sat of all transactions and spends. whether rare or notenjoy that entertaining thought",
