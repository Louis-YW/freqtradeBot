  "content": "Hi Ive mined about 12 bitcoins in 2010/11 ish when they were 30 cents with a PNY gtx9800, but I stopped mining cause it was worthless and couldnt play league of legends at the same time.I used MS DOS at that time it was the only way to do it.Now my question is if the wallet.dat file was ever in the bitcoin folder or always in %APPDATA% ?",
