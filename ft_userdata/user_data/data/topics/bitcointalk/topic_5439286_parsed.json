But before something like this can work it means those head of the religion has to be aware of what Bitcoin is and also know a little bit of how the process works, that way it will be more easier to convince the congregation to adopt Bitcoin. Quote from: Dakcrypto on February 10, 2023, 01:02:38 AMSecondly Bitcoin is better than saving in a bank because it appreciate while it is been saved in our wallets and it is also an investment,Don't forget that Bitcoin is volatile meaning it can also depreciate. If you intend to go one with this initiative of yours then you probably should prepare the mind of those you want to enlighten about Bitcoin. If you decides to tell them only about how Bitcoin value can appreciate what then will happen when it starts depreciating and you and I know that those you have spoken with concerning Bitcoin are definitely going to tag you and Bitcoin as a scam. All I'm trying to say Op is that what ever you do don't just tell people about the advantages /benefits of that thing alone try to also add the disadvantages/risk-involved to it, if they decide that they're cool with it then that's fine rather than them discovering it the hard way.",

Let they do their religious jobs.With religions, people are so fanatic and they can be misled by religious leaders that we can not exclude if you want to use religious leaders to advertise Bitcoin. I see more adverse effects than good effects from this.Bitcoin itself is already a kind of religion and the Bitcoin religious communities are becoming bigger world wide. If you want to contribute for Bitcoin adoption, let's build your community but please don't mix it with religious communities and religious leaders.",

Regarding religious leaders in both churches and mosques who can tell or teach about Bitcoin, I think this is not a good suggestions, there are so many people who really believe what is conveyed by religious leaders as the true truth, if they teaches about Bitcoin even though theirs doesn't have the appropriate knowledge then it will be like a disaster because you shouldn't let people who don't know Bitcoin properly teach it to many people because this can make them wrong in making decisions and will only make them think that Bitcoin is a way to get rich where this is already a big mistake.",

In itself, it doesn't sound nice already. It seems the way they get into Bitcoin is antithetic to Bitcoin's philosophy. Not to mention that these leaders are basically spiritual authorities, probably not well-equipped to make sure the believers know and understand all the implications, especially security matters, regarding Bitcoin.",

This is not right, majority of Nigerian citizens are Muslims, Bitcoin is haram for Muslims due to high risk and there are a lot articles discuss about this matter. I know there's will be an user will disagree with this and give a source if there a Muslim's master saying Bitcoin is legal etc, but it still doesn't change Bitcoin is high risk.QuoteSecondly Bitcoin is better than saving in a bank because it appreciate while it is been saved in our wallets and it is also an investment, so many people complain from there day to day activities with the local banks of been debited without cause and reducing the expected savings this is not a good reputation and Bitcoin has solve this aspect of issues, with the security of wallets, hard ware and software wallets fraud is been reduced making both the old and the young to believe that they are saved from been scammed through BTC.

Anyone intelligent enough to understand the distinction between religion and finance will find this irritating.Imagine hearing bitcoin referred to as the \"coin chosen by God Almighty\" — I'm sure I'd never want to talk about bitcoin ever again if that happens.

I believe church should never be involved in any promotion regardless if it’s legal or illegal, because this may sound like manipulation of the minds of the people to do such things even when they aren’t supposed to do it. Most particularly for bitcoin since it’s a very risky investment, so if one should decide to invest in it, he should be knowledgeable enough and knows exactly the risks involved when investing in bitcoin. Otherwise, he’ll end up losing his hard earned money because of relying his decision from other people.",

Also, what makes you think that all those people in the church or mosque will fully understand Bitcoin? Or even agree to invest in Bitcoin? It looks like forcing them to me, churches and mosques consist of older people too, they can't get involved because they don't and won't understand what bitcoin is all about. This move can easily get you in a big mess if someone does something wrong, either when transacting with BTC or a massive dump happens after they invest in bitcoin, do you know how fast people condemn bitcoin and call it a scam?",

For things to promote bitcoin by religious leaders in my opinion it is a strange thing and is not an effective step, basically they teach the meaning of life and matters of obligation and prohibition from God, of course they do not have any interest in spreading and explaining bitcoin to their people and more bitcoin is still said to be a new discovery, unlike their centuries-old understanding of religion, of course there will be contradictions if promotions are carried out by any religious leaders and there will be chaos with their adherents. As for religious leaders who are asked about bitcoin, they will definitely answer not on the substance of bitcoin but more on how useful bitcoin is for the people and whether it will be detrimental or not. I think they will only act whether or not bitcoin is used in a religious sect without carrying out any promotion.",

Religious leaders have so much followership that their followers sometimes obey them more than the government. I am sure that immediately after these churches announce that they can receive offerings and other donations in bitcoin, millions of their members might become aware of the currency. And it is possible that some of them might become interested in bitcoin. The only problem this suggestion will face is that banks are restricted from dealing with bitcoin. Most of them might be discouraged because of the Nigerian government's unfriendly attitude towards bitcoin.",

I don’t see any relevance bitcoin should be taught in a church just for the goal of promotion. Maybe outside the church it can be possibly done but never when the mass is still going on. Especially that bitcoin is not yet legalized in most countries so it might create a form of opposition on the people around knowing illegal things should never be introduced or promoted particularly from the mouth of religious leaders. So I think I have to disagree to OP that bitcoin should be promoted by religious leaders.",

Hey mate you have spoken fine but I would remind you this that religious organizations are government recognized institutions, they are approved entities to operate as religious body not financial institution or financial advisors so therefore will not want to risk their license in going against the government as they are not certified financial experts. Although religious organizations have large followership, committed and devoted members but that does not mean that they would start telling about finance which I believe not all would accept. As we all know, this is a very sensitive matter as it has to do with financial investment and one needs to be careful when when it gets to this level of getting involved in religious activities. Your religious leaders would only advise you to seek the face of God before going into anything be it business etc but can not tell you where to invest because they too know how sensitive it is and are very careful about it so that you do not put your loss blame on them. Come to talk of it they are not financial experts so why going to them for such? Although they have influence over their members but that does not guarantee that members too would listen to them when it gets to that level as they too are very careful about their investment.",

TBH, I can't think of a reason why somebody must connect religions, churches into Bitcoin.I can't find any churches that are promoting any crypto project at all. I don't know if religions promoting Bitcoin will be good or bad, but I don't think that they will promote it at all. I mean if they can't benefit from it then they will not do it and besides, not all of the churches know or has been engaged into Bitcoin or crypto in general.Quote from: Dakcrypto on February 10, 2023, 01:02:38 AMSecondly Bitcoin is better than saving in a bank because it appreciate while it is been saved in our wallets and it is also an investment, so many people complain from there day to day activities with the local banks of been debited without cause and reducing the expected savings this is not a good reputation and Bitcoin has solve this aspect of issues, with the security of wallets, hard ware and software wallets fraud is been reduced making both the old and the young to believe that they are saved from been scammed through BTC. Well, you are thinking of telling to these savers to just invest their money into Bitcoin instead of saving it to banks right?I can't blame those who wants to save their money into banks because maybe they are lacking of financial literacy thus, they grow up with a mindset of \"Save all of the money into our banks\". Another one is there are some savers who can't take the risk of investing into Bitcoin. Do you expect that all of these savers can take the risk of holding an asset that goes up massively, but goes down massively? Do you expect that they will just be ok when they see their investment or in this case savings' account going down because of volatility? I don't think so. After all, there are some factors whether you will invest your money into Bitcoin, or to just let it save in banks. Those elders who are saving money into a bank can't take the risk of taking out their money from banks and put it into Bitcoin.",
