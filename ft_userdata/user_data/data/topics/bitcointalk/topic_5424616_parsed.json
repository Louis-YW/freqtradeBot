  "content": "Have any cryptocurrencies considered pairing with a project like the library of babel?quick refresher: The library of babel I am referencing is an online database of every possible configuration of a collection of random letters.I was thinking about AI video generation and I had the idea of an extra capability where the AI reverse engineers a prompt from a video that you produce and ties that prompt with a seed that produces your video. Now you have a key that allows you to produce your video without saving it locally.Then I wondered if the \"proof of work\" concept inside of cryptocurrencies could help us begin decrypting the library of babel. Seeking knowledge that might not even exist yet.Instead of mining a fiat currency, people could mine for knowledge.Is this not the kind of idea that crypto has been waiting for?How hard would this be to dumb down for mass adoption?",

Now you have a key that allows you to produce your video without saving it locally.If you are thinking along the lines of restoring data from a SHA-256 hash. I have bad news for you. It won't work.Quote from: Cryptostic on November 30, 2022, 06:36:03 AMThen I wondered if the \"proof of work\" concept inside of cryptocurrencies could help us begin decrypting the library of babel.

Random, by definition, contains no information.",
