  "content": "I am coming to the conclusion that the cause of mostly all current problems in Western countries is a lack of democracy. I will try to substantiate this thesis:1) Russian propaganda loves to show the horrors of leftists rule in the West, such as how people are turned into transgenders and the like. There is some truth in these accusations; the idea that the state should support oppressed minorities has become considerably distorted, and these minorities began to oppress the majority. But the democracy, by definition, is the rule of the majority, and if, for example, the United States had referendum democracy, at least the Swiss model, I think there would be no such problems.2) In addition to the power of the leftists, in some states and countries there is the power of the rightists, who, for example, ban abortions and make the population more religious. And as far as I know, in all places where the population had the opportunity to vote on the topic of abortion in a referendum, it allowed abortions. See above about the Swiss model.3) Over the past 100 years, Western countries have seen a continuous increase in taxes and state participation in the economy. And this is done not because the population wants it, but because politicians want it - because this state money goes through their pockets. This mechanism is described in the book “Parkinson's Laws”.The point is that in Western countries the population does not have the opportunity to directly decide what taxes they will have and what to spend the collected money on. It is believed that the population, too incompetent to resolve such issues, will vote for the abolition of taxes; I’m not completely clear about Switzerland yet.4) In Germany, the authorities closed nuclear power plants, preferring to buy Russian or Saudi oil. The last stations were closed in 2022, which is the height of cynicism. At the same time, there were referendums on this issue in Switzerland, and the Swiss voted not to close the stations. The results of these referendums were contrary to the polls.5) Currently the European countries have small armies. Trump fought with them, tried to ensure that EU countries would spend at least 2% of GDP on defense (not to depend on US protection), and was not successful. Some people say that NATO is the naked king, that Europe produces fewer canon shells than North Korea, and that in the event of a war between the Russia and Germany, the latter will stand during no more than two weeks. But this is not because the Europeans have become somehow decayed or sickly; they just, again, cannot decide anything on this issue. My argument is that referendums were held twice in Switzerland, in which the population voted to retain compulsory military service.My worldview was influenced by the film “The Illusion of Democracy”, I suggest everyone watch it:https://youtu.be/mhOOziH7QAo",

Unconstitutional...patriot act etc.    Powers should include veto power to any new law or presidential decree etc. A five page (current standard size of paper for this posting) maximum to any new bill introduced and one law per bill to stop the sneaky $h1t. Term limits for the out of touch senior citizens? Better yet, do nothing!",

      "body": "I am not an expert in the history of the West and the history of democracy as a whole. So my opinion could be completely wrong or biased, still I would like to share it. There is a common trait when we talk about developed and functioning democracies and those traits are mostly tied to the idea of the freedom of ideas, thoughts and individual development up to the point the personal economy alllows the citizens of those democracies. Many of the problems we see in the west are unheard of in autocratic countries like Iran, China or Russia, because of the level of suppression they have. Their systems are based on forcing all their citizens to move in the same direction, regardless of what their religion is, their race, their political ideology, etc. In Europe and the United States, while it is good to have the liberty they enjoy, it is also once of their biggest weaknesses, because it is easier to manipulate, divide and weaken the population from within, by sowing ideas which are favorable to the adversaries of the West. There comes the Chinese and Russian interference in USA elections, for example. The average person in the west has become such a easy target for whatever progaganda or fake news coming from whereever media lab in the east, to the point the freedom of speech and rights of the Americans and Europeans are wielded by people who wish to out an end to them. It would be the equivalent of someone in the CCP using their power to get rid of Communism and the CCP itself, it won't happen because of the nature of Chinese politics, but it can certainly happen in the west. Democracy and Republican values and not to be taken for granted, as the laws of Thermodynamics, instead are supposed to be defended and protected from Ill intentioned people.",

      "body": "What actually needs to Rule is good/fair Law, perhaps why it's called Rule of Law. If this is the case there won't be need for democracy by tyrant majority/minority. Every decision by the people, whether majority or minority will be based on the good law and no one will be oppressed or treated unfairly. The law is based on love for the CREATOR of the Universe and for man. It's given to humans by the CREATOR to be a guide to them.If you deeply consider this, you would realize that murdering those who don't deserve to die like via abortion is evil and should never be lawful",
