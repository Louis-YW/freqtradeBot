These pools with higher hashrates aren't going to attack the network or anything, and that's because they stand more to gain if they use their computational power to look for blocks than to attempt an attack. Having said that, miners are definitely going to pull out of any pool that turns malicious and they are going to lose most of their hashrate, so there's prolly nothing to worry about.",

Thay may let a lot of other miner's blocks orphan, well yes a 51% can do that.. But a 51% can't move balance for one wallet to another without having those wallet's privatekeys, they can't create more coints than the mined coins limit, they can't change the consesus rules or anything like that.I'm not an expert, i know that 51% \"attack\" is bad, but is not the worse right? I think that there should be a topic for that more detailed, please if somebody have that link put it here.Regards!",

Less concentration of mining power is the actual decentralization so it is kind of jeopardizing the decentralized nature of bitcoin.Quote from: kavuncu on September 23, 2023, 07:36:05 PMWhy do miners stay in 2 big pools and give them more than %50 power? Even if they don't use it for evil.Miners operates for making more money so its obvious that they can sustain being profitable only if they are under the pools where there is high chance of getting rewards and also geolocation plays a vital role in profit making so miner has to choose place the location where electricity is cheaper that is why it is scattered on few locations not all over the world.But the fact is the Foundry USA and Antpool started to gain more miners when china restricted the mining operation that is th reason you may find the these two pools have very less total computational power compared to now.Quote from: kavuncu on September 23, 2023, 07:36:05 PMWouldn't it be better if total of the biggest pools are less than %50? Would you prefer 4 pools for %50 rather than 2 pools for %50?2 or 4 doesn't make any big difference, as long as someone is having the control of 51% of total hash rate they can control the BTC network but practically they need to spend billions to make millions which doesn't make any sense that is the reason why 51% attack will never likely to be performed by someone even if they have control over 51% hash power.",

Would you prefer 4 pools for %50 rather than 2 pools for %50?To wipe out your fear, you must read some articles. I hope you will read those articles but to summarize, there are some big mining pools that have big hashrates and some pools were believed to owned by same owners. They did not do any attack when they had chances because your fear shows the reason, they will not get benefit by doing this. Bitcoin network is decentralized and is believed to safely against attack that makes its high value. If any attack happens, its price will be destroyed, drop a lot and mining pools will be in the hell too. They don't need hell as they have a lot of capital spent for their mining farms as well as hold many bitcoins.There are some insightful information and charts in those articles for dominating, big mining pools. Some big mining pools like Deep Bit, BTC Guild, GHASH.io, Slush pool but they all refused chance to do network attack.How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?The evolution of mining pools and minersâ€™ behaviors in the Bitcoin blockchainVisual Analytics of Bitcoin Mining Pool Evolution: On the Road Toward Stability?Two tools to check what percent of global hashrate does the potential attacker have?https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-confirmation-risk-calculator/https://web.archive.org/web/20181231045818/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html",

Even if they don't use it for evil.It theoretically poses some risk, but practically it does not. These pools are profit oriented and with their individual hashrates they have a guaranteed chance of getting one of four blocks confirmed, that's a chance to hit a reward every ~40 minutes. Even if hypothetically both miners could merge to attack the network, there is no guarantee that they will be successful, their chain will likely be abandoned by all nodes and they will have miners pull out en masse from their pool into other ones.It seems safer to take a guaranteed profit every 40 than gamble with no long term possibility.Quote from: kavuncu on September 23, 2023, 07:36:05 PMWouldn't it be better if total of the biggest pools are less than %50?

They stand a higher chance of making a profit if they associate with the top pools as long as they meet the specification to join.I will rather 4 or 8 pools for 50%, but it's not a real bother.",

Consider the amount of investment in mining gear and energy required to perform such an attack. It doesn't make any sense to do it.You can't change other participant's transactions, you can only temporarily censor transactions by deliberately excluding them from your own blocks, rewrite last few blocks at most and double spend your own coins. In doing so, you would ruin Bitcoin market confidence and trust and very likely the price of Bitcoin as a result. You don't benefit from this, your investment will burn, too. Honest mining will gain you more than foul play!For Bitcoin a 51% attack is no viable option to gain profit and thus overrated by newbies. For the proper design of a cryptocurrency it is important to take care of and something to watch for closely when a new blockchain is started. But once the amount of PoW surpassed certain thresholds and sufficient decentralisation is in effect it doesn't really much matter anymore.",

I do not think that such an attack will continue for a long time, but it is enough to set Bitcoin back several years. Since this did not happen in the past, we will not be afraid of mining basins or at the present time.",
