      "body": "Economists around the world feared the global recession last year. Still, the fear is being allayed this year as more hope is rekindling, thanks to governments' careful efforts to tackle the menace. Global spending rose much in recent years due to inflation but for lesser goods purchase and service rendering, and a responsible government hiked the interest rates across the board.Still, the effect has consequences on the GDP, Manufacturing/Retail sales and others. These contracted the economy but the effect is subsiding in 2023. So, I don't believe a recession is feasible at least in the near future.",

I believe that it fails to correctly predict any recession. Even if the chart shows that inversions of the 50-day SMA of the 10-year treasury rates minus the 50-day SMA of the 3-month treasury rates have preceded every U.S. recession over the past 50 years, there is simply no evidence from the chart that there will be a recession. There are simply too many unknowables that could alter at any time. The government might propose, among other things, new, advantageous economic conditions and policies.  Anyways, I just feel that the chart is there to give us a head up but there always a 5% uncertainty involved and I am holding on to that.",

I don't know.. right now the situation looks ugly.On the other hand Tytanowy Janusz had in February a pretty interesting point we are already in recession. Unfortunately I am not knowledgeable enough to have a smart enough discussion on that.",

Who is not going to worry with such and do not forget about OPEC limiting oil supplies on a daily basis. The heck is happening on this world, even with a recession only the rich becomes richer.",

In my opinion, the Federal Reserve and all proponents of fiat currency are pulling out all of the stops that they can to prevent their monetary system from crumbling and falling to the mercy of its competitors. It might survive for another year, two years, three years...but at what cost to the people and when will the people have enough of the costs that are being imposed on them for saving fiat currency? The paradigm is already shifting, I think it's only a matter of 1-2 years before the paradigm begins to shift clearly in front of everyone.",

So yeah, we are already deep in recession, there's only one good topic to read, \"Greedflation\" has gone too far!.And we have seen the even US is trying to fight it out, printing money and hiking interest rates to salvage their economy.The question is how many years will we get out of it, 2-3 years? As individual how to get out of recession?",

After the pandemic we haven't recovered any of the things we lost and it is going more deeper than what the professors in philosophy and economies said. I was in church today and someone said in UK for over two weeks they haven't bought egg a common thing we get regularly because of how hard things have become. The economy of United kingdom is going down gradually but we are not noticing it. With power and influence of United kingdom (Britain) they are still facing economy down turn, imagine an underdeveloped and average developed nations will be facing now. This example is to prove that recession has started for a long time now.",

I have heard about it for more than a year and I have not found clear confirmation about the current situation and the next. Maybe we are in a recession today and the government is deliberately hiding the truth so that there will be no panic among the people.I don't think that we have to depend on the Ukraine and Russia conflict to determine the economic stability of most countries in the world, but if that is the case, we will see how influential Ukraine and Russia are in the global economic circulation.",

Although the GDP has continued to raise and this has easy many minds about the risks of recession but if we look carefully the inflation rates are increasing gradually although it is a good thing to control the production of a country and the demands of the products but should it continue it will affect the wage’s earnings and people might seek to ask for increase in wages. We all know most of these companies runs on loans and even during the lower interest rate period it was hard to get one so this could actually result into layoffs of workers by most of these companies. Although the government is trying to cool down the economy but in the bid the amount of employment created has reduced drastically and in near future the unemployment rate will just increase more posing threat of recession.",

These factors include but are not limited to consumer spending, inflation, employment, GDP and interest rates.While some economic indicators may point to a possible recession, it is important to consider various sources of information and seek expert guidance before making any investment decisions.

In the long run, this will most likely cause inflation to rise again, and we will fall into an inevitable recession. We cannot blame OPEC+ for the cuts in production because, however, oil prices did not increase significantly. The dollar is tied to the value of oil, and a drop in oil below $60 a barrel will harm the world more than an increase in prices.If the price of oil drops sharply, it will not contribute to moving the economic wheel because what is happening now in terms of inflation is not directly related to oil prices, but rather the Federal Reserve’s policy of raising interest rates has harmed countries a lot, not to mention the problems from the year 2020.Low prices mean a lack of future investments, which means that once the factories return to work with all their capacity, there will not be enough supply, and therefore the price of a barrel will easily rise to more than $150.",

If this trend continues , and most likely it will be like this all 2023 , we can only hope that it won't be worse than it currently is because inflation lately took a break and we are not on the rise like we were 1 year ago. If somehow , we can stop inflation in 2024 or why not , reverse the trend entirely , then we will clearly have an economy on the rise once again and this will apply in all domains , with Bitcoin most likely having the biggest rise in price.Until then , I personally hope for a friendly current year of 2023 when nothing is certain so far.",
