  "content": "In line with the global adoption and promotion of bitcoin for which  I am a member of this community, fulfilling one of the course for which this community have long being on the move. I decided to take the bitcoin adoption and promotion movement to my locality. My major targets are vendors, traders, skilled and unskilled labors in my locality and my neighborhood. To start with, I met this barber in my locality, he is good at his work and gives nice haircut. I took my time to talk with him about bitcoin and how it works.  At the first stance, he was reluctant and said he does not really have digital knowledge and it would be a kind of difficult for him to go through it but I assured him he would like it when I start putting him through the whole process and he gave in. I started by giving him hint on technological innovation towards digital currency with Bitcoin as topic and subject of discussion. He picked interest in the discussion and started asking me questions about bitcoin and how it works for which I responded to him accurately. It was an interesting and interactive session as I made him understand the whole system and how it works.In other for the communication, learning and teaching process to scale through, I had to come up with a learning scheme for an easier understanding and they are as follows;1. What is Bitcoin?2. When and why Bitcoin was founded.3. Founder of Bitcoin.4. Importance and benefits of holding bitcoin.5. How to trade bitcoin. ( listed some  notable exchange where he can trade bitcoin)6. What is blockchain and how it works.As a first timer, I explained and showed him what a public and private key looks like, showing him a transaction harsh too was another thing I did for him to get a clearer picture of how it works.Never the less, I taught him how to set up a bitcoin wallet, the easiest to be precise so he could easily understand and do it himself, copy and send his wallet address to his customers for payment. As earlier mentioned above, I also told and showed him the difference between private keys, public keys  and transaction harsh so he could get acquainted to them all. For accepting bitcoin as a means of payment, I promised to patronizing him and also introduce him to more customers ready and willing to pay with bitcoin for services rendered  within my locality. He was very happy for my kind gesture of me introducing him to new customers ready and willing to pay in bitcoin which means a plus to his business. It was nice and also fun on-boarding him into the bitcoin movement. I believe he too can reach out to his fellows as I told him to do so because it would aid in the faster and rapid adoption and promotion of bitcoin in other locality where they belong. This course we must achieve until bitcoin adoption gets to the various locality as this is the grassroots goal on target.Edit.....I will keep updating this tread as I continue to carry on with the Bitcoin Promotion and Adoption  campaign in various locality.",

And probably it's important to let him understand the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallet. I'm sure you are aware of what is going on right now.Best of luck to the barber and hopefully he can get clients to try and used bitcoin when paying for his services.",

In any case, it looks like an African country and we have seen several such initiatives in other posts to spread awareness and use of Bitcoin. I too doubt, like hugeblack, that this will turn into a significant volume of transactions in the barber shop, but you never know, as I have read that there is quite a bit of cryptocurrency usage in Nigeria. Nigerians Turn to Crypto Assets as Currency WeakensCryptocurrency usage soars in Nigeria despite bank banIt would be curious if they end up using Bitcoin more there than in El Salvador.",

BTC loyalists do this often so it may no longer be a thing, but anyway bravo for posting this.How popular is BTC in your locality, and will the barber get >2 customers that will want to pay him with BTC in a month, the living condition in your locality is another thing, do the people living in your locality have a moderately good life to care about paying their local barber with BTC, good luck with this, but it is still very hard for merchants to accept BTC in many localities and for many reasons.",

Nigeria are doing great in bitcoin usage even though their government hasn't adopted it yet. Please also teach him not your keys not your wallet in other for him to be safe from scammers and centralized systemI have always think of how people can choose bitcoin first instead of fiat currency but they find it difficult to understand because they are in a fiat world,so I thought that to remove this acarde thought from their minds is for more bitcoiners to campaign for Bitcoin which OP is doing.",

Because it's difficult to explain Bitcoin or cryptocurrency to someone who is completely unfamiliar with them. However, I assume cryptocurrency is legal in your country and that helping to promote Bitcoin will not cause you any problems. If there is an opportunity, that is how we can all adapt Bitcoin. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is not legal in my country, so I cannot do the same. I just tried to explain Bitcoin to my very close friend.",

As hugeblack wrote, though, motivation is what really ensures that the people you're targeting (in this case, his potential or existing customers) are converted to try using BTC at least once.How do you convince them? When they understand why you do it -- some reasons or motivations given (opportunity to send money to places inaccessible by traditional payments, inflation hedge etc.).But even more powerful for me is to demonstrate the positive change (before and after).Example (from perspective of the shop owner): before, I couldn't accept Mister A as customer because he could not leave his farm. Now, I send him a payment request for BTC and I now have a new customer.",

It will catch more eyeballs which will make some people intrigued about what is bitcoin. People may miss simple black text. So adding something attractive may help! Also, in a couple of month, it will be great if you can open a thread to let us know how many people actually paid via bitcoin. I am interested in knowing this number. because while many merchant establishments are interested in accepting bitcoin, there's no substantial data available to understand how many people actually transacts through it. So I will appreciate if you can let us know about it when the time is right.",

Not really since they can just leave it as that and no one knows when a customer that is willing to pay in Bitcoin come knocking.  I believe they will not stop accepting but rather keep it there as an option since local stores doesn't need to pay to maintain their stance of accepting Bitcoin.  It is different in an online payment gateway though.Quote from: Kakmakr on November 20, 2022, 09:20:01 AMBitcoin's volatility encourage people to rather use Bitcoin as a Commodity or an investment ...so people are hesitant to use it as a \"Currency\" ...because they anticipate huge profits on the horizon.    I am not hesitant to use it as currency.  After all Bitcoin is the only payment system for me to be able to transact online.  .  If there is no additional option to use beside Bitcoin, then people will use it no matter how valuable they think it is.",

It's acknowledgeable to extend the news and transaction of Bitcoin into localities so that will not be unaware of cryptocurrency and especially bitcoin.",
