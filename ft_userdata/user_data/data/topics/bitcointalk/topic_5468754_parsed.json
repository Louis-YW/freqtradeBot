A few of the traditional ones might be up for the task. That sayd, looks like being a high roller has its drawbacks, people literally afraid to take the money",

I keep asking myself the following: you say you have already made 45 million wageredThis means that in the same casinos that you are complaining about not allowing you to place large bets, they are the same casinos where you made 45 million wagered, so until you manage to make 45 million wagered it means that the betting value was not a very low value, because If it was a very low value, then you would never have reached the 45 million wagered or am I wrong? In case I'm wrong, could you tell us which casino you played at to the point of reaching the 45 million wagered and why you stopped using the casino that allowed you to play to the point of reaching the 45 million wagered?",

But don’t expect that you will have free flow limits since Stake usually one of the sportsbook that is very generous on betting limits to high roller. If Stake limit your max bet then most probably it will happened too on other sportsbook since no wants an unprofitable players in their casino consistently draining their bankroll. Sportsbet and Duelbits are my 2 favorite sportsbook that I don’t encounter limit on my bet despite I’m winning frequently with decent bet size. But this is a case to case basis since your wager is insane to the highest level. What’s your usual bet size and PnL on both Stake and BC? I’m interested to know how insane your casino port.",

We dont actually have those precise numbers about max wins because sports betting platforms would be actively changing it up basing up on the bankroll or hot wallet that they do have but pretty sure that most known bookies will really be having those millions $$$ limits on which they could potentially be able to hit it up.Dont know if those numbers shown on OP are real or just boasting out because if thats true then he's/she's a whale. Not all people would really be able to reach out those numbers even if we do speak about combining that wagered overall. Its not something that anyone could achieve!",

Looking for more sportsbooks would help him increase his betting size overall since each sportsbook can only allow up to a certain amount per bettor.What's your average bet size? In Fortunejack, i've checked the T&C, and it says the max payout goes up to €100K but it might not be the same with their NCAAF markets. Maybe it's best to try for a betting exchange like Fairlay.",
