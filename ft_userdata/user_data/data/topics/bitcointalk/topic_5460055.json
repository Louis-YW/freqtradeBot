Now I can send from Binance to OKX or back to Binance without the need of the stress again. If someone ask me to send using lightning network and give me invoice, I can easy send with low fee too. Binance has done good for doing this as promised.",

Bitcoin is only on the Bitcoin network, or lightning if you use it. Other chains are not native BTC, you're withdrawing a wrapped token which adds additional risk to your withdrawal. Not to mention it is not universally supported by other exchanges, at least for now. Even if they do support it, you should never use it since you're just exposing yourself to additional risk for a relatively small benefit.",

Right but it can't be stopped since there are users that thinks it's totally fine to go with those other networks like in BSC and other wrapped versions of it. And I think that Binance added those because there's a demand for it and of course, they've got their own wrapped version of it so it should be there as owner of the platform. But in that case, they should be the one to promote that people shouldn't get that much attention with the other choices and only choose the actual Bitcoin & LN.",

      "body": "Better late than never.It is very easy to confirm the opportunism of Binance in delaying the implementation of the Lightning network, despite the successive periods of btc network crises in which fees on the main network were at unprecedented heights. As a reminder, the two most important reasons that contributed to this delay are:- Benefit as much as possible from the fees on withdrawals, which are the highest fees compared to other withdrawals on other currencies. It was possible to activate the Lightning Network service on deposits, but this would conflict with the second reason, which is:- Promoting alternative versions of Bitcoin, on top of which is the version of Bitcoin developed on the bsc network, in addition to other versions. In fact, none of us knows who is behind the development and launch of those versions, and I do not know why Binance supports all of them if it does not benefit from them all.Currently, the Bitcoin network is stable and the fees are very reasonable, but it is good to launch the Lightning Network service for Bitcoin despite its delay.",

Hopefully this will shut big blockers up. When LN gets adopted by every major player in the crypto industry, the first layer will become way more usable than what it is now. LN is for daily transactions and the base layer is a settlement layer for the big transactions. Thanks to LN, unlike the big block alts, bitcoin won't lose its decentralization aspect too. It looks like this is the only way to carry bitcoin forward. Finally these big institutions understood it.",
