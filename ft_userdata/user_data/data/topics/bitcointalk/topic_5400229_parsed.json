When i set my Memory Clock on anything over 1150, it is unstable or crashes instantly. My Card is OC from stock. Thats why i chose this oc profile.And like i said, it even crashes even without any oc or only Power limit set on like 75.",

You do know you have to tune everything again for the 100% LHR unlock. Old settings are not stable anymore.",

If your GPU has overclocked settings for normal you have to benchmark the GPU by yourself again ! Maybe try it with Core Clock (CClock): 1402 , Memory Clock (MClock): 8300 , Fan Speed 75 .Thats my settings for my 3060 LHR 12 GB GPU from there you can tweak it yourself.",

Have you tried testing your graphics card with FurMark?If the video card works without failure for about 30 minutes, then you need to look for a problem in the software.What power supply do you have?I'm testing the video card on another PC to avoid problems on your PC.",
