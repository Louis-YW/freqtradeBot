The hacker reviewed itself to Binance and Binance has to compensate him for that. But the hacker would be the one that stole the coins and caused the hack.

My personal experience: I have already encountered the vulnerability of a Bitcoin wallet - something about $ 600 was stolen from me with Jaxx.  At that time, I didn't know that he was a scam. After that, I began to closely study all the wallets on which I was going to store money. So: I recently installed Exodus, on the advice of a beautiful UI and reliability. But when I began to study it, I realized that the source code was CLOSED. But in Trust Wallet code it is open. It's not just like that, only a good wallet can trust itself with an open code for users. So I switched to the Trust Wallet.",

You can see the problem stems from lack of research right, and it is the fault of the users, is there anyone who doesn't secure their money in fiat, they either put it in the bank or in other places they consider secure, they also safeguard their sensitive banking information, thus for someone who wants to use Bitcoin, knowing fully when that it's also a currency (their own money for that matter), and can be stolen the very same way their fiat currency can, why won't that person do their due dilligence and do what's right. Nobody was born with Bitcoin knowledge, so i don't make excuses for people who want to use Bitcoin, but what to skip the part where they have to research about it.",
