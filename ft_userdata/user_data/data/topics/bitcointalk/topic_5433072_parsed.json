I think there was already a debate about this with Saylor on the BTC side. Schiff is just like an old dog like Buffet who don't adopt. But you could understand that because even central banks today are buying gold and preparing for the Gold standard due to the global shift. Distinguishing Peter Schiff's shilling of gold discussions, I think his views on what the markets are doing are actually better than Cubans. Especially his idea of what the FED is doing currently and so forth.Cuban is not a new celeb getting into crypto, he had been advocating not just BTC for a long time.",

To be honest I could belave the article until I saw the other link here saying the same thing about Mark Cuban: https://fortune.com/2022/12/24/mark-cuban-defends-bitcoin-crypto-slams-gold-investing/Even if they consider bitcoin a highly profitable investment still I think we cannot say other investment assets like gold and others assets are not good for investing because the investment plan for everyone depends on what they think and how they want to invest, gold is safe haven for long term investors and but bitcoin is giving more reward by having more risk.",

Digital assets are worth more now and can be converted much faster. He's smart and has a lot of money to play with, or have to play with, otherwise inflation will eat it up. So he is definitely toying with the idea that his bitcoin money will be worth more at some point. He could use it to buy a Dallas Mavericks player or pay a salary. Why not, there have already been a few players who wanted that.",

Bitcoin is portable, gold is not. Bitcoin can act as a currency, gold can too in theory but it is not practical to use gold as a currency. Bitcoin has limited supply. Gold has near infinite supply because of astro mining. Should I continue?Drop gold, buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is the new gold.",

That's what drives us all - potential profit. Also it is a very well known fact that bitcoin has more potential than gold because gold is meant for capital protection. Gold is usually not used for investments with high return expectation. While bitcoin is used for just that. So let's not compare them and let's not get influenced by rich investors like Mark.",

What sets Mark from other old world capitalist tycoons is how progressive he thinks when it comes to investments and the likes. You wouldn't catch him sitting in a dusty office twiddling his fingers about blue-chip stocks, he actively considers ventures that some of his peers may find absurd. At least that's how I see it. Anyways, this just goes to show how true that previous statement is, he knows there is potential in crypto right from the get-go and even if he didn't immediately jump in, he is not so arrogant as to dismiss crypto unlike other big investors.",

Mark Cuban considers more strength in bitcoin in comparison to Gold. Do you agree with him ? I am not so excited when I hear news of most celebrities buying bitcoin. They might have good intentions of buying it but sometimes they also give the sector very bad publicity. It is true that in some cases they also affect the bitcoin space positively, but some of them easily lose interest in their investment and publicly sell their coins which would give the press the opportunity of targeting and criticizing bitcoin. It would be better if they buy it without publicity and if they want to sell it they should also do that secretly. This year my expectation is that more multinational companies and at least three countries would adopt bitcoin as a means of payment and legal tender.",

So it is not like another celeb showing trust on and faith bitcoin, in my opinion.As for the gold vs bitcoin, this has been debated/discussed to death as well in this community and for sure there are no sure winning in the end.",

I agree, and I think this is because he, as a billionaire, knows that business is done when you buy cheap. Another thing that very rich people like him tend to have is a long-term view. He is not thinking, as a retail investor might, of buying now and selling at $25k to make a small profit. He's probably thinking about holding for a couple of cycles at least.",
