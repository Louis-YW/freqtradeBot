Enough money doesn't mean you dip your hands into your savings or emergency funds. Having enough money helps you bet without worrying, it saves you from unnecessary desperate calls which might impair your betting judgment.and it clearly says that we must have enough funding while using the strategy without compromising our budgets for bills and commodities, and emergency funds.Quote from: Oshosondy on May 28, 2023, 10:29:11 AMWhy should I record the data of a bet?

The quoted part of the article in my above reply tells the reason.  But for us that see gambling as entertainment wouldn't bother that much.  I think this kind of tip is for more serious players that see gambling as a way to generate money and keep them at the safe zone at least.Quote from: Oshosondy on May 28, 2023, 10:29:11 AMWhat I see useful are:Do bankroll managementLearn to accept lossesKnow when to quitI agree with you about these tips are useful to minimize losses.  the article is about having an \"edge\"  and at the same time limiting losses while engaging in gambling activity.  Just like what @swogerino stated, the advantage of trying the demo and keeping the data and studying it when is to know when the bonus scatter is triggered which is one of the important factors that may influence the fund we can allocate.  Information is a very powerful tool so I do not belittle the power of gathering data and statistics.Gambling results may be random but in some way, it has a range or pattern on when the bonus round will likely trigger.Quote from: Lucius on May 28, 2023, 10:41:37 AMShouldn't gambling be fun for the players, and on the other hand, profit for the owners? The majority who approach gambling (and by that I mean casino games) in such a way that they want to beat the house will not succeed regardless of the strategy. It should be, but there will always be a player that wanted to earn money from gambling activities, worst, there are players that wanted to try to beat the house which often resulted in the players' destruction.",

The majority who approach gambling (and by that I mean casino games) in such a way that they want to beat the house will not succeed regardless of the strategy. This is the right way but most of the gamblers especially on crypto casino is so greedy on profit due to the too much exposure on risk. Either on crypto volatility trding or gambling. Gambling should be done for fun but many of us use this as source of profit. Even I sometimes become greedy when I’m already soaked in the game even though my main purpose at start is just to have fun. Having an early loss of significant percentage of my bankroll always change my mood from calm to greedy even though I’m using only small amount of money as bank roll. I would say the actual mentality is very hard to manage rather than in theory no matter what strategy being use.Quote from: Lucius on May 28, 2023, 10:41:37 AMThe best strategy that anyone can practice is to think of gambling as fun and to set a limit that he can lose daily, weekly or monthly.

I think the only way to do this properly is to set a date on when I gamble since frequent gambling always change the goal of fun to profit. So far this long gap of not gambling helps me a lot to control my losses and gain consistent profit even in small amount.",

Being a house involves more risk because you are investing huge amount of money on bankroll, marketing and operating cost. Not all casino is successful on running their own casino especially now that the competition on gambling is very tough. Running a casino is riskier than you thought and I will choose gambling over casino management since that needs a lot of commitment while gambling is just for entertainment.

This is a strategy that works but people find it difficult to accept that they have a bad day which is turning them into losses and they keep playing especially addict because they want to chase back lost money. We have to understand that losses are part of gambling, the faster we understand it the greater time we have the opportunity for a come back.Quote from: lionheart78 on May 28, 2023, 10:09:56 AMKnow when to quit.Yes this is very important to gambling or any thing else that is not positive to us. This strategy safe us bigger losses if we abide to it. Many of us to follow this, like I know someone that will bet all he has in a gambling house because he is losing but at the end, he won't have any money left with him and start begging for help on money to go back help which is a result of greed to chase money lost.

And there is no practice mode. Though probably some might have to know the way the game should be played. Well those strategies are enough to be on the track but some are correct. Yes any gambler that can't learn how to accept losses then he might face problem in the casino hall or in the site because he might not satisfied with the loss and that might escalate to argument and before you know quarrel and there exchange of words and abuse has started.

This might be a good suggestion to follow for those who have problems with their gambling losses.  I also think that the given instruction is far from being a perfect gambling strategy to win a session but it is good enough to follow to keep us from losing too much money.  The last two (10 and 11) on the list are the key to keeping us from chasing losses and being addicted to gambling.  I believe gambling isn't a simple matter and it needs a lot of preparation and understanding to avoid bad consequences, not saying, it also requires a lot of self-discipline to keep us in check.So what do you think about the list of instructions stated by the article, are they good enough to keep a person to have an edge against the gambling platform?[1] https://ftnnews.com/other-news/44458-how-to-perfect-your-gambling-strategySome says there's no perfect strategy that may work on gambling since it matters all in luck or sometimes on skills but if we follow certain strategy we set just like what you show gambling became more entertaining to play. Although no strategy will work on long run but at least you became well discipline or practice to be it since you follow what you think that might help you.Anyways thanks for sharing it up since this thread is informative and worth to read.",
