Non of the above, because this is a giveaway contest of which you stand a chance to win or not win anything, as they never said its compulsory that if you take part you shall be rewarded, because from my observation, I guess the €5000 is expected to be share among only 5 lucky persons who will follow all the rules as stated above, and you never can tell you might be the lucky one to win (i.e €2500, €1500, €1000, €750 or €100). But I guess O.P is in a better position to explain more.",

There’s 2 1st place which the one should be 3rd place.I have inquiry too, If I deposit 300€ on first day then withdraw my balance after my gambling session. Does my deposit on the next day is still counted for another ticket?",

But I guess O.P is in a better position to explain more.That`s correct - you collect tickets for every €50 deposited and in the end, there will be a raffle.  As another user stated, there will be 10 prizes in total though, at least... wouldn`t be too much of a surprise if we even sent some additional prizes if we see some good action.  Quote from: dimonstration on June 01, 2023, 08:57:42 AMQuote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on May 31, 2023, 08:43:27 PMQuote from: Martingaleboy on May 31, 2023, 07:49:19 PMDoes this means i get paid after 1 month ?
