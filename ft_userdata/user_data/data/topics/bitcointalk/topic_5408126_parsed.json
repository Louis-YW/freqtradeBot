  "content": "Hi all,I did a test yesterday - I sent coins to a paper wallet I created using terra station, the transaction was sent successfully, but no money in the wallet when I restored the wallet it still shows 0 coins (I did manage to restore the wallet but no coins).Withdrawal Address : terra1ss33z7cje3pz72qz30u7ssvflmht3m9myf5qarDid I needed to put a memo ? I am not sending it to an exchange so I though I don't need to and I didn't know what MEMO to put.what are the reasons a transaction can be sent successfully but not received ? the address is and was correct (didn't sent it to the wrong place..) second question : why when restoring the wallet do I need the password ? It's so stupid that private key alone isn't enough..Thanks",

I am not sending it to an exchange so I though I don't need to and I didn't know what MEMO to put.No, you didn't have to put a memo since you are sending it to the address you control.Quote from: rupxisshit on July 30, 2022, 08:06:35 AMwhat are the reasons a transaction can be sent successfully but not received ? the address is and was correct (didn't sent it to the wrong place..) The address is indeed correct, but you sent it on the Terra Classic network.I haven't kept up again with Terra since its fiasco. AFAIK, they was conducting some airdrop not long ago, and i don't know if you need to do some migration or not. But I found a useful reference about it, take a look at Terra migration guides, there might be some information that you need.",

      "body": "It's probably because your Terra station wallet is set to mainnet by default. Try changing to the Classic network by clicking on the settings button and see if the coins appear in your wallet.Quote from: rupxisshit on July 30, 2022, 08:06:35 AMDid I needed to put a memo ? NoQuote from: rupxisshit on July 30, 2022, 08:06:35 AMsecond question : why when restoring the wallet do I need the password ? It's so stupid that private key alone isn't enough..ThanksThe password helps encrypt your wallet if someone accesses your device and tried to access your wallet. Private key won't help with that kind of security.",
