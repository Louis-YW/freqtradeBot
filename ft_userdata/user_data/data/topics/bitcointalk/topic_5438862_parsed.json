It will not be in their best interest to choose AI instead of humans who do better than AI. And the best way to find people who are better than AI is to go for those who are talented and passionate in the role they want to give to AI. But before the human talents can do better they have to be purified with fire like certain precious metals are purified in order to shine/sparkle.",

It's never the jobs we expect that get automated at first.Not that long ago everyone thought that \"creative\" jobs would be safe from automation, and looks like they were proven wrong.Similarly, there was a big talk a few years back about truck drivers getting replaced by self-driving trucks. Result - fewer people pursuing truck driving qualifications, a shortage of drivers, existing drivers getting paid much more than before, and self-driving trucks are still not here.But it's good to have an alternative skill set as a backup or just a plan B.",

So, you don't have to worry about losing a job because there will always be one, just never stop learning",

It doesn't know the difference between a right answer and a wrong answer. ChatGPT simply constructs text that appears to be written by a person.Eventually, jobs that are tedious, mundane, and require no thinking be replaced by AI, but the people in those jobs will not be replaced by the AI, they will use the AI as a tool.",
