  "content": "Greetings everyone!I no be medic practitioner but I bring to us about \"Health na Wealth\" discuss.Una know say e get how person go sick, u go forget about pleasures and riches with all that u treasures? but only for u to tink abt ur current state of health & hoping to get healthy fitted again na him go be ur ring tunes prior then.Now I want to talk to us about the possibilities of minimizing unhealthy exposures in different basis specifically on the vulnerables.Many of us go say sickness dey com as flu, by means of what we eats, or by environments.Bt I can tell us that this na sometin we fit fight and reduce the potentials if only we fit adhere to these preventive measures realizing what health is worth about.Phase 1: Ignorance to unhealth symptomsTo us the vulnerable, we know that hard time feelings of spending the least amount of our money on our healths when we have sick symptoms or even when we falls sick.Because we are hoping on miracle were the unhealthy state of time would just disappear by faith somedays or some times without realizing that a \"cure\" or \"escalating preventative\" measures supposing to demand just #1K may later requires #10K & above due to health ignorance where the symptoms was formally underrated.The necessity of healthy being is at an utmost 100% of everyone's concern both the rich and the poor.If u no fit afford the English medical side of healthcares as a vulnerable, then go for the native Herbal medication sector afterall our fathers lived by it before the English medication was introduced for all are aimed with the same goal to proffer healthiness.Phase 2: Preparation & consumption of foodies At times, we dey lost the prior of good living to lye on the shoulder of good-health. We know that scenero of purposely eating decayed/expired foods because it is not worth wasting it or no alternative to settle the urge to eat (hungry) even being aware that the substance is seemed poisoned that can be dangerous to eat or intaken. Again is improper hygienic meals buttressing on how we prepares our foods & the manners of eating. E.G... some person's doesn't properly washes their food items during cooking while some doesn't wash most at all probably considering economization of water or washing agents.I am triggered to say most vulnerable black minded people are fund of saying... \"After the dirty enter fire boil wella for pot the germs go die\".And those of us way dey get reach to something quick eatable like Apple, coconut etc without washing or washing of the hands b4 eating.All these are licensed to unhealthy exposures through digestion.Make we know differences b/w RICHNESS & HEALTHINESS bcos no be only when we eat rich foods we dey dey healthy but most especially on a prior of eating hygienic foods.Phase 3: Environment & selfcares (sanitations)The vulnerable are mostly found around themselves in the less government less concerned places living them environmental lawlessness and in most cases poor regions as maybe rated.Poverty has potential thrills of crushing effect which makes it hard to caution about cures and preventive measures about health being.The poor feels so worthless considering their environmental welfares and itself waste of resources over time, money & energy but fails to denote resultant of the unhealthy pollutions that is triggered by its unhealthy environments.E.G Tidiness of homes & drainages, selfcares and environmental sanitations.I have gone a long way to have a proper review on this research because as a vulnerable citizen, I have fallen victims to some crucial healthcare challenges and I have come to share this with the rest of us that we can fight, beat & minimize the risks of being exposed to unhealthiness which would also save us the resources of cures.Let me just remind us about a popular saying that prevention is better that cure",
