I have bought and hold osmosis before and I regret it. The APR was 21% but it is too volatile and reducing in value. It is around 10% APR now. Atom APR is around 18% and less volatile.",

It's always good to hold long term and Cosmos has good fundamentals. I wonder why asking altcoins when you are saying you're become too close to be a Bitcoin maxi.i started my journey in mid 2017 and burnt some of my money (participated in several icoS) , i lost some money due to not being actively researching and staying on top of the news , i didnt loose because of scams . for example i lost my zilliqa because they released main net and i didnt do swap timely , wax similar situation , some projects were eaten by competitors . lets say tezos was very appealing when released , but if we count in btc- lost profit , in us dollars - gained (if i kept money in btc - i would have 5x) etc i was buying more tokens and btc during this years and seen atom shooting from $8 to over $40 during last bull run . The reason i am asking : i have positions in this tokens (atom is my 2rd biggest bag after btc ) . i am thinking either convert everything to btc or keep it the way it is if those projects have hopes to perform well in the next bull run . usually if bitcoin does 3x - alts do 7-10x .",

If you can keep being patience waiting for those coins to go up and it's still worth to hold em. Keep in your mind to sell them all once bitcoin reaches another all-time high again, but none know when this will be going to happen. I remember that when thorchain got hacked. Keep in your mind that if some tokens like juno were not even worth to hold for long term. Thing may differ if you said that you are wanna gambling to the bullish trend after bitcoin halving. Juno's daily trade volume was so small. How can i call it as a good token when it doesn't have a lot of demand right now? It has even less than 100k daily trade volume. Keep your good altcoins till another bull will come. Holding BTC was good but if you were just a small shrimp and then you can't expect to farm a lot of money from your portfolio when bullish will come. Anyone is now only accumulating altcoin as preparation once the bullish come in the future. We are in a very long time bearish trend. BTC has been bearish for more than 500 days which was a new record.",

Even if they will \"follows the developments\" then it doesn't change anything. There are 1000s of projects that have promised to deliver the same (smart contract, staking, lending, governments etc, faster than eth). Only 1 of them will become the new Facebook. The rest will drop to 0 regardless of whether they deliver the product or not.",

Plus the platform has expanded its network to a lot of dapps. While for me the one that seems interesting is the injective protocol. They got some good listing and trading volume on exchange and the supply is mostly circulated and still got low marketcap compared to their competition.

Crypto newbie comes to bitcointalk and creates a thread \"what to buy to earn\", a crypto pro comes and advises him projects like atom because they are old and proven in battle, a veteran with 6 years of experience in crypto, who has been making a living from investing for 7 years, comes and replies \"don't buy anything, because 99% will fall to zero and even if you manage to hit that 1%, it will not bring profits adequate to the risk\"In 2019, there were also people like you who proposed investing in EOS, NEM, XLM, IOTA, NEO, ETC for the same reasons. They were all in top 20 CMC. Despite the fact that another 4 years have passed, and in 2019 we were at the bottom of the previous bear market, most of the mentioned projects are still in the red compared to the valuations from 2019 (all of them are in red in sats) and few people seem to remember them. It will be the same with bubbles like an atom (unless it is in the 1% of those that will not die immediately)https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20190210/Little advice. a high valuation is a negative parameter when analyzing whether to invest in something or not. As an investor, you are looking for something that has great value and a low price, not something that has a high price and you assume that it must therefore have a high value, so you buy it and hope that the project will change the world, because only then will it justify the current valuation, detached from reality.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5208144.msg53299809#msg53299809 - this is how i analize crypto projects before investment.",

But what is lacking here is the utility of atoms in its ecosystem. The only use case for atoms is that users can stake their atoms and earn some reward. I do like the Atom Project but have no intention to hold its token because of its lack of proper utility. Osmosis, injective protocol, band protocol, juno, and secret have a big userbase, but they have their own limitations, and there are similar but better technologies in the market. Thorchain is different from all of these. It is working on something unique that will give him traction in the market.",
