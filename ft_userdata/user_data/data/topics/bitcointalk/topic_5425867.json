It needs better policies and a strong education system before it can prosper fully. Crypto might be viewed how gold is viewed by that point too in the world - as a stable potentially boring investment that doesn't rise to much because it's what a lot of people try to accrue value against - of course it could also be like the gold v platinum with bitcoin and other coins where some do better than others like what happens in forex.",

Should there be some standards to it, it might start serving its original purpose with people stop treating it for an asset and have some direct fiat relativism other than the inverse situation we now experience.Fiat and Cryptos ought to operate a mutual relationship other than one getting to diminish the other.",

According to me, it is a wrong understanding. When the monetary system is strong automatically the economy will be at the best and this makes people look for alternate investment opportunities as people have good sum of money. This will divert investment towards bitcoin and the same could gradually increase the usage of bitcoin and adoption.",

Quite arguable because I believe these two products do run parallel to each other and believe Bitcoin has more to lose than the monetary system as btc is still fighting to mark its territory in the world of fiat. Quote from: alastantiger on December 05, 2022, 04:24:24 PMThat is as the monetary of fiat system of a country gets worse the adoption of Bitcoin increases. On paper, this is what is expected but in reality, this is far from what happens...FYI Fiat is considered to be far much more stable than cryptos and if the monetary system is failing users are more likely not to go the crypto way as it's considered a volatile asset.QuoteAs you may have guessed countries like El Salvador and the Central Africa Republic that adopted bitcoin as a legal tender already has a failing monetary or Fiat system that is irredeemable.leap of faith maybe Quote from: alastantiger on December 05, 2022, 04:24:24 PMFurthermore, in countries where even though bitcoin hasn't been adopted as a legal tender we see an increase in investment in Bitcoin by most of her citizens because in these countries their Fiat or monetary system is already failing or being devalued.

What do you think?Bitcoin investments can be caused by several reasons, one of which is people believing BTC is a get rich quick scheme because its on record  that people who got onto this boat early did cash in big after a couple of years of hodling and people are trying to get the same luck .",

      "body": "One big reason Bitcoin came into being was the financial crisis that gripped the USA back in 2007/2008 leading to the collapse of many big financial institutions due to many factors. People then realized that platforms which we assumed to be solid and well-managed were not what they are meant to be. Standing opposite to the usual monetary system, Bitcoin is then seen as a possible savior by the many and a kind of wealth protector into the future. Of course, right now, if one entered Bitcoin at its highest price value, it would be a different and maybe a sad story knowing that its value is just at $17K currently.",

The monetary system everywhere has already failed and it is getting worse every day. Simply because it is centralized and has no cap on the amount of money they keep printing. For example US with the biggest national debt is the biggest money printer in the world.But people only invest in bitcoin when they face inflation, which is the case in countries like El Salvador and \"Central Africa Republic\" that you mentioned. But if they face recession, they won't have any money to invest in bitcoin which is why we are seeing bitcoin price dropping since most of the world (namely US and EU) are facing both inflation and recession.So in short if the monetary system fail leads to inflation alone we'll see more bitcoin investment but if it leads to recession we see less.",

What do you think?I beg to disagree, I believe the relationship between Monetary system and Bitcoin should be commensalism wherein Bitcoin can benefit from  worsening financial system while not harming its entirety.  Bitcoin is not created to replace fiat currency nor compete with it.  Bitcoin is created as an alternative to fiat currency. For those who wanted frictionless transfers without third party finance system.Further more. Bitcoin is not the solution for poverty nor it serve as relief to people that has financial problem.  Bitcoin isn't created to save the world from poverty. It is created to have smooth financial transfer without boundaries, without trusting a financial institution to process the transaction and have irreversible cheaper inter-country transfers.",

It was because of the failure of the current fiat monetary system that Bitcoin was proposal by Satoshi to become the replacement of that corrupt system in the first place. Satoshi saw that if we're left in this centralized system that many people finance will be destroyed so he introduced Bitcoin which is why any economy that's dying get the major support of Bitcoin as it's the only savior for such scenarios.The dollars is becoming weaker daily as more and more is been printed by the central banks without realizing that they're inflating the supply which decreasing the value of a currency. Bitcoin has a fixed supply which makes it a perfect replacement of the fiat system.",
