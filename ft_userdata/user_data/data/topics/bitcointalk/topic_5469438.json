  "content": "Sup! As the topic says, where can I exchange my Skrill balance (USD) to BTC at the best rate? I know about all the P2P websites. But many of them got quite high precent on their offers, so I trying to ask here if anyone know a better way to make the exchange?Or if someone here want to trade their BTC for Skrill balance (USD)? Maybe it's not possible to find a better way then using the P2P deal's but never hurt to ask.  If anyone know anything or have any idea feel free to share them with me if you want. Thanks!",

I just checked Bestchange (https://www.bestchange.com/skrill-to-bitcoin.html) where I expected to get the best rates, but there are only 3 exchanges accepting skrill USD for bitcoin and for the best rate there, you have to buy Bitcoin at over 8% of the current market priceSeems too high for my liking",
