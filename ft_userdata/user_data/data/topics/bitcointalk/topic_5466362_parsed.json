Share yours? you have been mentioning correct things related to the airdrop. I remember my friend who has been working on sei testnet for almost a year but he got paid 3 dollars from what he has done for almost a year. It looks so stupid to see how people keep being delusional in getting rich quickly from airdrop. Many scumbags are using this opportunities to increase their engagement in x to get as many followers as possible. I have marked any task related to the zealy or something like this as a useless thing. Many of stupid scammers were increasing their followers through this bullshit platform. Since x implemented new ads mechanism and many scammers are trying to use the stupidity from airdrop participants to build their account to participate in the ads revenua sharing program.",

I'm just happy to see those people that have been sharing their wins with airdrops especially the last ones for this year which there have been tons of it in social platforms and even on the forum.Quote from: libert19 on September 11, 2023, 01:00:41 AM— Minting NFTs to qualify is waste.

Many scumbags are using this opportunities to increase their engagement in x to get as many followers as possible. I participated in the sei testnet as well. I have an officer role and only received 100 Sei(Around 20$). Also, they do not distribute all the airdrop allocation(Which is 300M). Most of the users do not receive any allocation. So all the sei Dapps are moved to other networks like BASE to handle the situation. Otherwise, their sei dapps will be rekt. These days most of the projects exit rug pulls.",

Share yours? Yep, the truth that many people do not like to accept and waste time, money, health,... I would like to add that developers are wasting their time with users in this market. So What would be reasonable here?Repeating everything the OP and what I mentioned, waste is wasting time, effort, and money on things we don't understand. The reverse story of the few projects that resonate in this space only brings happiness to a few, just think if we are willing to research those things in the hope of having a chance.  So if you don't want to waste money, go through those things first to see the mistakes later. If you're lucky, you can also receive some budget. And the work of finding opportunities in this market will really be promoted when they find its many traps. I quite like to say \"the beginning of success will be failures\".",

There is a bunch of dropped less valuable token and NFT here and there. and most of the other airdrop has the fake team or the token really useless.  From there I'm rarely touch airdrop again but Im still on couple of telegram airdrop group and in some cases see people had a JackPot from airdrop but for somehow I always missed the train and at end of the day I can only see people get Jackpot from airdrop.",

I'm sure what you are doing by the time they are coming out are more worth it. NFT and P2E games on the other hand are popular last time but again, many of them are just a flop.
