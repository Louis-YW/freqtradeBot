  "content": "Manny Pacquiao set for exhibition match vs Korean YouTuberWhat can you say about this fight by Mr. Paquiao? Do you think this will be a big news in the world of the boxing industry where this Korean Youtuber doesn't even have any boxing belt. There seems to be no strong impact on Paquiao's side, maybe on the Korean side because he is against a famous Boxer. Wherever you have a bet on who will win, surely most people know very well who will win. But if that exhibition is for Floyd Maywheather, maybe it would be more noisy news than this. What do you think of this updates recently?Do you think there's a huge gamblers will go for this exhibition fight?Referrence: https://sports.inquirer.net/469093/manny-pacquiao-set-for-exhibition-match-vs-korean-youtuber",

Perhaps the Korean Youtuber will let Manny win on this one and I bet the odds will also look that way if ever the bookies will register it. It's all entertainment and probably content for fame grab.

But can this be bigger than his usual fight? Not sure though, this is just an exhibition, and others might not be interested because his hardcore fans might not think that he will go this way, joining the exhibition fight just for money, but whatever. If he needs the money because he lost in his bid for the Presidency then so be it.",

That's what is puzzling because this youtuber don't even have a Million subscriber. If Pacman just talk to the Logans, he might be able to make a big show to the world for entertainment without even going inside the ring yet.Pacman has a ton of money, there were rumors he has tons of businesses running as well. To the man with everything, he doesn't need this fight. Whatever the deal with this Korean Youtuber its all up to them. Although I'm still going to speculate Pacman had lost tons of money during his failed Presidential run.",

If it's a money issue I still think there'd be better options or offers? Though if time was an issue then it might be a different idea altogether. Still gonna support him though.

There's probably a bunch of better options he could've chosen from, maybe even outside of boxing itself.",

We really don't know what's going on Manny mind right now, when we thought that he will not go on the same model of having exhibitions matches because he is a true warrior. And then we are all surprised that he has a fight win a Youtuber. So I guess everyone is for the money. Because this is an easy fight for them and then they will received a huge paycheck. Win-win for him. And there are fans that is really disappointment with Pacquiao.",

Therefore, it is natural that this exhibition fight will attract a lot of attention from all boxing fans, even despite its status (I doubt that we will see something interesting in a sporting sense).By the way, I would like to know how this YouTuber was able to achieve such a fight - he only has 645,000 subscribers, which is extremely small even for a country like Korea.",

Looks like Pacquiao loses a huge amount of money when he tries to run for president of the Philippines where he loses and probably he loses some fortune too. Man, when it comes to money, only a few people can resist such offers but right now, Pacquiao thinks he really needs to get some money back after he loses the presidential race, after all the guy is a businessman. Anyway, when it comes to mere entertainment, I really like to watch this fight since we already know what would be the outcome of this fight because money hasn't really slowed yet and he still has that powerful punches that can knock out his opponent for sure.",

I've heard that Pacquiao likes to gamble, most likely is addicted. Not 100% sure that this is our case here, but this is surely about money. But, he could have signed a contract with Logan brothers and his reward definitely would be higher. He could have agreed to have an exhibition fight with a real boxer and earn more. He could have fought someone with greater amount of subscribers. The only string that leads to DK YOO, is that he is connected with fighting. On the other hand, there are more popular blogger fighters on YouTube.",
