People will only require money from you but they do not care if you gain or lose and you may even lose after paying them.Learn trading from scratchKnow that newbie traders will surely lose, use the money lesser than the amount you can afford to lose to start trading.",

If you try to invest, DCA. If you are unsure what to do, learn util you're sure (just make sure you finish your learning well before next ATH).I think that you're pretty much fortunate. Crypto winter is imho one of the best times to get into Bitcoin. Whether you invest or not yet, the experience remains.",

In bull run the price is going up, majority of the coins are going to reach their all time high. But how can we earn more profit in bull run? Then the answer is that when the price is really down in the bear market, that is the time to buy because they are very cheap and just have the mental toughness to hold and wait for the next bull cycle.So if you are seeing this market for the first time, don't be discouraged, on the contrary, take this opportunity to accumulate.",

      "body": "That beat market is mostly a result of the collapse of overleveraged cryptocurrency-related companies, which causes investors to suffer significant financial losses. Consider the recent issues involving Voyager, Blockfi, Celcius, and 3AC, which stopped their deposit and withdrawal activities, causing billions of user funds to be locked up as a result of the market crash. Point is, having a non-custodial wallet that lets you grant full authority over your funds is a must rather than using vulnerable lending/exchange platforms as your main wallet to avoid such unprecedented financial repercussions.",

Observe and see how the pattern of dumps and pumps has always happened and that it's something natural. See how price dumps have always recovered and probably more. Now, look at how long it took for those scenarios and start honing and understanding how much your patience is in play here. After that, I'd honestly just let you think for it yourself. If you want to keep hodling but are doubting, just repeat the cycle of checking the charts and reminding yourself that you're hodling for the long term.",

Just like what happened when the last bear came. It went below $3k if my memory serves me correctly, you'll get mad just thinking about how far it went down but at the end of the day, you cannot do anything about it. Perhaps if you have some spare money or you sold at the peak, you can use that to just pile up more cryptocurrencies that are trusted and just wait for another pump to come.",

But you're not the only ones that are in loss here, as someone who has experienced bears. I've learned that those people that have understood the cycles are the ones who wins on this market. As said about halving, it will make the market go bullish again. It's not just a coincidence but this is the time for you to be more patient.",

Sometimes even though it takes a long time, it is clear that understanding can be obtained from the type of person who is diligent, deep in the investment world, or just trading.

This is were I failed to do last bear market, Getting myself down because of the bear market makes me lose the big opportunity that other people take. If you came from the recent bull market, It would be nice if you stored some stable coin or fiat to fuel your future crypto purchases. Buying on the dip would be a very good move especially if those reaches a massive support, Being ready of having a fund would make it easy for you to make a purchase.

The market is very volatile and if the newbie didn’t do his own research, there’s a high possibility for them to lose the money. Trading is not easy for every newbie, just take it easy and learn every steps so you can be good, be more patience as well. You can be more successful once you already know what to do during bear market.",

Always know that the crypto market do not stay up always, it will also stay low and create price decline. But the good thing about is, whatever the condition of the market, it has always its own opportunities to earn and become profitable so always act rightly.In times when the market is very bearish and you witness all the coins are in low prices, don't over react. That's part of the bearish market. The only challenge you have to overcome is to survive in this market condition and it will only be possible if you chose to stay calm and patient, and just keep on buying even when the market gets deeper.",

I can give you sunshine but crypto can give you thunderstorms as well. Before entering any market, you should learn to make a research first about the coin, about their roadmap, plans, strategies, use case and also better if you will learn different jargon related to trading, also prepare your emotional and mental health, trading can give you breakdown in your first few years.  I guess that explains all. Also, do not invest in crypto for quick profits because it takes first a lot of hardwork and wise moves in the market before you can be profitable. And only invest on the amount you can afford to lose, as the crypto market is not all about profiting, but you also have to endure a lot of losses before you can learn your own strategies, and having good strategies do not still guarantees that you'll be profitable already. The fact is, you have to learn in crypto the hard way.",

This bear market might take more time before it recovers so you still have time to study. Newbies should buy established coin first or the top projects so you can still have the assurance that it will rise again. I was once a newbie and made some mistakes before, I believe you have to learn from those mistakes in order for you to become more successful. Don’t feel any FOMO, just stay on your course and know when to buy and sell.",
