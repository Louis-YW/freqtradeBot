Most of the virus engines are describing it as a coin miner. This is after i extracted the file and scanned the excutable - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3a86fc63407326852759577b458fe05183665261c6f5fc4a8b4dab2a77ebd49a- Kaspersky - Not-a-virus:RiskTool.Win32.Miner.iag- AVG - FileRepMalware [Miner]- Avast - FileRepMalware [Miner]etcDefinition of FileRepMalware QuoteFileRepMalware is a detection that may or may not be malware. Even if it isnâ€™t, chances are that it has an overall low reputation. In other words, files tagged with FileRepMalware may either be a virus or a potentially unwanted program such as adwarehttps://sensorstechforum.com/remove-filerepmalware-virus-files/So it's hard to trust the wallet or the person who posted it because of their reputation.",

In general, you yourself can run in a virtual environmentAnd it's a lie, don't use that wallet or try to click on any link in it.I'll report it assuming you don't.",

You have made a great effort. I hope you will continue this way and not stop updating it continuously. What is interesting about your topic is that many fake links to GitHub contain Malware and Trojans, whether they are in programs, tools, extensions, etc., The matter is dangerous, as they publish these links in Bitcointalk to target and hack members here by creating ANN topics for them, and we must all cooperate in exposing them and reporting their topics and their phishing links, as the OP did towards Kraker wallet, which contains trojans and malicious codes. Thank you all, and I hope the community is safe.",
