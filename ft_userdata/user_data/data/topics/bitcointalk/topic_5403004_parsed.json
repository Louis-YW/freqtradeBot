  "content": "Hi guys,I like to share with you a question that I've in my mind since many days. I've read some thread here which talks about Bonus abusing and I've also partecipated in it.What do you think about matched betting and the difference with bonus abusing?As I've read, matched betting is something that many users do with success and made some earnings that in some cases are important.In my opinion bonus abusing is something that doesn't respect TOS while instead matched betting does it.And what is your opinion?",

      "body": "Imo matched betting leaves a lot of control with the bookmakers so it's fairly reasonable to do it whenever it becomes an option (they can change odds if it's done too much), it's also normally done involving multiple companies so it probably benefits some too (especially if some users are likely to gamble with their profits). I think a lot of places change odds based on demands too. Bonus abusing as in making multiple accounts with the same place is obviously much more problematic but it might be more on the site owner to actually prevent it - since it's probably expected it'll be attempted.",

Whereas in bonus abusing, you literally try and game the system in order to get something more than the stipulated amount of the bonus provided by the casino. Better to work your butt off and release huge capitals in order to gain small amounts, and that is through matched betting. Profits are somewhat sure but will surely take more time in order to realize profits.",

      "body": "Bonus Abusing well it's something that players do when they make multiple accounts and at the same time they use them to get deposit bonuses and stuff, at the end of the day multiple account is already banned in most places as well and therefore most of the sites have started deleting old accounts that are not touched for ages. Other than that there are people who are definitely doing multiple betting on the same sites and sometimes they bet at the same outcome 50-50 and end up making a lot of money as well, but then again this causes problems and they would ban your account for it. At the end you just have to read the sites rules and regulations and understand that every site is different.",

Match betting is when a punter place another bet but which is free at a bookmaker. Assuming he already placed team A to win, but he got a free bet, he then placed another bet with his free bet in opposing way so that he can at least have more chance to make profit than losing. If bonus abuse is against ToS of a gambling site, then also taking several accounts for match betting should be an abuse. But on the other hand, if only one account is used and betting on same match in opposing way is allowed, I do not think it is wrong.

Not a very familiar with such activity, it seem making things complicated already while analyzing the skill set of team members is hard enough.But I also don't think its wrong I have tried betting the same match the opposing way especially because there are lots of options to bet like methods of defeating an opponent in MMA. They seem to have allowed it. Have not tried the free bets however but betting $15 for the underdogs to win will give me back 50% of all the funds I've bet.",

But the gambling sites keeps increasing in customers and making more money. If this is not done properly, like in sport and gambling games, it is possible that someome can stake differently on the same match and lose the different stakes. I do not see this as an abuse, it can be used to have some more means to win by some gamblers but it is also kind of risky too, not 100% safe to win. I have not tried this before, but the betting site I wanted to try it in the past did not even support it.",

      "body": "This article[1] probably explains in detail the matched betting as bonus abuse. To summarize:Matched Betting is a kind of bonus abuse done in an organized manner.  It needs lots of work and research to look for a newly founded bookmaker and take advantage of its promotional bonuses.  It doesn't abuse through creation of multiple accounts that makes it not illegal but rather it exploits the difference in odds and promotions  between bookmakers and profits from it.QuoteFor those unfamiliar with the idea, matched betting is a technique where people take up free bookmaker signup offers and other bonuses to back one outcome of a sporting event, then place a lay bet at a betting exchange such as Betfair. Because the back bet was essentially free, they profit whatever the outcome.QuoteEven so, Michael Rasmussen, head of acquisition at Panbet (Marathonbet Group), describes matched betting today as organised bonus abuse. “The whole concept of matched betting is that there is zero risk and you just extract value from offers.

The betting is regarding the player who is doing everything possible within him to have a win or at worse get back the account of his total bet.
