But I don't know if it has been given any good attention or not, or maybe there has been no good reason for the admin to put it into consideration yet.",

May be while you are travelling or not in the mood of going PC. Adding and improving things with time will give new height to the forum?As far as I remember, I once proposed this. But members don't really need it. But maybe one day mobile applications become a necessity, who knows, this might become a reality. Keep providing good ideas for the forum, even though sometimes these ideas are criticized, because as far as I know, it's not easy to get ideas and it's very easy to insult other people's ideas.",

Adding and improving things with time will give new height to the forum?I like how the web browsing of this forum and I may not use the app, although if one is created I will first try it and see out it is. I do not think we need an app to be accessing this forum though. As you can see in the above posts, many people have even asked this forum before but nothing done. If you think there is a need for it, you can create the app yourself which would be a good project.",

Adding and improving things with time will give new height to the forum?Rather than the app what would be more better is if the new forum software gets deployed, that would be much appreciated then an android or iOS app, but we have been waiting for some years now so it’s safe to say that’s not going to show up anytime soon.And as for the app, I did raise a question… if a user volunteers to create an app and somehow gets it to work how are we going to be able to verify that the app does not have a backdoor? Because right now we are talking about exposing our login details to the app so if indeed it turns out to have some malicious code we will all have our account at risk here. Except an official app is create by admin I’m not going to use any surfing the forum in its current state is not bad.",

It just came in my mind that many new users  have been joined so lets start a discussion whether such feature is required or not.I respectfully agree with the thought that you can always use browser to access the forum. But if this is the only point then I think there was no need of having Quora application because we can also read quora on browser. Similarly, news website also should have not been developed their app and,we can also check our smartphone, we have many apps installed on phone while there are perfect website available to access that service may be news app, or a ticket booking app.In my opinion is \"Convenience\" is the thing. That is why almost every website with good user base have application for user convenience.  One of the member mentioned that we should work on website forum script. That is also one appreciable thought.",

I was just trying to encourage him for his efforts in trying to bring ideas to the forum. 100 activities with only 1 merit is definitely annoying. Hopefully he will be more enthusiastic and give more ideas on the forum.Quote from: Lucius on September 24, 2023, 10:53:05 AMHave you ever thought what would happen if there really was an official mobile app for the forum?

An innovation definitely has challenges and obstacles. But we won't know until it happens. I think security issues are an individual responsibility. We have been using applications for a long time and I think people already know how to recognize official applications and fake applications, I never underestimate people's abilities, sometimes fear needs to be ignored so that we have the courage to take steps.",

I agree.I think bitcoin talk is rich enough to hire a dev team to do that . If we are not updraging with time, someday CMC or CG will launch their own new forum that may affect bitcointalk.
