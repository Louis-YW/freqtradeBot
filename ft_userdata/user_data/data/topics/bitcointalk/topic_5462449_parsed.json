This technology is years away and if it finally comes then there will be an update to a more secure private key for everyone’s Bitcoin addresses.It won’t be a risk only to Bitcoin or crypto. Your bank and almost every other website uses the same encryption pretty much, so it won’t only be a crypto related issue.",

A lot of these nitty gritty details will become available in the future. Just not yet.- If Quatum computers start cracking the 256-bit, then it could potentially be able to cracking old, forgotten wallets.- There are plans in place for possible mitigation routes when quantum computing becomes a thing in the future. Forking the network like @BlackHatCoiner said might be a possible solution of if a post-quantum cryptography to mitigate it.Quatum computing for Bitcoin and crypto has not been empirically investigated and creates a research gap in that area.

Are the bitcoin wallets vulnerable to advanced quantum computers?If we see it technically then yes the quantum computers with 256 Q-bits would be able to crack the old Bitcoin wallets in seconds, but in current state of the quantum computers we don't need to worry about such things because it will take a lot of time to build those level of quantum computers and it would take even more time to make those computers available for general public. The possibility is there, but we are still very far away from maturing of such systems.Yes, if a wallets private key is cracked then the coins from old wallets can be recovered, but I don't think that something like that is going to take place in a decade or more. If any such technology matures in coming years then to combat such technologies the crypto graphers will find a way to implement quantum resistant cryptography methods to protect the whole blockchain and the wallets from such powerful computers.",

Until a concrete decision is made when the time comes, everything else is mainly a speculation / prediction.The possibility of a random person inventing Quatum computing with that kind of capabilities is still years away.",

That's now how it works. 1 super computer according to you can crack 4 bits of password instantly. I am sure it's difficulty level will keep on going up in quadratic, not linear.For example, if a number is 1, it goes 2. That's linear. If a number is 2, it goes to 4. That's quadratic. And for 4 to go to 256 will require more quadratic processing power which isn't possible.Instead of cracking private keys, they should just focus on mining. Much better and they will surely earn some Bit.",
