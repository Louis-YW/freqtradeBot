In the forum, you can advertise in bounty or signature campaigns, where you can pay either with Bitcoin or with your campaign codes (almost for free), or a mixed payment between Bitcoin and your campaign codes, which is the cheapest and most secure method.You can try to advertise on X and Reddit, and I see some ads on YouTube, but I do not know that. You can also pay influencers to advertise for you on those sites.",

At first, they might be hype and will invest because of how good at marketing your are. In the long run, the stability of the project and the legimaticy of it on how the developers are working on it still have the final say. Don't get blinded with how good marketing is for a project when you're not working hard on the actuality of the project. Going with the marketing, as mentioned you start from the forum and spread it through other social medias if you've got budget.",

Signature campaigns, banner ads, hire some influencers, make paid press releases on popular websites. How long does the service last and the skill of the advertising team is what plays a role, as there are things that bring long-term clients, such as Signature campaigns, banner ads, and things that bring direct followers, such as hire some influencers, especially on YouTube, as the video rarely gets continuous views after several months. .Therefore, without a clear plan and the skill of the advertising team in controlling the budget to maintain the impact for the longest period with the least amount of payments is what determines the success of the project.Quote from: rat03gopoh on September 20, 2023, 03:36:21 PMHonest reviews campaign, because first it will definitely attract filtered early adopters (they wouldn't bother testing the platform if they weren't interested).

These reviews are also necessary for those who visit the service for the first time and want to make sure that everything is working.",

There are many ways and alot of them have been mentioned above but I just have to add using influencers to hype your project on YouTube, TikTok and twitter. Alot of users still listen to those guys and will buy anything they talk about. Getting them to hype your project will give the project some publicity and if your project has something different to offer from the rest of the projects in the market, you'll get yourself some loyal investors and you can start building from there. I won't recommend bounty right now because they don't bring in investors anymore as they use to since most participants uses fake account that don't get any genuine engagement but just bots. Their comments on the social media profile of projects they advertise looks spam like and might likely chase away potential investors that visit the social platforms instead of attracting them. Signature won't be the best option either because the exposure is limited to the forum. If your project is a gambling, mixer focused project that's when you'll get a lot of interest from the forum but anything altcoins should be taken to platforms that you'll get more results for the expenses you're going to make. You can also try media platforms that specialized in crypto related news as they get alot of engagement from cryptocurrency users. Getting an ad slots on this platforms will introduce your project to alot of crypto users.",

If you don't have good knowledge about marketing, then hire someone who is professional at these things.Totally agree on this one on which it would really be that depending towards your budget because if you do have plans on hiring or getting and influencer but your budget doesnt fit out then of courseyou would really be finding for some alternative ways which cost cheaper but of course expect that exposure wont really be that much compared if its introduced into bigger audience.You can run some signature campaigns on this forum considering its a crypto based or related kind of business or site or service you do have then it would really be just that relevant that youshould really make out some marketing here on this forum itself on which crypto traffic is really that relevant.You could actually do it for free if we do speak about social media marketing but of course you are the ones who would really be doing such work and hassle.  Ads,banners and other are really those typical methods or type of advertisement or marketing.Come to mind that it is one of the crucial things needs to be considered specially when you do have a business, exposure is always been that recommended.",

But don't expect a better result in a short exposure, because running ads, a signature campaign or a review campaign might take months or years before it will effect.  So consistently having a long exposure to any campaign methods would be considered as an effective way.",

I mean they are not the same when it comes to niche. So if your project is about gaming, you also need to hire the influencer on the same field because their audience are also in to it. If the influencer has a lot of engagement, obviously the result is going to be much better. We only need to pay them a little better but we shouldn't worry since we are sure that we can recover our expenses later on.It's not a big deal if the video is sponsored by some company but as long as what the viewer/customer see is what they can also get. Other than promotions via influencers, the priority of the crypto companies must still be Bitcointalk because it is the number one site/forum when it comes to cryptocurrencies.",
