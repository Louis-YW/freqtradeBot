  "content": "I don't think Bitcoin investment can be measured with every other investment, in the sense that Bitcoin investment allows one to be in absolute control of every step they take towards buying and holding their coin. No third-party involvement, no dragging of cue position with anyone in any office, and in fact, there's no symptom of competition with anyone. In Bitcoin investment, your security is in your own hands.I happened to come across a few friends who were arguing among themselves about who could get the most out of Bitcoin for themselves, no matter what the cost. One said that he must accumulate up to 1 Bitcoin in a year, and the other said that if his fellow friend is able to accumulate one Bitcoin in a year, then he will make sure he accumulates two or three Bitcoin in that one year, the third person said he will accumulate more than 5 Bitcoin in a year, so as the fourth person. In their argument, they made Bitcoin investment look like a kind of competition where one person has to take first position (probably win a trophy ü•áüèÜ) against the other no matter what the situation.On hearing all the arguments, I just had to engage in a brief discussion with them by telling them not to be agitated with Bitcoin investment but rather that it should be something done at ease and in one's own best financial time.Really, it's not bad to have a big vision about the amount of Bitcoin one wants to accumulate. Someone can have the desire and vision to accumulate three bitcoins within a space of two or three years, but it shouldn't be something that they feel obliged to do due to the influence of other persons. Bitcoin investment should not be done in such a way that you have to let go of your own physical needs, shot down your business, or quit your job and invest your entire salary.Bitcoin accumulation should be done at ease, in a way that it doesn't have any phycological effect on the investor, or in a way that you are not always in a haste to sell your coins because of every arising need. While investing in Bitcoin, it's wise to keep some fiat for one's personal needs and budget.I actually educated them about Bitcoin investment and how they can go about their investment with ease, and they confirmed that I really did change their mindset from what they were thinking about. I really feel happy that I have passed on what I have learned from this forum (knowledge gained from the forum) to other Bitcoin investors.",

My main question is how they plan to get such large amount of Bitcoin quickly. Are they some kind of investors, experts, or miners? I don't think they are any of those. we should remember that Investing in Bitcoin takes time, study, practice, and planning.From the way they were bragging, it seems they don't really understand Bitcoin well. Owning a lot of Bitcoin isn't something to boast about or a trophy. Just having some and holding onto it makes you a Bitcoiner, and that's the good part. People really need to stop talking and start learning so they won't be left out.",

However, I emphasized that Bitcoin investment should be approached with a long-term vision and without feeling pressured by others' ambitions.It should be done at one's own financial pace, considering personal needs and budgets, without compromising one's well-being or financial stability.",

Accumulation of bitcoin is not child's play and for you to achieve a good amount of bitcoin, you must have patient and self discipline in accumulating. There is no competition on this,just the way life is not about competition. Having a strategy on how to go on with accumulating bitcoin is what matters and not bragging because it is easy said than done.

For some people, buying Bitcoins turns into a game of chance; in this case, it is only welcome. Having faith in Bitcoin is worthy of respect.

It is so easy to become an attractive victim for scammers this way. Your safety is in your hands, the less other people know, the more reliable your investment is. Secondly, I don't see any point in comparing my savings with someone else's. Each person has different living conditions, different salary, expenses, financial management and intentions regarding bitcoin. All of these factors are not taken into account when people simply compare the amount of bitcoin they own. But these numbers mean nothing just on their own.

When you improve your financial situation, do it within your means and don't compare yourself to others who are much better off than you, because if you want to get where they are you're probably going to try too fast and with too many risks, which will probably leave you worse off than when you started.

Bitcoin accumulation is not a competition, and you should not feel obligated to participate if you do not have enough money to spare, even if some of your friends are. Competition among friends to see who has more financial independence is enticing, but it should not come at the expense of one's comfort. Some people are unsure what to do with their money or how to diversify their savings if they are not persuaded to do so. If these friends are financially stable and decide to compete to see who can gather the most bitcoin, I think it's a good idea if they don't come back and touch it in the long run. Accumulation of bitcoin is beneficial, especially when using the DCA approach, and it becomes more fascinating if they consider it as a hobby to accumulate more bitcoin.",

This is true for all types of investment, not just Bitcoin. You are essentially saying to not invest more than someone can afford to lose. Without knowing someone's financial situation, it's not clear if chasing 1 or 2 or 5 BTC per year is a bad idea or not. Maybe they are making millions per year and can afford that? Also people who already have a lot of other investments can afford to put a lot of their income into BTC, unlike those who have very little or not investment at all.",

It could help them stay the course, keep faith in BTC in times of doubt, market downturn and FUD, don't you think? What's more, as long as they don't make themselves too poor doing it so, it won't do them any harm to own several BTC in the long term¬† We often see people treating the accumulation of BTC as a sprint, particularly on Reddit (r/Bitcoin). I don't really know why they have this feeling of urgency, maybe they're anxious to see BTC rise to $1 million without having had time to accumulate enough, or maybe it's the limited supply that's making them anxious and impatient?In any case, those who understand the long-term potential of BTC and the real philosophical interest of a form of P2P digital currency understand very well that there is no rush to accumulate it. From a long-term perspective, I don't see how they could miss the boat, even if they're currently DCAing small amounts since yesterday.",

Everybody will have to invest at his own pace based on his financial strength and plans. Such arguments or competition can become unhealthy which can lead to engagement in criminal activities just to beat competitors. It can even breed jealousy among these friends. Come to think of it, discussing your investment in public is risky because you can give criminals the information they need. Privacy and anonymity are important attributes of bitcoiners. There is no need to compete with investing in bitcoin because the market will always be open.
