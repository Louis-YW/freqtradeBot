It's not about the smart contracts of the tokens used in the DEX he's referring to.Quote from: saxydev on June 18, 2022, 07:24:59 AMI need help in identifying hot wallets of dex's who use trc20 or trx on their apps.

The hot wallet is not a problem usually, the main problem is to find cold wallets and I am not even trying to find that. Now, I'm playing with the api of tron scan and I was able to identify arround ~300 hot wallets worth arround 60 mil in trx + trc10/20 tokens.There are still better options to be able to identify, just need to figure them out.",
