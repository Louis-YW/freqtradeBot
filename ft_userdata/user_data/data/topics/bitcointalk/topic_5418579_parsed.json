  "content": "Do you think the value of Santos token will increase? Since Santos is constantly listed on reputable centralized exchanges such as Binance, Gate, MEXC… it is undeniably affirming its position in the community. But after all, Fan Token is just a lottery coin created for the purpose of attracting cash flow into the market. So perhaps Santos token just serves as a refreshment for this crypto winter. If you decide to participate in Fan Token investment, then start with small capital and accept that it is possible to lose. Remember to have a plan for your investments before entering. Good luck!!!  And don't forget to check out the full investigative article about Santos on Hackernoon:https://hackernoon.com/is-there-still-room-for-santos-to-grow",

World cup is coming, Projects like Santos Token and others should appreciate in value. I have seen cases when people thought the price of a token was too high at the price it was trading only for the price to keep surging because of the utility and demand of the project. Have you checked the previous ATH of santos? there is a high probability it will achieve it and even higher. The supply is just 30m which is another reason to boost the price. This is a fan-base coin and the price movement may or may not go alongside btc, but one thing to note is... if it can perform even in bear market then expect an even better performance in bull market.",

With its historical chart, the launching price was $16 and then its ATH was $20. The current price is $11 and that's not far from those heights that it has got.If it will maintain its good posture for its volume, I think that it'll raise its ranking from 350.",

You should also see there how the team is responding to those.That's my first pit-stop when choosing a coin, searching for general views of the community about that certain coin.",

This is for all projects out there which they do really have the chance on getting their prices go to the rooftop but of course, it would really be depending or varying on some factors which could really be putting themup on such condition which is DEMAND, RECOGNITION simply in the market.No matter how shitty it is, as long it would be hyped or been bought by people or investor then it would be having the chance.Come to mind that there are some good potential projects but ending up on having no support or having low value? Why? Because they do lack up into those factorsthat i had mentioned above. When you do believe that Santos token does have the potential then go ahead and invest.",

Binance and other top tier are just large marketing for these coins/tokens and we even see a lot of those delistings in the past that didn't end well, those aren't full-proof that they will succeed in the long term. I think it will just increase in value if they constantly provide more utility on the token and deliver what they ought to deliver on their roadmap.",

Im judging from the pump that happened during market. Santos got pumped so hard when bitcoin dumped so hard. There's no doubt if fan token used by the whales to create a pump. The value of santos will be determined by pumpers. It's caused by fan token doesn't have real utilities unlike another altcoins in the market. Santos was just a fan token that created as a way for fan to support the club. Im not even considering it as an investment. it's pretty much the same like meme token in the market.",

Now it's clear to me where this token coming from I thought it's something like a LUNAC again but what else could we think since most of these token are showing up because of the hype. Binance has this type of token in every occasion I came across with them and it seems we can't stop this type of token to be showing as a type of pump and dump token that's obviously be gone for good in no time. It just never stop since almost every day there's always a new hype coming after one another.",

World cup is coming, Projects like Santos Token and others should appreciate in value. Isn't it great if this token move on its own? That means it is possible for this coin to go up when bitcoin and the rest of the coins are dumping hard. If you are bored and eager to earn during a bear like this then we can also allocate small amounts on this coin.Only use the coin for doing short term trades and not for a long term investment because I believe that coins like this are only like a meme coin and they will collapse hard once the certain hype or event has passed. We must also be careful on investing in similar coins because I know that a lot of them are going to pop out, the closer we get to the world cup but most of them are only just a scam.",

Sure, there should be a chance for this token to increase its value but it depends on the popularity of the clubs and the use of the token itself in the future. However, I am not a person who likes to invest in fans tokens because I don't see a big use for that tokens. Mostly those tokens are only pump-dump tokens, and they rely on the news related to the improvement of the token usecase.",
