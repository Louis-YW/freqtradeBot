  "content": "Tom Lee's Fundstrat Global Advisors told CNBC that it is expecting another major Bitcoin sell-off to take place in the near future. The New York-based independent research boutique believes that this will be the final \"washout\" before more buying opportunities emerge.Fundstrat believes that the largest cryptocurrency could briefly drop below its June low.The Bitcoin price plunged to as low as $17,592 on June 18, which marked the cryptocurrency's lowest price point since December 2020. While this marked at least a short-term bottom, bulls only managed to pull off a modest recovery. Earlier today, the top cryptocurrency once again slipped below the pivotal $20,000 level.As reported by U.Today, FS Investments Chief Market Strategist Troy Gayesk recently predicted that risk assets such as Bitcoin might head much lower if the head gets serious about shrinking the balance sheet.Lee, a well-known permabull, has a history of terribly wrong price predictions. In December, he insisted that Bitcoin could still hit $200,000 in a CNBC interview despite missing his 2021 target.In April, Lee opined that Bitcoin was not \"speculative\" enough.

I would not give all this weight/importance ... from a speculative point of view HODL is really difficult and it may seem like a waste of resources, since you don't get interest and you lose a lot of small movements. But in the end it is the best strategy for those who want to see certain results, probably this is the real key for earning with bitcoin!",

Just read this sentence and stop reading afterwards. It's a crypto winter, of course that there will be multiple price drops and the possibility of the BTC price hitting 10K USD in the upcoming months in still there. Should we be worried? Nope.Just don't expect a price recovery until the next BTC halving and you will be fine. The big central banks will increase the interest rates, but this will be temporary, because somebody has to cover all those giant budget deficits in the western world. The money printing machine will always go brrrr... so crypto will face another  big bull run after 2 years. Fear dominating over greed is just temporary on the markets.The markets will get used to the war in Ukraine(which isn't going to end anytime soon).",

Funny to see how many perma-bulls are only just turning bearish now Bitcoin is at $20K  Yes, this is a sign that either we have reached the bottom or we will not fall much further down. In the same way that last year the predictions were increasingly bullish, now it looks like a game of who can give the worst prediction.This man, as he never stops making predictions, at some point he will get something right, but it won't be because of his predictive abilities, but rather by chance.

Tom cannot predict that because there are no technical indicators showing that someone will dump coins on the market or not. He's taking these predictions out of his ass and that's why they are never any good. Note that he used to give exact numbers like Bitcoin to 50k in 2018 and now he's back to generalizing about downside risk. Downside risk in a bear market... no shit Sherlock!Maybe I'll become an analyst at Fundstrat? I'll be telling them that bitcoin will go higher once we're above the 50 week MA and I'll warn about downside hen we go below it. I wonder how much an analyst makes these days",

My challenge is that sometimes these predictions by these Bitcoin \"prophets\" instill fear and skepticism in new investors making them to sell off there investments. I have decided to stop listing to these set of persons regardless of their credential, experience or past support for Bitcoin and focus on the outcome of the market per time.
