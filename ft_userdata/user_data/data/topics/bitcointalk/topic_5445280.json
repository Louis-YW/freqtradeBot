A bigger total network hashrate is, a stronger it is and a less probability of reorganization as well as attacks. Since 2009, the network hashrate has grown exponentially.Profitable days: it partially shows increases in adoption and demand on Bitcoin.

Just imagine, until now my bank has experienced a lot of disturbances, especially during peak hours, the mobile banking system cannot be accessed making it difficult for customers to send or withdraw their money. Just imagine for example banking has a system like that of Bitcoin, how good is that",
