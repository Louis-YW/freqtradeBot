The video highlights two very under-educated gentlemen. One of them has a box of ugly Chinese counterfeit physical cryptocurrency. Someone clearly needs to educate these two as to what a real physical bitcoin looks and feels like. I find this video to be a disgrace to our culture, almost like salt has been poured into my eyes. This \"Piece of content\" just shows you how early we are. I can't believe this video was from only 10 months ago, feels like something from the dark-ages. This is about their own self-interests:Â  Peddling horseshit to the unknowing for profit.",
