  "content": "Jermell Charlo vs Tim Tszyu, January 28, 2023, venue to be announce later.https://box.live/fights/tszyu-vs-harrison/We have a banger at the start of the year, as Tim Tszyu, the son of legendary Kostya will have his chance against pound for pound Jermell Charlo for the undisputed belt at 154 lbs.It is also interesting that fight also coincides with the 28th anniversary of Kostya Tszyu debut in the US against Jake Rodriguez in 1995 to win the IBF light welterweight title.We've also heard that both Crawford and Spence wants to move to 154 lbs, so possible that the winner might get either down the road.QuoteRegardless of the hardware at stake, all signs point to chaos if these two share the ring. Charlo (35-1-1, 19 KO) has been pure dynamite since suddenly discovering his power in a 2015 wipeout of Joachim Alcine, while Tszyu (21-0, 15 KO) is the sort of physically overwhelming pressure fighter that could provide the same sort of clash of styles that made Charlo’s fights with Brian Castano instant classics.https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/7/13/23207373/jermell-charlo-next-fight-vs-tim-tszyu-set-january-28-location-tba-boxing-news-2022[/s]",

      "body": "Yes, the fighting style of Tim is very similar to Castano. In the first fight it was a split decision with by Charlo and there are some pundits who says that he lost as the score is SD. So they immediately go at it in the rematch, round 24 but this this Charlo won by knockouthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpQcS2_bzZAAnd I think the Castano is a better boxer overall compare to Tszyu. So there could be some adjustment on the side of Charlo in the beginning, because of the pressure and overwhelming style of Tim, but eventually he will be caught by the power of Charlo late in the rounds. So my prediction is that Charlo winning here.",

He has better experience in fighting and is not coming straight from recovery from any injury like Tszyu. He has a title to defend and knows well that after Tszyu, some other fighters are equally waiting for the challenge, with his mind set on that, he will ensure to give the other fighters an opportunity with him and will be keen on winning against Tszyu. He has wanted to fight since, and he is finally getting what he wants.",

But Charlo is one scary dude, that power, the way he knocks out Castano in their second fight is brutal.",

And probably if that happens on the social media days, the Internet would have exploded like when Maidana beat Broner.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cilqqDXQRp4",

Meaning it could not be all brawl and could used his IQ to offset the power of Jermell and maybe put him in some awkward position just like in the first Castano fight. And that's why others say that Brian won because he put Charlo in one corner and then just try to bust him up. But in the second fight, Charlo has adjusted and fight in the middle that's why Brian head snap from that power of Charlo because Jermell chooses to fight different. But hopefully Tim will get a good account of his father's name and give Charlo a rugged and solid fight.",

He is so brandish as well, I guess it's because he can back it up. And although he has a close call against Brian Castano, he defeated him with a spectacular one punch knockout to leave his doubters behind.Now a new challenge for him, a tough Australian in Tim Tszyu. He shouldn't underestimate him because Tim is also a good boxer and has been really pushing hard in every fight that's why he is a challenger right now for the belt by Charlo.",

Although he doesn't risk any belt, but he will take a risk about his clean record.Based on the bookies, the odds for Tim Tszyu is 3.20 while Jermell Charlo odds is 1.32x, I think the moneyline odds is fine if you bet Tim Tszyu and the bookies also see a chance if Tim Tszyu can pull an upset against Charlo.",

Yes, this is a tough matchup for Charlo, style makes fight and this one is going to be intriguing because Tszyu will likely to be the aggressor and then Charlo trying to defend himself but will also go to score a knockout. At the same time, Tim's chin is tested, but we will see if the power of Jermell will be enough to at least stop him in his tracks. Otherwise, Tim will go and will come forward specially if he thinks he can take Charlo's power.",

Tim might be determined to take the belt and so he will fight on whatever capacity, or maybe fight it dirty and see how Charlo will react or adjust to him roughing and making Charlo not comfortable. That is the only way that Tim could win.

I saw his fight against Horn, we know the style of Horn, he always goes forward, so Tim takes advantage of that as he has the power and at the same time he is quicker than Horn. I know this is different, so let's see if he can continue his undefeated record.",
