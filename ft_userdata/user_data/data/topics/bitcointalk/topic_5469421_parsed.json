  "content": "Hello every1.I have a question. Recently, i bought a used InnoSilicon T2T 32T, buit on 11-06-2020. I am learning how to deal with this kind of machinery, since my previous mining exp were from shitcoin mining (ETC) from PC. I found there (into ASIC config) some fields to fill with Pool address and port. i tried to insert in these fields, my node info (http://127.0.0.1:8332) and could'nt connect. May the error be the ip address i used? i tried to use my desktop (LAN) ip adress instead 127.... and have no success doing this. So, i am mining in a solo pool (EDITED TO NOT PROMOTE ANY POOL). But i would be very happy to mine using directly my own node, on my own ASIC.Do you know some way to do it? I've read the ASIC documentation in search of this, and could'nt reach this info.Quite happy to write this, and i appologize if it was a repeated asking, but i didnt found answer from forum search.THX y'all BTW.",

      "body": "Having your own node and running your own local pool is the only way to mine solo without 3rd party.But it's a waste of time and power if you only have one unit to mine solo because you will never be able to solve a block or it takes decades before you can solve a block.Based on the pool where you mine solo I never heard of that pool before and according to Whois, it's 2 months old.Look:Code:Domain:public-pool.ioRegistrar:Cloudflare, IncRegistered On:2023-08-09Expires On:2024-08-09Updated On:2023-08-14What I see here is you are trying to promote this pool here.",

Going to also say that if you did follow one of the guides to setup a solo testnet pool like this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415335.0I could see someone thinking that it would work for an external stand alone ASIC. Then you google some things and public pool does come up.Either way, my original comment still stands, don't do it yourself.-Dave",

Anyway, i downt want to mine in a pool that chargeback fee for kings friend (As f2Pool did). So, my objective/goal is quite simple. I wanna do it for my lottomining.",
