The majority of bitcoin ATMs also don't request much data for verification some only request the mobile number and the selfies the machine took from their customers to explain why they are conducting the transaction. Many people who I believe make use of Bitcoin ATMs are those who are so afraid of exchange, as many people believe they need some sort of skill before they can successfully buy from an exchange and make a good withdrawal with issue. I said this due to the experience I have had with a relative away who struggled to send bitcoin over to me sometime ago, even with the direction I gave her, she still ended up not being able to do it herself, and anything that has to do with online and they don't see a physical shop, most people have trust issues with that.",

Once you use bitcoin in public, your privacy is also at risk, so using a bitcoin ATM or using bitcoin for payment will not guarantee our privacy. But people both want to ensure privacy and ensure that bitcoin will become a popular means of payment around the world. I really see the contradiction in our thoughts. Once we use KYC anywhere, the risk of information being stolen or sold is inevitable, even banks are selling our information.",

The very moment that you put you guard down and actually try out a bitcoin ATM, you subject yourself to risks of not only having your bitcoins stolen, but also getting your identity stolen at the same damn time. Since Coin Cloud's not operational anymore, who's gonna be responsible for the recompense that these 300k users will have to receive given the fact that their important info just got into the wrong hands. As someone who personally experienced a similar situation as these poor folks (I got my PC contracted with a malware who not only stole my wallet's contents, but also stole important files on my harddrive and even went so far as to use my PC as an ethereum miner), what I would highly suggest they do is immediately get to the police to file a formal complaint even if the details on how to get the perpetrators apprehended are a little cloudy at the moment. The thing is that the police and justice units must know about this first and deem this as a major threat to mobilize their units and have them get to the bottom of this whole situation. Plus it's not that hard to imagine these hackers being in the same state or perhaps country as the victims considering that they only attacked a singular brand of ATM, which means investigation could go smooth and safe for the users who just got their information leaked.While investigation is carrying on they need to secure their information by making sure that all their emails, if unable to be deleted, have their passwords changed and their 2FA activated. Their mobile numbers must also be changed, these are the most important things one should do soon as they find out they are exploited for the information they can provide.",

True, this could be done by someone with access to the database of the said ATM or bank, because as a developer in database management, I can say that the sample information is in database format, or it is usually the structure of a row of data in a database, and it is alarming because if someone really releases it or gives it to hackers, then hackers could take advantage of this information as the information is crucial and vital. This should be actioned by the bank owner, or else they will be charged with heavy cases, and for those customers, better change the password or information of your account that is in that ATM, or else there will be inconvenience and, at worst, hackers might get something from you. I hope not all information is being extracted from the database, or else it will be doom for those users.",
