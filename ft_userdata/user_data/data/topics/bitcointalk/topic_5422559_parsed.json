This time maybe we ought to change that too? I mean not saying that it would be better or worse, but it does look like it is going to end up with something that is hurting the market at this moment if we keep this up.So, it is better to move to Decentralized Exchanges for trading for example, or any other p2p method for fiat needs.

This is just a repeat of those incidents and again, another reminder not to hold any crypto for long term in exchanges. The report of big profit with Trezor is a good indication that many already learn their lesson, just choose the best hard wallet and decentralized exchange, you can be more secured there.",

Don't mention about passwords. That's not even complicated. But even if it is indeed complicated to some, we all do that. It is not something that is unique or an additional exclusive feature by hardware wallets. Even centralized exchanges have passwords. In reality, centralized exchanges are way more complicated than hardware wallets. You need to fill out forms to open an account, verify the email, submit KYC information including pictures and videos, monitor daily for updates about the status of the exchange, regularly check your funds, review activities for possible suspicious ones, etc. With a hardware wallet, you only need to set it up and then send your funds. You can forget about it right after.",

This doesn't necessarily mean you wouldn't use them anymore for their intended purpose, as an exchange, but rather use them only for that specific one and not anything more. Ofc using decentralized options would naturally be better. Quote from: Fundamentals Of on November 23, 2022, 02:32:55 AMWith a hardware wallet, you only need to set it up and then send your funds. You can forget about it right after. It's not the complicatedness but rather the \"setting it up\" process I guess? Not that I'm saying it's hard, anyone can study up on it and learn it really, but some people just choose convenience over anything else I suppose. The process in Centralized exchanges is something done in general for most account creation purposes so most people are used to it hence using it for exchanges doesn't really seem that complicated anymore. In general, I'm just saying people are just THAT lazy, either in setting it up even if they knew how or in learning how to set it up. Especially if you consider how most people wouldn't really move till they get hit themselves.",
