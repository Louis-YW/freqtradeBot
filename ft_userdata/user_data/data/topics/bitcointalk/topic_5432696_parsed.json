      "body": "The time stamp is constrained by the rules of bitcoin.You say you aren't mining full nonce ranges, well an asic miner internally, in the asic hardware, mines full nonce ranges.So it is useless to test incorrect theories about independent headers.An ASIC miner is a 7000kg backhoe.Do you eat your food with a backhoe?No, you use a teaspoon.So while your incorrect theory will not work anyway, you are using the wrong tool.Go visit the scamcoins and ask them about CPU mining.",

      "body": "I don't understand the reason of this piqued reply.ASICs allow limiting the nonce (some even the timestamp) ranges: I've checked the datasheets.Me and my colleagues think we've identified a way to optimize BTC mining. To prove the theory we need an hashing platform pore powerful then CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs (which we're already using), and the ability to control these 2 parameters.GekkoScience's Compact F would be a first step, but we need to understand how to bend the control to our needs.Now, if you know how we could achieve this result, I would be grateful if you could answer the question: this would be a better starting point than cgminer's `main` function.FYI: it's not an hobby project.",
