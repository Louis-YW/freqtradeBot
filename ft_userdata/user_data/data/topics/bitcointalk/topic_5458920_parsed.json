      "body": "I haven't read your other thread about Stake being... a family run scam business, and as I am not a tech geekie, I have to resort to a quick search at the internet about motion sensor, some explains that it's implemented on tablets and phones to help determine the screen orientation through gyrometer etc., help enhancing gaming experience by translating touches and gestures into action [temple run, anyone?], fitness app tracking, but one that explains quite nicely about brave in desktop, that blocking motion sensor from a website that doesn't need a motion sensor by logical reason [pizza hut for that case, stake for this case] is this snippet, that hopefully could help provide readers some insight:Quote from: https://www.theinternetpatrol.com/about-motion-sensors-and-motion-sensor-blocking-in-brave-and-chrome-browsers/[...]As it turns out, one person has dug down to the very bottom of this mystery; that person is Grant Winny, a developer from Ohio. Grant followed the code trail after noticing the motion sensor alert on several sites, including the same site we visited, Pizza Hut:It turns out that this is a function that Akamai is behind. Akamai is a massive online content and content delivery system. Grant Winny concluded that this is a script developed by Akamai to determine whether a visitor to a website (i.e. the visitor’s web browser) is a bot, saying that it is “using sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not.” (You can read his very in-depth analysis of the whats, wheres, and whys here.) [...]I didn't read to the bottom of the page, but I think we have our answer why stake asked for it: to detect if you're bot or human.",

Please elaborate more so people can get a better grasp of your proposal.Meanwhile, not a tech geekie that I am, I need to resort to other intelligence, so I approached the closest available to me right now, namely AI, below is a generated response from ChatGPT:Quote from: ChatGPTIt is highly unlikely that a gambling site would use motion sensors to specifically cheat or manipulate the outcomes of your bets. Reputable and licensed gambling sites are subject to regulatory oversight and audits to ensure fairness and prevent fraudulent practices.Motion sensors are not typically used as a means to influence gambling outcomes. Their primary purpose is for interactive experiences, gaming, or motion-based controls. The use of motion sensors in a gambling context would likely be unrelated to the fairness of the games or the outcomes of bets.However, it's important to exercise caution and choose reputable gambling sites that are licensed and regulated by recognized authorities. Independent testing and auditing organizations ensure the fairness and integrity of the games provided by these sites.If you have concerns about a specific gambling site, it is advisable to do thorough research, read reviews, and check for licensing and regulation information. This will help you make an informed decision and choose a trustworthy platform for your gambling activities.Overall, while it is essential to be vigilant and choose reliable gambling platforms, it is highly unlikely that motion sensors would be used as a means to cheat or manipulate the outcomes of your bets. Given Stake is licensed and regulated, I think it's safe to assume they passed all the audit conducted on the safety and cheat-free of their platform. I mean, the word even written by yourself on your opening post, though turned around, they're provably fair. I think they'll more than welcome you and anyone to test this, the full guide and explanation is here.Quote from: tabas on July 08, 2023, 07:37:46 AMYou have made other threads accusing that they're a scam.

Creating different for the same casino or website can not solve the problem but your evidences from the different period of scams and post it in one thread so users here will look into the case and judge it and not for the to spam the board with different threads with the same purpose.Skate accusation is a new thing I am seeing here. Skate has been in the forum for very long time and the site is running smoothly before so this accusations that are coming up are worrisome.",

      "body": "in addition to creating many threads accusing them without proof, you also don't follow the rules when you create a scam accusation, do this:Scam Report Format (Use it to make scam reports properly)you need to follow the proper format so that we can better understand what your problem is, what you missed at the casino and what you want the casino to do for you to be satisfied, now a serious mistake you are making is exposing personal matters like keep accusing the relatives of the supposed owners of the casino, see that I say supposed owners because I don't know who they are, on the day they want to show their identity and talk about their personal matters, they will talk, but this is not the case, and you shouldn't be talking about people's fathersyour problem is with the casino, so expose your problem appropriately and with that we will understand what you want, and of course you must not forget to post proof, without proof hardly anyone will believe in something you are saying and be careful with that of creating many threads talking about the same thing. good luck in solving your problem",

What I read from the website you provided is that Edward Craven is a founder of the streaming platform and explores more of his life story. Not from the alleged fraud, maybe in your 2nd link. I haven't checked further. I myself, although I have never used gambling sites like stake.com etc., but I have turned off the motion sensor on my device's browser. Indeed, there is no guarantee that the security and abuse controls on the browser are permanent, at least I have made small efforts to minimize the possibility.",
