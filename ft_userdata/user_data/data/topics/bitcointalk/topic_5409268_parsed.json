  "content": "We need to keep our eyes open regarding all the ways government might be giving us money.An example - besides the one, below - is the invoice. If you are losing money to some government program that is taking away your rights, write to the appropriate government people, man-to-man, for them to change whatever. If they won't change, invoice them to the tune of the $amount you have lost, and the $amount of trauma that they have put you through - perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars... your choice. When they don't pay the invoice (which stipulates interest on the unpaid balance) sue in court for the invoice to be paid.Houston officials ban “ghost guns” from anti-Second Amendment buyback event after man discovers infinite money glitchQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-08-houston-bans-ghost-guns-buyback-money-glitch.html#A Texas man played Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner for the fool that he is by bringing a cache of homemade, 3D-printed firearms to a recent gun buyback event.Turner’s goal is to remove as many guns from Houston as possible, though no stipulation was made as to the types of guns people could bring in for compensation. Consequently, Turner’s goons were forced to pay out $3,100 to the man for his 62 “ghost guns.”Since the homemade firearms only cost $3 each to make, the man, who chose to remain anonymous, netted $47 in profit per weapon. And he would have continued on with his “infinite money glitch” at future events had Turner not changed the rules.“You’ll always have people who will try and [sic] take advantage of the programs,” Turner whined following the incident. “I was there when that person brought in those guns. The reason we went ahead and did that was we had not said we weren’t going to.”The money did not come from Turner’s own pocket, of course. It came from a $1 million pool of taxpayer dollars that Turner decided would be best spent trying to fight against the Second Amendment. (Related: Remember when Robert Scott Bell announced a “vaccine buyback” program on his radio show?)“The goal was not personal profit, but to send [Houston leaders] a message about spending $1 million tax dollars on something that has no evidence of any effect on crime,” the anonymous man stated.He added that he also wants city officials who wish to do this kind of thing to at least pay a fair amount for people’s guns, “use private donations rather than tax dollars, and don’t destroy historic guns.”If anyone can 3D-print his own firearms, then what are gun buyback programs even accomplishing?Future firearms buyback events, Turner said, will “exclude” 3D-printed guns,” as the program is “designed for people who want to voluntarily relinquish their guns.”...",

      "body": "Gun buyback events are utterly useless and emblematic of the larger dichotomy that the gun control absolutists face. That is -- who are the folks that show up to these gun buyback events? Are criminals incentivized to sell their firearms to authorities or would they rather keep their unmarked/unregistered firearms to themselves for criminal activity? Are the types of law abiding citizens to comply with gun buyback events also the types of folks that you need to worry about committing abhorrent violent crime?",

      "body": "^^^ I see gun buy-backs as a way for government to keep the peace. Even if nobody sells a gun back to government, it makes the chicken-s**t Americans who are against guns think that government is doing something. And it keeps them peaceful so that government people don't have to go against their oath of office by promoting anti-2nd Amendment laws.",
