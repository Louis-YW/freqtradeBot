From my own understanding, their job is to investigate and prosecute people who are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and war but they appear to be doing in the situation of Ukraine and Russia.Quote from: Ripe_berry on July 18, 2022, 12:37:12 PMDid the president make the right decision? Of course, he did make the right decision and his questioning and suspension could bring an effective result.",

The government must follow these lay down laws to avoid the illegality of their actions. Maybe the government have done proper probe or investigation of the matter at hand and it was discovered that the allegations are valid. If the accusations are true and the punishment is removal from office, then the President did the right thing. Don't forget that Volodymyrs Zelensky is the President and Commander-in-Chief who has sworn to uphold the constitution of Ukraine.",

Including the SBU, the GUR, the presidential administration, and many others.But since the populist Zelensky came to power, control and the search for \"canned food\" (as the \"integrated\" representatives of the Russian Federation in power and other state structures are called for a long time) has been reduced to zero. Moreover, due to his populism and idiocy in the formation of the team, the Kremlin \"canned food\" received almost unlimited access to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, including the president's inner circle. Before that, many pro-Ukrainian heads of law enforcement agencies were fired under various pretexts, because they were real experts and set one of the goals of identifying such \"canned food\" and destroying them. BUT! We have what we have ... In order not to be unfounded: In Ukraine in 2021, having information about the plans for the next stage of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the area where, from the temporarily occupied Crimea, the border areas with Crimea were mined in order to prevent large connections from quickly and without loss to penetrate the territory of Ukraine. But, it was the presidential administration, and it was precisely those people who are already openly spoken of as Russian agents, who initiated and quickly pushed through the project to ... DEMINING this particular area! And this was done literally a month or two before the start of a new invasion. That is why large areas in southern Ukraine were so quickly occupied by Russian terrorists. Corruption, betrayal are the most terrible crimes against the state and the people of the country.",

I think you don't have to be military expert to expect that Russia will attack from Crimea. It was much more difficult to expect that they will attack from Belarus.Quote from: af_newbie on July 22, 2022, 12:03:15 AMI think it is safe to say that the special operation to eliminate any anti-Ukrainian elements in Ukraine has started.Ukraine should have done this in 1991 as the Baltic countries did.Actually, Baltic states haven't done enough to clean up from pro-Russian elements. Former communists were allowed and still allowed to be ellected and work in public sector. So, from communist they have turned into patriots. Most of them don't have pro-Russian views or at least don't show it, but in general they are harmful for country.Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on July 24, 2022, 08:11:27 PMI would not be surprised if Ukraine similarly has spies in Russia.
