  "content": "Self-moderated: Obsessive Conduct by \"BenCodie\" Over A Neutral Tag by JollyGoodQuote from: BenCodie on September 10, 2023, 08:53:11 AMHi JollyI actually made an effort to make sure that I didn't directly relate to our drama, so that I could still explore my curiosity without causing further drama. I asked @LoyceV prior to this thread being made about some feedback. He gave me some, I took it into account and I had then told him I'll make adjustments in due time. For now I am too busy.One of my adjustments is the feedback I left you with better referencing but instead a neutral feedback.I will let the community talk on this thread and have their say on the matters, I on the other hand, have already moved on and have no more energy to defend myself from your attacks, or engage in anymore worthless discussion.I will only refer to this as it is a major accusation:Quote from: JollyGood on September 08, 2023, 07:24:09 AMNow, after a deeper look the feedback history of BenCodie it seems he has been selling stolen accounts in the past. Granted it goes back to 2016 but he also has accusations of scamming.For those who might not have seen it, it is an apt time to mention I created a thread in June 2023 that is worthy of a read because of the very many good ideas put forward by members of the community during the discussion: Tagging Accounts Sellers And Tagging Traded/Sold/Bought AccountsJust an important detail that was missed (standard from you Jolly) these were for cheap torrent accounts and for the most part everyone was satisfied with the service, even hilariousandco bought from me with no problems. I helped everyone who used the service, some of those ratings are trolls or competitors I believe. As you can see there is no reference.Another thing, torrent account selling was fine in the era I did it. In case your or anyone else is confused, it had nothing to do with bitcointalk forum accounts as it seems you are suggesting.You've been ignored for now Jolly. If any member PM'S me as there is something I should urgently respond to here, I will come here and do so if I see fit after reviewing the posts.",

You are either being naive or you are a part of the scam and this is a unique way to get people to PM you asking for the URL of the scam scheme you're talking about.1% per day is not feasible to run forever. Neither is 0.5%. Or even 0.25%. Even if it seems realistic, the money must be generated from somewhere that involves risk, and anything that involves risk does not last forever. As for the statistics, everything can be faked. It means nothing. Do not ask for the URL of this website from the OP, it is a scam.",
