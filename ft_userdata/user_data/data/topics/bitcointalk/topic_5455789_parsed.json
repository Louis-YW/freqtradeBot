  "content": "Good afternoon, forum members. Now I'm working on my own token, presale, earlier in 2022 I've launched several projects, after the events of TerraLuna, FTX the launch of new tokens became irrelevant, now in the season of altcoins and memcoin boom the launch of new tokens is relevant again)).Test launched a week ago to test, everything still works. Looking for an investor partner to launch. The amount of investment needed is $7500. Implementation period of 1 week. Payback x3-x5 of the investment. All the technical part I undertake, for the project found ambassadors, bloggers to promote, marketing channels, site placement are all found. I know how everything is arranged) as a guarantee for the investor before the sale will give a pledge in tokens in advance. The project is not a scam, hanypot, etc. Â There will be a full audit, verification of the project, prepared documentation.If interested, send a message in pm or in Telegram.",
