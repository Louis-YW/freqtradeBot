Take for example a bettor wins a lottery ticket if he doesn't have any knowledge of investment or how to make good use of the money to improve his business instead he wants to keep buying ticket hoping to win more he'll only end up with nothing.",

Then, it shouldn't be pursued with gambling. I know that there are rare and lucky people that have made their wealth through gambling but, this isn't the case at most times.But I do agree that if someone who has a rich and positive mindset and will pair it with hard work and then will upgrade to working smartly, we will see the results positively and even better if it's not with gambling.",

Because you are unused to that kind of riches, now the amount you have won from gambling, in excitement you can begin to spend the money even without settling down to plan for it. It is usually after a huge amount has been spent, that is when the person begins to want to plan for what is remaining and then discovers that it is not enough again. Gambling will have to continue so maybe he can win some more.",

In gambling, huge money comes not in long term, it income at once and this makes some gamblers to spend the money anyhow they want and to use it to gamble more, they stake more. If they are wise, they will look for any other means which is not that risky to make money from.",

      "body": "There is a way that you could save money from gambling earning that it will be easy and you can control your emotions on it if you make it mandatory and a decision. That method is to withdraw your winning from the casino account out to another account that you own or your wallet. I'm sure this is a good strategy because if you leave the whole of the winnings there and you keep seeing it anytime you login, your inching fingers will keep tempting to keep playing after you have lost some so long you still have balance there. The way this works is if you withdraw some, you can see the remaining balance as the only money you have to bet and you will be prudent with it. Being prudent with it means you will play carefully, reasonably with reasonable amount that you can bear the lose just like you are gambling afresh in the beginning. If you withdraw some and leave some there is tendency that you might have a break for sometime either because you don't want to stress yourself to login into your personal account, activate your password, get email codes or phone codes and all other necessary requirements to access your wallet funds before transferring to your casino wallet. In fact, all the necessary delays could make you change your mind and have a break for sometime until your zeal, addiction etc have cooled down and by then you would have saved that part of winning that you sent out from your casino wallet.",

I never even think about it, I just enjoyed the money being with the kids, letting them play on a paid playground, and then eating dinner outside. It's fun and even if I am left with just a little amount then I will just try to increase it again by gambling slowly. I think a rich mindset also has a number in his plan on where he would withdraw but those who are too greedy, I don't think they have a number as long as they think they can make more. It's not healthy and those are the type of people who are prone to gambling addiction.",

Cause I mean, lottery winners being successful with whatever stuff they did after winning isn't really reported by news outlets, however, people who fucked up big time after winning the lottery, now that's headline-worthy. Though I guess I also assume that the majority of people who win the lottery majorly fuck it up most of the time. I'd say it's not the same with gambling though, it's just that a LOT of people like taking risks, hoping for more. It's why casinos are profitable in the first place. It's a whole nother thing if I were to describe it. Plus, even a rich person would not be able to increase the odds of their diceroll no matter how \"rich\" their mindset is.",

It is very easy to transfer money from your wallet to a gambling site account. The confirmation time will even be faster if you use altcoins.If you use an exchange and it has been long that you login, those kind of codes can be asked. But if active on the exchange, you may only be required for authentication code. Some people even have some addresses that they have whitelisted on an exchange which needs no authentication or password.Discipline is very important for people that are gambling. Some people will withdraw money from a casino site and leave some. If they lose the one they have on the casino site, they will deposit the money they have withdrawn. If they lose it, they will deposit more money and continue to lose. That is just gambling unless you discipline yourself not to have a bad gambling habit.",
