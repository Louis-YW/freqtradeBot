You can have investment plan, example is to divide your investment capital into 4, invest one after the other as the price continue to decrease.",

We don't know what will happen next. It could be the reversal up to the moon or we'll still have a lower low that made us believed that we're already out of it.",

But we are funny to be honest.When price is at the peak ($60k and above) everyone was thinking they are going to miss out and jumped in to buy. They were regretting why did not they buy when price was cheap. They do not want to miss it. But now when the price has declined 60% and more, they fear what if it disappears or some are still waiting for the price to decline more. Most of the investors have no clue to have a plan.Have a buying plan, accumulate as much as possible. DCA helps. Market has given you a chance again. Take it or leave it.",

They still need some sort of miracle to convince them. Some wait for lower prices and when the prices start rising they cry that they've missed the train and now is too expensive (no matter when that now is), some others are disappointed and sell now at a loss, claiming Bitcoin to be Ponzi and so on, and near the next ATH they may FOMO buy again.As said, human psychology is very strange / counterintuitive. And also as said, whoever wants to buy, DCA is the easiest and best way to do it.",

Let's assume 17,500$ is already the bottom, Traders can still buy at 23K, 24K and 25K to wait for confirmation of the uptrend and they both experience gain. The only onl difference was there gain is slightly lower to the gains of the people who bought at the bottom but stil it is same gain while they avoid gambling since they might face losses if the price dip way below 17.5K level.This simple analysis is always being missed out by newbie that typically always want to purchased at bottom which is very hard that’s most new always buying too early and suffer loses when the downtrend continues.",

Maybe we will find it difficult to buy at the lowest price, but as long as we can buy at a low price, I think that's okay.",

If you have the money there is nothing wrong with buying bitcoin right now and taking advantage of the opportunity that has presented itself, so while what you are saying is right it is likely we are never going to convince people like those to take advantage of the opportunities right in front of them.",
