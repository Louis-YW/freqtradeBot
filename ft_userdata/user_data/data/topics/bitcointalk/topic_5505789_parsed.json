  "content": "Hello everyone, sorry in advance if my English writing is bad.First I would like to say that I have found something odd in the process (ecc) to learn more about all the things between PRIVATE & PUBLIC KEY thoroughly.Ok let's get to the point.Here I have the compressed public key from puzzle #130Code:03633cbe3ec02b9401c5effa144c5b4d22f87940259634858fc7e59b1c09937852Then I tried to get the public key of Uncompress and this.Code:633cbe3ec02b9401c5effa144c5b4d22f87940259634858fc7e59b1c09937852b078a17cc1558a9a4fa0b406f194c9a2b71d9a61424b533ceefe27408b3191e3Ok guys be patient, this is where the magic appearsCode:633cbe3ec02b9401c5effa144c5b4d22f87940259634858fc7e59b1c09937852b078a17cc1558a9a4fa0b406f194c9a2b71d9a61424b533ceefe27408b3191e3Code:c6f333070697de335a9541d5a0e2df16202110569bf5ffd6385e424f29e8b7a96d3d9fe2d9bc5029e0f18bc29f2d64a8772624b9b2047b9aeec7b225681a1437Code:b89927eaedf2aad53f3e1ba7ed858b43b4d98160f980a8ada02d596d3ef78ec945c309f1de8c905d0c05821b075ccf4ba0dee885e667b206e717eb5719eead35Code:32814241b5ab82584f7d0172083476b2afadef98b78f21c0c5a2179961d1f201a82987b70d489eca9f754e06135f2b96d4d62c7129521448801218aeaa0d001dThe four uncompressed public keys are linearly derived from puzzle #130 (connected like public key 0x1 to 0x4).But the great thing is that it only capitalizes on the public key from puzzle #130 without the associated private key ... Yes it is unfortunate but know that everything needs a processThe method is also unlimited, you can create a public key from puzzle #130 or from any public key linearly up to as much storage as you have. It can be said to be infinite I'm sure you will have a question how to validate that it is correct?The answer is 2:1. Is the time when puzzle #130 is solved 2. You can reply to this post publicly here and give me one  public key that you obtained yourself. But remember to make it linear. And I will validate that what I have described is indeed proven to be accurate.Unfortunately, my finances don't support me to learn more effectively because I only have termux on my smartphone. But I will keep tryingDon't forget to leave your thoughts or ideas",
