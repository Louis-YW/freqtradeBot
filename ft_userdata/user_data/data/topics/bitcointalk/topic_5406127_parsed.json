      "body": "So G20 regulation will be born out of this obviously.  Just wondering if their recommendations are going to be really strict, over-regulation in an attempt to knee cap the crypto industry and movement.  But each nation may address differently unless there is a singular G20 mindset in this matter, and this will still take some time before laws are passed and implemented.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on.",

They'll avoid passing anything before elections, which might shift public opinion.Making it even more important to remember what this crypto regulation is for the following election cycle.People tend to forget events after a short time. There is a chance that even if this regulation is bad for everyone. People won't remember it in a few years. That could represent the greatest danger.",

      "body": "Let's see what the nations say though. I mean sure it's cool to see it \"presented\" but the thing that will make it go bigger is not being presented, they all know what crypto is and they do not care about it.The thing that will change a lot is one by one there are more situations like El Salvador. That is an experiment that so far didn't pan out, but there is a chance it could pan out in the future when the price goes up. When that happens we are going to see more and more nations getting in and eventually there will be a reserve currency type of deal for bitcoin in many nations, that's how you get bitcoin to be liked by governments as well as people.",

      "body": "I am honest and I say I didn't read the entire text of the link. But I assume this regulatory framework for crypto is not only Bitcoin focused, right? Like, are we talking about PoW ban? I think this was kind of closed discussion, as I seen some article saying that the ban on PoW was reproved! Am I wrong? I think this framework will target crypto in general and not Bitcoin in particular! If it targets crypto in general, then, I wouldn't worry much about it because Bitcoin is all what matters. Let them kill all other cryptos, I don't really care!",

They do need regulation and interference from someone with the backing of judicial power no matter how libertarian you are. It's ridden with the likes of Do-Kwon. As for regulating the transactions and usage of any truly decentralized cryptocurrency, that's kind of impossible. no matter how many bills you pass lol",
