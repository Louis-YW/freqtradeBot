If there was no bounty from their side, why tranthidung launched the campaign and who have paid tranthidung some cash? Can you relate this? I think there's a misunderstanding between you and the team member you have PMed.Did you try to contact tranthidung through PM? What did he say? I think it's good to discuss with him rather than posting here. Project owner wants great promotion in return of shit tokens and when they don't get enough of the targeted result, they deny paying hunters. Though it's good to escrow the rewards, not every project allow that.",

To test for start I don't think Tranthidung was so lost in mind that he launched a campaign without having anything from the management. They must have a deal and in the deal the management agreed to pay the hunters. But we can not verify what was in the conversation between Tranthidung and the management. However, if I have to pick one based on the history, I will pick Tranthidung over the management. They have nothing to lose but Tranthidung have so he is not going to do anything that will effect his reputation.As Little Mouse suspecting, this could be a miscommunication between you and the management too. Let's hear from Tranthidung.",

Its also weird that the only way to contact person in charge of the campaign is via his Linkedin profile and not Telegram. It may be that people behind EGold simply decided to pretend that they have nothing with that bounty campaign after they saw lack of result (as we've seen this number of times) or that there was miscommunication between person who hired tranthidung to publish the bounty and the actual team.

However, I still think it's smart to take a closer look before jumping into such campaigns. I mean, the fact that the project highlights \"Mining ecosystem built on the metaverse\" and uses the name of a previously established project as its selling points are enough red flags for me. Personally, I would never promote or in any way participate in such a project. Unfortunately, many bounty hunters don't really do their research before signing up for these things, and then they complain afterwards.",

To test for start Check below comments for full conversationArchive Bounty: Egold Bounty Bounty Manager: TranthidungEGOLD Telegram Member I'd Devolper Team: @promanager007If you were to read the terms of the separate campaigns, you would see that nearly all of them say \"up to\" meaning you do not necessarily qualify for the full reward each week. Then go and read the rules and conditions and you will see that the reward is based on the quality of the work.Bounty hunters normally do not read anything except how to join. If i'm being honest, in my time of managing bounties I have found that quite a lot of them are pretty incompetent. On top of that, the amount of cheaters in every single campaign is pretty sickening. I am not talking about 1 single person when I write all this, I am talking in general. Another thing off topic that bothers me is how bounty hunters say \"I worked hard\". This is the funniest thing to read because I in fact know that it literally takes 1 minute to like a tweet, retweet it, and share the link. There is nothing hard about it. The same thing goes for facebook. Things like articles aren't even very hard because most just copy the info from the company website and post it to various other social media sites. IMO the hardest thing for bounty hunters is those that do original videos. At least some of them do their own work, but you notice a lot of duplicates while grading those as well. I hate to say it but bounty hunters are mostly a waste of a companies time. Tranthidung has done nothing wrong so far IMO as well. The only thing he could be blamed for is not getting tokens escrowed and even then it doesn't guarantee everyone is paid anything worth any value. Long as hunters are aware he isn't holding tokens, that's fine as well. Tokens could end up being worth 0 and companies may not even list them. Managers only guarantee for hunters is escrowing eth/btc or something like that.Hate to be brutally honest but that's what it is.",

As far as I know, distributions are on the way. Bounty hunters must keep cooperated with the management team with confirmation via email to complete the distribution.For others,Generally, I stated that I did not manage bounties and I've never intended to manage bounties (or had it far in the past and never minded about it later). Reasons are like yahoo brought his points. Bounties in my opinion are bad and bring very little impact for companies. On manager side, it is headache to check works of bounty hunters and handle their complaints.Many of them joined bounties but even did not spend 1 or 2 minutes to read in OP which has application forms and links. They make a post in Bitcointalk and join bounty groups to ask where is application forms. I am sure those bounty hunters will bring almost zero value to companies. I even asked management team to exclude Newbies because I am sure they are likely zero contributions for projects.Sometimes, people DMed me to ask whether they should join bounties generally. I said no and they should do other things but it is life and society needs different people to do different jobs.Important from my experience, when projects distributed tokens to bounty hunters early and especially when their public sales are yet ended, shit happens. Bounty hunters will dump their tokens on DEX and impact company public sale a lot as well as lot of FUD. Projects got that issue even have to create a new token and make token swap to avoid impacts on their sale. It does not end here, they will have to spend time, resources to update their project info on big site like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. You know, shit happens again, support on Coinmarketcap is not too good and takes a lot of waiting time. Meanwhile, another chance for FUD.I don't manage bounty but when I can, I advice the guy I collaborated with to tell companies that they must pay attention on distribution time in correlation with their public sale. I also told them to have clear distribution date like if your public sale ends at 9 Feb 2023, bounty distribution time should be only after that day.About my collaboration for publication, with NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement), I won't reveal details except shit happens from their management team. With disclaimer, I am not responsible for distribution but I always keep up contact with management team about distribution for bounty hunters and advice them to adjust rules for future, for more transparent, better management to avoid fud as well as to bring clearer view for bounty hunters to make decisions (joining or not).About Escrow idea, I don't take risk to do this. Why I should take that risk if I am not the manager and not responsible for distribution? Shit happened with julerz12 and I won't do the same. Additionally, I recommended the management team to take the bounty budget first, Escrow it for distributions. They can not trust companies for distribution because I am so sure companies mostly are not happy with result from bounties.Obviously, when shit happens with management team, I will definitely stop working with them.",
