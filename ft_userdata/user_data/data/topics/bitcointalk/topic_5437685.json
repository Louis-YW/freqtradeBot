From what I can see, those bounty campaigns have different bounty pools; one is in BNB and the other in their tokens so there is a chance that both are legit. We've seen weirder things than some shitcoin running two bounty campaigns at the same time.Quote from: BountyProgram on February 01, 2023, 08:09:18 PMI hope they both explain this from their side. If they don't give any kind of respons, then flag should be created because as far as I know scams have no place in bitcointalk forum.If you have doubts, why don't you head over to Pi Chain Telegram group and ask are those bounty campaigns legit? That's really the only way to know for sure what's going on here.Other than that, Pi Coin looks like yet another shitcoin, like the Pi Network on which it's based on.",

      "body": "I am yet to do any DD on the referred project, not even reading their ANN yet, but can you tell us exactly how they're a scammer simply by having two simultaneous bounty handled by two different BM as your evidence? And what explanation do you exactly asked the BMs to provide?If you read closely, the bounty run with different rewards, Formula Bounty held a 5,000 $ worth of their token while ahmim held a 7,000$ of BNB. There are instances of projects like them; running two simultaneous bounty handled by either different BM or the same BM.I am not saying the project is scam or not a scam, it's still undecided because I haven't read any of their materials, what I tried to say is running two simultaneous bounty does not instantly make a project scam, unless you have another proof or other basis that you're yet to show us?Ok so I'm running on fumes here as I actually planned to hit the bed early because it's been a long day for me and I was just checking the forum to... well... it's some kind of bed time routine actually. As I'm worn out and not quite sure I can think with crystal clarity, I'll just present my findings here from a quick \"give-it-five-minutes-and-then-go-to-sleep-which-turn-into-hours\" promise/lie to myself.So far, the first part of their whitepaper is copied from this site, And from the three team members they presented, one name checked up to be valid, Pierre Mattei is indeed a Pierre Mattei who worked on Unagi, although he didn't seems to mention Pi Chain on his profile. P.s.: forgive the image messiness, my trustworthy IMGBB choose to be down right now of all the times it could be, I almost sure the world is conspiring to fill my annoyance to the brim.",

Based on his previous experience (worked as a lead game developer for one of the biggest video game publishing companies in the world) and the fact that he is a co-founder of some sort of football fantasy game, somehow I doubt that he would connect himself to something of low quality as this. But I guess you never know, stranger things have happened.The best thing to do in order to remove any doubt is if someone contacted him directly and ask does he have any connections to this. I did that in the past and so far only once person in question was actually the part of project and all other times they were just using their images to appear more legit. The other way it would be to go to their Telegram group and ask some tough question and if they start dodging the answer or even deleting message it would be obvious what's going on here.OP could some of that as so far all he did was shared 2 bounty campaigns links and that's where his digging stopped.",

Is it that they are trying to imitate or mimic the real PiCoin project based in the large followership they have so they could generate some funds and run away or what because these people  claiming to be the founders of the project are they for real or they are just using some other person's details well known to front so  they could get  investors to invest so they could run away with funds. Sometimes last year December something happened where a pool was created on one of the dex and people were quick to purchase without doing proper research on to know wether it is really PiCoin or not and they got scammed. Here they go again. I am not In any way calling them any name but my interest is that why would th y use PiCoin logo to run their project instead of creating their own logo if they really have good intentions. Are they trying to liverage on the already built community of PiCoin through this platform to look genuine why they carry on with their act?It would be nice their representative here responds to this scam accusations here for clarity.",

Their TG is abandoned² and their website has been down for days³ --I checked two days ago, and yesterday, and today, archived-- which according to isitdownrightnow, they've been down for a week⁴.¹² ³ ⁴Edit 2: Though it's pretty much beating a dead horse at this point, as it's evident that PiChain is a scam project judging from my updates above on edit #1, I think a clarification to clear one's name wouldn't be too late.Earlier today I finally got a reply from Mr. Mattei, as below,",
