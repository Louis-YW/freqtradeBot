  "content": "Hey all, just looking for some advice really as I feel extremely hard done by with some recent VAR decision.I was railing a football match and the score was 2-1. The second team then equalised to make it 2-2, and after this I dumped aload of money on the draw at odds of 2.05.A VAR intervention then happened and the goal was cancelled. The score was reset to 2-1 and the odds of the draw shot up to over 6.0. My bet however was not voided.Is this normal practice with crypto bookies? Should they have voided it? Should they have offered me the higher odds?Just looking for people's thoughts as I feel like i've been conned out of $1k usd here, and the casino in question is really not helping as they receive their sportsbook from a provider.",

Bets are settled based on the final score. And if the league sets its final score based on VAR decisions, then there's little the bookie can do. You can't realistically expect a bookie to not settle a bet at all just because VAR was involved. That would make a lot of other bettors unhappy.",

That would make a lot of other bettors unhappy. That's correct - but I placed my bet at the time when it was 2-2, at the odds of it being 2-2 at the time (which were 2.05). The goal was ruled out, so it wasn't actually 2-2, and so the odds then went up to 6.0. So my bet was placed on the assumption that the score would be 2-2, at the odds offered for 2-2. Instead, I was royally shafted.Other sites like 365 and betfair etc all void bets when a VAR decision overturns a goal. So thought I'd ask. Because you are taking the price at the time assuming it will be 2-2, only for it to be overturned and you now stuck with a bummy price. I'm also wondering if i'd placed a bet on the team winning, instead of the draw, if that would have been void!",

They've said they are waiting for a full explanation from their sports provider, but the ts and cs do say that bets with the \"wrong score\" will be void. It could be argued that the wrong score was on my bet, as it clearly displays 2-2 on the betslip whereas the final score was 2-1.I've just never seen a bookie NOT void a bet in this instance, unless it's a case of \"lets wait until the end and void the winners, but keep the losers\". We will see when it goes the other way I guess, I'll be waiting for opportunities to pounce on when a goal is incorrectly given!",

That would make a lot of other bettors unhappy. You're right. I am assuming the match was already close to the end when he placed the bet and if so, the fact that the odds were 2.05 is enough reason to be suspicious of the situation of the game, another thing is live games are more volatile and more likely to go wrong because one is predicting a match based in the current situation which can change any time, and some matches can receive up to and sometimes more than 10mins of added time which is enough time for things to change in the game, unlike betting pregame which one is more likely to predict correctly because one can analyze based on current forms, injury forms and previous head2head meetings.Staking such a huge amount is not advisable for live games, but can be beneficial in basketball games and not in football games. The booky knows this and expects you to be informed on the disadvantages of VAR in staking live games so they would not admit to any fault or void the game due to that.",
