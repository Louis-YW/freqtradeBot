Especially, those corrections are golden chances for experienced and patient investors to buy dips at very high discounting price rate.After all of these corrections, price is upwards in long trend.",

After 13 years, no actual death for Bitcoin has been seen. Its network becomes bigger each year and price increases yearly.About price, if you consider its yearly highs, it would be ups or downs but if you consider its yearly lows, the trend is more clearly uptrend. I see the yearly lows uptrend is a valid evidence that Bitcoin has been accepted more and has an organic growth in price. Another organic growth for Bitcoin is its trading volume.",

Because now Bitcoin is legal in major countries and transactions are being done by Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin had died then those countries would never have made Bitcoin legal and a means of transaction.And in a very short time all the countries will be using Bitcoin and they will choose Bitcoin as a means of transaction. Many say Bitcoin is dead due to poor market conditions, but this is not a new phenomenon. I have heard many times before that 'Bitcoin is dead' which never actually happened. And I think it will never happen.If you notice that this is not the first bad time for Bitcoin, Bitcoin has faced many bad times before which it has overcome to reach today. And will improve in the future. You can believe that Bitcoin will never die and it is going to be our future asset.",

Whales, institutional investors, rich people can continue investing in bitcoin while avoiding regulations if they invest from countries which have a friendly stance towards crypto. That is quite logical and possible for people with million or billion of fiat to invest in btc.What is weakening bitcoin are the high interest rates offered in US and now in Europe. On short run it has a great negative impact on crypto investors, but on long run it also doesn't mean a lot, as with inflation, naturally investors will have to give up on fiat and migrate to something else again, possibly bitcoin as they did during the covid pandemic in 2021, when fiat was greatly depreciating and the global scenario was unclear.",

After all, they still believe that bitcoin won't die, at least for the next few years. I still believe that bitcoin can survive the bad news out there saying that bitcoin will die slowly and telling us to save our money. They will see how strong bitcoin is when the reversal begins, and they can't imagine why it happened to bitcoin.The regulation comes from the US, while the countries supporting bitcoin will be more. The US will not be able to survive if more countries come and will disagree with the US. We'll soon see what happens next and prepare everything before it happens so you can take advantage of it.",

If bitcoin didn't died before from all the corrections in the past then, it certainly won't die now. Government trying to regulate bitcoin is just doing what government does, It's nothing new.",

Wrong. This war (like other dozen ongoing wars) has no effects on bitcoin price whatsoever. The recession + inflation that was caused because of incompetence and weakness of the European and American economies has led to sell pressure on bitcoin pushing its price lower as people sell their bitcoins to fill their hungry bellies in the West.QuoteIf you buy ethereum than you are in bad place. FTFY.If you buy shitcoins at any price you are always in a bad place.QuoteIt can take 4 years only to achieve the same high of last bull run.Wrong.

If bitcoins were dead than the price would be 0, or at least very close to 0 and not at 18.700 USD as it is right now. Bitcoins and other crypto currencies tend to move in cycles. There are always bull and bear markets, we shouldn't worry too much about it. Also if you are true that in 4 years we are back at the old ATH then it still a pretty good return. From current levels it would mean a rise of more than 250%, which is a pretty good return if you ask me in 4 years. Much more than you would make with stocks, bonds or your savings account.",
