In fact, I have added my support for the flag though I wonder why Timelord2067 opposed the flag, yet I have always seen him have a strong stance against lending board scammers and potential scammers.",

I'm not surprised that he opposed this flag or anything he might do at this point. I know many people still trust him but I put him on ignore some time ago because he is too conspiratorial with alts and such.",

The thread of @OP is nothing but a trap and I think no will care to provide even a pic of their knee to such scammers.",

He's been doing this since 2020 had an offer like this back in 2021 where he first got tagged and now he posted again this year, he is not serious about giving a loan he just wants your information, so far there's no complaint against him but that does not mean that people should not be careful on his offer, it's a trap when he asks for confidential details, your sensitive information is not worth hundreds of dollars not even a thousand dollars, especially to an anonymous person.",
