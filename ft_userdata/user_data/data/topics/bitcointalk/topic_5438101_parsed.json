  "content": "Over the course of my many years of involvement in highly distributed systems and the blockchain I've become increasingly interested in how blockchain technology can be used to create trustless distrubuted systems and how this can be leveraged in more traditional applications.One thing I've been thinking about a lot recently is if a blockchain solution with a similar contract mechanism and supplier/consumer relationships to the file storage chains (Filecoin, Sia, Storj, etc) could be applied to the running of assets within the kubernetes ecosystem. It seems like a logical extension of the existing technology, but would have unique security requirements to ensure the safety of the host machine (likely by isolating the k8s cluster and pods within a virtualized environment and creating a pod/service combo responsible for inbound network connections and the general network security of the cluster). I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts on a system like this and start a discussion surrounding the implications of attempting to open such a broad scope of functionality in a trustless environment. I'm aware of other companies attempting to do something in a narrower scope like https://cpucoin.io/ by exposing a very narrow set of compute resources however I have not found any projects attempting to tackle a larger problem subset like total kubernetes or VM rental mechanisms.",
