In the end, I had to delete the old database (it was corrupted, I gathered) and create a new one. This I did and Bitcoin Core worked fine throughout. So far as I'm aware it's up to date now. I did that while it was still V22. When I try to run it now though, and updating to the very latest version makes no difference, it runs for a few minutes saying \"Loading block index\" and then simply dies. It disappears. It goes away. It stops running. What to do? :-(",

No I'm not forcing Bitcoin Core to quit early, it does it for unknown reasons. I wondered about that too. Is it likely some other program could be stopping it running? It ran fine while it was updating the index so that seems unlikely I'd think... bitcoind... in the absence of any immediate response here I've been floating round the other forums and found advice to see if bitcoind would run ok without promptly dying, so I tried it for a short time, and it worked OK. I thought I'd mention it before someone here suggested it.",

That might tell us something... like it isn't installing properly maybe. Crystal liked my E drive, isn't sure at all of my F drive and had no idea what to make of my SSD C drive. Hmmmm... I'm moving the index to the E drive and then I'll adjust the shortcut to accommodate the change and then see how that goes. Possibly I'll rebuild it there, it won't take too long.

It can take lengthy operations if the block data or indexes get corrupted and need to be checked or recreated.I don't recommend Windows as a base for Bitcoin Core or other wallets. Due to its market share it is the most targeted environment for malware. And because you're likely familiar with Windows and use it as your daily driver you're going to make a mistake to install your Bitcoin Core and your wallet(s) on your daily driver. You should avoid this as all your internet shit will hit your daily driver. That's not the safest place for your wallet(s).I consider a Linux box that's not being used for daily computer stuff a better approach. Older decent business laptops aren't very expensive from refurbishers (it might be different in your country). Most business laptops are easy to upgrade with a larger SSD and should then serve as a nice and stable haven for your crypto wallet stuff.",

Just make sure that the datadir is set to a folder in one of the other disks.I know I have said it before but basic smart tests are well...just that basic.Something like crystal disk info or Hard Disk Sentinel are better tools.Most basic SMART are pass / fail the above give more detail.Also, since core is just crashing it could be a CPU / system issue that once it's ramps up something else is failing. If there is a cooling issue, or a power issue core trying to do something can be causing it to have a problem.Any one of bunch of utilities that can stress the system a bit can be used to see if that is part of the issue.Remember we are talking about a system that is close to 10 years old with a CPU that has a TDP of 95 watts. There can be a lot of things that have cooked in that case over the years.-Dave",
