If the price has suffered a massive price drop, what would happen next? You should be expecting the bull market next. But in 2023, I am expecting both bull and bear market while 2024 will be most for bulls. Which means that it would be best to use 2023 to DCA or to accumulate more bitcoins for the coming year.",

Moreover, in the coming year it is predicted that there will be a recession and worsening geo-political conditions between Russia and the West, this will be a bad signal for crypto market conditions in 2023.",

What are your Crypto Investment shortcoming this year.. which you avoid or have learnt and would not repeat in the year 2023 ..Nah!!! i don't the see market getting better in 2023. But it did teach us a lot of things most especially those thing that we have been taking for granted like the FTX fiasco taught or reminded us the importance of keeping your coins in a non-custodial wallet and to treat exchanges as 'exchange' and not as a wallet.In 2023 i just hope something new comes that will change how people now view the whole crypto industry that's the only way to make the market recover faster. because if we continue like this it is going to take a longer time before the market fully recovers.",

Every bad events have a good side, since people have an open mind to learn with the mistakes.After the scams involving the exchanges, enthusiasts started demanding for more transparency, and companies which want to thrive and keep operating will have to give what customers are asking for.

In the past, Bitcoin was a cheap unit and the market was normal, meaning that you could, through a job, save enough money to invest in Bitcoin.Next year will witness a worse recession, and if thousands of currencies are laid off, inflation increases and spending and salaries decrease, you will not have much money left to invest.Therefore, the problem is not related to buying cheap coins, but rather to your ability to buy.",

Do you think there's no shitcoin become a dead coin every year? there's no exchange went down due to scam or get hacked every year? But I think you're the one who leave your coins on FTX, so that's why you're get a lesson on this year. Gladly I never leave my coins on exchange because it's not safe.",

And just as everybody has experienced, it's all about selling early. I've already learned a lot from the market a long time ago but if you're going to be rekt by the situation that you're dealing with, there's no way into applying that but to adopt the situation and just bear with it.I don't want to promise myself that things won't happen again but as much as I can, I'll minimize the negative effects of my overthinking.",
