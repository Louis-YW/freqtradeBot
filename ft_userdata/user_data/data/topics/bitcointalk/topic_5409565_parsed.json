Obviously, this doesn't include trades on your typical centralized exchanges such as Binance/etc.^This tool can be quite pricey though, but it's definitely very useful imo if you can afford it, and if you can make smart decisions based on the data.",

Pretty sure can help in some determination but not actually traded, bought or sold. You just get hinted on possible action like usdt or busd movement or btc transferring to exchange or wallet.",

Pretty sure can help in some determination but not actually traded, bought or sold. You just get hinted on possible action like usdt or busd movement or btc transferring to exchange or wallet.This is also my way of determining large buys. I just go on this twitter account and probably it has an app that it uses to detect all of those large buys and transfers.I'm too paranoid on downloading apps since it could contain malware or mining algos that uses your PC or device for it.That's why following that account is enough for me.",
