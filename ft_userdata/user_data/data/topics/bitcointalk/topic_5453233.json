(Preferred - meaning if you offer to buy just one, I might prefer another offer to buy both even if it came later.)Both un-funded.Both bought here from minerjones.Escrow optional, on your expense.Both in plastic cases made by Kialara.Exogenesis in mint condition, but since To the Moon was originally sold only in a plastic bag, it has very minor surface abrasions.Prices are non-negotiable, sorry.Long term offer, might bump occasionally.PMs please.",
