They signed up for it, especially political leaders. Yes, leadership comes with its difficulties and expectations but itâ€™s still a voluntary thing and they must accept the accountability that accompanies them. also, as much as we know that leaders also have their individual cross to carry, we shouldn't forget that there are major benefits they stand to gain by the virtue of the position in which they assume.Nevertheless, GOOD Leaders are great people yes, they also feel pain, and I beleive anyone leading deligently, nature has its way of catering for them.",

Leadership should be something that people rejects and ignore because of the responsibility they will put themselves into but that's not the case I guess.There is a greater burden for leaders but that's only if they are going there to do something for the country anyway, most of them politicians are aiming for that higher sit for their selfish reasons and gains (MONEY), let's not forget the allowance these leaders are getting per month.",

In my knowledge, humans are not easily controlled because everyone would want to exercise their rights and freedom the way it suits them, which could be against another right or harm them. So, leaders are also putting in their efforts and trying to do their best, which they feel could satisfy the interests of their citizens.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

Leadership is a a responsibility that can even even oversea four person in a group. There is pain trust me. The noise of how best it should be never ceases. The envy, the backbiting all adds up, but the person who is in control is mostly known for the calm, focus and attention to duty that is directed toward the common goal. The sacrifice is there and it is always noted by the followers covertly.The true leader in the multitude will always bear more brunt than the multitude who stump down the gate.",

Your illustration about leadership only happens in an ideal situation. Leadership is a call to service and not to oppress or enrich. A good leader will always sacrifice for his followers to have a good life. When a leader is appointed he is supposed to be sober because of the enormous responsibility placed on him as the leader. But I am sorry because selfless leaders have become scarce globally.Currently, most leaders don't care about the masses because their target is to loot the treasury of the country. The struggle for political power currently is not based on the willingness to serve but on a preplanned plot to enrich themselves and impoverish the masses. In some advanced nations, the level of stealing in government is not as widespread as what happens in developing nations.Â It is also true that money alone will not bring joy or fulfillment but everybody needs money to survive in this current society. We need money to take care of our basic needs. These corrupt leaders might not have all that makes them happy but they have also stolen resources that would have made people comfortable.",

Just some intention if ever they win, they have a personal interest that will be easier to fulfill on that position.Well, we're all grown ups and we do know that some of these leaders are up for their personal interests. I am not ignoring those genuine leaders that has their genuine heart ready to help their people, these are the type of leaders that are not heartless. I do see some points that there's this genuine leader but because of the people that are surrounding him, he's being taken away to the heart of service and change their route into serving a few for the benefit of himself and those that have pulled him away to the people.",

Corruption isnt something that we could really be able to remove out in todays society or simply speaking about the reality on which to those who had been sitting into those positions would really be having the power and rules on which they could really be able to take advantage if they do really wanted and this is where it starts on misused taxes and other correlated things which in regards to money of people. If it wasnt been applied on the right place then for sure it would really be that applied into their pocket, which it is indeed the reality.Â   I do rather prefer on seeing a leader whose really be that being silent but when it comes to changes and things that had been done on the country or a certain city or whatsoever did really make out that notable progress on which this is what we do really like to have and not into those people who do reallyjust simply spamming out those sweet words and promises on what are the things that they would really be planning to do. This is why its always recommended that we should really vote for the right people.",

It should be abit easy for them as they are controlled, or they are always told what to do like animals in zoo... then they pretend to be in charge when speaking to the media and others. ... It's more like being a conveyor belt for a pre-planned work in a system. The one who planned the work is in the dark watching the activities of his salves/leaders. The moment the leaders start doing things on their own it becomes really difficult and dangerous for them. The system typically fights back without mercy.",

And there you can find the difference between Politics and Leadership. As an old quote says, great power comes with great responsibility. Then and only then being a leader of a country has power over the government, military, and system. This requires a great deal of responsibility to keep the country's sustainability of needs, economy, and peace.Of course, power towards other nations and connections to other organizations are necessary for being a leader of a country but only secondary. What is needed for a leader is integrity. However it is not enough, because even the leader is true to his responsibilities, corruption occurs on their subordinates, lawmakers, and cabinet members.",

This burden, often concealed behind public images, frequently results in the ethical dilemmas plaguing modern politics.You've raised an intriguing point about corruption. While it's generally linked with greed, it can be seen as an offshoot of the colossal pressures intrinsic to leadership. Amid an atmosphere where tangible results denote success, leaders may resort to unscrupulous means to fulfill their roles.Your metaphor of \"closing our eyes to see this little thing\" is a striking paradox embodying this intricate issue. It hints that we must delve deeper, past the headlines, to truly grasp the hardships of leadership.

Maybe it's a bit telling that studies have shown a disproportionate amount of people in leadership positions have psychopathic tendencies, whether they have them to start with or simply end up with them after reaching these positions, who knows. It is definitely stressful being at the top of the chain because lots of people rely on you in many cases, whether in business or when running the country. However they often receive rather outsized rewards for being in this position so maybe don't be feeling too guilty towards them. Power can be a dangerous thing for some people as well, as it can be very corrupting when it is unmonitored or enforcement of boundaries is lacking.",

The problem is that the leader is not autonomous in his decisions. Often decisions are made instead of him, and he is only a \"scapegoat\" who takes responsibility. It should be understood that if you go against the system, the leader can always be replaced by a double. Is he worth envying? I think not.",
