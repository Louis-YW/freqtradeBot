  "content": "Stawy away. It is a scam. I was looking for a passive income strategies. I purchased the first contract worth USDT 5,800 (a cryptocurrency with a unit value similar to the US dollar), IDMINING initially paid me the so-called daily profits and thus paid me about Â 4200 USDT. I made all transactions with BINANCE(.)com. I was depositing USDT cryptocurrency directly from Binance(.)com to an IDMINING wallet whose TRC20 network wallet address is TFZHB2H7MuXXNruXvbvVKTSweaj2NxD6LP and BTC wallet 3J46FZi5TAisEgM2Sd6WGNsG9MsBKnj1m1. Later they changed the USDT address to TM1zzNDZD2DPASbKcgdVoTYhfmYgtfwx9R, but unfortunately, I didn't use it for depositing. Satisfied with how things turned out, I purchased another contract worth USDT 28,000. Unfortunately, the ability to withdraw daily profits has been blocked for me. After contacting the support on the scammer's website the same day, they told me that I needed to buy a second contract worth 28,000 USDT and only then would they unlock my account. In the end I bought a second contract and at the same time I wrote to the technical department a request to unblock my account. Unfortunately, despite this request, they said my account's scoring value low and I can't withdraw until my scoring will high again. They nagged me to refer my friends to increase the scoring. It is brutal scam. Stay away. They are blocking withdrawal after you reach some threshold or when you buy a more expensive contract. Then when you ask their support what is going on, they:-tell you must buy another contract-ask you to pay a deposit-ask friends to join a referral programThis is an obvious scam. \"Trust\"pilot is not reacting to complains. They are flagging truth comments very quickly. You can read stories of the other people who were scammed:1. https://medium.com/@amin.sajedi/idmining-is-scam-and-you-must-not-trust-at-all-dbabeb3e25e82. https://youtu.be/1QqBBXeHDSsI pay 1000$ to the person who exposes Idmining scammers or wallets owners with their names and addresses.Edit 1:The IDMINING's deposit addresses later changed, although I didn't use them because IDMINING blocked withdrawals on my account. The other scammed people I'm in contact with were using the new addresses. Moreover, the money flow on the crypto chain proves all the mentioned accounts are connected. 1.

But I can't understand how can, you guys, invest such huge amounts so easily without doing a proper research. Thank you for kind words. I think the reason behind such behavior is the greediness. Let's use classical words - I am an idiot. I investigated on the internet before and I found many articles that were backing up this company like this one https://finance.yahoo.com/news/idmining-launches-cost-effective-cloud-131500225.html. Now I know that these articles were written by scammers themselves. Also in May, idmining had score 4.5 on trustpilot and negative reviews. In the end I think I was too lazy to think more critically, but greediness did the job. I realized that they changed agrement after I bought first 28k contract just to get money from me. I want to find who are these guys. What I also found is scammers most probably have other sites for scamming people. One of them is Happyminer.us which is now gone and cryptolyi.com the websites have the same tech stack and they use same wallet addresses.",

Also OP, you should know that no matter how grave the offense is, doxxing isn't the way, you're putting yourself and the people that accepts your request in an awkward if not dangerous position even if you offer a reward. My suggestion is that you do it legitimately and talk with the authorities about the identity of these scammers and regarding their identities, even if you were to know it, there's a possibility that they're not from your country.",

Yup. I had the same assumption - that their account was already fully verified in the higher tier (or highest?) given the big amounts they transacted recently.At the same time, buying and selling of verified exchange accounts have also been rampant and there are even people who volunteers their identity to be used hence my most likely bet went to the mentioned situation. Ofc, there's also a chance they're dum dums and have actually used their identity or one of their team members.",

It's like 99.9% of them are likely a scam these days and if there are companies left that are doing and offering real cloud mining, their contracts are mostly full at all times. It is enticing to have these contracts because you think that they're for real as a passive income but then, no wonder that they're still existing because there are beginners that will always fall for these schemes. And please, don't ever put such amounts and it's best to never trust them quickly if there's one out there interested and keeping an eye with these cloud mining companies.",

It seems it will be very hard to track the real owner. QuoteI have been able to (eventually) recreate similar circumstances for outbound USDT TRC 20 transactions which appear as though funds are (double sent / two step) firstly from a wallet on the exchange to one of the exchange hot wallets and then from another hot wallet to the recipient.In effect the exchange has it's own in built mixer.Recovering funds from a borrower who absconds with borrowed funds would be even more hard to track for a lender - especially if no collateral has been provided.While I haven't done inbound (i.e. deposits) to users on the exchange I'm guessing the is a similar two step process (probably three - deposit, hot mixer then the recipient's wallet address)Edit 1:They unblocked withdrawals on my account, but now there is a different fooling action - transfers are ending as invalid ones.https://imgtr.ee/images/2023/07/16/d2b9914c1589495fe5908bbc6c876b34.jpeg",
