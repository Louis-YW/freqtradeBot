  "content": "A very embarrassing situation that caused panic happened in the white house. QuoteThe White House and the surrounding area were evacuated on Sunday as the Secret Service investigated an unknown substance found on the grounds that turned out to be cocaine, the authorities have confirmed.The grounds were cleared “as a precaution” after the Secret Service’s Uniformed Division Officers spotted an “unknown item on the White House complex” at 18th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, a Secret Service spokesman told reporters on Sunday.The Washington, DC Fire Department’s hazardous materials team was dispatched to evaluate the find, while the Secret Service closed down multiple streets in the area around the White House.United Nations employees accused of drug smuggling United Nations employees accused of drug smugglingRead moreUnited Nations employees accused of drug smugglingRead more:   Australia to send warship and Defence Force personnel to Middle East to support USDC Emergency Medical Services soon deemed the substance “non-hazardous” and the streets were reopened. The mystery substance tested as “cocaine hydrochloride,” a recording from DC Fire and Hazmat tweeted by radio aggregator OpenMHz confirmed.Cocaine is a Schedule II narcotic in the US, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and addiction and is illegal to possess without a doctor’s prescription. The Secret Service was reportedly still investigating the origins of the substance as of Sunday night. https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/white-house-evacuated-over-cocaine/President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden who has struggles with drug addiction recently visited the White House, could it be his, or there is another active illicit drug user in the white house of the United States? Should citizens be worried? What do you have to say concerning this.",

Nothing is embarrassing about the discovery because politicians are hypocrites. They criticize the open and do the same thing in secret. Most of these government officials do drugs but they conceal it from the public because they are angels while the people are devils. You only see or hear about the rotten secret lives after they leave office maybe through lawsuits or in their memoirs. QuotePresident Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden who has struggles with drug addiction recently visited the White House, could it be his, or there is another active illicit drug user in the white house of the United States? Should citizens be worried? What do you have to say concerning this.According to reports the substance was discovered in an area accessible to the public. A visitor might have brought it in because this is not the first time such a thing has happened. Musician Snoop Dogg and actor Erkan Mustafa claimed that they have used drugs while visiting the White House. Political opponents are using the presence of Hunter Biden in the White House two days before the discovery to score cheap political points. There is no link between the President's son and the illicit drug for now.OP you need to check the article you quoted. There are some irrelevant information that is distortion the flow of facts.",

I wouldn’t look too far into it, it isn’t a scandal or anything. Could just be an admin employee or a janitor or something. It’s illegal sure but I don’t think as a nation we need to panic about it.",

Many times, during negotiations, they have to keep working and speaking and plotting for hours and many times these are \"won\" by mere exhaustion of the opponent, it is just a question of incentives that they will use \"enhancers\".Normally I am not surprised that some politicians still use illicit drugs, many people in top positions in society are into one drug or another, habits from the past that followed them into the future. I am closely monitoring reports from the secret service and the investigation they claim to be conducting. I will like to see who they will tag as the culprit and owner of the cocaine, I like to see a name, DNA analysis is being carried out, so a name will be possible, that is if they will agree to make the findings public.",

Because I thought surely no one would be foolish enough to bring cocaine on their person and enter security with it. The WH is the most secured compound on the planet. No one without a clearance could possibly enter with a powdery substance on them, let alone leave it somewhere on WH grounds without getting caught.So whoever brought it in went past the secret service checkpoint. And who is notorious for being a crack addict? I saw a report that suggested the coke was found near the Vice Presidential limo parking spot. Are they trying to blame the coke on Kamala?",

They have to feed the pigs. Last time Fox attempted to go to anything near facts and truths they lost more than 10% of their audience in days. They have now learnt the lesson - people in their audience are not about hearing facts and they choose leaders that have a distant relationship with these. To be honest, that is nothing original from the US, it is just that it is more influential in how other countries play the game.",

Someone who unintentionally brought the cocaine to the White House and spontaneously decided to drop it would have left some fingerprints behind. It is also the fact they could not identify the person from the angles of the cameras (assuming they had some of them around the area).Keeping in mind someone tried to approach the alleged residence of ex-president Obama with a van packed with guns some days ago, going in a tourist visits with some grams of coke to carefully drop with without leaving a trace sounds rather tame from I have watched some people is capable of there in the United States.",
