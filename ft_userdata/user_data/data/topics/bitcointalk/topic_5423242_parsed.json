      "body": "This is useful post to the people who involved in the sports bet in the World Cup of Qatar. The match between Poland and Saudi leads to the upper side of Saudi as compared to the Poland. In this game Poland should concentrate on more to chase the Saudi. Their maybe 3 goal difference between this two continues, because it’s World Cup and team will give its hundred percent for sure. In the Second match, France will rock for sure. Because France was in form already. So both game will be quite impressive today. France going to reach the next level using this game. So we can see France in top 4.",

So far, I have missed the Poland vs Saudi Arabia, but have got it right for the game between France versus Denmark. Let's see what will be the outcome of the following games.",

And currently France is at the top of Group D with the acquisition of 6 points, and to advance to the next round France will face Tunisia who are in last position which in my opinion will win and get 9 perfect points and win Group D.And for the next match Argentina will face Mexico, and hopefully Argentina can win this match and get full points, and Argentina must win the remaining group C matches in order to qualify for the next round.Argentia betting against Saudi Arabia, I'm sure many will be disappointed, myself included and for now I'm sure Argentina will win against Mexico.",

This is what I love in football, you can tweak your bet and get some more value from it while still being safe in terms of results. Then again, I think this tip was just a guide on how would the games pan out in general and not something that can be shadowed 100%. Nonetheless still great of OP to share.",

Even their weakest team is good enough to form another national team to play against Tunisia. Tunisia shouldn't be a case to worry about it should have more goals compared to result against Australia and Denmark. Take such a risky odd for France to lose isn't worth the funds. Over 3,5 odd should be a perfect bet for me",
