Better for you guys but for me , I really don't see this as a strategy to betting but a collective effort to raise betting funds, just saying from my perspective though.You would have atleast listed the analysis you guys used and how well it has worked for you guys with proves if possible.I hope greed doesn't come when there is a big win and that is one reason I really don't like collective efforts to doing things as regards to money",

Do Share.Looks great as you share the pain when you lose money and that is really the best advantage that you get from this \"strategy\".The second one is that the knowledge is better shared when two or more people discuss together before placing the bets and now with technology this is fairly easy to discuss through our chatting apps in our mobile phones if we cannot discuss it head to head.I never thought of such \"strategy\" before because in life I am always taught to be an individualist rather than doing team work,maybe not a good thing but that is who I am.I like this idea a lot though,I have no strategy to share as there are no real strategies in gambling,everybody does as much as they can to win money.",

Do Share.Your analysis is the strategy and not the way how you guys get a capital to invest because that's the thing which contributed to the outcome, so that would be more helpful to be posted in this topic which you may consider. Well, what highlighted on my end is the bond which you have mentioned. Atleast whether you guys win or not (ofcourse winning would be more preferred), you have enjoyed the experience itself which is not evident to many gamblers who are just seeking money from this activity or industry in general.  What is unconventional on my end is betting at night. I am not even having basis with this one, but as I have observed my guesses turns out to be winning bets. I consider it as a coincident but I'm on a 2 week straight wins already. Maybe our brain is just more active at night which helps us to analyze accurately.",

Those who share their picks and a bunch of gamblers follow it which means it could really hit the winning ticket. I am happy you are doing it with your friends, I just hope it won't create a conflict when you win big and also about how the profits will be shared if you have different amounts that were put in. Not really a strategy but more like enhancing the way to enjoy every game with money on the line.",

I'm sorry for asking this question, but how can this strategy be profitable and minimize risks if the 3 games in each game have different odds? if you bet the same amount of money on the 3 games and the 3 games have different odds then it can happen that you only hit 2 games that have low odds and you don't make a profit, you end up with losses, anyway, I still think it's risky to do thatQuote from: Davidvictorson on November 30, 2022, 01:38:41 PMFor me it has a lot of advantages - - it minimizes losses- it reduces the chances of being addicted- it helps to build bonding.
