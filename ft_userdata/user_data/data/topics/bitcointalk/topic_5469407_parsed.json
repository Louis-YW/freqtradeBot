Look at the fundamentals, the tech, and the app and you'll find it's the best product on the market. This is clearly #1 winner in crypto revolution (every tech revolution had few winners - see Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages [Carlota Perez]).",

If something never happened before it doesn't mean it won't happen at all. Yes, there were many that claimed to be Bitcoin killers but none of them succeeded (none even could even beat ethereum). But this one is different. It's really really special if you look into the tech and the app. First of all, what makes it different that is it's the only coin that can scale to 1m+ tps.

But I want excacly the opposite - to attract the very few that will believe in the project. Something like Satoshi himself did. MultiversX is not just the most advanced blockchain (it's already way ahead than Ethereum will ever be) but it also has the mobile app that is really gonna be the be your own bank thing. The main application of blockchain is payments and that's what does the best. You don't need to mess with seed phrases and stuff like this; you only need number to create a wallet. Then you can start sending and receiving stablecoins without the native token. For instance, you send 100 USDT and pay the gas fee in USDT (it's called relayed or meta transactions). That is really killer app for blockchain. They have the e-money license required for such transactions but they also need approval I can't talk about now. They will get it 100%; it just needs some more time.",
