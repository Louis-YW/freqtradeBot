Most of the world's economies cannot abandon the dollar, or it must be excluded from the global market. Originally, it is not in its interest to do so, apart from the troubles that will be caused by hostility to America, the world's largest economy.",

This news does not mean that the dollar has been defeated, but that there are several countries that have changed their currency dependence from the dollar to another currency, namely the yuan.and not all people and countries have switched from the dollar, only a few countries have joined to choose the yuan currency, and the country is• Russia• Brazilian• India• Kazakhstan• Pakistan• LaosWith big news like that, surely it will spread faster in all media, especially when it relates to the United States, China, Russia, and even India. Surely this news will make a hot conversation in every country.Yesterday afternoon I was still watching the news about this on TV, meaning this news is still hotly discussed.",

But it is only a matter of time before the USD is eclipsed and replaced by another currency. It may not happen overnight, but it will certainly happen in the future. The US has ruled the world long enough, and they have abused their power to the extreme. Many countries have gradually realized that, and it is understandable that they are anti-American. Currency wars won't be good for the world economy, and we'll be hit hard when it happens, but it's the law and the cycle of the world. Like how the United States overtook Britain in 1920 to rule the world.",

Conspiracy theory lovers, do you think that this forum is influential so that there are paid votes to influence the dollar?All there is to it is that raising interest rates harms many economies, and many citizens begin to know its negative effects, and therefore they search for alternatives to the dollar and put forward discussions. Therefore, the closer a meeting of the Federal Reserve and the higher the leader’s prices, the more these discussions will increase and will decrease if the interest is reduced or in the period between each two meetings. for the federal.Generally, this decision is taken by countries, but you as an individual must diversify your investment portfolio.",

YUAN? Are you seriously ? Do you really not understand why China is doing this? More precisely, why does he manipulate not very smart \"friends\"? For the fight against the dollar? On which does China's economy and industry depend? Are you seriously ??  I’ll tell you: for another half a year, or maybe more, when the screeching “BRICS is abandoning the dollar and switching to local currencies” and “More countries are joining the BRICS” just started to rise actively, I then wrote - there will be no local currencies. There will be YUAN!!! And there will be no dollar in the gold reserves of other countries! This is China's goal. The export of inflation will concentrate the movement of the dollar on itself as much as possible. And this is done precisely through the \"unification of the countries\" of the BRICS. All will trade within the BRICS only for RMB. No one will be able to sell their products to the Western world for hard currency. And China, having bought it for its yuan, will sell it to the West for DOLLARS, which it will keep for itself, in order to buy technology, equipment and everything that allows China to be the \"second economy in the world\" in the West.I hope now you will begin to understand what this whole \"China game with idiot friends\" is all about?",

I simply believe that everything has its time to make an impact and be discussed. People tend to make humor and talk about what is going on at the time; it's a trend that may be coming to an end. It is not a question of being paid or not to propagate propaganda. The media is vast, and people say whatever they want in order to gain public attention. The same thing happened on this forum because that was the topic of conversation on social media at the time. Now that everything has calmed down, we will see fewer articles regarding the US dollar. The truth is that most people simply follow trends and don't care what they're all about or the effect of what they’re engaging in, that’s just a typical being for you.",

The dedollarisation is still ongoing and there is enough discussion about it on this forum without needing a new topic being opened every day with every tiny news.The most recent news is the United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen admitting that the world is dumping the dollar.There are lots of signs of the weakening dollar too. From the inflation+recession going on in US that has led to mass firing of employees and increased unemployment and banking system falling apart to the economic hardship that has led to a significant increase in number of people who loot supermarkets across United States every day.It would be spam to open a new topic every day to say for example yet another Walmart store was looted 2 days ago in Chicago by hungry Americans.Besides if you were expecting dollar to dump down to zero overnight or disappear from the world, that was your mistake. Countries aren't dumping dollar overnight or even all at once. They reduce their dependence slowly. For example a country that was trading 100% in dollar is now trading 80% in dollar and 20% in other currencies and by the end of 2023 this percentage would reach 50-50 and next year to 20-80. And that process will continue to weaken US Dollar.",

The trending news always finds its way into the forum. The news of the ditching of the dollar was propelled by the rumor that the BRICS nations are considering substituting the dollar with a common currency or the Chinese Yaun. That's usually true for headline news stories related to crypto (like the collapse of FTX), but I'm assuming the members who created the threads OP is referring to weren't established members.  Am I right, OP?  It sounds like a spammer or propagandist or who knows what.In any event, I don't think this is really a big deal.  I'd say it's probably a good thing whoever started up those threads went away.",
