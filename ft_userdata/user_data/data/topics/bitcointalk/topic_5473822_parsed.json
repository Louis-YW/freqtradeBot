It is not done in any investment space unless you're lazy about doing your own research.Quote from: hopenotlate on November 12, 2023, 03:58:41 PMI can feel your frustration but no matter how hard I try I can't understand what you're referring to.\"Lots of random words I don't understant\" : well crypto knowledge involves a boring part in which time is wasted in introducing concepts without which most of the speeches read here seem \"random words\".\"Nothing cool happening\" : it is not a party, a movie, a football game or a rockstar concert.

If he sees the market as something boring and only wastes time on the concept when some of the institutional investment companies that are not interested in crypto now filing for spot ETF then crypto is not meant for him.",

On the contrary, in my opinion this platform isn't getting enough credit at all because this platform is embedded with vast knowledge, not just about Bitcoin like the name implies but offer knowledge on other subject matters. So I'm pretty sure if you give the platform a chance, you'll learn so much from here. I've only been here for a little while but I learn everyday here and trust me when I say the knowledge I've accumulated from this platform is none like no other and I'm still learning more things everyday.",

Obviously, noone under such conditions or circumstances will find this place to be constructive. Anyone who would be interested in this community would not complain about strange words they cannot understand, they would try to find the meaning of them on the internet and come back here to further educate themselves and perhaps earn some bucks in the way.

However, if you're talking about something else then you need is to make another post in which you describe that thing in detail. Your current post lacks information and with such limited information no one will be able to know what you're trying to say.I really can't comprehend that which words you're claiming as random if it's about seed words of a wallet then that makes sense but still I can't understand your post because it lacks information and the questions or the opinion you're trying to share with us isn't clear. Has any poster done something wrong with you? If yes, then you should mention that in detail.",

If you are not happy being in bitcointalk for one reason or another - then just leave your account and forget everything. You just need to focus on how your assets grow - after all, for train yourself not only by reading, but also in several other ways.But wait - I don't think this is about bitcoin and its discussion, but this is about altcoin.

I don't know what others who are just coming in here are going to say, as many people should be looking up to accounts like yours as role models if they have been active and could have also classified it as an OG account. When you talk about the forum being boring, do you mean in terms of the kind of discussion that goes on in the forum or what? You can also start with the kind of topics you want to engage in and have such discussions that won't be boring on your side again, as for me, my time in this forum has never been a boring season. as I always visit different boards, which is based on the mode I'm in and the kind of topics I want to read at that very moment, so when you are talking about the forum being bored, I really don't know the angle that you're referring to, or should it be flooded with jokes like we can see on social media's?",
