  "content": "Quote from: Wind_FURY on August 20, 2023, 07:22:57 AMPlus instead of debating again and again that goes nowhere, why not open a topic/guide that compares different CoinJoin wallets and illustrate the pros and cons of each? That would be a more constructive solution, no?Due to recent events with mixer being confiscated by authorities, or mixer doing an exit scam, or with a seemingly legitimate pro-privacy company going in the opposite direction, I think a clarification of where we are at the moment in protecting the users' privacy is necessary. There are three ways to secure privacy of your bitcoins, each of which comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Pick according to what fits you best. 1. CoinJoining - what is this?There are three ways to do a coinjoin with a large liquidity and effectively. Joinmarket, Whirlpool, and Wasabi. We'll break down each. Joinmarket [Github]pros:Decentralized; each of you can become your own coordinator if you provide sufficient liquidity. The protocol is designed to work with many takers (those that will take ordinary users' offers). Self-custody.Large liquidity for coinjoins. (orderbook)cons:Difficult to setup for the average user.Expensive; you're paying for the inputs of the takers. Those inputs are recommended to be more than 9, so you'll be paying for at least a large in size transaction. This can be in the range of $5 to $10 sometimes. Running your own full node is a requirement. (even though you should either way do that, as noted below)Whirlpool - [samouraiwallet.com]pros:Self-custody.Very effective, contains ~8,500 BTC in liquidity and you can make as many coinjoins as you want once you enter a pool.Cheap. For amounts within 0.001 and 0.025 BTC, you're paying only 5,000 sat. For larger amounts less than 0.7 BTC, 50,000 sat. (mining fees asides)cons:Not fundamentally decentralized; you'll be using Samurai's whirlpool, as they have the most liquidity.Wasabi - [wasabiwallet.io]pros:Self-custody.Cheap. A fresh input (that isn't already coinjoined) will only cost 0.3% of the amount with free remixes according to the wiki. (mining fees asides)cons:Not decentralized. Liquidity sits on top of the default coordinator, even though it's theoretically possible connect to other servers (none of which I'm aware of).Service treats the currency as non-fungible and might blacklist your inputs without rationale given.Software is caught to have flaws with protecting user's privacy: https://twitter.com/wasabistats.Funds blockchain analysis company and requests permission from them when user does coinjoin.Note: To enjoy great levels of privacy with coinjoin, running your own full node is a prerequisite (unless you're using Wasabi which utilizes block filtering). If viewing your wallet's balance requires a third party, then the gained privacy is questionable. 2. Mixer servicesIn this category falls every Internet service that runs individually and is often advertised in this forum. You can find an extended list in here: 2023 List Bitcoin Mixers Bitcoin Tumblers Websites. Each service might come with other benefits, but they all fundamentally share the same pros and cons following:pros:Can be cheap. In fact, some services in the past charged you absolutely nothing.Can be very effective. Services in the past used techniques like time travel and cutting of blockchain connection, both of which are impossible to do with coinjoins. cons:You're forfeiting the custody of your coins.Trust that the service isn't a honeypot or doesn't keep logs is needed.3. Swapping bitcoin with a private cryptocurrencyThe third option is most likely underestimated. Swapping decentralized, cheaply, and with the largest anonymity set currently available (Monero / XMR), is attractive. Let's look in each pro and con closely.pros:Decentralized, using Bisq, you can trade bitcoin for XMR, and there appear to be lots of offers: https://bisq.markets/market/xmr_btcVery effective; largest anonymity set (about $2.6B in market cap). You can also take advantage of the time; you can keep the XMR for an indefinite time, and make yourself even more untraceable.Self-custody. (if Bisq is used)No trust required. Monero is a network resulted from cryptographic achievements like ring signatures and their combination with confidential transactions.cons:Might be a little complicated, as the user has to get along with Monero, and maybe even run a full node for additional privacy.Might come a little more expensive sometimes. Total costs are: Bitcoin on-chain fees (4 TXs), Monero on-chain fees (nearly zero), Bisq fees (trading costs).You're giving up bitcoin for an altcoin. Some may not like that, and if you keep it for a lot of time, there might be price fluctuations (which can be seen as an advantage too, as they randomize the swapped bitcoin amount).Comments appreciated.",

      "body": "Great job putting this together, @BlackHatCoiner! I think for someone who really wants to keep their Bitcoin safe, not just their privacy, I'd suggest option 1. Even though it might cost more and expensive, protecting one's coins is what matters the most. I'd tell most people to think carefully and decide wisely. It's a good idea to focus on keeping your Bitcoins secure rather than just your privacy. Choosing methods like Joinmarket, Whirlpool, or Wasabi, which are part of CoinJoining, can give you better protection for your coins. Remember, think about both privacy and security when you're making your choice.",

It is very paramount that we consider our privacy together with the security of our assets, if we are to consider this vital information you've just provided fro this thread, we need to have a rethink on this regard because mixing services are truly facing serious regulations from government and other related internal challenges, this isn't a call for us not to know what to do or know about other necessary advantage we could take from it, privacy and security should be both considered and achieved by every bitcoiners.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 21, 2023, 04:23:19 PMThere are three ways to secure privacy of your bitcoins, each of which comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.

I mean one thing I knew about them is they are not a good option due to centralization which obviously means we should avoid it but I think your statement make sense.

Also, it makes yourself more untraceable to be in a coinjoin with 100 inputs, than in one with 5, so the number of inputs used surely matters.Absolutely agree, but my point is the size of the total liquidity pool is not that relevant because nobody is mixing with every other output in the pool. Whether the total liquidity is 5 BTC or 500,000 BTC, it doesn't make a difference if I only coinjoin with 0.5 BTC of it.So let's say JoinMarket has ~700 BTC in liquidity and Whirlpool has ~8,500. I have 0.5 BTC to coinjoin in each one. For JoinMarket, I perform a single coinjoin with 19 other participants. For Whirlpool, I perform a single coinjoin with 4 other participants. At this point, my anonymity set is greater for the JoinMarket, even though Whirlpool has the greater overall liquidity. But then I leave my coinjoined output in Whirlpool and it gets another 5 free remixes. Now my Whirlpool anonymity set is exponentially larger than my JoinMarket one, especially once you consider the forward looking anonymity set and all the free remixes that every other output I have coinjoined alongside is also getting.I guess the essence of what I'm saying is that liquidity is not the same as anonymity set. It is difficult to say which out of JoinMarket and Whirlpool provides the best anonymity set, because it depends entirely on how you use them.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 21, 2023, 09:00:29 PMWhat's important here is to break down what's user's best courses to accomplish mixing.

Some may not like that, and if you keep it for a lot of time, there might be price fluctuations (which can be seen as an advantage too, as they randomize the swapped bitcoin amount).Apart from price fluctuations, the process itself has some additional costs. One cost is the network fees you have to pay to create transactions in bitcoin and monero networks that can add up. The other cost is the exchange fee you have to pay the platform like Bisq that you are using.The last cost I can think of is the spread. Sometimes if the trading volume is low, there is a spread in the orderbooks between the top sell order and the top buy order. So even if price remains the same and you buy that altcoin and sell it immediately you still lose some money because of the spread.The other disadvantage I can think of is the complication of this method. Someone who has never used Bisq before or have monero wallet/used monero will have to learn how to do these things first which is time consuming and could be difficult for some people.",

And I would argue that is incredibly important for the coinjoin user.If a 'honeypot' is a site or service that covertly passes your personal data on to governments, is a company that does it openly an 'overt honeypot'?  Or is there a better name for it?  Wasabi are giving your details to blockchain analysis firms and those companies are likely passing the details over to law enforcement or other government agencies.",
