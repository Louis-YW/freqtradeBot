Prices on the Bitmain S19s have dropped significantly ( From 10K to 3K ).Is price drop based soley on the bear market or is it something more concerning like perhaps banning mining ( USA ) or  a new technology on the horizon ?Is Intel's new ASIC chipset going to be more efficient than the Bitmain S19s and if so WHEN/WHERE will retail miners be able to buy them ?Thanks,Ronald",

In this market (partly thanks to the massive sales of gear to mega-farms) that means Bitmain et al have once again been forced to cut into their previously huge markup to far lower prices. At current pricing they are no doubt still pulling in at least 30 or more % over all in manufacturing & marketing costs but before it was more like well over 100%",

It is a chip developed to do one thing and one thing only.  The ones developed for BTC mining cannot be used by network security companies, but ones that use ASIC’s for things like encryption standards, etc are a completely different in the sense of what they are “programmed” to do.  Hell your TV at home has ASICs in it…",

I have lost all faith in our fiat system. Left unmolested by the central bankers and decrepit governments, Bitcoin makes sense with the limited supply and decentralization.

Do you believe Bitcoin is worthless or will the Central Bankers and governments outlaw Bitcoin ?Thanks,Ronald",

The general consensus here seems to be that Bitcoin will drop to next to nothing. The general consensus where? in this form and almost all other bitcoin-related places, the consensus is the exact opposite, the general narrative, however, has always suggested that BTC was going to zero, at least for the past decade, if you count how many times each group was right vs the other, the answer is rather simple.Now if you really believe BTC will increase in value, buying BTC directly beats mining (more often than not), but there are many factors involved, I'd just start and finish by saying if your power rate is anywhere above 6 cents -- mining is probably not for you.",

With rising electricity prices and also declining prices for bitcoin it is pretty obvious why prices are also going down for miners. If you don't have fun to set up mining I think there are a lot better business opportunities including just to buy and hold bitcoin.",
