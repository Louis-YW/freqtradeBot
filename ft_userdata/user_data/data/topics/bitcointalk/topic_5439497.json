Well, unfortunately, based on how I understand things to be or work, any ban in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general send a negative message to the brains of individuals, it be clouds them that it becomes extremely difficult to see the brighter side of such a ban, so personally myself, I am not surprised the way investors perceived the US stands on staking, and besides, bitcoin also can be staked on several platforms, the current correction in the price of bitcoin, which have also affected the entire market might be due to investors unstaking their bitcoins from centralized platform and selling - this is my assumptions.",

I believe that bitcoin is above the rest and it is above the rest in the eyes of the regulators. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency recognized as commodity, while PoS altcoins are securities, even if they aren't yet labelled as such. Another thing you should consider is how much of the total crypto market cap would go to bitcoin if there was no altcoins. 30%? 50%? Think about it. Bitcoin doesn't need altcoins, but altcoins need bitcoin.",

In other words the rates are sustainable. Remember what happened when idiots staked their assets on Blockfi and Celsius? That's right they ended up losing all their money, because the scheme was not sustainable. Plus traditional bank accounts are insured by the US government and heavily regulated. If ethereum wants to offer staking in the US then it should first register as a security and be subjected to the same level of regulatory scrutiny as banks and stocks.",

This is bad news for cryptocurrency which affected whole crypto market including BTC. Banning staking in cex is against the decentralization and regulations and limitations will not give any benefit to Bitcoin. The benefit was nothing, the loss was that Bitcoin's price dropped from 24 to 20This ban is limited to Centralized exchange and door of staking in dex is still open. second only US person are prohibited to stake token in unregulated Cex. all other POS utilities are open and there's no banned and regulations so Nothing seems to benefit Bitcoin.",
