  "content": "Website: www.Sportsbet.ioSportsbet username: snneWhat happen: Sportsbet ban my account $18919You can find the screenshots below the post. I bet for fun.  That's why I don't spend time on forums.  My friends recommended this site to me.  I placed this bet believing in the surprise matches in the world cup.  I was very happy that I won, but sportsbet.io was a big disappointment for me. After experiencing this situation, I researched it.  Many people have been victimized by sportsbet.  I was surprised by what I saw on the forum.  I'm writing here because I see some people in this situation being helped.  Also, other people can benefit from my writing.  They accused me of multiple accounts but I have only one account.  They canceled the winnings I received purely by chance, by sending an automatic e-mail , which they wrote the same things send to everyone. They sent me an e-mail saying that you can withdraw the remaining balance, then I checked my account and they took my earnings from my account.  I was only able to withdraw the money I deposited and then my account was closed.  When I ask a question, they do not answer for days.  I want my earnings.  People shouldn't trust this site and place a bet because they probably won't pay once they've already won.You can find the last e-mail they sent me in written form at the end.https://i.hizliresim.com/96tg2py.jpegOur conversations are as follows:https://i.hizliresim.com/tcicxvf.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/4bvti8h.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/ra9wuls.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/2r7lq7a.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/lii5r58.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/ga5rjhz.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/tn00dw9.jpegthen they sent me this e-mailHello snne,Thank you for completing the verification process.Unfortunately, your account verification was unsuccessful due to multiaccounting.

Im glad I did.This is a simple case of a user who is part of a larger syndicate trying to work together to manipulate the sportsbook. This has certainly ramped up directly due to the World Cup effect.Im all for paying out genuine bets if the price is right, and we are known for fast payouts and withdrawals.However, we are not a charity.. and if you deliberately break normal industry terms and conditions standards, you will be caught.The multi-accounting on this case is soooo blatant and LAZY that even the emails are the same - as above ^^ SO you can imagine what happens when we start checking device details.. it unravels like an Onion.I mean - Icloud and Hotmail?  this just shows you are not new to the game.But the thing that got me, and the one fact I wanted to sleep on, is you tried to pass yourself of as an innocent female. This means you have brought either your wife, girlfriend or a poor innocent female into your web of deceit and using them to try to add to your long list of accounts through KYC verification.You were on top of us for a while and have withdrawn more than deposited. So you can have that money, but there will be no more financial transactions between your (many ) selves and sportsbet.ioWith no surprises, I won't be spending any more time on this case. I am fully enjoying other parts of the World Cup and the bitcointalk forum is pumping with excitement and interaction. I will be joining in.regards, Steve.Sportsbet.io",

This sarcastic attitude is unprofessional, please change it. You accuse me of using multiple accounts, but I don't have an active account other than my snne username. When you asked me if you knew these accounts, I checked that they were closed so as not to give you false information and they were. You confiscated my money without giving you an answer that I was linked to those accounts. Those e-mail addresses belong to me and are accounts that I have closed before. I took a break from gambling to think about myself. Because I usually lose and when I made a profit I wanted to take a break. The next time I wanted to have fun, I opened a new account. I have never used those accounts at the same time, you can research it and see. You can understand this because those accounts are already closed. Also, I didn't do this on my own, I did it by researching. I saw that I could do this in terms and conditions 10.1 and I consulted live support about this issue. He said \"if you close one account, you can open another account. It doesn't count as multiple accounts\". (Proof screenshots are below.) I did not commit a rule violation. Please give me my earnings.https://i.hizliresim.com/oprrw4u.jpeg https://i.hizliresim.com/casy4hy.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/akwiepu.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/45o7sqd.jpeg (terms and condition 10.1)Evidence that I have closed accounts:https://i.hizliresim.com/9tu2v0a.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/ln93pxw.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/a19leo5.jpeghttps://i.hizliresim.com/fd0qx8g.jpeg",

Hi No, I did not use kyc in my other (closed) accounts.  On my account with the username snne, they questioned me not to give the money because I by luck won a large amount on my first withdrawal.  They don't give my money even though I did it correctly.  KYC was not requested in my closed accounts. Probably because I usually lost. There was no money they could confiscate.",
