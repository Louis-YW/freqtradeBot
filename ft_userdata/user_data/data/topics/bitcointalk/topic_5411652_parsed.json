  "content": "Saving ones money is good but could be a disadvantage during inflation. During inflation, price of goods might have increased rending your saved money valueless. In 2020, a friend bought his middle generator at #46,000. I had the same amount but decided to save mine in bank. Last week, I decided to buy the same generator, just to check a store online to see price was now Â around #85,000. See the difference in price within 2 year. Bank can never put such difference as interest on the saved money.CONCLUSIONDuring inflation,ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰always purchase all you need on time without delay to avoid rapid increase of such commodity.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Unnecessary saving should be avoided. Savings should only be made from excess income which one doesn't need at that moment. Lastly, investing is highly preferable to savings.",

Even with cryptocurrency one need to do things at the right time without making any delay.Once savings served as a base for further investment needs. Now things have changed and it is completely upside down. In my country banks are at its worst and few have closed the service. So, banks are no more a place for our hard earned money.",

LOLThe things your 10k can buy before, is less worthy than the things that you can buy at the present because the market value of Â devices, foods, and everything being sold, continuously increases due to inflation.This is also why some people prefer investing their money than to just save it because it would be wiser.

This is because the value of assets will increase over time, while the value of money saved in the bank will decrease.If someone is living paycheck to paycheck, they should not be saving money because it will only put them at a disadvantage. One advantage of saving money is that it can be used as a buffer during tough economic times. Having money saved up can help you weather a temporary loss of income or unexpected expenses.Otherwise, it is better to invest in something that will maintain its value or increase in value over time.",

Generally you should invest it however if you invest at the wrong time like at peak 2021 then you are no better off.From 2 years ago I found most items are at least 20-30% more expensive.

Lastly, investing is highly preferable to savings.Well, what is needed is always going to be the top priority to use your money from. You also have to be aware of unnecessary spending, espcially with the stuff you think you needed, but eventually you'll realize it's not just because you are rushing to get these things to avoid inflation.Savings and investing should be two separate thing on must do. I don't see any problem with savings in the banks, of course you don't want to expect it would increase in value over time. Savings are meant for emergency purposes. It should be secured and risk free and banks can do that for you. While on the other hand, Savings just don't get you profit thus you need to invest to let the money do the work for you and multiply itself.",
