  "content": "What is the possibility of  massive adoption of bitcoin in the world i.e countries that has law prohibiting bitcoin as a legal means of exchange in their various nations if World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other World Financial Organisations decides to take in or consider Bitcoin as a legal means of exchange and making loan option for nation to accept bitcoin from them as a loan and source of exchange or legal tender in their various nations. I had to look at this because since these world financial bodies are giants in the finance industry and nations go to them to seek financial aid which happens that they already adopted bitcoin as a means of legal tender and deemed it fit to be considered as digital money which it already is. When nations go to them for financial aid and they tell them that they can give them bitcoin as loan, this would make the nations reconsider their stand in adopting bitcoin as a means of exchange for goods and services. As financial bodies they are, they have strong influence since they set out international monetary policies which these nations look up to for adoption and  implementation in their various nations.As a world financial organization they are, they can make it more attractive for other nations in the sense that they would raise policies that can be able to accommodate other nations that are yet to implement and adopt bitcoin in their various countries so as to make them reconsider their stringent rules against bitcoin existence in their countries. I was just being curious about this if it would attract a massive turn up for bitcoin adoption in those nations that have passed law  against the existence of bitcoin in their countries since the world financial bodies are possibly bitcoin friendly organisations and would want them to take bitcoin as loan option.I thought of sharing this here to  further broaden my understanding and also to know the opinion of other members too but if you feel it is not inline with the stand of this thread or the platform in general, you can call my attention so as to make the necessary corrections or take the necessary steps to effect the observed corrections.

So if bitcoin evolves to that stage where IMF has to give at loan to countries instead of fiat then there is no place for the existence of them itself, since bitcoin itself can act as a bank and they already knew it.Now about the questions you asked if the world banks provide Bitcoin as loan then the country banned bitcoin completely will be revoked? Maybe yes or Maybe no, it depends on who makes the policies because the government can stand on its own without any flexibility to the changes that or happening or they can be open to adapt and change their stand.",

However, it is only in a Utopian society that we would ever have a time where international financial organizations who again to Bitcoin adoption thereby making laws that allows it to be legal. I don't feel completely comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin loans. It is a highly volatile and speculative asset at the moment and it is more risky taking out a Bitcoin loan not to talk of offering Bitcoin loans to countries as financial aids. This would mostly likely not happen. I like for us to shif our focus from depending or relying on the World Bank or IMF for anything positive about Bitcoin. We the Bitcoin enthusiasts have made it so far without them and we will keep progress without them too.",

Bitcoin goes against fiat in quite a number of ways and this is a red flag to them so would make such possiblity hard to come to passQuote When nations go to them for financial aid and they tell them that they can give them bitcoin as loan, this would make the nations reconsider their stand in adopting bitcoin as a means of exchange for goods and services.Remember Bitcoin is scarce and it cannot be owned by just one body or person so about going to them as what? They won't become lords of Bitcoin suddenly obviously people would have more of Bitcoin than them in fact Scarcity and Decentralization of Bitcoin makes it virtually impossible for them to begin a lordship control of Bitcoin to the point they'd be giving out loans and like you know market of Bitcoin can be very volatile another factor why this can't work!",

      "body": "I doubt the world bank or global financial institution will implement a bitcoin system, this is clear because bitcoin is decentralized so it cannot control and cannot print new bitcoins like fiat. I think the only way for bitcoin to be implemented and adopted by all countries is when everyone already believes and owns bitcoin, then this situation will force countries to recognize bitcoin and legalize it.I think countries have been trying to ban bitcoin for a long time, but they failed. Even though many countries have banned bitcoins, it turns out that there are still citizens who own bitcoins. This happens because bitcoin can be accessed anywhere, even though the network is blocked, there are still VPNs that can help access bitcoin-related services.So I think it's just a matter of time until bitcoin is recognized and can become an alternative world currency. There's no rush to get there, but bitcoin is definitely on its way",

The government is the number enemy that keeps the majority away from Bitcoin by means of scaring them using the volatility or providing alternative such as their CBDC. It’s very hard to attain mass adoption if the government which is the one being follow by the majority is the one against the idea of decentralization.El Salvador is the living proof that mass adoption can only be attain if the government itself is the one believing on Bitcoin.",

So by using their own political hold, they can greatly introduce Bitcoin into government policies.The elite class can do anything whatever they want.

Since they have powerful influence and strong monetary policies it could be of help to make them adopt it smoothly without  any challenges. I also was looking at your points though but do you not think these financial giants adopting Bitcoin alone will cause a fast increase in Bitcoin value which would drive massive adoption of Bitcoin in various nations. Looking at the loan aspect, Bitcoin can be loaned based on its volume and percentage interest could as well be in Bitcoin volume calculations as well. If possible,  the calculations should be in two ways; the monetary value and volume. This I think can be considered when giving out loan to nations interested in Bitcoin as loan.",

Then you must work diligently to acquire 2.625 Bitcoins in the market - whatever it may cost you. When an army of approximately 8 million plebeians is gathered, you will always start winning. By uniting in an army and following a unified strategy and common purpose, education, work experience, skills, religion, personal qualities, etc., won't matter for plebeians. Only in this way can you defeat the elite with higher IQs than yours, better education, more work experience, better connections, more capital than you have... And you have no other choice, either join the plebeian army or you and all your future generations will be slaves... even if you change your names and surnames to the right ones, you will never get into Yale, MIT, Berkeley, or Stanford, believe me. Our army of approximately 8 million plebeians will be invincible. Because nothing can kill what is already dead.",
