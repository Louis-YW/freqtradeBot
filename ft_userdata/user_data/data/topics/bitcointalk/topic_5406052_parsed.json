I see that is a dictatorship tendency. So even with the volatility risk of Bitcoin, receiving payment in Bitcoin is now safer and cheaper than fiat payment since there is nothing like charges on deposits with Bitcoin and they is no charge back in Bitcoin transactions.",

With banks you can take your money and move to another bank, with better terms and fees. In my country not only banks don't charge you for maintaining an account, they even pay you for just having money on it, around 3-4% APY paid monthly, without opening a deposit.

The traditional banking system in my country has limited the citizens and killed the micro economic activities, foreign companies are moving out to other friendly and less taxed countries reason why Bitcoin become a safe heaven for most youths and start-ups.",

Bitcoin may not be ideal for using right now, plus we are not seeing that many \"bitcoin accepted here\", so even if I was willing to pay for the fee, thats still not an option, how am I suppose to pay my meal, bills, clothes or anything like that with bitcoin if they do not accept it. However, there are better deals coming in the future, the debit deal will probably be great in the future, plus the QR code thing is picking up pace, we all have smart phones, so paying with QR code is getting more attention.However, \"having\" crypto is still better than having any kind of stock or gold or anything else, definitely better than fiat. Which means that if the problem is \"50 of each 10k goes to government\" then crypto is certainly an alternative that will destroy that idea of the government. Definitely makes more sense.",

In future, I believe we can have it but in future, governments will have more regulations on cryptocurrency and taxation is one of stricter regulations.The crypto adoption is different but there are many crypto payment processors like Coinpayments.io, NOWpayments.io, WOOCommerce, Shopify and more. We can use our cryptocurrency to buy a lot of goods but we have to use those platforms. It is another challenge. We can be familiar with crypto transactions but not familiar with using those services.In future, even we can pay everything with cryptocurrency, taxation will be very different than now. Stricter taxation and Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is not tool to avoid tax.",

The use of Bitcoin may still not get us out of the financial oppression of our own government but at least keeping BTC in your wallet will limit them from getting your money thru forbidding you to withdraw from your bank.",

If we look at the price volatility of Bitcoin, it makes us interested to take advantage of it. It seems so easy. The price rises and falls and so we buy when the price falls and sell when the price rises. Easy peasy! Alas, when we're already trading, we're most often stuck in a certain position and we don't know what to do next. We're often losing instead gaining. We're often left out when there's a rally and we ended up buying when the bottom is actually far down below. It's actually even better to get into odd jobs like flipping burgers and save some in Bitcoin.",

When a newbie comes to know Bitcoin, trading is exciting to learn and try; mere HODLing is boring. But it's just a matter of time before HODLing becomes the most attractive option.

Bitcoin could also be an escape route when it comes to tax. It could be an escape route in the face of inflation, or wealth transfer across borders, and so on. But Bitcoin trading is hardly an escape route from lack of jobs.",

It really saddens me when the government fails their job to provide a good economic development for their country and constituents to the point that their citizens are the ones suffering the consequences. Although I cannot really say that bitcoin is actually an escape route on financial oppression because no matter how hard we deny, we're always gonna pay the fees because bitcoin isn't fully adopted yet in every place. Hence, we're still going to pay for processing fees for the conversion of bitcoin to fiat. The government will still have their way to tax us and get money from us as long as it isn't widely adopted yet. However, bitcoin is a great opportunity to be an additional income source and investment for the future which is beneficial to the holders of it. It's just up to us on how we would utilize bitcoin for our own sake and advantage.",

In the past 2 years, most banks in my country have increased the fees for their services, and as far as I know, they will increase their fees even more. Let's say that the fee for paying bills (electricity, telephone, etc.) at the bank is even 100% higher than if you do it at the post office, and even 500% more expensive than the fee you will be charged for the same thing at the gas station (bills can be paid even at a newspaper kiosk).Quote from: Odusko on July 12, 2022, 10:27:01 PMWith this over-taxation, a lot of people like myself will opt to hold and receive money through Bitcoin to avoid this crazy bank stamp tax that is aimed at robbing the citizens to enrich corrupt political office holders.If you think that Bitcoin is something that has potential and if you believe that it is safe, then I don't see a problem that you trust Bitcoin more than fiat in your bank. I decided a long time ago that I believe in Bitcoin more than in fiat, and considering that my country will soon abandon its currency, I will have even less reason to believe in fiat.",

Of course banks have overheads like offices and personnel, but that should be easily covered by the interest from their main activity --> lending.It is not generally good for the long-term when the state makes interventions in the economy.
