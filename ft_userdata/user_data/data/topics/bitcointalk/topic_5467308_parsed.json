On the flip side, altcoins, or the plethora of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, might be treading on thin ice. He  drew attention to some concerning signs, such as the disconcerting sales from the now-bankrupt FTX exchange, a dwindling revenue stream for Ethereum protocols, and looming token unlocks.The latter could potentially flood the market, as venture capitalists get the green light to offload their tokens.Source Link: https://www.ethnews.com/bitcoins-surge-rockets-to-27400-is-30000-or-25000-next-exclusive-report-inside/To read more,  the above link serve",

      "body": "Altcoins can make new bottoms from now till the end of 2023 before they can start to recover and prepare for Bitcoin bull run in 2024 after halving. Without Bitcoin bull run, altcoins will be dead coins and they will have no actual bull run in 2024.I think it is still very risky to use your capital to buy altcoins now and rest months of this year. Bitcoin is still in a bearish market and after stucking below $30,000 some months, failed to break out of the strong resistance, and after having good recovery from $16,000 to $30,000, it's sensitive time for Bitcoin.When Bitcoin has hiccup in this sensitive time, altcoins will not have good movements.",

But without bitcoin ETF, altcoins have been following bitcoin price. If bitcoin increase in price, altcons follow and they also increase in price. If bitcoin decrease in price, altcoins follow and they also decrease in price. But bitcoin is better because it is less volatile than altcoins, it has more marketcap and more utility.Bitcoin spot ETF would be one of the reasons that more people will have access to bitcoin, that is definitely true.One thing I just do not like about altcoins is that the can be disappointing, when you expect their price to rise, they may disappoint. Also when they are falling in the bear market, their fall can lead to almost total lose of money.",

      "body": "On September 19, 2023, the price of bitcoin, according to the present market, will be around 48.9945%. Therefore, Bitcoin currently accounts for more than 50% of the entire cryptocurrency market valuation. As a result, according to my hypotheses, this growth is a significant improvement over the November 2022 month, which is only 37.28% lower.In conclusion, Bitcoin continues to be the most well-known and recognizable cryptographic asset worldwide. And for investors worldwide, the most secure and trustworthy investment. While others continue to follow the movement of Bitcoin due to its volatility, we should still exercise caution while dealing with other altcoins. Because of this, its risk volatility is greater than Bitcoin's. Thus, greater vigilance is required.[A] https://ng.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bitcoins-market-dominance-on-the-rise-amid-a-volatile-crypto-landscape-93CH-1075881",

This is really a bad sign for altcoin when Bitcoin suffer another downtrend since the dominance will surely continuos to rise since altcoins is not yet recovered. Bitcoin dominance show how money from Altcoins is diverted to Bitcoin. The pump is not a result of fresh money or else dominance should be decreasing since new money tend to diversify on different crypto assets.",

Thanks for your valuable insights, and I can not agree more with your facts. As I also think that the market might reach $50k this year because it is possible for the BTC and there is much good news circulating in the market too. But most of the time, it all depends on the interest rates announced by the FEds, and the current MT GOX case, other than this there are many other factors involved that could dump the market, and then that would be a great point for Buyers to take entry. Specially for the whales, and for the institutions, who wish to apply or already apply for ETFs. I'm eagerly waiting for the next bull run and I think BTC will reach $110,00 easily. And I don't really think that BTC will reach the previous ATH this year. But fingers are crossed and let's see what comes next.",

If there was only one that came close, I would be more concerned, but if it was Eth, I wouldn't even worry about it because it serves as the basis for many other shitcoins. In the next bull run some will hit the lottery with the shitcoin of the day, while most will lose a lot of money and those of us who invest in Bitcoin will have decent and safer returns, although not as spectacular as some shitcoins.

And that's increasing the dominance of the BTC. And whales and manipulators took advantage of it. We can say for sure that dominance cannot be used as an indicator to time the market; instead, it can still be used to analyze the potential of the market, specifically, those who are alt-coin traders. They have to keep a straight eye on BTC dominance. because increasing dominance has a bad impact on the ALTs.When more money comes into the BTC, its dominance increases. And that's not a good sign in the short term. And we have learned it from the historical events. But still, it makes a good impact on the overall BTC market. BTC's market cap has broken many records of many other financial companies by having a big market cap.People who have already taken entries in the altcoin and are bearing the loss might not sell their altcoins to take entries in the BTC. Because those who are smart enough knew that the market was up for a temporary period. And they knew they just had to bear the market for a short period of time.",
