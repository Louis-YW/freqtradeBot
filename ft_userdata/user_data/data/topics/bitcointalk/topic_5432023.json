The best board to post about announcement thread are either on service announcement or exchange section.Gambling discussion is used to talk about a particular sport or general discussion about gambling, the @OP should post his announcement on gambling board.",

But when it comes to posting an ANN thread, you must post in the Service Announcement board- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=84.0Quote from: Plaguedeath on December 27, 2022, 03:18:03 PMGambling discussion is used to talk about a particular sport or general discussion about gambling, the @OP should post his announcement on gambling board.though your quoted post says gambling discussion, Yogee suggested him to post in the Gambling section. That was correct of course.",
