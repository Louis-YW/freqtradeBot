Meanwhile, enjoy your stay here in the forum and I will take a look at your casino to see if it meets my preferences.",

      "body": "well, as you said that this casino of yours is an evolution of your previous site, that means that you are publicly assuming that you are the owner of the 999dice casino. It turns out that 999dice casino came to this forum in 2013, 10 years ago and the casino had scam accusations. you can see it here:999Dice.com - Just Launched - 0.1% house edge, faucet & earn BTCPeople complained about your casino to the point of posting a photo of the possible owner of the casino, you and anyone can see it here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=386238.msg58840470#msg58840470the last post of the thread creator was in 2013Quote from: jakem on December 26, 2013, 10:56:44 PMQuote from: Stunna on December 26, 2013, 10:45:49 PMSign an address with 3000 coins on it and that should be sufficient proof. Can't do that, but could sign a bunch of little addresses with that sum.  Will take me a little while to contact all people with investments.In return, I want a perma-link on your site to mine, with an apology to boot =DAfter this post the creator of the thread disappeared, it's been 10 years and today we're seeing someone who claims to be him, let's assume it's true, because you didn't tell the people on this forum that you wouldn't post on this forum anymore and you were disappearing from the forum ? Why didn't you resolve the scam accusations that were being made against your casino? And how are those people who were accusing your casino? what has changed in all these years that made you create another casino again and in the past your casino did not end up with a good reputation. How do you expect people to trust your casino since it has disappointed people in the past?honestly, I hope you can give a solid explanation about all this, the strangest thing about all this was that you used the name of a casino that already had a bad reputation in the past, it seems like you are someone else and didn't know anything, but I thought 999dice was an old casino with a good reputation, so I would like to ask the following: can you prove that you have been the owner of 999dice since 2013?",

A casino that is just a week old has amassed such followership with such number of registered members and already raking in millions of dollars as revenue. I was wondering how they did that without any promotional content, publicity and advertisement here. I checked and I can't see any campaign attached to their name here but what I could see from the link provided here is a casino similar in name which announcement thread was created 2013 with last activity 2014. While this casino was created just a week ago.So far from the comments and replies I have read here, is there any difference between this casino and the former? Because I see what happened before is about repeating itself if there is any relationship between them otherwise, the OP should come up plane and tell us or dissociate this casino from the other because the names looks similar. Maybe this could be of help because there is already an existing stigma on the previous casino with this name years back.Lastly, I checked for live online customer care service but I couldn't find any but rather it was a live stream Chat of members I could see and to access it, you must be registered first before doing anything else. Live customer care service should be made a priority for prospective clients in knowing more about your casino and services rendered.",

Someone already mentioned to the OP on how to get a good ANN and so that it will attract some gamblers and who knows, maybe this it out.But I do agree with the numbers, and I have doubts that they can have high user assuming that their sites is fairly new and not known. In any case, then goodluck, online casino are a niche and competition is very though. So for those who are really new in the game, they should have a less a good promotion here, and the best one is thru signature campaign.",

What your platform is offering is being already offered by other casinos with good promotional offers for us. I don't want you or your casino team to think that by just creating an ANN you would be able to divert our attention to your casino. It takes a lot of marketing strategy and promotional offers to become a number one casino or number 10 casino of our choice. Unless you have a certain marketing strategy in your business book, I don't think anyone would be interested in your casino for the time being . Since you have created an ANN without any images. I would suggest you to buy copper membership, as it will help you create an ANN that will look beautiful and also attract fellow forum member to check your announcement page. I do see the first reply on your thread suggest what I am suggesting you to do now. Do think about it.P.S: It doesn't look like your poll is working.",

They are claiming that they are licensed casino yet there’s no visible license available in their casino to verify it. Also their games is mostly a house games which typically a decentralized casino offers.Othe member concerns about the huge number of players is really alarming since their games are just typical yet their chat box shows bunch of spam post and probably chat gpt bot that spamming the chats to make the casino looks lively. All their games are available on popular casino house games.",
