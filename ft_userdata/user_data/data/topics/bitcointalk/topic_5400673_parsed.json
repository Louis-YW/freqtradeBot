  "content": "since 2021 I quite often make transactions or buy some items from my friends who have shops with payments using bitcoin or other altcoins. because in my area there are no shops that accept bitcoin payments in general. but this is not an obstacle for me and my friends as fellow cryptocurrency users. I happen to have many friends in my area who have various professions and all of them are already familiar with crypto and trading crypto as an additional income and investment.so I often transact with my friend using bitcoin.and a few days ago I have bought a wardrobe for my son and payment with bitcoin. because I bought it by chance from a friend of mine who also accepts digital money as payment. and a few weeks ago I also bought an SSD for my laptop but at that time I made a payment Not with bitcoin but using BNB. because my friend needed BNB that time.and it turns out that when are a shop there is no writing accepting payments with digital money. doesn't mean he doesn't accept it. but maybe he hasn't opened it publicly yet.because we can ask the store even though there is no writing accepting bitcoin but at least try asking. because I recently did it. ie ask a store that has absolutely no writing accepting payments with bitcoin. but it turned out that after I asked the shop owner directly, it was very coincidental that the shop owner also played crypto and he explained to me that he could also accept bitcoin as payment but specifically. he deliberately did not write because the reason turned out to be that I also just remembered that in my country bitcoin as a means of direct payment is not yet legal. and that's the reason the friend and shop owner I asked didn't write a post on his shop about accepting bitcoin payments.maybe friends here can also try it. and have you guys done it too and what items have you recently bought with bitcoin payments?How often do you transact in the real world with your bitcoin or digital money?",

In extremely rare circumstances I would use cash.I'm now waiting for my Bolt Card which should in theory allow me to do the same, paying with lightning by tapping with the card, and it would connect directly to my lightning node, and pay for the requested amount of Bitcoin. Note that even though this card is advertized to be used with CoinCorner, you can set it up to work directly with your lightning node.Of course most shops are still living with legacy merchant checkouts, but covid has accelerated a bit the usage of cashless checkouts, so I hope more stores start using BTCPayServer and similar checkouts, which works with the NFC card",

Because I also think that there are actually a lot of shop owners who are familiar with crypto or bitcoin in particular. But certain situations keep them from making the bulletin board accept crypto/bitcoin payments. Maybe I'll also try asking the shop owner if he knows crypto and accepts crypto as payment.",

You may find some places here and there on the internet that accept altcoins through payment processors which would give them the fiat equivalent right away into their bank accounts but never in real life.I've seen Tether be used for P2P trading too but that is not payment. For example I recently sold a tiny amount of bitcoin for Tether and then dumped it for fiat through P2P trading.",

But unfortunately, majority of the crypto holders do not have such facilities available. If I look at my area, I will hardly find anyone else who had heard the name of bitcoin.So it all depends on the options available. In my country,  a specialized technology called UPI has taken over the digital payments by storm and outperformed China in the number of digital payments and took number one spot. So in my country, crypto payment is not a very cost effective idea. So it's best to keep them as an investment.",

The only thing that I can use my Bitcoin directly is by paying my bills online using the local cryptocurrency wallet app but they are still converting it first to PHP it's literally not a direct transaction. I don't know if other countries' business establishment allows BTC as a direct payment. I remember that a coffee shop owned by my friend start to accept Bitcoin in 2017 and I love paying Bitcoin directly on it but he stop accepting when the price of Bitcoin dumped hard after reaching the first ATH to 20K. Until now he still didn't want to involve crypto in his business due to the loss that he got last time he accepts it and invested some of his shop profit.",

The number must be huge.Many merchants probably don't want to reveal that they accept crypto, because of some sort of \"crypto is a scam\" stigma, which might hurt their legitimacy. I would never ask any shop owner about whether or not he accepts crypto payments. Maybe I would feel embarrassed to ask.Anyway, I don't use BTC for daily payments, because I'm a hardcore HODLer and the amount of merchants accepting BTC in my town is close to zero. I know that without even asking them. The people in my town aren't tech savvy.",

But having bitcoin to spend with, I don't think so that they're so into it because the craze and hype are done.

Back in 2016/2017 I used bitcoins very often for online purchases, like computer hardware. My biggest purchase was a new bicycle after I sold all my CSGO skins for bitcoins. Using digital money seems a bit easier for me, because I can get rid of my fiat money. PayPal is probably the most used for me when doing online purchases. My goal is basically pay with fiat and save with cryptos.",

If you want to use the bolt card with CoinCorner, yes, of course you need KYC. But the card itself is simply an NFC card.
