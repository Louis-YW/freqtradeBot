Not only will this impact the bitcoin mining industry, this is a game-changer for energy usage itself. Right now, our most efficient nuclear power plants are still laughably wasteful, that is why nuclear fusion is a sought after form of energy resource for decades now. The claim that such feats have been made is not only monumental, but with anecdotal evidence this could mean greater improvements in the quality of living of everyone who lives on this planet. Of course there's a dire consequence to this too, as this could easily rile people to use more powerful nuclear weapons should the threat of a third world war be imminent, but I'm hopeful. I think we're on the right track here. First it will be the world, then it would be bitcoin.",

      "body": "Its obviously a lab test with two decades old technology. Not a ready made commercial power plant. They proved a theory that was going for more than six decades, NOW that its proven, the engineers need to figure out ways to deploy it. You are NOT going to generate power continuously by shooting lasers to little containers, so check the proposals for fusion reactors that have been going around. Before there was no evidence that even if they built it, it would work. Now they have it. Yeah, it may be a few decades away, but its happening. Oh and they also tested materials in the process that can further benefit this.The weapons have existed since the 40ies so there is nothing new about that (except a bit more refinement to the weapons). It was: To produce more energy than what is used into it that has been the holy grail of this matter, and that milestone has been achieved.The first fission reaction was done in a lab in 1942, count the years it took to have commercial nuclear fission power plants since that event.",

If one has been following the Fusion Power Saga for any length of time they would know that no single country holds a 'lead' in development of it nor can ever monopolize it.As for China et al reverse engineering ANY advanced technology, knowing how to do something is only a small part of what is involved in reproducing it for themselves. It's a matter of all the industrial infrastructure having to exist for making the multitude of bits & pieces required. A prime example of that is the lithography gear used to produce IC's especially cutting edge ones. There is a reason why China has no foundries that are able to produce chips at the 7nm node using home built equipment: They would have to 1st build up far too many other industries first for them to be able to do it.",

If it were possible to use curved mirrors to use sunlight to heat steam inside a boiler, then scavenge exhaust water vapor inside a closed loop system to recirculate moisture. That could be a good blueprint for low carbon emission and long term reliable energy generation. While solar panels might last 20 to 40 years under optimal conditions. There are known cases of steam engines having lifespans greater than 100 years.Metals science has advanced from the days when steam locomotives were the backbone of trade. Its possible enough progress has been made to completely replace coal as the primary energy solution for steam power.A steam engine that needs only water and sunlight could be a decent concept worth pursuing, at least for some applications.The next stage would be a simple battery format with a longer lifespan than current lead acid or lithium cells.",

Energy prices have become a huge problem in the world over the last few years. Its not only the crypto community that is struggling with rising energy prices, the whole economy relys on affordable energy. The big question is now how fast that can be replicated in large scale and be rolled out for industrial and consumer needs. This could change a lot for the green energy approach as well. More and more fossil fuels could be left behind to use the most ecological friendly energy sources. Another issue is going to be the accessibility of the technology. Can it be used by other countries free of charge or will it be expensive to get access. Hopefully it's not going to take too long and will make energy cheap for all of us.",

So obviously the energy production it can do is massive. However I have seen a lot of articles which tell that it's not that happy a thing. These tests were done only in a lab environment altogether.

As few folks said, its gonna take around couple of decades. I know it's good news, it will help control many things around the world from clean resources to zero carbon emission and much more. However, I am wondering what we are doing for the problems at hands? I read on the forum somewhere that people think this will help get rid off Russia issues who is not supplying the oil ands tuff. But that's not how NIF is going to work. There is still time for its actual use case projects. The infrastructure, the controlling and distribution will take lot of time.",
