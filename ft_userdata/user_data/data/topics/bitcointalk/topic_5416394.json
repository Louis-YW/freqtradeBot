Cameroon Green looks like his replacement.- Indian team is facing injuries among bowlers. Bumrah is already ruled out and now some reports are coming that Deepak Chahar is also struggling with his fitness (not confirmed tho), Shami should join the team soon in Australia.",

Jokes apart I'm sure we are not losing em and in some way, they are allowed to reserve their spot, even if they are late to submit their entry fees",

Don't hesitate to recheck these selections again I have already subscribed to the thread so any update posted here I get notification. Still now following cricket because of the work load for other things but I am sure once the WC starts I will spend good amount of times to watch the important matches. Those picks are kind of insurance in case I miss to pick once the matches start. I will surely revise most of the days.
