I guess my age helped A LOT in easily grasping the concept of non-tangible assets/goods; because I grew up playing video games with their own tradable items and currencies and such. Based on the older folks around me, they couldn't grasp paying for literally anything digital. The fact that people buy things that they can't hold is so mind-boggling to them.3. I mean, literally everyone wishes they learned about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies earlier lol.",

I will say am not too old to still learn about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, at this stage in life my brain is still open to learn and accumulate new things faster. Am still learning though and I won’t stop because I now know the benefits in it.3. I would say this can also be my early age, everybody will always wished they started years back.

This is why many older people have a better understanding of the 'rona scam and vaccination mania, and don't just accept government and pharma' propaganda.It is cool to see old and older people in bitcoin. It is not something common though. I am also aware that mothers invlove in bitcoin too. Some of the older folks and women in bitcoin are here just for the sake of their children. I said this because an 80years old man has actually retired from work and relieving his pension and other benefits? Of what use is investment again if not to leave something for their children. In other ways, old people could be the real users of bitcoin as a currency because they like to practice everything as long as they live.Bitcoin is slightly older than a decade, so the question of at what age is somewhat ambitious. You could ask at what year.  I am sure not one at the age of 30 embraced bitcoin at the age of 10.But for emphasis purposes, old people scale through in some investment schemes because they better understand scam and can differentiate same with genuineness. A young dude may pay less attention to details, and that cannot be said for an old man who truly understands the principle of money.",

      "body": "I tried explaining Bitcoin to a relative who is in the 70+ category, but he was all about it being a scam, volatility being dangerous and fiat being great because the state has control over it. But I think it's not as much about age as it is about a person. As for me, I started hearing about Bitcoin when I was a teenager, and while I was open to it (not negative), I wasn't very interested. I don't think age played a big part, I think it's more about context. When you're a teen, you still live with parents, probably don't have a job and much money of your own which you could invest or experiment with. But some people are in the same situation when they are in their 20s or even 30s sometimes. So it's about the experiences and knowledge more than about age to me.I'm very surprised that Jet Cash is almost 80, btw. I sort of always perceive most forum members as relatively young (as millennials). But I'm happy that this assumption is wrong and that there are people of various age who are interested in cryptos.",

This is where I created my Bitcointalk account, Coins PH, Blockchain wallet, etc. But the problem is that I had no clue on what Bitcoin is really all about. That time, BTC was under $600 and since I only earned very low that time as a guy from a 3rd world country, I can’t afford it. Only if I hadn’t put my money into network marketing back then, I could have at least throw it into BTC. Because of my poor decision, I ignored and forgot Bitcoin for more than 3 years. The reason why I got back into BTC is that not only it crosses $10k for the first time that year (2017), but I’ve seen some people on Facebook have made money very well in BTC and cryptocurrencies (especially airdrops and bounties) and the rest is history.",

Hold your Bitcoin and wait for the winter ending, because the more negative news you read, the more chance you will lose your faith in Bitcoin and will sell it.People can start to learn Bitcoin anytime they are ready. With the Internet, free access to many resources, they can learn a lot in short time if they want to learn. Age is not a matter or barrier against their Bitcoin learning.",

It means things are not completely strange to me, and I could be more open-minded about them. Especially in my country, I must say Bitcoin sells more to the younger generation than to the grandpas and grandmas. My grandparents didn't even know how to use a smart phone, much less a personal computer, didn't use credit cards, didn't have any inkling about PayPal, and so on. So it would be too hard for them to embrace the concept of Bitcoin. And they are also too preoccupied with the things that they care about to learn so alien a thing as Bitcoin.",
