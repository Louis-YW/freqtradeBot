  "content": "Alik BakhshiNational interests of Russia     In the speeches of President Putin on the international theme, one can often hear a phrase that, it seems to me, has become sacred - \"Russia's national interests\". Usually it sounds with reproach to the countries of the West, which, in Putin's opinion, should not only take into account Russia's national interests, but also respect them. True, Putin did not bother to disclose what the national interests of Russia really consist in, but judging by the military-political steps taken by Russia, they clearly go beyond its state borders, which is confirmed by the Russian invasion of Georgia and Ukraine, followed by the withdrawal of their territories. Thus, Russia's national interests inevitably face the national interests of other countries, and are defined only as aggression. Ukraine wanted to enter the European Union, but it turns out that such an desire is an independent country, violates the legitimate interests of another country - Russia. By the way, Putin said that Russia will not allow such actions by the neighboring country. It turns out that if an independent neighboring country, for example Finland, wants to join NATO, then Russia will have to wait for a military invasion, because maybe Finland too is falling under the legitimate interests of Russia.     I did not make a reservation, Moscow really believes that Russia's national interests are both its legitimate interests. This is confirmed by the words of Foreign Minister Lavrov: \"The project of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline affects the legitimate interests of Russia.\" http://Http://tass.ru/politika/1582470    It turns out that if a gas pipeline is laid between the independent countries of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan by the Caspian Sea, this action is a violation of Russian laws. It is possible that the construction of gas pipelines in general is a violation of international laws. In this case, laying a gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey on the bottom of the Black Sea is also not legal. Or, maybe, Russia asked permission from Georgia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria? Like Russia's request to the Black Sea countries with such a request was not observed. Hence the natural conclusion: all countries that were colonies of the Russian Empire, or as Moscow calls the post-Soviet space, fall under the legitimate interests of Russia. In other words, any independent decision of these countries, whether political or economic, may be in the field of Russian legislation. Exceptions are Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which have issued themselves as members not only of the EU, but also of NATO. This fact points to the fact that Russia's legitimate interests began to operate with the appearance of Putin in the Kremlin; Under President Yeltsin, the demand for observance of Russia's legitimate interests in the post-Soviet space did not come from Moscow. Here Ukraine did not have time to hurry and was violated the Russian laws, overthrowing its president, Yanukovych. Thus, the removal of the president from power in any independent country, but the former colony of Russia, is a violation of Russia's legitimate interests. I suspect that they did not know about any legitimate interests of Russia in Ukraine when they started the Maidan, for which they received punishment in the form of the loss of part of their country. In short, ignorance of laws does not absolve from responsibility.   In fact, Putin should present a specific list of Russia's legitimate national interests, so that neighboring independent countries do not violate Russian law and pay for this territory.   Undoubtedly, each state has its own national interests, however, if the state was once part of the Russian Empire, then its national interests are inferior to Russia's national interests, which are legitimate. Dot!  The result - if your neighbor is Russia, then you can be either a vassal or an enemy.   08/18/17.",

Zelensky is way worse than Putin when you consider the short time he has been in office. The difference is that when you believe in Jesus, and attempt to act righteously, like Putin, the bad things you have done are forgiven by Jesus.You can search Youtube and find at least several videos where Putin condemns anti-God, corrupt behavior. But you can't find Zelensky claiming anything like this. All you can find for Zelensky is lewd and crude comedian videos, or all the bad things he is doing in the war. And he doesn't seem to have changed to be in on God's side.You are supporting the wrong side. This makes you an accomplice with Zelensky in all the wicked things he is doing. And if you don't change and believe in Jesus, and prove your faith by what you write/do, you will get the punishment you are talking about for Putin.",

Douglas Macgregor: Is the Ukraine War Lost?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ucxTCe2x6EDouglas Macgregor is a decorated combat veteran, the author of five books, a PhD, and a defense and foreign policy consultant. He was commissioned in the Regular Army in 1976 after 1 year at VMI and 4 years at West Point. In 2004, Macgregor retired with the rank of Colonel. In 2020, the President appointed Macgregor to serve as Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, a post he held until President Trump left office. He holds an MA in comparative politics and a PhD in international relations from the University of Virginia.Macgregor is widely known inside the U.S., Europe, Israel, Russia, China and Korea for both his leadership in the Battle of 73 Easting, the U.S. Army's largest tank battle since World War II, and for his ground breaking books on military transformation: Breaking the Phalanx (Praeger, 1997) and Transformation under Fire (Praeger, 2003). Macgregor's recommendations for change in Force Design and \"integrated all arms-all effects\" operations have profoundly influenced force development in Israel, Russia and China. In 2010, Macgregor traveled to Seoul, Korea to advise the ROK Ministry of Defense on force design. In 2019, Transformation under Fire was selected by Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi, Chief of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), as the intellectual basis for IDF transformation. His fifth book, Margin of Victory: Five Battles that Changed the Face of Modern War from Naval Institute Press is available in Chinese, as well as, English and will soon appear in Hebrew....",
