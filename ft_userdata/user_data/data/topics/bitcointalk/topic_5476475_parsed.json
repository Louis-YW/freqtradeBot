If I am gambling, it is just like I am wasting money on bear while paying for my friends to drink with me, but the fun I have and the good moment made it not as a loss. I see gambling this way.If a friend is letting you know how he loss,  always try to encourage him and tell him not to be using the amount of money he can not afford to lose to bet. He should not see gambling as a way of making money.",

      "body": "Actually our financial level are not same and losses among gamblers shouldn't be compared in terms of we trying to be or showing sympathy. If we wish to show sympathy we should just show it and not doing so based on comparison of the amount a gambler had lost to gambling.I could be showing sympathy to someone that had lost $10k to gambling not considering another that have lost just $1k, unknowingly to me the guy with the $1k loss was the last cash in his possession home and abroad whereas the fellow that had lost a $10k has so much in abundance in his wallet savings.In all we do as gamblers we should resist the urge of gambling amount of cash we can't afford to lose, calculate your income percentage that you can affordably spend on gambling and stick to it to avoid seeking sympathy from others.",

It can be difficult not to empathize with them, though. At least for me, it is kind of difficult to distinguish a real gambler who has lost a significant amount from other who is only faking it all for show. Even if we assume most of them are being paid or are expected to by paid for streaming their gambling sessions, as far as I understand, part of their wager is still money which belongs to them (while other part is provided by the casino, to prolong the session). We could even make a case for those streamers who do not have sponsorships yet and start gambling with their own funds, it gotta be heartbreaking to see who one of those get their balance go away from their casino wallet, as trey try to make a name on the internet by themselves.",

      "body": "OP, this topic does not belong here, you should move it to gambling discussion.Anyone that feels he has lost heavily and is showing that on his face should quit gambling because he can't control his gambling activities, and this also shows that the person has used more than the amount that he can afford to loose to gamble. No matter how small that amount is, if it is going to make you look pale or in a bad mood, it means that amount is too big for you to gamble with.Gambling should be seen as fun and not for profit and anyone that knows this, will live a healthy gambling life. I don't normally have sympathy for anyone that have lost big because it was an act of greed that led them to such big loss and nobody needs to give them any money due to sympathy. Instead you should advice them on how to be a responsible gambler and let them not see gamble as a get rich quick scheme.",

We can not deny the fact that most of the gamblers who are losing money are actually losing their heads to those red lines. We can not expect high returns everytime we gamble online, not everyday is ours. If we are losing then someone is winning and vice versa is also true. The only thing that can make use good gambler is to self aware about the limits. I have mentioned this many times, I am usually closing the Website immediately if I’m getting losses in a long streak. I know that’s the only exit strategy when we work online. More than that it is always important to keep only fixed amount of money on casinos while starting a gameplay. This helps to restrict (a little) to go for second round if we have lost it all.",

But since we are all humans with emotions and feelings, a loss is a loss irrespective of how big or small it is. We would unconsciously pick one of the hundreds of emotions available to the human biology to display. QuoteThey are basically to believe one who lost $20 has lost more to them who looses $10.The lies we say to ourselves to feel better. Only a beginner gambler does this.

You need to know how much you are making per week or per month and stick to a certain amount only for gambling, but don't forget that you will probably lose the money, that's the most guaranteed outcome when you are gambling, so you will be a stupid person if you risk more than you are ready to lose, because you should know better.I have gotten past having sympathy for gamblers that lose money, I might sound like a wicked person but it's foolish of you to want to make money doing nothing and you believe it will be that easy, that's why choosing gambling as source of income is a wrong thing to do.",
