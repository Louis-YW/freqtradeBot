It is better than clicking on strange email, then curiously click on strange links and hope that your computer won't be infected with hazardous elements from hackers. It is unrealistic and risky to believe that Internet Security software or Antivirus software will be able to protect you against those threats completely.Your habit when using Internet is more important than any AV software.",

I do a lot of browsing almost all day, and this is why I believe that I am still not completely safe from scammers and hackers, not even with anti-malware software and antivirus installed on my PC. This is why I don't store my assets on my PC, I don't have any wallet installed on my PC, and even my files are stored offline.  With a PC, you can never be sure of what could happen at any time,  it doesn't matter how careful you are.",

Last time I got a link from an inlaw that came back from another country and I Immediately clicked the link. I thought since it came from him and because he is coming from a developed nation, it was safe, I later discovered that they were scammers. It is not good to click on popups whether you are trading or not because scammers are everywhere. Don't click on any link regardless of how close a person is to you, his account might have been hacked. Like OP said we should calm down and act slow when we receive these popups.",

Last time I got a link from an inlaw that came back from another country and I Immediately clicked the link.You made me laugh. How can you be sure which country scammers are from? They can tell you thousands of fairy tales to win your trust. In addition, people are the same everywhere. Everywhere, in both developed and developing countries, scammers seek to deceive. Think: who knows your email address? Create complex logins for mail so that it is difficult to parse them.The creation of several emails is not a problem for those who like to subscribe everywhere, someday dreaming of getting a good offer. While people themselves value this hope, not to mention the fact that some gullible people click on the sentences sent from scammers, the threat of hacking and theft of data will hang over them all the time.But if a person knows that no one can write to him, he will never fall into the trap of hackers.",

Those that have been said is just like a script that they send to the emails that they've got in their database. Because it's not just one or two emails that I've received with exactly the same content for those emails so, I already got what it is all about. They scare the hell you out that they've got everything but don't believe it and don't click any linking sites that they've got at the end of their message because when you do then that's going to be the start of the disaster.

Its good OP brought this to the public notice because alot of people fall for such tricks I believe it will help lots of people especially newbies who are not knowledgeable enough.

Lesson need to learn from this is never share your private email to public to avoid such thing which can cause big stress to us. But if happens that same situation came the same what OP mention and what you stated better ignore it especially if they can't show something to back up their claims. Maybe take a action if there's harmful elements release and this is the time where you need to go to proper authority to file necessary action.",

Prevention, not cure, rules.Also, you don't need to indicate your only mailing address everywhere. It makes more sense to have several and use each to perform certain tasks: 1 - to communicate with family and friends, 2 - for work, 3 - for other tasks (for example, online shopping and registering in social networks), and so on. Thus, you can weed out the extra flow of spam and secure yourself.Better yet, have a separate PC to work with crypto and for entertainment and everyday tasks. It is not necessary to buy a powerful PC and it is possible to assemble a PC from old hardware to interact only with crypto.Regarding the letter that OP writes about: you need to be more prudent and not succumb to emotions when you see similar letters or messages.
