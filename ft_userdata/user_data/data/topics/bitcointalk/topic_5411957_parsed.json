  "content": "I'm tellin' you, my peeps, ever since I started that thread with my rules for requesting post history reviews, I haven't been able to keep up!  But that's made me curious about merit statistics, which I never really gave much thought to in the past.  Recently I saw this and was chagrined to the wind:Here's my issue: I visited BPIP and Ninjatastic Space looking for who the banned members are that I merited, and if that info exists on either of those sites, I'm totally missing it.  But I know for damn sure there are bigger brains than mine in these parts, and I'd like to tickle said brains for an answer.  The problem is that I've browsed a number of people's post histories without giving a single merit, and I'm generally careful about handing out merits to newbies unless I'm sure there's no plagiarism involved--I even reported one of my requestees for plagiarizing something, but I can't remember if I'd already given him a merit or two.  I don't think so, but that still wouldn't account for me being at the top of that ignominious list.And yeah, I get that it's data for the last 180 days, but still.Thanks in advance, you big-brained brethren....and sistren.",

The stat really reflects, out of all those sMerits you awarded over the last 180 days, those that were given to accounts that were then or are now banned.",

Yes, yes, a thousand times yes, my hypercortical number cruncher!  I appreciate the answer--it was exactly what I was looking for, though if I'd given the whole thing about 20 minutes of thought I probably would have arrived at the answer.  I'm very aware that naim027 is appealing his ban and also that I was helping him rank up.  My initial thought was that it was a member who'd recently requested a post history review, and I'm relieved that it isn't.All right, I think that'll do it for this thread.  I'mma lock this bizotch up like the storage locker I used to live in and my thanks to you again.  I would merit you if I could.<<Goddamn it, Theymos!!!!>>",
