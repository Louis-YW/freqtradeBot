Because ALL sites I’ve checked, it’s always just starting in 2017…It's a bit odd...fees were dirt cheap so no one tracked them.  and blocks were big in 2016  25 coins were huge compared to fees.btc was never higher than 1300 usd 2009 to 2016we had 1 peak event in 2013 and 1300 usd price was brief.in 2016 we were always under 1000 usd so fees were 40x cheaper then today and 19x cheaper than 2017 .also high fees started up in early 2017 as there was no LN and only legacy addresses maybe legacy segwit.most of us did btc to ltc to move wealth if fees were any kind of an issue.I don't program so I am don't goinng to look at fees in 2016 or 2015 to make a chart up.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocksabove will go all the way back.so I searched blockshttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/399999date-------------  block number-------   fee02/25/2016........ 399,999............... 0.2052 .... worth  87  usd02/25/2016.........400,000------------ 0.3334..... worth 141 usdif you want to do the work the info is on that link",

And to conclude: For earlier bull markets, substantial fees didn't seem to be a problem  (as only 2013 / 2014 should be relevant here), in opposition to the crypto winter late 2014 - late 2016). But what we can see in the chart from Jochen Hoenicke, even in January 2017, there was substantial weight in the Mempool. So probably, this increase has been rather sharp end of 2016, probably?",

As far as I know, it was empty most of the time.I have some related data though, see Bitcoin block data available in CSV format: size.txt shows which blocks weren't full. If blocks aren't full, that means mempool gets emptied every time. There's more data on fees, either in sats on in dollars.",
