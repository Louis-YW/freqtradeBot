  "content": "Way back when...TV was still monochrome and NASA had some nazis in the basement working out the apollo missions, there was a pyramid scheme that people would play for fun.  Everyone knew the score, nobody really expected to make money.They called it \"The Airplane Game\" and here's how it worked.There would be <i>x</x> amount of passengers.  Usually around 10, but it could be 5 or 5000.  It doesn't matter.There would be a handful of \"stewardesses\".  (It was the 50s.)There was a co-pilot.There was a pilot.When you wanted to be a \"passenger\", you would pay one of the stewardesses a flat fee.  If it was too high, you could try to get a better rate from another stewardess.  More often than not, you couldn't but it wasn't against the rules.  The stewardess kept half, with 20% going to the co-pilot and 30% going to the pilot.So far, a basic pyramid scheme.  But here's the part that gets interesting...There can only be so many passengers.  So, if the \"plane\" is \"full\", you have to buy your seat from a passenger who is already there.  And you have to pay the stewardess, too.  Who has to pay the co-pilot and pilot.  Suddenly, it's not the worst deal to be a stewardess on the plane.So, how does one become a stewardess?  Why, they buy it of course.  From the co-pilot.  Who gives 60% to the captain.  But if there's already a limit of stewardess, you have to convince a stewardess to sell you their position.  Which is a separate deal.And how do you get to be a co-pilot?  Same as a stewardess, of course.Captains are the same.Like I said, it was a social game.  Usually very low stakes...somewhere around a dollar to be a passenger, no more than 10$ to buy your way to the top.  And more often than not, when a \"captain\" would \"retire\", they would \"buy a ticket\" as a passenger and start over.Why am I telling you all this?  What can an obscure social game from 70 years ago where they best case scenario is breaking even possibly have to do with crypto?Glad you asked.  I'll tell you...Anyone who has been around long enough has a nice collection of shitcoins that are worth exactly nothing.  They'll never be traded on any exchange ever again and even if you held the entire supply it would be worth nothing.  But we have them.  We collect them.  We cherish them because we're fucking weirdos.So, this thread, if anyone even notices, is here for people who have bags upon bags of shitcoins to have a little fun.  Comment with your preferred shitcoin, maybe what each \"position\" costs, etc etc and maybe someone out there will want to play.  Maybe we can take some long forgotten failures *cough* sprouts *cough* and have a little fun.Even if you win, you'll never make any money.  And there's about a 50/50 chance you're just throwing coins into a void.But why not?  What are you going to do?  Hold that 808coin until you die?  Impress girls with your massive LAMBO balance?  How many Ember is a pizza these days?",
