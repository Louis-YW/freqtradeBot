      "body": "Important announcement: Conclusion of First CampaignDear Pactus Community,First and foremost, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to all of you. Your remarkable engagement and dedication towards Pactus Blockchain has been truly inspiring.Within less than two months, we have successfully onboarded 500 validators, a significant milestone that we are truly proud to announce. This level of dedication and enthusiasm demonstrates the strength of our expanding community and the potential of the Pactus blockchain.Despite this incredible progress, we're not ready for the Mainnet launch yet. It's a complex process, and we prioritize getting things right over rushing them. many important development tasks to complete, including Soft and Hard fork tests essential for the stability and security of our blockchain network.Additionally, While our community has already grown significantly, we plan to reinforce it even more. A strong, active community is vital to the success of any decentralized network.Now, announce our second campaign for initial staking on the Mainnet launch. We encourage everyone to join the Testnet as a validator until October 1st. We will randomly select 100 validators to receive 40 PAC for initial staking at the Mainnet launch. This lottery is based on the block hashes, ensuring full transparency and open for examination. We will soon share the list of validators eligible for the first campaign, who will each receive 80 PAC for initial staking on the Mainnet launch.Thank you once again for your support and belief in Pactus. Together, we will build a better future for blockchain technology and decentralized networks.",
