The most recent case to be able to do that can be mentioned Shiba meme, the people who invested in shiba last year were the ones who made huge profits, if I remember correctly, Shiba has a growth rate of thousands %. That's just an example, I'm not saying you should invest in Shiba.Finding such projects is difficult and sometimes takes a bit of luck and no one can tell you what coin it is so don't believe anyone if they say they know what it is.",

If you find such a project then don't hesitate to invest in their coins because they are the ones who have a higher chance to be one of those good-to-be-true coins or tokens. Recommended that you bought them at their pre-sales which gonna give you lower price ever. But always take note not to jump on any investment without taking some proper research and reviewing your total budget to avoid some huge problems.",

Is this even possible?.It depends what altcoin you are going to invest to and how long you will hold it. I believe it's possible but it's hard to spot what altcoin is going to give you that return. Just think of $BNB, it was less than a dollar few years ago and look at its price now. No one would've thought it will reach its current price now and I don't know if there is someone able to hold and sold when it hit 3-digit price. Making it possible would feel like hitting the jackpot on the lottery.",

Once I made a big profit from investing in altcoin, but the amount of profit was not too big as you say, but still, that is a big profit for me. But if you use that $100 in bitcoin, you can have a big chance to make a big profit, but I would not say that will be $7,000 because that will depend on how much you invest and how much the bitcoin price is at that time.",

It's probably less than 1% since not all people are making profit and you could be scammed since there's a lot of exit scam.A legit project wouldn't promise anything like invest $100 get $200 or 2%/day and such, that's what too good to be true project and 99% you will get scammed.",

Cryptocurrencies are famous for such huge investment returns, but not many and not everyone can be so lucky. Such returns are still possible today when you invest in the right projects, but finding such projects is extremely difficult and I think no one would be willing to share it with you if they find.",

Investment in altcoins is really risky, you can make huge profits but you can also easily lose all your money that's why you have to be very careful, if you are planning to invest and you want to have rest of mind then it's better you invest in bitcoin, if you invest in bitcoin, your investment is safe and you will also have rest of mind, just that you should be able to hold for long term, but investing in Altcoins is very risky which I don't always encourage.",

So the chances of that happening again is very slim in the foreseeable future.You'll have to pick the right project, invest in it, wait for a few years and boom your $100 will become $7k.Remember ETH once was $9, and now it is $1.7k.If you had bought 10 eth for $90 back in the day, you would have had $17k staring at you in you wallet.",

Is this even possible?.That is definitely possible. To turn 100$ into 7000$ means a x70 of your initial investment. That is quite a huge number of course but still it is possible. In order to achieve returns like that you have to take a pretty huge risk though in my opinion because you won't get a x70 of your investment on altcoin projects that are already big and established like Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and so on. You have to pick a new and upcoming project for that. This also means of course that the risk of of a loss of your investment even all of your investment is very much possible. There are so many new projects out there that it is very hard to pick the right one.",

It is possible, but the chance is very minimal that you will buy the right coin or token and be able to sell it at the right time. This is a bad investment strategy. You can buy Kusama or CHIA and wait 2-3 years, but it's a risky investment.",

Is this even possible?.Yes it is possible, but you have to be very lucky to find that project early and then invest on it before other does and then it magically grows in the next couple of months, specially if this happens on a bull market. And perhaps this is true maybe in the ICO boom in 2017, that is a bull year and every projects turn into gold. Even during a airdrop it's going to be worth like $100 or even more. So just imagine if a airdrop can be worth like that what more is the project that is more hype than others?",

Is this even possible?.It will only take x70 to reach your goal while there’s a lot of token that grow more than that to astronomically x1000+ since the initial listing of there tokens. You can possibly earn this kind of profit by participating on launchpad IDO and not through buying on exchange especially on huge exchange like Binance because tokens is usually pump big time before the listing on exchange.I experience this kind of profit during 2017 ICO by investing on startup coin that turn into massive pump after listing. Blockchain token like Waves, Ethereum and Neo are the tokens that I bought during initial stage that gave me a very huge profit in crypto.",

These days, slower but surely is the thing in the market but if you're looking for that type of gain.You'll have to take a guess and gamble on the unknown altcoins and it could be in the meme coins or any other that you're not aware of.
