And this is not to offend, but to make sure other bidders have a fair bidding experience (there were cases in the past when dubious newbie accounts bid on an auction and didn't pay etc.). So nothing personal, just something I noticed needed to be added to OP.It seems to be your first auction but given you collected quite some merit and your account isn't a newbie account so please be welcomed to bid in this auction.",
