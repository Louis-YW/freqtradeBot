He is partly right, at first it sounds strange to the uninitiated and the media have made it sound like something that is linked to scams and organised crime. Besides, bitcoin can help you to be more financially free, but regulations can affect the environment a lot, especially if we think that most people buy and sell bitcoin on centralised exchanges.But hey, let the OP enjoy his enthusiasm, I guess he will moderate his enthusiasm over time.",

As I said, I don't see it that way, but it is well known that it is the way you described it, but as I mentioned above, I see bitcoin as a freedom against the state, where the individual does not ask permission from banks or anyone to move their money to whoever wants it and nobody, the interesting thing about bitcoin is that purpose it is a tool to be further explored over time.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
