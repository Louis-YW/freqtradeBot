You are already spamming the forum for having 2 active thread with same purpose. Creating new thread will just create more opportunities for user to spam your thread with same opinion comment. The power of the community is very limited and you should convince chips.gg for your case and not us if you want to receive your money.The only thing we can do is to create a flag against the casino and put a negative trust on it. But it will need a very solid evidence like that since they are accusing you for violation of there ToS. We should wait for there response and be patient. Ignoring your concern for a period of time will only mean a red flag. They banned me from live support, they don't respond to my e-mails. This is the only place I can contact @ChipsGg.I was only able to contact them here 2 times and it was thanks to this community. Although none of their answers make sense, at least I'm in touch.My aim is not to spam, it is for this community to see the truth and be on the side of the right.In this case exactlyQuoteAlso impressive job at responding to almost everything but the parts they know are indefensible",
