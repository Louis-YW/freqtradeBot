I am expecting bitcoin to go beyond $25000 in first quarter of 2024.You do not have to bother yourself about it, or you bought bitcoin with high price and expecting the price to increase to the price you bought it? The best advice is to never yet sell your coin because bitcoin will get to $23000 one day again which I think won't be long, it will even surpass that price.I will advice your to just hold your coins.",

We're now in $17k and that's just a few grand away for being at that price.But wherever we're going with the price, it's expected to be on that line going up as it just came from a huge decrease.",

But for investors or those who like to save in the long term, they still have to rely on time if they want better profits in the future. Because a slight increase was not what they expected now.QuoteAs the trend remains largely incremental, the token is believed to maintain a steep upswing to regain its price. The question is which tokens will maintain the sharp rise at this time? Because I don't see a sharp increase in any token if Bitcoin doesn't increase sharply in the near future. And the market won't look good if Bitcoin's growth continues to be very slow from now on.",

      "body": "Bitcoin will remain stable on the currently price range or at even lower levels while this bearish market lasts. To hit the 23,000$ once again we need to leave the bearish market first. Then the correct question is, will the bearish season be ended by the first quadrimester of 2023?Personally, I don't think so, because we are too close to this time period. Meanwhile, the news don't look good for crypto enthusiasts. There are too many scams going on around involving big companies of the sector and huge money, the world is still being affected by a war and traditional markets are still profitable for speculators who are taking advantage of increased interest rates. Most likely things will start improving here from the end of 2023 on (Q3-Q4).",

I am not saying that 23k will be easy to reach though, it will be a tough one considering how hard it is already with the current situation.We could always end up with a great deal of increase in price later on, it doesn't have to be Q1, and it could be anything else. I hope that people will realize that it's going to take a while, maybe it could be tomorrow too, bitcoin is a volatile littler bugger and it could be 23k tomorrow very easily if we all wanted to, but at the same time that is not realistic and I am expecting at least end of Q1 if it ever happens.",

Investors are getting smarter, and the market is also getting harder to deal with investors.You said from the initial that nobody knows or can predict the price of Bitcoin in future, so i believe that the price of Bitcoin is rotational, and since the price is rotational, their is every tendency that the price of will experience more bullish in 2023 than 2022, and we should understand that the price of Bitcoin accelerating is dependable by the investors, so therefore the price lies in the hands of investors which can be determined by the demands and the supply in cryptocurrency market.",

QuoteWill it reach or cross above $20,000 in Q1 2023?Indeed it is somehow stabilizing at the current price range but it is hard to tell whether its market value will be able to break $20k before this year end or on the early quarter of next year but for sure everyone is hoping for such thing to occur. As everyone knows, Bitcoin halving would happen in 2024 which is why it is more believed that the market price of Bitcoin would be more likely to break ATH once again by that time but ofcourse it the market would recover as early as possible, that would be better 'coz if it would need another year of no uptrend, there is a bigger tendencies that its market price could be easily pulled down by factors affecting its demand.",

It could be in the second quarter which is also based on my observation Bitcoin price increase until 3rd quarter.  I think that time most commonly Bitcoin increases the price. So IMO, the chances of a Bitcoin price that will reach that amount might unlikely happen.",

In the case of btc, this might be the reason why btc can reach a really high price because people don't know what's coming but they just continuously put their money in it because they believe that what btc showed in the past can repeat. It wasn't only limited there but the main reason on why people buy btc is because of its technology.So, don't think that being unpredictable is a problem. If I will have my own prediction about btc I think yes. $23k for btc is very easy. We have been on $20k levels before, a lot of times and January is a month where an increase is usually spotted.",
