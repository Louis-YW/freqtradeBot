  "content": "Anytime anything has a down market like this and for its first major bear market I always like to think that there is an opportunity afoot, or at least that there could be a chance it would go back up again in the future. Certainly this could be a great gamble! But not as much if you focus on accumulation of some of the most popular NFTs that had great volume as well as price stability. I haven't even checked the markets reccently but I have just been having this thought today. I have a prediction that the NFT market will go back up, some day maybe even up to what it was or perhaps even to new all time highs, and that if you do take a gamble with NFTs right now I think one day you could have a huge payout. Which NFTs am I talking about? I have no idea, the market is so unpredictable but I would place a bet on it that one day the NFT markets will bounce back and I think there is a tremendous opportunity right now. Bored apes for sure right now or cyber punks are probably a great buy.....",

      "body": "Yeah, when the markets stagnate or go downhill, it can be a good chance to take some smart risks for those willing.  Bored Apes and CyberPunks are indeed some of the big names in NFTs now. They've gotten a lot of attention, so it'll be cool to see how they do long term.  But you gotta remember the whole NFT thing could lose steam over time like some fads before and  these new markets are shaky, so smart thinking is needed with NFTs, it's wise to approach the market with a measured strategy and diversify your investments. That way you can try for the chances but also protect if things drop.By the way, I don't think this topic is really about gambling, so maybe it's best to move it to a suitable board.",

      "body": "The hype around NTFs died as fast as they came... many believe it was outright bubble. Even though I don't share in that sentiment, the signs are high. I wouldn't venture into this bet instead, I can use the funds for this to buy Bitcoin against the anticipated bull run. It is all about making money and one have to be wise about the choices. Until NFTs return,  no need to gamble with it as the probability is very low",

      "body": "Does this post really fit in gambling discussion board?The truth is that I have never being a fan of NFT right when the hype was still on, although I did manage to get a few probably two to four different types and I couldn’t sell any of them, unlike tokens/coins that I can sell anytime I like as long as there is liquidity and an exchange for the token but for NFT it’s not like that.All trends will surely comeback at one point or another but the issue is which particular project will still be standing strong when it happens? Because if you take a look at most NFTs on twitter you’ll see that some of them are just scribbling while others are AI generated images nothing unique and no story behind them, I’m sure those type won’t be able to stand when the market goes back to normal.",

      "body": "Not sure if this thread actually belongs to the gambling section, to be honest. Buying or selling NFTs sounds rather like speculation, instead of gambling. Anyways, if we assume NFTs are actually a vehicle to gamble, then I must say there are better ways to wager money and get results on the risk faster than waiting for days or weeks before cashing out.The only reason I would actually buy a NFTs would be for historical reasons, to have an historical piece of the era when Nfts were quite popular, nothing else. I would keep them in a non-custodial Ether wallet, never on an exchange.",

Bored apes for sure right now or cyber punks are probably a great buy.....If that's what you think based on your own observation then just go ahead with it \"with care\".Since everything is speculative, our actions will depend on what we see in the current situation.If you think you will succeed by following your own observation, then give it a try. As you said, the market is unpredictable therefore you really need to test what's on your mind in an actual situation before knowing the result. Maybe you will fail, maybe you will succeed, no one knows.",

Bored apes for sure right now or cyber punks are probably a great buy.....I can't say much about your prediction since it's your own prediction and that was your analysis. So be it. However, you can't just tell anyone here to gamble with NFT just because you think that is the right to do. It's ok that you shared your analysis but let these people decide for themselves on what to do next. It's hard to trust someone who in the end, they will say expect a huge payout someday.Good luck with your analysis and I hope you will have a good and smooth run in earning a good profit in the future with these NFTs.",

This thread is not about gambling at all.Some none fugitive tokens have connection with metaverse and the rest of the web3 i-gaming development so to some extent their have a connection to the i-gaming upgraded version with Metervse,  this tokens will have double representative since ther can be held as an assets or as an investments,  but the best possible bet is to have something that it value will definitely increase in the long term and that is where the speculative nature of the topic comes in. The thread should be moved to the alternative cryptocurrencies speculations board because I believe that is where the thread is best fit to.",
