  "content": "Good day,I am looking to buy Bitcoin for GBP quickly at a reasonable rate. I have a verified Binance account but as you may know new users can not now deposit or withdraw in GBPs. P2P in Binance does not qualify.What trustworthy exchanges are quick at validating ID, not one that requires an IOS or Android app. Thank you in advance.",

(best choice: bisq; beginner friendly: agoradesk/hodlhodl)For p2p, I also suggest reading hodlhodl's security guide as it applies in most cases, see: https://medium.com/hodl-hodl/trading-security-guide-2f35c20e58f4",

      "body": "My answer can be general but let's go with general fact.Service support for users will be quick or slow depends on their human resources as well as technical resources they have to handle customer request from KYC verification, withdrawal to support ticket. Generally speaking, everything takes time but if you have good resources, you will handle it faster than if you have limited resources and are temporarily overloaded.So let's consider Tier-1 exchanges and see what exchange can serve you best.https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/Kucoin exchange is non-KYC and fortunately they support EUR and GBP trading pairs.",
