  "content": "I am currently using a highly complex method to store a set of 24 mnemonic words. Decoding the mnemonic requires 20 minutes. I am considering why not use a simpler approach? For example, writing down 15 words on papers, and storing the remaining 9 words on an encrypted USB drives and online emails. Certainly, both the paper documents and electronic file should be kept with multiple copies.Question: Given the first 15 words out of 24, can a hacker crack the wallet?I ask chatGPT, and it say that is secure. However, considering that AI models often give unreliable information, it would be better to seek advice from friends on this website. Thanks!Adding passphrase is better, and some message is obtained here https://blog.trezor.io/is-your-passphrase-strong-enough-d687f44c63af The official Trezor website has calculated the security length of a passphrase. It states that a passphrase containing characters from 0-9, a-z, A-Z is considered secure with a length of 10 characters. With 62^10 possible combinations, this is equivalent to approximately 5.41 words, or 2048^5.41.",

The 24th word should not be included (it is a checksum word with only 8 possible choices). This still makes it impossible to crack. If a 30-character passphrase is added (using 0-9, a-z, A-Z), with 15 characters written on paper and the other 15 encrypted in an electronic file, it becomes even more secure.If the 24-word mnemonic has been used before, then the blockchain will contain BTC transaction records. In that case, a hacker can first crack the remaining 9 words (by checking if the generated wallet has transaction records) and then attempt to crack the passphrase. However, if the 24-word mnemonic has never been used individually, then the hacker would need to crack both the remaining 9 words and the passphrase simultaneously. Is my understanding correct?",

My plan is as follows: Write down 12 words of 24 and an 18-character passphrase (including 0-9, a-z, A-Z) on papers. Additionally, encrypt another 12 words into different electronic files with different keys, to prevent single point of failure. Multiple backups for each part and store them in different locations.

My current knowledge is very limited. I plan to directly use WinRAR and 7-Zip for encryption, utilizing the AES256 algorithm. Regarding it must be reproducible, there are a few considerations as follows:(1) For electronically stored files on the network, use strong passwords (>40 characters) and prepare password explanations. The passwords will primarily come from things or names that I am very familiar with but others are not, such as the names of childhood playmates, and so on! Most these things and names are unknown to my colleagues as well.(2) I have purchased a few high-level encrypted USB drives, including two fingerprint USB drives. The seller claims that these encrypted USB drives cannot be cracked. Therefore, relatively weak passwords (~20 characters) can be used for the electronic files stored on these drives. If a hacker-level thief were to steal these USB drives, they would not have the ability to crack them immediately. Then I have time to send out the coins.(3) The last line of defense is hardware wallets. As long as the hardware wallet continues to function properly, it remains secure.",

To ensure that encrypted electronic files can be opened, I have done the following works:Have you personally reviewed the code of 7zip to ensure there are no flaws in its encryption algorithms?Did you take steps to mitigate against known vulnerabilities such as this one: https://nitter.cz/3lbios/status/1087848040583626753?Did you make sure to build the app yourself from the source code you reviewed to ensure you haven't downloaded a fake or malicious one?How to you plan to do any of that for WinRAR given that it isn't even open source?Did you only encrypt your data on a permanently airgapped device with a clean OS?Did you make sure to delete all the temporary files it creates in the archiving process, and then write over those sections of your computer's memory with junk data?Did you make sure to delete the unencrypted text file you would have first stored on your computer before encrypting it, and then write over that section of your computer's memory with junk data?Quote from: lyw123 on October 05, 2023, 01:59:36 PMSo passwords will only relying on memory and password explanation. I test this method for a long time, and it is very reliable.It isn't reliable. Here are 100 million reasons not to rely on your memory: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5402270.msg60342177#msg60342177Quote from: lyw123 on October 05, 2023, 01:59:36 PMI have purchased a few high-level encrypted USB drives, including two fingerprint USB drives.Biometrics, especially fingerprints, can be very easily bypassed, even on high end 3D ultrasonic fingerprint scanners such as those on the latest flagship phones - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5281976.msg55391797#msg55391797. It will be trivially easy to fool a basic USB fingerprint scanner.Quote from: lyw123 on October 05, 2023, 01:59:36 PMThe seller claims that these encrypted USB drives cannot be cracked.Do they also have a bridge to sell you? People will say anything to sell their product. How do you plan to verify this claim?Quote from: lyw123 on October 05, 2023, 01:59:36 PMCheck whether the encrypted files can be opened normally once a year. If not, transfer funds through a hardware wallet immediately.Will you only be decrypting them them on a permanently airgapped device? Will you be writing over the sections of the computer's memory which held those unencrypted files after you are done?There is a reason that everyone here and every good wallet tells you to write down your seed phrase and store it offline. If you want to ignore all that advice and do your own thing then obviously we can't stop you, but you greatly increase the risk of loss.",
