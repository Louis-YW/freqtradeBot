  "content": "I had a crazy idea... Â What if we designed a Bitcoin poker chip set with $ denominations and the Date Bitcoin hit that denomination? Â  I think it might be a cool idea to show the ever expanding value of Bitcoin and $ eventual demise.I was wondering if anyone found a company willing to do custom chips for a decent price, I found one, but it's:Â 500pcs custom ceramic chips 39mm is USD295.00 including shipping to the USA by FedEx.I thought maybe someone here would have a better idea, and I was wondering if we wanted to do a group buy (not sure if anyone else would be interested).I thought one side the Bitcoin logo, each denomination a slightly different color, but consistent design in general. Â  The other side would have the values we decide, along with the date first achieved.Let me know if anyone else might be interested, especially if we know of a better supplier. Â Hopefully we can get the price down a bit if we do a few sets.Thanks!MarkOh, and the idea was to have this a set to play with, no wallet or sats assigned (I don't want to compete in that area).Â  Â Also, not looking to make a profit, but rather work with other members if there is an interest.",

I am really only concerned about people wanting the full playable sets, as I want to allow people to order the exact mix of chips they would like for their collection.Again, no need to pay anything up front, it's only about $1k for all the chips, so I will front that and then people can pay once I receive the order and I will send out with confirmation I have chips in hand.Â  (Bitcoin preferred!)Finally, I got them to center the $ amount and make the text more legible; however, they made the $ amount black as well, but I like the white lettering for the $ better.Â  I have asked them to make that change, then I think it is done!Thanks!Mark",
