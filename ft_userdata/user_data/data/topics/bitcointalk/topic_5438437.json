I think all exchanges should have this by law because it helps people from getting stung by taxes because cryptocurrency is difficult with taxes. I think people should get a accountant to do the math for them but for people who cannot afford one might benefit from this. If this is made compulsory by governments then at least people will be covered and do not have to do the math themselves and make mistakes which could cost them in big fines.",

At least he is now guided on how to compute his tax as far as his crypto activities in Binance is concerned. But he has to make sure first that Binance's computation is based on the latest tax formula and policies in his country. They could change every now and then. To be honest, it is better to consult a local tax expert than Binance. Local tax experts know much better than whoever is assigned in Binance to come up with a tax computation. To be honest, Binance coming up with this is not really necessary. But they must have thought of this to make them look good in the eyes of regulators.",

So this reporting tool will definitely help users to download their tax statements for any given period of time without stress. But it could be a challenge to some of us in developing world that have been enjoying tax exemptions due to the government's reluctance to acknowledge that cryptocurrencies are important investment platforms. This tax reporting tool could however serve as an attraction to the government to become friendly to the sector because of the revenue they can get from the crypto industry. But I hope that Binance will not in future assist the government in collecting tax directly from users.",

Yeah, looks like Binance is moving in the right direction and probably gonna become the most adopted/legalized exchange in the next couple of years. I'm glad that companies like this represent the crypto industry.",

This is also maybe good news for everyone because even if the tax itself is of no use, some companies especially banks here in our country just asking some proof that you are trading cryptocurrencies before I am using just a screenshot and they are still accepting it. Overall with this new feature, it's good for everybody.",

CZ is really smart to take this step to please the government. Since the FTX collapse, binance has been the target of the US government, and I think this is the way to alleviate the government's anger to maintain their existence. This action will cause more misunderstandings for privacy lovers but pleases the government, and in this case, the government is more important to Binance   .",

It should be depends on the country where you come from, because each country has their own rule about income taxation, some even have specific rule for crypto taxation.I think it's quite tricky how Binance will calculate the tax, does it's in fiat equivalent or in the crypto equivalent? Let's say I get donation 1 ETH worth of $800, next 2 months I exchange 1 ETH for BTC and I get 0.071 BTC which is worth for $1,600. But in the end of the year I exchange my 0.071 BTC to ETH and I get 2 ETH, but it's worth for $1,200. It's confusing lol.",

How about someone just sending coins to you for normal purposes just like using bank to transfer money to someone, would the person need to pay tax because binace tax may likely calculate every transaction it sees without knowing the purpose of the transaction. Every invention has pros and cons. I believe the invention will defer from country to country.",
