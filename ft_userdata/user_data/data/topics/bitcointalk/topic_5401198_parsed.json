  "content": "Alik BakhshiWar, so war!    There is a large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine, started by Russia with the aim of capturing Ukraine or part of it, which the Russians call Little Russia, without a clearly defined border, which, apparently, will be drawn according to the situation, that is, determined by the territory that was under the occupation of the invaders. In this aspect, the Kremlin, in the midst of hostilities, without waiting for even a hint of a symbolic truce, intends to hold a referendum, which has become traditional for Russia under Stalin, among the subjugated population, satisfying its irresistible desire to become citizens of the Russian Empire with a 99% result.    It is difficult for Ukraine to resist an aggressive and vicious neighbor, but thanks to the heroism of the Ukrainian people, the blitzkrieg that Putin was preparing was thwarted. Having abandoned frontal tank attacks, the Russians, hoping to achieve success at the front, switched to suppressing the enemy, relying on powerful artillery and missile weapons that literally burned out the positions of the Ukrainian army. Moreover, the Russians are firing high-precision missiles all over Ukraine, destroying transport hubs through which Western aid is delivered.    Yes, the countries of Western democracy, after much thought and vain hopes for the prudence of the Kremlin, finally realized that the fate of world democracy is being decided in Ukraine. Making concessions to a dictator who has strangled the beginnings of democracy in Russia will only whet the appetites of a revanchist and a bloodthirsty killer. With a great delay, the Ukrainian army began to receive light lethal weapons, with which it is naturally difficult to provide serious resistance to the Russian army, armed with long-range artillery, multiple rocket launchers, missiles that reach any object on the territory of Ukraine. The heroism of the Ukrainian soldier alone is clearly not enough argument to stop the aggressor, who is superior not only in the quality and quantity of weapons, but also in resources. America's decision to supply Ukraine with precision-guided artillery and HIMARS multiple rocket launchers could shift the balance of power in Ukraine's favor. With the help of the HIMARS mobile system, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have the ability to deliver a powerful blow to the deep rear of the enemy, causing significant losses, both to manpower and equipment. This led the aggressor into indignation. Threats and accusations of crossing the notorious \"red\" line, which must be understood as set by the Kremlin and has nothing to do with the actions of the Russian army in Ukraine, rushed towards America. According to the Kremlin's logic, the Russians have the right to strike anywhere, both from the side of the occupied Ukrainian territory, and from the side of Russia itself, and the Ukrainians, you see, are limited to adequate response actions. There is a definition for this and it is called arrogance, or rudeness, which is common for a Russian.     The Kremlin dictator understands only strength, and it is from this position that one should treat his revanchist aspirations to restore the empire within its former borders. It should be noted that, unlike the United States and Great Britain, Germany, the leading EU country, is in no hurry to help the Ukrainian people, limiting itself to promises, which is very strange against the backdrop of unanimous condemnation by NATO countries of Russian aggression, especially if we take into account the inexplicable behavior of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who slows down with the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine, and this is contrary to the decision of the Bundestag.         The Russians, with their great-power outlook, cannot in any way come to terms with the idea that even the peoples who were in their subordination in the past can organize their own state without looking back at Moscow. In this worldview lies the unity of the Russian people with their dictator and popular support for Putin in the war he started in Ukraine. And if there is a war, then the Russian people should know that, as in every war, one must be prepared for a sad outcome, as, for example, in the Crimean War with the surrender of Sevastopol. Then the reason for the defeat was the technical lag of the weapons of the Russian army from the European one. Something similar might happen again. So it’s not for nothing that Putin and his horse are against Western aid to Ukraine. By the way, a defeat in the war for Russia will have deeper consequences, as it will lead to the decline of the Russian Empire, ridding the World of a monster from the era of lizards that has survived to this day.      06/02/2022",

The people of Ukraine did not want to be part of the Russian Empire again.",
