The court noted in its report that virtual assets under the current legal policy framework are still legal property and protected by law.Only what China do not consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as is that they are not currencies, but they consider it as a digital property that can be hold legally.",

Before that the big giant of Chinese construction Industry, Evergrande had filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy protection at a Newyork.court. China has not been able to overcome the COVID-19 shock to its economy. It might  be a rumor, that there are daily cases of COVID-19 that are coming out, after every citizen being administered with the local vaccine did not work as expected. Things got very worst with CCP when they tried their level best to show the world that they have been able to counter the pandemic by allowing everyone to walk free. As per my understanding a country ruled by a fascist government would try to hide everything happening within the country.Let's talk about the flood situation, CCP tried their level best to save the capital by destroying those regions which were supposed to generate farmed output. At present they have zero clue on how to get rice as India has banned rice export.Mismanagement and ofcourse over confidence let them to this stage. Without the yes nod of CCP, this court would not have give such a positive statement. As per my understanding this statement from the court might bring back miners and it will allow ever citizen to invest, trade & hold their cryptocurrency. Another last attempt by CCP to get FDI inorder to reboot it's economy.",

Kind of weird though, the CCP owns a lot of bitcoin although they prohibit their people from owning or even mining them, that's China for you, trying to control everything but will eventually end up making situations get out of hand.",

People of China like bitcoin, it is their government that is hostile against bitcoin. If you remember when bitcoin and other crypto mining was banned in China, mining hash rate went to zero with the IPs linked to China and bitcoin dropped from over $45000 to less than $30000 at that time. China has the largest miners before the ban. The mining hash rate went to zero. Later and now, China is the second largest after US. Chinese like bitcoin but their government is the problem. You know that people can buy bitcoin without the government using decentralized means. Chinese are still trading bitcoin.",

If you remember in the past years when China's government authorities announces that Bitcoin is illegal, the price immediately drop. News especially in big country has huge impact to crypto, and some people taking advantage it, they manipulate the market through spreading a news that create FOMO or FUD. Until now, it's very effective strategy for them.",

But we all know that China is not a democratic nation so these these court judgments are just academic exercises, they will hardly be implemented. China's economy is going through a lot of problems, maybe the government wants to set its stance on Bitcoin and others. Reversing the ban on cryptocurrencies can be a good economic strategy to attract investors back to China.

Crypto or digital assets are not legal instead they are property with protections. Means, if those assets are considered as property under protection then it means the source of earning or buying must be legal one. If assets from illegal sources are found then they will be seized by the government.Another statement by the Banks of People in china is The People’s Bank of China Crypto Crackdown Continues. If we read this news carefully then a confusion will create in mind that this bank is saying crypto and other stuffs like that are illegal while some author or ordinary man is saying these are legal.To be honest I do not know what comes out of this but if this news will prevail then this will create a FOMO situation.",

So to my knowledge, it indicates they have to pay taxes and other stuff too while withdrawing and depositing them. But what I do not think is there is no other country like China that has banned the crypto and if they unban it then it will make a mass impact on the price of BTC. Instead, there is no such other country from which we need such good news.In the first place, I do not consider it bullish news means this is not some bullish news to increase the price of BTC. Instead, this might be information that we do not know before but now we know about it. And for the people of China, it might not be new. But still, there is a lot of confusion, to be honest, I have no words to clarify it instead one thing I can say is this news is not a bullish one.",
