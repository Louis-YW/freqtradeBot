  "content": "From exchanges robbing users, to increasingly encroaching KYC checks and laws...'Not your keys, not your coins' is becoming increasingly apparent. Polymerbit will start experimenting with DIY wallets without keys again, to be made at home discretely. These wallets will be intended for large amounts of Bitcoin. I'm working on launching a new note before the end of this year as a test. In short, we need your help. The challenge facing us is how to make user friendly DIY wallets. Anyone offering to test these wallets and provide feedback on this thread will be offered the note for £10 (half price). The forum member who finds a safe, easy-to-use open source method to generate the keys and provides a step by step guide using our paper wallets will be offered a £250 polymerbit gift card valid for two years.",

[...]Just my take on it: If going for a Bitcoin or any crypto collectible, many collectors don't want DIY in general. - The BIG advantage of DIY is that you only have to trust yourself (and your skills to produce private keys) instead of a 3rd party.However there are a handful of disadvantages coming with DIY: - it's (quite some) extra work*- it does need some research and effort, just to make sure your private keys are not exposed - the collectible value of DIY seems less interesting because of two things: 1) if you keep it unfunded, it's in a way just another rare item with no direct link to crypto and 2) there is some randomness compared to factory-funded items, some people will fund them, some won't. Also, the way they apply the holo will differ.- most importantly: if you want to resell a self-funded item with private keys produced by yourself, you need a high level of trust to be able to even find potential buyersYour thoughts already give a clear hint, as to why DIY priv keys will probably stay very niche for another few years (until there is a TREZOR-like device with its only purpose to print out safe private keys in different formats): \"Airgapped Pi, airgapped printer with special ink and paper\" - Anything in that range is a lot to handle for most folks and you can't really blame them.*I still like your challange here, you never know what comes off it - would be cool to get some creative and easy-to-use solutions as a result.And, call me pessimistic, 'Not your keys, not your coins' - I doubt this will stay on people's mind for too long. Some yes, but the majority... Not so sure. Even after all that happened recently.",

But I understand why they are not and I still do purchase some items from sellers that are holding keys I dont generate - in these cases I prefer to never fund them though.",

      "body": "Not sure if it's feasible, but what about making them the same size as something like a typical piece of photo paper, 4x6 does seem a bit big, but still... Then you should be able to load it like typical into most printers that have trays/ stops for it. Or maybe have the note be on a typical size of paper that just needs to be cut down to size? Might be easier to cut around the edges of the note vs printing and cutting the wallet info.Just spit balling here",

That is very true, laser is the way to go here. We've tested the polymer on various brands and models. I have yet to find one where it failed the durability tests. Some printers definitely offer higher quality prints, but frankly that is hardly relevant as long as the keys are legible.",
