Yeah sure there are a ton of good reasons to be a BTC maximalist, BTC is solid and should be around for a long time. And even without going so far as to be a maximalist, I find that investing in projects and altcoins represents a lot of research and 'temperature-taking', often resulting in a lot of disappointment (but this is a personal point of view).But I deeply believe that people who buy alts to get \"rich quick\" don't give a shit about decentralisation, P2P, the freedom that cryptocurrencies can offer or the founding principles of Cypherpunks. However, at least there is one good thing about altcoins and memecoins. they encourage a lot of people to get involved in the world of cryptocurrencies, and some of them then gain a better understanding of the field through research and reading. They have the advantage of contributing to the demystification of the actual use of wallets, exchanges etc.. for the begginers.How many times have I read on Twitter or Reddit, something like \"came hoping for quick money, stayed because it taught me how money works\"",

Yes. BTC While the fundamentals continue to improve and what we really have to optimize here is the security and convenience of price and flexibility and buy before the fork otherwise you will probably pay more for bitcoin than it will be worth right after the fork and now you know everything you need to free your money from banks and fiat currency and don't convert your BTC to shitcoins   .",

Some buzzwords such as DEFI have been used by centralized exchanges to deceive people that they offer decentralized services. Some of them claim that they are decentralized and even offer P2P services. Sometimes I wonder how Binance and Coinbase will claim that they offer such services meanwhile they will always ask for KYC. Don't be moved by these buzzwords because they don't mean what you think. Take time to read about the services they claim they offer and it will be clear to you that they are nothing but highly centralized platforms.

That's the easy strategy to successfully deceive new crypto users that lacks the understanding that with bitcoin there's next to none, and any other dev project can only pump at it's birth just to dump never to pump after gathering a whole lot of assets leaving the investors in a damaged loss.
