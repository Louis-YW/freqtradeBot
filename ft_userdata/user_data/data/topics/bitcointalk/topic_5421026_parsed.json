This is the notification I got in Discord that supposedly I was a winner of some sort of raffle they supposedly held in Discord. The thing is, I had never heard of this exchange at all. Well, I was curious, the amount is pretty decent  I decided to register. After registration I was invited to deposit 0.01 BTC or 0.16 ETH, and then I will be able to receive my prize.This looks very suspicious, considering that such methods are often used by scammers, when to get one amount from exchange you have to deposit another amount to exchange.What do you think?",

I'm not surprised you were asked to deposit first instead of just deducting it from your supposed prize. In addition, the exchange is only [almost] 2 months old and yet they claim to have $198.76B market cap.Some helpful links:https://discord.com/blog/common-scams-what-to-look-out-forhttps://discord.com/blog/protecting-users-from-scams-on-discord",

This is the notification I got in Discord that supposedly I was a winner of some sort of raffle they supposedly held in Discord. This is 100% a SCAM and they are using familiar discord messages technique to announce fake giveaway winners.You will be asked to create account at fake exchange and you will find amount of coins you received, but when you try to withdraw coins they will ask you to first send them bitcoin to ''unlock'' account.If you search in Scam Accusations section you will find many similar examples, and they are only changing domains with small graphical changes.Don't waste your time doing this and block this members in discord, even better disable all discord messages except from your friends.",

And yes, this is a well-known scam method.I am wondering, in a period where we have the liquidation of some large and recognizable services (Celsius, FTX for example), how can anyone even think to believe in such too-good-to-be-true offers? Due to panic, funds are being withdrawn en masse from the strongest exchanges, although there is no problem. why would anyone believe in such an obscure Discord PM offer?",

I've got that experience but I need to deposit some amount of BTC but I never deposit on the exchange. I know I will only lose my money if I deposit money to withdraw the prize. It is an old trick still working for some users so I hope you do not take any action and leave that exchange. Next time, never consider the prizes if you need to send any money to them.",

If we consider that maybe 10% of people ask or admit that they have been cheated in this way, the percentage of those who never admit it publicly is certainly quite large.Making people aware on a global level that this is a scam should be part of every school curriculum, along with of course many other things when it comes to the internet.",

I found this exchange strange,I also saw the same thing on reddit, it seems someone has been scammed by the cryptokreed.com exchange, this can be proven based on the experience that happened to @Ace_add.Beware CryptoKreed.com is a scam!!!! Do Not Use ItQuoteBeware CryptoKreed.com is a scam!!!! Do Not Use ItSo I was contacted on Discord by CryptoKreed.com telling me that I had been selected to win some etherium and all I had to do was open an account on CryptoKreed.com to withdraw it. (Too good to be true!). So I registered for an account and true enough the etherium was in my account, so I tried to withdraw it. However, I was told by the support chat that I had to be a premium member to withdraw funds and I had to deposit an amount of Bitcoin. I thought fair enough (stupid I know), and sent over the bitcoin. I tried to withdraw it all again and was told that a commission fee of 15% was required to be deposited. I tried again and now a region fee of 15% is required. Oh dear, I had been scammed!!!!As a warning to the community on the Bitcointalk forums, from the experience above, @Ace_add. One of the victims of the CryptoKreed.com exchange, I hope to be careful of that exchange site, it's a scam site.",
