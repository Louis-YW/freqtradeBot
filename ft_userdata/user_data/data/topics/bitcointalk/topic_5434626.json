  "content": "I've often heard it referenced how BTC has a fixed supply, and that being one of it's greatest advantages. It doesn't however, what it actually has is a decreasing supply with an unverifiable loss rate.As is pointed out in this article: https://medium.com/@alcio/how-to-destroy-bitcoins-255bb6f2142e There are three ways bitcoins can be lost or destroyed. They can be sent to bitcoin addresses that have no known private key, the private key can be lost, or they can be destroyed by being unredeemed by a block miner. A few thousand bitcoin are verifiably lost to burn addresses and unredeemed block rewards. The amount attached to lost private keys is unverifiable. There's nothing that can be done about unredeemed block rewards. However, the amount can be perfectly accounted for, and bitcoin core could be updated to guarantee 100% of the block reward is claimed in future; assuming it hasn't already. Burn addresses and lost keys are another matter. This is where the \"Should it\" part comes in.We could, if we really wanted to, implement an expiration timer on UTXO's of 21 Million blocks (~400 years, block count chosen for symbolic value). Expired UTXO's would be added to the block reward on expiration, and would apply to all UTXO's all the way back to the Genesis block. Such a timer is long enough that even family trusts planning to hold for tens of thousands of years would experience negligible loss, and virtually zero bitcoin with private keys recoverable by the inheritor of the original holder would ever expire. It would bring with it a massive advantage to the network as a whole: a truly fixed, fully verifiable supply. Not of 21M bitcoin because of already unredeemed block rewards, but very close.I'm inclined to think the trade-off is worth it. Quite possible I'm alone on this, and I'm certainly unwilling to break from consensus over the matter (not that I'll live long enough to do so). I still think it's worth considering. It's not like there's a time crunch on it; we have to hard fork bitcoin long before this would even matter to fix the UNIX time bug after all.",

The important part is that number never increases beyond 21 million. Everyone gets a little too involved about owning one whole Bitcoin, but Bitcoin doesn't have to be used like that, hence why we have denominations which could potentially be increased further to allow even more room for smaller amounts.",

I can see the argument for longer periods of time, but still probably wouldn't support it. Honestly, I don't think the loss of coins will be that big of a problem to justify any action taken. If we were in dire needs, then a solution probably would need to be thought of. However, we are far from that, and I can't see us getting there any time soon. There's probably going to be generations upon generations, and Bitcoin might well be replaced by the time that happens. I think there's definitely moral issues when it comes to injecting coins back into the network after a certain period of time. Bitcoin is attempting to replace conventional ideas of money, and doing something like this would be a step backwards in my opinion, and would question the integrity.",

The entire idea of this is that unrecoverable bitcoin is recirculated into the economy; no UTXO that could be reasonably expected to have it's private key still known should be recirculated. The reason ~400 years was proposed is because if a UTXO is that old but is still recoverable, it is being held by a seriously dedicated family or company trust. Such a trust could be expected to occasionally self-transfer those funds.Quote from: franky1 on January 13, 2023, 08:18:49 PM20 years 400 years.. doesnt matter. breaking the signing policy of fund movement breaks bitcoin no matter the delayI don't know enough about the code to know whether a retroactively applied expiration would unavoidably create a security vulnerability.

Price signals are thus manipulated and are impure. A deflationary money decreases demand pressure without true demand being affected. Price signals are still manipulated and are impure. A fixed money doesn't affect demand pressure at all. Price signals are pure and only affected by true supply and demand. A deflationary money will also require it to be made more divisible from time. Technically there are 2.1 quadrillion units of bitcoin, with 100M satoshi per bitcoin. It's somewhat likely that within the next 20 years, 1 satoshi will have the buying power of $0.01 at current value. If bitcoin continues to have minor deflation from lost UTXO's, at some point we will be forced to split further subdivide bitcoin, into 1B satoshi per bitcoin. That's 21 quadrillion units, a 10x increase of supply. Though as all holders of bitcoin will also have their holdings increased by 10x, the ratio of each holder to the total monetary network remains unchanged. That ratio is very important, as it determines just how much energy a holder of the money has a claim on compared to all the energy stored by the entire monetary network.",

No inflation, no deflation, ever. My thinking on this is heavily influenced by the philisophical work Robert Breedlove is engaged in. A monetary network is a kind of social energy storage. Money is a claim on energy. The total energy in a monetary network is thus the overall energy capacity, and the ratio of one's holdings is how much of that energy one owns. When people trade dollars for bitcoin, they move their energy from the dollar network to the bitcoin network. Dollars and fiat generally is a scam because the ratio of all holders is decreased as the currency is created. Energy is taken from existing money and moved into the new money, thus energy is stolen. There are thus two factors that determine how much value your money has: the ratio of your money to the total money supply, and how much energy is claimed by that monetary network. Unfairly change the ratio, and supply demand mechanics must be affected. Moving energy between networks is much more complicated, but hyperbitcoinization promises to leave us with only 1 network.",
