  "content": "In the past few days i have noticed unusual things like this user in the screenshot. New users come to the forum and start creating new topics right after a few days. Just look how many topics this user created in a single day and he even begged for merit in one of his topic. Is there someone who spreads misinformation about any giveaway in the forum for creating new topic!(This isn't a serious question)   I know they are newbie and we can not expect anything super helpful from them, but they should at least read the forum rules first....................................Edit: That users profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3573102",

Merit begging is a kind of begging also and it is prohibited by rules as well, so insistent begging from a newbie could probably lead to a ban also. But usually such violator has many violations and it just takes time to find for which exactley they will be banned.Quote from: rat03gopoh on October 01, 2023, 11:09:19 AMAnd look what I found, he did plagiarism.

Somehow he thinks that he's smart and everyone else is a fool; otherwise, he wouldn't believe that he could possibly earn merit through plagiarism and AI content. This is another example of the successful implementation of the merit system; otherwise, this user would simply rank up through activity in a few months and start applying to bounty and signature campaigns, which I doubt the latter would accept.",

How many chances they may get from mods?  Well, will wait for next violations from Aliagha790. Usually such users or lose their interest in posting on the forum at all or continue violating. So it could probably take several times of reporting plagiarism and other violations. Okay, we'll wait and do so.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on October 01, 2023, 01:05:43 PMThese posts were removed. According to the Bpip.org, the user is still free. So, either mods gave him another chance or he deleted the post himself.Modlog shows that posts with plagiarism were deleted by mods. So yes, he's got another chance but I don't think he'll get benefits from it.",

Nowadays the moderator become more friendly with plagiarism cases, but you don't have to try it. I feel like this established member did this at the beginning of their forum journey. No? Did they do it when they were already established? It seems all seven posts were reported at once. Did this member repeat the same practice again after the report? I guess not, which is why he is still free. If mods give a chance for the first or 2nd offense, I won't complain about it.",

Nope, it's when he was a Senior member rank, I don't believe if Senior member rank still not aware about the forum rules.All the seven posts weren't reported at once, it's two times because the reporter update his post three days later, IIRC first he report 5 posts and then add 2 more posts.It's true this member might not repeat his mistake anymore and you can still forgive someone for their second offense, but it looks unfair for old member who get banned because of one old plagiarized post.",

If they feel like they were much stricter back in the old days, and now they want to give chances for the first or 2nd offense, I do not see anything wrong here. The old members who were banned for their first offense should adjust themself and take it with a light heart. If they feel, \"I was banned, now they should be banned too,\" there is no double standard. I want to say that rules change over time. Sometimes, the same rules apply in different ways. So, old members should let the moderators decide what they should do. All you need is just report and let them do what they want.",
