I can on-board couple of projects@Royse777 have this kind of commission based offer to all the user that can refer him to project that can be potentially client for his signature campaign management service. I remember that he already closed the thread for this service but you can still try to contact him via telegram or post on his service ann thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5328445.0 about your offer.I think you can PM other campaign manager like Hhampuz,Yahoo and Icopress to negotiate for your offer because this is potential client after all so I think they might accept you offer.",

Also it's good move to create this thread so that other campaign manager will be aware to your offer because there's a lot of campaign manager that I still didn't mention that might be interested to your offer.",

Companies want to pay pennies and half the time offer tokens. I understand it looks like you're going ot help whomever offers the most money and that's fine, but if you already got a good offer it might be best to proceed with that manager.",
