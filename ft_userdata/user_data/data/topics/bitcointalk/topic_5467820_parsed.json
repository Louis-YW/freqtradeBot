You have made a serious complaint about this casino, and it is not unusual that we have seen many such cases where a gambler who wins big faces various problems when he tries to withdraw the winning funds. If you have more evidence please add it to the OP so that it will be easier for community members to understand exactly what kind of problem you are having.",

If he or she is withdrawing CSGO/CS2 (Global Offensive) skins, that's seldom necessary.However like other casinos, exceptions may apply if someone decides to be hanky-panky. Rest assured the KYC is only to cross-check against malicious activities and nothing else.",

We don't know what is the actual issue here as OP hasn't clarified everything. But as acroman08 has said above, the casino team (or the games provider) is investigating on his bets if the delay isn't related to KYC verification.Quote from: https://500play.com/terms-of-serviceIn case of a large or abnormal win, players sometimes can be subjected to a thorough investigation by the games provider in order to confirm the validity of the win and compliance with the Terms of Service. This is handled on a case by case basis and can take from a few hours to a few days. During this time, the player is not able to initiate any withdrawals and is fully responsible for self excluding/refraining from playing in order to keep the balance untouched.In the above case, OP should control his gambling habits to not loss his account balance now. His complaint is already live on Casino Guru: 500 Casino - Player‚Äôs winnings are confiscated. UserU has also replied above. So, there could be a solution of the issue if the OP cooperates by providing the evidences.Quote from: hugeblack on September 24, 2023, 10:05:58 AM~ so if there is another account they have here, please add it.The owner of 500 casino has an account in Bitcointalk, but he isn't active in the forum. Perhaps, we don't need him in this case as UserU has already stepped in here.",

The topic on Casino Guru was created on the same day as this one. The support agent asked OP if his account is verified and if the casino told him the reason why the withdrawal was declined and he has chosen to remain silent. The player has about 4 hours left to reply to Casino Guru, otherwise they will probably close the case. I doubt we will hear back from OP.",

Im looking to play here but do not want to experience issues if winning big.So far, they have no case on AG and two from four of open dispute cases against them on CG [soon will be three with OP's case] were closed. Their rating on both sites are also quite high; 8.46 casino rating and 9.5 players rating on AG, and 7.5 on CG. Those are the facts as per when this post is made. Whether you'll have issues in the future or not, that's completely depends on your gambling activity. If you don't give them any reason to make any issue with you, I don't think any casino would want to start an issue.",

If there's nothing wrong and the players play fair, the funds will very likely be released.The typical behavior you're referring to, is an attempt by casinos to balance customer's privacy and govt. intervention. They only ask for KYC when situation requires because they won't scare people by KYC when not necessary, while KYC is one of the things required for legal compliance.The bunch of nasty scammers you're referring to, is OP being impatient with the process. He literally only need to wait, and once processed and passed, he didn't bother clarifying things.",
