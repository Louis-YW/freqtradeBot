We also have the regrets simply because we already saw how it showed the potential of of it. If you can take  back time, what would you do? Take note that it's value before is not as big as with the others. Therefore, they simply disregard the potential this industry is having. A man selling his pizza for a  or in exchange of his holdings that has nothing much if a value before. But since by now we saw already its peak price increase based on previous market price milestones. It might be too late for other investors but for me nothing's too late. The price is still below its previous all time high which should create enough validation with things that we could still ride the tide. Sometimes it is not only with one's silly decision, give him the benefit of the doubt that he had a strong reason from doing so. That's his money by that time in the first place and for sure he is one who have learned from it at the present. For now, Wait for the right entry point 'coz right now consolidation and demand are around and there are still tendencies for another price correction which we should be waiting to happen.",

I mean people would mine them, for sure, they mine anything, but being a whale at the start in alternative history would have changed the playfield and the players so much, that bitcoin wouldn't have same changes. people wouldn't get to buy them as cheap as they did. Wrong people might be interested and right people look away as they would see it centered to one big whale, who has potential to crash the markets any time he/she wants.Even a small change in history could have taken away someone's share away, who has been essential to success of bitcoin. And even if someone entered early, they most likely had been sold everything long time ago, no one could have even dreamed we got here, except some crazy people who eat glue or something, so you wouldn't listen to them anyway.",

It will alwas be bought in exchanges or even with p2p selling of it. Although being rhetorical is the main thing here, the question should be would you be buying it all with that mentioned amount back on 2009, will you really believe that the market price would be fine or higher than what peop have expected even before. There's a reason why it would be an impossible purchase and that's the price of it before. Some people even forgot where did they put their crypto assets in because the value before was not even getting the right assumptions of it. If it is really being hopeless before then things are different right now.The logic as we all know; price reached multipe ceilings. When it was still at $10k people are afraid to purchase. When it reached $60k people are hoping for a price correction. Then when a sudden decline happen, people would still wait for things.What am I trying to point out, is that no matter how we desire of things at the present from this cited instance, it would only be the investor to decide what's best for your feat. Enough with regrets and what ifs, 'coz if really want to invest then go.",

But having 5M early coins on top of Satoshi's coins concentrated in the hands of a single individual would be pretty toxic, everyone would be afraid of a huge crash when this individual would start selling and the addresses would be closely monitored. But if the coins aren't moved for a decade, people would start assuming those coins as lost.",

The main point of his post is not how to build profit by monopolizing the economy and the supply but to actually see how whales could disrupt a thriving economy such as bitcoin’s in the past. Imagine earning almost a quarter of the total economy to yourself. You’d literally have so much buying power that the whole crypto world will depend upon you not selling a single cent of your held supply otherwise a crash would ensue and you’d kill the industry, especially if you did it in its early days. Now imagine just how much more devastating the effects would be if the sane situation befalls crypto. The implications would be so disastrous every single bag holder here’s gonna have to make a back up application to McDonald’s cause as soon as you sell your position, everyone’s cooked, that is if you can sell your position at all. Decentralized economies such as bitcoin’s work best when the supply is evenly distributed among its users. Sure we’d get a few whales here and there but it’s not so major that the economy’s gonna be affected for years to come soon as they sell their spot.",
