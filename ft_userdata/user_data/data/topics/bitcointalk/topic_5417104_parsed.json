      "body": "IMO \"Metaverse\" just like P2E Type Game the different only have more expensive stuff to be play. The only problem is not the programming, project and developer but biggest problem is to maintain or make a migration player to the platform it self. Also, the price token (In-case they using it) cause so far i know most of people who are investing especially crypto user (Only want his money back & make profit).",

I would say this is the best time to find the right metaverse project to invest on, a lots of expectations said about this ecosystem and it will be such a shame to miss out on it. And always DYOR.",

      "body": "As an immersive game experience, Metaverse will give users the chance to enter a virtual world and play with each other, like any other PvP games. However, Metaverse is going to be much more than your average video game. This is something that has never been done before, and it's probably the most ambitious project in this field so far. Everything will start from the project itself: how the digital assets are linked to each other and how the trading system works. There's also going to be a lot of creativity when it comes to asset creation: players will have their own avatar, for example. The game itself will be a platform for players to develop their own digital assets, but also a place where they can trade them with each other. There are already plans for tournaments and competitions that will provide the opportunity for people from all over the world to meet each other in person.I am also wondering what will the future bring to it, but it seems like it's going to be pretty promising. I can't wait to see how this project goes.",

Usually when I heard metaverse, I am closely thinking related to p2e which they are but of course there other business means that can be generated profit from metaverse. We just need to check which platform suited are metaneeds.",

In 2022 there is no way to reach immersion. Current vr sets are expensive, uncomfortable, and cause headache after longer gaming but in 2070+ ... its completly diffenrt story.

Next step is streaming video, than smells and fillings. With this technology you will have to decide if you want to go for a walk as a normal person in real life or as a superman in metaverse by advantage chips placed in your brain, feeling 100% immersion - feeling the wind in your hair, smells, flavors, etc. That day metaverse will be the strongest drug. Not many will be able to resist it and live normal life.",

One thing is a fact that the gaming industry will be one of the foremost beneficiary of the Metaverse project. Some tech equipment will be required to access the metaverse for a full gaming experience, you can become a retailer or even a wholesaler and receive payment in cryptocurrency and fiat. As the metaverse becomes popular, your business booms if you do it well. That's a way to get income from the metaverse gaming project.",

Some metaverse didn't implement play to earn mechanism and that will make you get nothing from joining on it. you shall try to choose the metaverse that will make you able to earn small amounts of money. I will not expect a huge income from there are metaverse have been made to be a virtual world for anyone.",

Just like when you have owned NFT that can be considered as rare NFT in such metaverse and it can give you so many benefits. The metaverse is still in the development progress. that means if metaverse have not yet reached the peak potential. that's why developers are still discovering about how to make metaverse become even better and better",

Not many will be able to resist it and live normal life.I would prefer to leave this reasoning to futurologists  There is no telling what will happen to the crypto industry in 50 years and what virtual reality technology will evolve into. Undoubtedly, I support further digitalization of the world and want crypto-adoption to develop and be implemented in everyday life of most people, but this is just a guess if we are looking that far ahead. If we moderate our ardor a bit and talk about meta universes on a shorter time horizon, say until 2030, I believe that this market direction won't get much away from the speculation that ruins most projects. People will still see it mostly as an opportunity to invest profitably and sell their coins quickly on a hype.",

You shall try to talk with develoers about this as some of these metaverse projects were not offering incentive mechanism through play to earn game mechanism. The future is still unpredictable, it's caused by some metaverse have been performing so bad during the winter season like this. Most of play to earn token (incentive tokens were decreasing a lot from the top to the bottom)There are so many bots playing the game to farm the tokens for dumping purpose only. Tokenomic is something that plays a lot in this case. Sometime developers didn't even aware if they were creating inflation token which makes the price to be dumped caused by it has got over created caused by being minted by players anytime. The future doesn't look good from here.",
