But as long as you are not giving them your private key / passphrase, you will be fine. Be aware of phishing attacks too.",

      "body": "The domain was created on August 15, 2022, which means that we cannot know whether it is a legitimate business or just one of countless scam sites. As for free Bitcoin, I checked on their site what it is about and there is something they call a referral bonus and a deposit bonus in the amount of up to 200%, with a note on the minimum deposit amount of up to 0.1 BTC.The latter is, in my opinion, a very good indication that their intentions are not legitimate at all and that they want to catch as many greedy fools as possible. I would not advise you to gamble with your money in this way, it smells like a scam, and it probably is.",

There's always a \"catch\" with every \"promo\". Meaning to say, the exchange has to get something in return and I don't see that with the description given. I can only imagine them bleeding money with that kind of setup since it's an actual \"giving away\"...But if we think of the possibility that they're a scam, it all makes sense. Unsolicited DM, luring users thru unsustainable \"FREE\" stuff, new exchange and therefore no reputation. IMO the latter is more likely.",

Total scam.Of course, what do you expect? There's nothing but red flags all over. It's yelling scam loud and clear!Sometimes, I really wonder why some people still seem to give the benefit of the doubt to things like this. Some still want to try, they still want to make sure. In the process, they are actually exposing themselves to risks. With all the obvious red flags, even the famous crypto reminder 'Don't trust, verify!' doesn't apply to this offer anymore. There's no need to verify an obvious scam!",

Most of them are scam especially from random stranger in socmed.This has become the general classification of scam whether it's a casino or investment, once they ask you to send first before they send you their rewards or free coins, it's 100% scam, sometimes they ask you to send so they can verify your address or they need gas and you have to send coins for transaction fees, don't trust projects that do this scheme, so many projects are posted in the scam section because of employing this scheme.",

It means that the business is classified as New. Suspicious. Dubious..There are a few reasons for this rating. Our algorithm gave the 14.8 rank based on 53 factors relevant to narlybit.com 's industry. We have aggregated all the vital elements, ranging from the customer service in its Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency niche to the public feedback and its Domain Authority (DA).https://www.scam-detector.com/validator/narlybit-com-review/QuoteThis website is poorly designed and doesn't contain elements in the metadata that could help its online presence. As a result, it loses credibility and shows that its quality is questionable momentarily.From the review algorithm above, I believe the narlybit-com service is likely to lead to a scam website, for that you should stay away before your money is lost, there is no free Bitcoin.",
