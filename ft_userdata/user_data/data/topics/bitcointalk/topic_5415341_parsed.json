  "content": "Hello thereFirst sorry my poor english. Still learningI developed a system which binds content creators and miners.Name is watcher token. Created on binance smart chain.Total supply is 52.000.000System is very basic. Content creators add own video by spend token.Miners watching video and take token.In addition, the system distributes 10.000 tokens once every 24 hours. miners get it as they watch.I developed watcing (miner) program too. Program only watches videos so no graphic card or disk space needed. It is working on any old computers very well.System working for 1/2 months. I have around 4.000 miners. Miners are earning 2 token every day in 10.000. My question isWhen should I participate in an IDO or ICO?And which platform? Please advice meAnd please review the project and tell me what I'm missing.Project link : https://watchertoken.com/Contract address : 0xddB88941E9a963BFE3545A479Db1b6af5031bCeDBSC scan link : https://bscscan.com/address/0xddB88941E9a963BFE3545A479Db1b6af5031bCeDThanx for all.",

      "body": "This concept is not new Addmefast already implement this concept, the script is very simple, this is 2022, and what you offer and how you offer reminds us that a simple script can easily generate millions, I don't think offering ICO will get investors to invest here, they will perceive it as another easy money, there's no team in your page either we don't know who is running this project and how capable you are in running this project in a long term but anyway give it a shot, you're not good at promoting too, we have an announcement and you choose to post it here in altcoin discussion, hire a designer to be a professional to gain the trust of investors, it's hard to invite investors to invest in your project if this is the best that you can come out.",
