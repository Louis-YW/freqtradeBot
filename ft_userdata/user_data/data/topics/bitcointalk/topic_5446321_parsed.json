  "content": "Buying your used video games and consoles. Must be in good, working condition. Everything will be tested. Console and video game values will be calculated based on shipping costs to Canada. I will pay for the shipping costs and I will be paying through PayPal. I don't have a reputation here as a seller and I want to build positive reputation by doing transactions but I won't pay first. You will have to ship to me first and pay me the amount it would cost for me to ship it back to you if it doesn't work. This amount that you sent me for return shipping will be sent back to you if the console works. If the console doesn't work, you will cover the cost of the return shipping. When you ship to me you will receive my name and address and can complain to the authorities if necessary.",

      "body": "Buying and selling via Paypal is too risky as Paypal can be charged back. Money can be questionable for 180 days. I would suggest that anyone interested in doing business with this user to use an escrow. If no escrow can be found, then do not do business. Always protect yourself.",
