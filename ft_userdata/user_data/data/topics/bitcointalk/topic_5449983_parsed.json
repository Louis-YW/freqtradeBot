  "content": "Hi. I develop hardware wallet which interacts with electrum.An issue is that - eink screen is not able to reflect whole qr of signed trinsactionsize 400x300 pixels. one qr dot occupates 4x4 . sometimes it is not enough even to reflect one simple tx with one input and one output.Is there way to divide QR to several part? I mean does electrum assums part of signed tx?",
