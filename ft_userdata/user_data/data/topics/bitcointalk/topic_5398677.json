  "content": "Hi all,rescanned some old wallet.dat files with Bitcoin Core. Most of them were empty as expected (sigh!). But then, there was one with a lot of Bitcoin on it.Too good to be true. But nevertheless, put in my address of a current wallet, sent it. The wallet shows that it has been sent, but nothing arrives. The tx seems to have been submitted to the mempool, according to the debug-logs.I used this wallet in 2014/15 for collecting miner's fees, and as to my recollection, I had emptied it in about 2017. So it seemed weird to me that there should be a substantial amount of Bitcoin still on it.So this seems to be a glitch - but what kind of a glitch?",

I think that would be the best way, if it tells you that the transaction does not exist, it is a glitch, otherwise congratulations.I say this because you say it seems to have been transmitted to the mempool according to Bitcoin Core, and it may be waiting for confirmation.",

So no need for congratulations Weird is, however, the fact that all transactions from 2016 are now with yesterday's date in Bitcoin Core.",

      "body": "Did you install Bitcoin core recently and resync?It happens to me before while my Bitcoin core is syncing I saw balances on my wallet and tried to send them but actually it didn't send or the transaction was invalid but after the Bitcoin core is fully synced the balances are gone because I already sent it a long time ago. So I think you are trying to send Bitcoin that was already spent you just need to wait for your Bitcoin core to be fully sync before you can see the right balance of your wallet.",
