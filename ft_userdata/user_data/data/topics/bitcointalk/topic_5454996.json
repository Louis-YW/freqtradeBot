If the government, let's say, says the USD is no longer needed and it's no longer valued, then the USDT will also lose value. Why? Because the USDT, which is a peg to the real United States dollars, is backed up by the exact USD you proclaimed will no longer have value and that it will replace. If the USD is being devalued in the real world, then there is no doubt that the USDT, which is the digital version of the USD, will also suffer the same fate, and if the entire world economy suffers recession and currency devaluation, then the crypto community will also suffer the same thing in terms of value. That's to say, 1 bitcoin might be worth 500‚Äì1 million dollars compared to the current market price, but in the real world, what will those 500‚Äì1 million dollars be worth? 100 dollars might just be equivalent to 1 dollar, which with the current value rate, what point and difference will that be?So in as much as we actually don't like the banking sector and the way the financial system is being centralized and managed, dumping and killing them is not entirely the best option for Bitcoin or any other crypto currency to gain the popularity we all wish and hope for.",

So should dollar devalues then it is only the currency, it will not affect any one to lose value of there funds except those that have a reserve in dollars. The countries that also uses dollar as their currency will only suffer this impact. Imagine a country that uses Euro and pounds then it remains unaffected if it‚Äôs reserve is not on dollars and they could use this currency to buy something of value they usually do because only dollar lost its value. But since the international market uses dollar then things tagged with it will also grow in price. Also as for the OP USDC deppeging already shows that even the so called stablecoins aren‚Äôt stable and they could be manipulated by whales easily than even bitcoin because there under regulations that affects the dollar",

And, if you think that there will be an official digital version of USD then that would be the worst competitor for stable coins. ¬†All of those coins will be useless and most of the exchanges would implement the official coin of USD and would one by one unlist all those stable coins one by one.In current times many countries are trying to stop trading with USD and they are trying to find or create another currency for trading of goods. And, if anytime they get success in that new currency than the USD will not be the strongest currency and in that case it will lose value at very fast rates. You should learn about the concept of BRICS currency, and that one might cause big damage to the current rate of United States Dollar.",

However, believe it or not, the traditional financial system will be maintained, the aim is to maintain control over the assets owned by citizens. Governments don't necessarily migrate to CBDCs if they don't secure a functioning centralized financial system. The point is that besides the state taking advantage of blockchain sophistication, they also need to have a full monitoring system, especially the inflow and outflow of fiat.In the next 20-30 years, when the CBDC is able to establish full control, that's where fiat finance begins to erode. Of course this process will be quite long, even with the change of heads of state whose management systems have different objectives.",
