Because there are enemies of the country.There is nothing wrong with holding a critical opinion about your leader. Just remember to hold enough of a critical opinion about your own ideas that you find out what the truth is.How do you become a citizen of your country? You were probably born into it. Or you voluntarily joined your country. You can voluntarily leave your country any time. And this doesn't mean you have to leave the land you are living on. Who determines what land belongs to what country? And what authority do they have to say make this determination? It's all arbitrarily done. But if they hold you in contempt for stating that a certain piece of land that you own is your country, you might be right, but if they are stronger, you might be dead.",

When will anybody begin to understand this? Democracy is simply a different form of dictatorship. Here is how it works in short fashion.In a Democracy, some majority of the people elect their favorite government leaders into office. These leaders might do a few things that the majority wanted them to do. They might even do some things that the MINORITY wanted them to do. Then they do whatever they want... often against both, the majority and the minority. DICTATORSHIP!A truly right form of government is one where the leaders only do things that don't harm the people. And it is one that a real live 'people' is only attacked by government for literally harming another real live 'people' or damaging his property... or by literal threat that is directed against another real live 'people'.On top of this, any accusation against a 'people' is adjudicated by a 12-'people' jury of his peers. Any government official acting outside of the way the government legally and lawfully says that they must act, is acting personally, not in his government capacity. He can be attacked as a 'people' and brought to court as a 'people', not as the government official.I say 'people' above. A person is a name on a document in US law. It might be connected to a man/woman of similar name. A 'people' is a man/woman adult.Get this stuff into your head. You want a Republic, where any of the laws that government makes can be overruled by the people... a 12-'people' jury. You won't want a Democracy unless you want a dictatorship.",

At least that’s how it should be. Remember that there are a lot of unfortunate countries out there who aren’t even meeting the basic needs of a lot of their citizens so if they say they regret being a citizen of that country then that makes sense. They might genuinely want better for themselves as well as for others. I see democracy as a privilege that we have to make use of when given. The government exists for the sole purpose of protecting and serving its citizens. If the appointed leaders aren’t fit for the job anymore then the citizens can and should criticize them.",

They're mocking their citizenships and just because they're able to move to another country and able to get a residency there, they're telling all shits of where the roots they've come from. It's normal to criticize when you're seeing a lot of bad things going on. But it can't just turn into a better land on an instant, that's why I like those leaders that instead of taking time into making themselves good, they're showing what they're capable of and what they can do for their country.Quote from: Smartgoat on August 08, 2023, 12:04:03 AMI also have no problem with some people's vituperation and hate over there country but to suddenly decide to serve the same country you hate is hypocrisy of the highest order. and such people will have nothing to offer.they want to make use of the government to gain there own personal subscription, if appointed at the end.

However, no country is perfect and those citizens that feel bad about their country may have such feeling because of certain policy that they don't like.

The name is also a democratic country, which means that everyone who lives and is in that country has the right/can issue an opinion. But to issue dirty or insulting words towards the government or the country's leader, indeed this will definitely be strictly prohibited by every country, especially by countries that have a democratic system. But it cannot be denied, if the people are too annoyed with the government, for example, their opinion is not heard, or the government makes rules that are detrimental to society. From my personal experience, sometimes dirty words are often heard from the community.Quote   I also have no problem with some people's vituperation and hate over there country but to suddenly decide to serve the same country you hate is hypocrisy of the highest order. and such people will have nothing to offer.they want to make use of the government to gain there own personal subscription, if appointed at the end. Because there are enemies of the country.To be honest, I didn't see the clear point written in your post, which I quoted. What I can catch from this writing, you seem to offend someone, who previously insulted a country, but in the end that person entered the government. Then what country do you mean, what country is it?Your explanation is a bit unclear, so try to explain again so that it is clearer.But here I will conclude, the point is you don't agree with the people you call hypocrites if you enter the government system. Because you think that in terms of personality and morals, this person is very inappropriate to be included in the ranks of the government (correct me if I'm wrong).If my conclusion is correct, I also agree with that opinion. Because if people used to insult or insult the country's leaders or the government system, then people like that should be prevented from entering the government. Because at first glance it is clear that people like that really only want to benefit themselves.",

And if we can get the right leaders that could figure out a way to fix the bastardized system and bring in new principles and policies that can change the face of things in Africa as a continent.",
