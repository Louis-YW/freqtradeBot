      "body": "This is indeed a good cause. And I'm reflecting on the fungibility of Bitcoin in this case. All Bitcoins are equal. There is no single Bitcoin that is more Bitcoin than another. There's no such thing as a dirty Bitcoin simply because it comes from a drug-related crime. It doesn't mean that since a Bitcoin was used in a crime it is less of a Bitcoin already. It isn't. It could still be fully used as a Bitcoin. It could still be put into good use. After all, that's what's important with Bitcoin, that it is used in good things. Finland has indeed done a good job. I hope the donation won't be channeled through a platform that subscribes to the idea that Bitcoins aren't equal or else it would be flagged as tainted coins and might be rejected or frozen.",

Holding is good, but holding Bitcoin for entire your life is kind of selfish. Converting Bitcoin to fiat aren't always a bad decision because it can be a good deal if it's used for good thing like this donation. With this help, you're give a chance for Ukraine citizens to live more longer and they might die if Finland didn't give this donation. Even you want to donate after 10 years when Bitcoin to the moon, your huge money can't revive someone which already dead.",

Apart from the reason mentioned by @mk4 (which makes sense), I would perhaps add that Finland did not want to send dirty Bitcoin as a donation, but rather wanted to clean it in some way - so even though that may not make much sense to us, the politicians, in addition to their ignorance still think differently about Bitcoin than most other people.Be that as it may, those confiscated Bitcoins are in circulation again, and the money goes to help those who really need it at the moment. However, it should be taken into account that such a decision is not only humanitarian, but also political, given that all countries west of Ukraine know that a weak or defeated Ukraine brings war to their doorstep.",

What I don't get, though, is similar to concerns expressed by others in the thread: why they badly needed to sell cryptos and donate the cash to Ukraine.

What kind of justice is that?Okay, a couple of things here if you truly don't understand why Ukraine needs weapons. You're saying Finland should donate food and water. Well guess what? When people were starving in Mariupol and many occupied and sieged cities (and I'm speaking not just from what I've read on the news but from what I know from my relatives who experienced hunger during Russian occupation in March), Ukraine had plenty of food loaded on huge trucks, ready to be deployed to help Ukrainian citizens. But Russia did not let the humanitarian aid pass through for a long time in many places. Food and water are useless when there are Russians with guns and tanks on the road, not letting the food trucks reach those who need them. You know what gets rid of those Russians? Weapons. And as for rebuilding safe houses, the issue is that you can spend a lot on rebuilding, and then Russian missiles or artillery shelling will hit the area again, destroying everything you've worked for. And what helps getting rid of missiles and shelling? Again, weapons. So Ukraine needs weapons to solve humanitarian issues. Not because Ukrainians are so eager to take human lives, but because of incredibly inhumane acts by Russians that cannot be countered with food or safe houses.",
