Discussions about bitcoin investment and trading that appear on this forum are not only on the appropriate boards but on boards that shouldn't be, they are also presented by forum members with the possibility of meeting the quota or posting requirements.My background makes this because very few discussions around the importance of privacy are focused and let the topic of discussion sink to the bottom. Most people focus too much on how to make a profit through Bitcoin, which gives the impression that Bitcoin is a tool for gaining wealth and not the greatest network in the history of currency transactions.Privacy, which is often stated orally, is very important to maintain, is rarely taken seriously. Many bitcoin users know that bitcoin has quite good transparency and that other systems, including bank operating systems, do not have this. Bitcoin is famous for its anonymity, but various transaction flows can be tracked and seen by anyone and everything is recorded on the network.Sending and receiving bitcoins can occur if the user has an address and with that address the public can know all transaction traffic.It cannot be denied that humans have a forgetful nature, want to be known and acknowledged, etc., so they cannot properly maintain confidentiality, so they often take actions that could threaten privacy.It's not how much bitcoin you have but how well you maintain the privacy of your bitcoin for the future.Maintaining privacy is not trying to hide crimes but protecting oneself from crime.What will I do?1. Always try to use a new address to receive payments2. Try not to publish your bitcoin address to the public.3. Try to keep IP addresses undetectable by using tools like VPN.4. Avoid using closed source wallets for storing bitcoins.Hopefully this is a reminder for me personally and does not mean to advise others because I still have many limitations.Reading source: https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy",

Always try to use a new address to receive paymentsIf you receive multiple payments from a same person, company, why do you need to change your receiving address?You can use different receiving addresses for payments from different partners or even can use different wallets for them too.Quote2. Try not to publish your bitcoin address to the public.If you don't have to do it, don't do it is the best practice.Quote3. Try to keep IP addresses undetectable by using tools like VPN.VPN is not the best, use Tor.Quote4. Avoid using closed source wallets for storing bitcoins.This point should be the first one.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsUse wallets that are open source, non custodial and have coin control features, RBF, CPFP because if you are going to non custodial, you will need those features.",

Discussions about bitcoin investment and trading that appear on this forum are not only on the appropriate boards but on boards that shouldn't be, they are also presented by forum members with the possibility of meeting the quota or posting requirements.What I will say regarding this is that the it is everyone’s responsibility to have their his forum in order so that we can actually reduce the spam on it. On this I would say whenever you see a thread that is not placed on an appropriate board then it is right for you to report to the moderators to move the thread or just tell the OP to move it to the appropriate board. If it is a thread or reply you feel lacks substantial weight or meaning then you can report it also to be deleted, it is everyone’s responsibility to get the forum clean and just leave them and complain on another thread. QuotePrivacy, which is often stated orally, is very important to maintain, is rarely taken seriously.

That is why it is mostly regarded as pseudonymous rather than anonymous. Concerning bitcoin been seeing as a tool for just profit I don’t see everything bad in it since bitcoin provides people with that benefit aside it’s main purpose of been an alternative to the traditional way of making payments so there is nothing bad rather shows the vast advantage of bitcoin that everyone can fit in but just make sure you are investing an amount that you canLose and do not blame the system for lose.",

      "body": "The reason why topics which are directly focused on privacy are not anymore common is that this has been discussed for many years already. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin. This has been talked about over and over again. But you must have noticed how it surfaces every time a new topic is brought up in which privacy is at stake. That's because every time something has implications on privacy, it must be discussed. Privacy is sacred and is valued. For example, privacy is defended when talking about CBDCs. Privacy is also defended when we discuss about KYC and AML. Privacy is also brought up when we speak about centralized platforms or custodial services. So I have to call you out for wrongly saying that privacy is rarely taken seriously. You couldn't be more wrong. And you are also wrong when you said that Bitcoin is famous for its anonymity. Bitcoin is not offering anonymity. By the way you are also wrong in advising everyone to try not to publish your Bitcoin address to the public. Bitcoin has a public address. That is what is being shared publicly. How can you not publish it to the public when that is meant to be given to anybody who needs it? That's what others need in order to send you Bitcoin.",

People believe \"Oh, its just an address,\" but they dont realise that addresses are like breadcrumbs that lead to the whole loaf! What happens when privacy tools like VPNs fail? You're taking steps, which is great, but how many consider this in the big picture? We must always be watchful and ready to adjustrivacy techniques in the never-ending struggle for privacy.Congrats on focusing on Bitcoin balance and privacy, which is sometimes overlooked.

The word aside wasn’t emphasized by me probably but I didn’t mean that just using it for payment purposes will bring profit",

Always try to use a new address to receive paymentsIf you receive multiple payments from a same person, company, why do you need to change your receiving address?I don't mind doing this -- I actually find it useful (same address, different wallet, and the even another wallet to unlink) but it is something that could alert someone who wants to know about people.Say a script that looks for an address receiving regular, same amount payments, high likelihood that it's a salary to the same person. And that person happens to sell at some point. Exchange KYCs. Then alerts an authority. Who then knows now the person has a fixed salary from said company, possibly violating tax/economic/ etc sanctions.Easiest scenario I can think of.Quote from: Etranger on October 01, 2023, 01:13:04 PMHow exactly one can afford to always use a new address to receive payments?

My main hot wallet has hundreds of addresses labeled -- even if you ever forgot, the coins are always there, and trackable.Not sure why you think new address use is a problem unless you're using a bad wallet. Then how do you keep track of change unless you specify coin control?",

Everything may change after a month or a year, but as long as you learn and do not trust a third party, you will enhance your privacy. These tips are good, but they are not enough to stay safe from currency tracking services, I might add: - The best Tor is because in the case of a VPN you need to trust the service provider. - Do not use block explorers. - Run a full node and your own block explorer. - Use a mixing service without linking your inputs.",

Also, why take all these steps in privacy? If you're that scare about people finding out about you, just use Monero.
