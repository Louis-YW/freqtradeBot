I don't think it is due to SEC they usually upgrade wallets to make sure their customer's wallets are secured and safe and I think they replace deposit addresses to get less exposure.",

They never had an announcement here either. When it comes to creating an unofficial thread, it requires someone to spend some good amount of times which I doubt anyone would volunterily do.",

I haven't seen any traditional exchanges to provide new deposit address each time except coinbase though I haven't used coinbase as an exchange. I used them as wallet only back in the day. They time an address is funded, you will be given new address there (previous addresses are valid too).Quote from: logfiles on July 06, 2023, 10:40:53 PMThe old Announcement was about a different set of addresses of Ethereum, Polygon, Tron etc. This new announcement as has a new setI can't see any changes on my Bitcoin address in Binance.

Since the notifications are going to be sent out in batches to affected user between this month and September 2023. There is a chance that they could notify you in the near future, and it's only then when you will generate the new address and stop using the current one.",

Following this, those deposit addresses, as well as memos, that belong to the old infrastructure will have to be retired. Accordingly, this is all for the sake of better efficiency and, as you mentioned, security for the users' funds. This isn't the first time that Binance upgrades its wallet. And, as indicated in their announcement, this only goes out to certain users. The rest who didn't receive email notification won't have to obtain a new address.[1] [1] https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/existing-deposit-addresses-to-be-retired-in-q3-july-september-2023-ffbe37cbd85f46db8fe3021ee3f85eb3",

Unless they pay it back to the senders, that's a nice bonus for Binance.",
