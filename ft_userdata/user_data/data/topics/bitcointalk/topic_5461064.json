      "body": "Ok i got your wanted to share your analysis of BTC but why did you shared your BTC address. Is this some new kind of scam or what. Well, don't want to offend you but i didn't understand why did you shared this address. Secondly, i think i agree with you but to some extent only. Which is, I think market is currently in correction and it might take another swing in the upcoming week. But many people like you are making many charts, in which they are saying, BTC is going to reach $7k, $10k, $15k, $20k, $25k. i mean really, everyone is backing up there analysis with some charts and some lines drawn on it. If you will open Trading View and check the graph section then you will understand what i am talking about.I am saying, this is all fud and panic among BTC holders so that they started to sell out there BTC even before next pump, so that at least they could able to buy BTC from another lower price. which means they could earn more profits. But market is always so manipulative that we can not understand it. Its like sailing on uncharted waters. So, we all should not panic and remain calm And bear the current correction.",

      "body": "The fact that the price fell below 30k, this does not mean that we have left the price range 28k to 32k, but rather we are testing the bottom of this range and the possibility of it being broken is small, so it is likely that we will fluctuate between 28k to 32k and there is a slight possibility of going to 26k.Even if the price tested $26,200, there is still a strong resistance at $32,300, and therefore reaching levels of $35,000 is unlikely during Q3 of this year.Quote from: Faisal2202 on July 26, 2023, 07:38:44 AMOk i got your wanted to share your analysis of BTC but why did you shared your BTC address.

Some traders publish their analysis and below the bitcoin address to donate if their analysis is useful, but what I see here is a general talk or most of us know it.There is no objection to adding your bitcoin address, and it is better to have it in the signatures.",

What I know now is that the price of bitcoin may not go beyond $32000, but likely the price may drop later, after long period of time of not growing, it may reach $25000. If the price did not increase for long and it decreased below $25000 and not able to get over $25000, that would be another time we would soon reach $20000. If there is any worst case, bitcoin is not going below $17000 anymore before the next big bull run.",

When it comes to technical analysis, Bitcoin is one very market that is very difficult to analyze sometimes because of its volatile market.Accurately forecasting the market is by luck because all we do here is speculate, So Op is lucky that the market moved in the direction of his prediction. The Binance lawsuit was not the only event that brought the market down,  some investors sold due to FUD, they didn't want to get caught had the FED reserve increased the interest rate above 25bps that Wednesday.",

Well, i think i am not that could at joking. So, let me clear my words again. I totally get your idea and i know people could explore such options or maybe more good options but many may not. And for those such news and advices like yours do the work.And which is very good, but i was trying to say you should also charge for such good financial advices.",
