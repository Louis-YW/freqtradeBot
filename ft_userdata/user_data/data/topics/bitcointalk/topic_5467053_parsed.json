  "content": "The two most common ways people earn money through bitcoin is either trading or hodling, I know its advisable for beginners to HODL but there are still others who are have been successful in trading though its has more risks comparably to hodling bitcoin, while others earn bitcoin through Freelancing like we see here.Some are into either 2 or more ways of earning bitcoin but this takes more of time and effort to device a strategy that works since attention is divided While those who focus on one way has a better chance of earning higher and becoming knowledgeable in that field but this constrains you to one field. As a beginner, it's advisable to stick with one for starters as time goes by, you become experienced with the market, then you can try other methods. Though hodling bitcoin has a lesser risk than trading but its all boils down to your goals and capabilites.   What do you think? Is it better to focus on one or more ways to earn Bitcoin?",

      "body": "Firstly, I usually don't advice anyone to go into trading. That simple because even the so called experts experience loss all the time. If someone wants to make profits from his Bitcoin they should hodl. When there's a bull, simple withdraw their profits and leave the capitals. Trading puts your funds at a potential risk and if you don't know how to go about it, you will definitely loss your Capital. And yes there are other ways to earn Bitcoin but we should all be aware that the best way is to hodl. Quote from: Amphenomenon on September 17, 2023, 04:25:15 AMwhile others earn bitcoin through Freelancing like we see here.Do you mean signature campaigns? A lot of people here before joining Bitcointalk all ready acquired Bitcoins as at then when it's price was still very low. Some of them don't bother joining the signature campaigns because they don't see it useful to them. It's cool how alot of us earn Bitcoin through these campaigns though and I don't think I have seen another website that pays it's members Bitcoin for freelancing just as you said.",

Is it better to focus on one or more ways to earn Bitcoin?As you noted, bitcoin trading is extremely risky, which is why I've always said that it's best left to experts who are familiar with the market and have knowledge of trading strategies; however, for a beginner like us who is just getting started, if they focus on trading in their early days without first gaining knowledge and experience about trading, they may end up following signals that cause them to lose money because they lack experience and the fundamental knowledge about trading.A beginner with a passion for bitcoin should, in my opinion, begin by holding bitcoin; if they decide to get involved in trading, they should learn while still holding bitcoin; once they have the desired level of knowledge, they can start trading as well, but combining the two at once is very risky.",

Is it better to focus on one or more ways to earn Bitcoin?The first ones that I tried were airdrops and pay-to-click. They all did not make me any profit. If I had not tried to look for other means, it would not have been better the way it is today. Bitcointalk was the forth that I tried out and it has been the highest paying one for me today. It is good to diversify. You can not rely on one. Another one I think people can make money from is holding, it is worth trying. Trading is risky, but if you are using small amount of money with it and if you have learned about it very well, it might worth it, but if someone is greedy, the losses would be like gambling. Do not forget that bitcoin and other crypto to naira and vice versa P2P arbitraging on different exchanges is still part of it.",

I agree with the op, this space can be really risky most especially for newbies, those who are new to Bitcoin are just gonna have to take everything a step at a time, trying to get everything on track at the beginning can be very detrimental to ones finance, so to better manage ones risk, one should only engage in the means of earning Bitcoin they are sure works well for them .",

I recommend looking into other ways to earn bitcoins, such as offering your services or products in exchange for BTC. This is the most reliable method for earning bitcoins.",

Newbie should only invest and hodli bitcoin for the main time, and he he has understood the technical analysis and fundamental analysis with risk management, that person can decide to start trading, because trading is very risky and it is similar to gambling. Trading no easy as we dey think say e be and if you no know anything inside you go troway your finds. Investment na the best and another good way to make profit from am, if you use better money invest and wait till the price of bitcoin reach bull market, it is an easy practise, when you only invest with money wey you no go need to use do inportant things.Quote from: Hatchy on September 17, 2023, 05:58:53 AMeven the so called experts experience loss all the time.I no go accept this one wey you talk bros, because no expert trader go trade dey make loss all the time go say him na expert, and he go run leave the business, because nothing come out but loss. Expert traders also make loss but they make more profit than loss due to their knowledge of understanding the market.",

Apart from signature campaign, you fit get bitcoin by participating in art contest, review works and quiz etc. The hodling of bitcoin is not meant only for newbies but also to other ranks. Trading and mining can give you bitcoin every day if you are good in them. As a beginner if you can diversify your investment and you have the funds to do that, you dont have to waste your time oh, just do am and make u no go stay for one place dey suffer. Mining bitcoin has more risk than trading. If I will advise, it is better to invest in more and earn bitcoin than to focus on only one line of investment.",

If you want to be a trader as a beginner, then you should be ready to learn. When you learn how to trade, you are definitely going to lose, so you have to be ready for that, and you will be ready for constant learning and practicing. I don’t discourage any beginner that wants to start trading from doing that, I will just tell them the necessary things that I think they should know. Every professional trader was once a beginner.Quote from: Amphenomenon on September 17, 2023, 04:25:15 AMAs a beginner, it's advisable to stick with one for starters as time goes by, you become experienced with the market, then you can try other methods.

After you see how things work and have knowledge about what you are into, you can decide to involve yourself in other things. If you are a beginner and you are planning to choose between trading or hodling, then I will rather tell you to start with hodling because I know the risk involved can’t be compared to trading, and I won’t recommend you start the two at once.",

Bitcoin is an asset, literally, and you need to learn to keep it, hodl it, beginner or no beginner. But as Op said, \"It all boils down to your goals and capabilities\".Earning Bitcoin is not that much of a difficult task on platforms where one can earn, especially faucets, but most of them are limited, and countries like ours can't easily earn or get access to them. So, the forum campaigns are really the best I've seen so far, even if it's not all that easy. And earning Bitcoin is according to your capabilities, if you're able to earn from more than one platform, then I suggest you do.",

Earning/making money through Mining 2. Earning through referral (i.e Getting a commission through referral link on exchange or casino)3. Earning through faucet (i.e the oldest means)4. Earning through freelancing5. Earning through Signature/bounty campaign, e.t.cBecause, the more knowledgable you are to that which you intend to focus on, the more likely you are to avoid losing funds due to lack of knowledge & systematic approach.
