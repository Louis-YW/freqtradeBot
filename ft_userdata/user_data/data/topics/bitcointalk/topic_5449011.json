You should look into this article[1].As for you sending Bitcoin to them, then it looks like they only require 2 confirmations[2] before crediting the funds so you should just make sure you're paying enough fees[3] when sending.[1] https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/why-does-a-buy-take-so-long[2] https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/glossary/confirmations[3] https://mempool.space/",

      "body": "About sending BTC from Coinbase to other wallets or exchanges based on my old experience using it Coinbase does not have the option to manually set the transaction fee they sometimes deduct TX fees too high or sometimes too low due to delays in their system to check mempool fee the TX fees sometimes low/high that is the disadvantage of using exchanges not only Coinbase but also other exchanges. However, Coinbase is very buggy I sometimes experience that even if the transaction was confirmed or more than 3 confirmations the balance on my account didn't change or the BTC that I deposit didn't reflect in this case you have to report it to their support to fix the issue.About confirmation when you receive BTC like the above said Coinbase have 2 confirmations required before it reflects unlike Binance or other exchange only requires 1 confirmation after you deposit.Why stay on Coinbase they gradually remove inactive customers from their exchange you can switch to a better exchange like Binance.",

Also, the fees which was explained above. If you experienced this for several times already and still the same, then its their system is the problem.",

If there is delay it could be low fees charged if you manually set it by yourself but I know in binance fees are automatically set and so you don't have such issues with that. At most you can reach out to customer care service.",

What are you trying to say or what point do you want to make?      Are you almost confirming what I said or what?I see that the topic has not been updated for more than 10 days, Coinbase is a popular platform and the user did not update that he was scammed despite being active, we can say that his problem has been solved and there is no need for more hypotheses about it.",

      "body": "Sometimes, Bitcoin network experiences high transaction volumes, leading to a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. If the network is congested when you initiate a transaction, it might take longer than usual to confirm. If faster transaction confirmations are a priority for you, you might want to explore other exchanges like Binance. However, keep in mind that each exchange has its pros and cons, and it's essential to weigh these factors before making a decision.",
