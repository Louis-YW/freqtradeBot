  "content": "So, it looks like the Russians are finally getting on board with the whole digital currency thing. And by \"on board,\" I mean they're planning to launch their own CBDC within the next two years.So, the Bank of Russia is planning to launch a digital version of the ruble as early as next year. And by 2025, they want exchanges and non-bank financial entities to join in as well.Do you guys think that will cause the Ruble to skyrocket once it is \"online\" - Will it be beneficial or not in your opinion?",

No I don’t, what I do think though about these CBDC’s is that it’s just another way for governments to control their people. They want to eliminate cash & track EVERYTHING you do. We are one step away from China stule control & social credit scoring.",

We are one step away from China stule control & social credit scoring.I think we're just not one step away, we're exactly walking the same footsteps as them. You see that they are getting their monetary control back, I don't like the idea of these developments!",
