As you can see the influc of money to these kind of platform go down eversunce the market got hit. Its not surprising, since users are tend to keep their fiat and stables for daily usage and to be safe. But who knows if you are right. But for me, the trigger for the next bull run could be lead still by bitcoin adoption and some metaverse related.",

Another hype that will be made on the next bull run is what you're predicting to come? As you have mentioned about GMT, the hype for it was done already. As you've said with all of those walk to earn, play to earn and everything that's associated with an activity and a way to earn, they're not sustainable really at all.",

Well, the fact is that we usually got wrong about the market. Whatever will happen in the future even this year is been untold, nobody knows about it. Well, I see the next Bullrun is somewhat surprising, not even know which altcoins will do the x100 but I believe it is possible to happen. So make sure you have bought some coins now and maybe, you are lucky to pick them up and become rich. However, never expect too much from it, it is better to keep yourself aware of the situation that we don't have assurance.",

I don't know if altcoins have the potential to invest or just wasting your time and money. Nevertheless, go to the top altcoins that have potential and have proven that they are good projects which useful blockchains. Play-to-earn has been only hyped projects only but in fact, still very risky. Choose BTC only, when there is a bull run for sure there is your profit.",

Web 3.0 and Metaverse projects will take the lead next bull market. that sounds unreal. Why? look at the latest report from meta. this major company who developed metaverse have been facing a huge lose caused by people rarely using metaverse. The transition needs the time but since meta was facing a big lose and its stock price was also dropping so hard. There's no reason to think that if metaverse to lead the future as this needs more time to go. Metaverse needs to be developed even further by creating so many possibilities that related with our life. The defi may still lead the bullish trend in the crypto. Major exchange sites are sitll investing heavily in the so many defi projects instead of another projects in the crypto. i do believe if defi will be more preferable for the next bull trend.",

In the coming bull run, expect another hype and probably some token will reach that 100x profit, but itâ€™s too hard to know which token will reach that level. All I can say is spend time to analyze small tokens and you might be able to find the next gem in this market.",

A lot of cryptocurrencies were released in 2017 and almost all cryptocurrencies in that period made good money. Later, many altcoins that emerged in the late 2021 and 2022 bull seasons were trash and evolved into fomo defi, nft and metaverse. As you said, uniswap was the one that kept the market most active. Until the next bull period, I think different things will emerge in terms of fomo, and I think that the new metaverse projects that will come to the market will do the job.Yes, we can't expect what happened in previous years will still happen again next few years. With the new projects created, will affect the market trend and change its course. Not I say it going better but for sure, there are some market improvements. I'd see the metaverses is quite growing fast and in hype but I haven't expected a surge in its price because people are not adopting it. Trust and confidence in the projects are big factors why people can't see the benefits of this, of course, I didn't. If I'm going to invest in altcoins, I've preferred old coins, not new projects.",
