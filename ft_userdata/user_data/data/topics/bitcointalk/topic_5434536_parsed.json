I think DASH is not worth buying because it was shilled in the first place.I would say we heard of Dash during the 2017 bull run, after that it was so quiet that some of us forget how Dash it. Or maybe not just Dash, it's all of the privacy coins that has been under attack specially by the government around the world.Some major exchanges has delisted most of the privacy coins and then US trying to pay bounty for some clever 'hackers' to break Monero anonymity, so I guess that's the final nail in the coffin for all privacy coins that's why Dash didn't even get to see a new all time high.",

Most of them have not lived up to the hype they had back then in 2017 just like Monero, Decred, Zcash etc. This probably due to the fact that most of the popular exchanges started delisting such coins as a result of regulatory pressure.We all know that demand and supply dictate the price of an asset, with no much demand, the price is bound to keep dropping over time and that is what is happening to DASH.",

It hasn't been shilled for some time now, which is very bad for Dash. Well i would say that Dash was never really the king off all cryptos, because that always was and definitely still is Bitcoin and it will probably stay that way at least for a few more years. I would also say, that Dash was also never the King of altcoins because that is Ethereum. As far as i know, Dash was a pretty big project back in 2017 and 2018 and it was also during that time that Dash reached it's ATH of more than 1200$ per coin. Sadly for Dash it seems like privace focused crypto projects are just not in the focus of most crypto investors at the moment. That is also the reason why Dash was not able to reach it's ATH from 2018 in the bull run of 2020 and 2021. So i would say Dash is definitely not a king at the moment.",

It hasn't been shilled for some time now, which is very bad for Dash. I can’t recall a moment that DASH leads the market, so this slogan is an old trick to fool people which I think they didn’t succeed on this one. I can’t see any good updates with DASH anymore, so probably that king statement is already outdated and can’t produce any hype anymore. Better to avoid this project as regulations continues making pressure to them, they are dropping that much.",

The privacy feature is just an option for users.Maybe they even lost their integrity to a lot of investors when they came out and did a 180 degree.DASH is one of oldest altcoins and it got great success in 2017 and 2018 bull run after that the altcoin has never been able to reclaim their all time high in 2018. It had some great rallies in 2019 and 2020 but its performance can not be compared to Ethereum or Monero, other two big altcoins in 2018 bull run.I believe one of disadvantages for DASH coin is its reward structures to stakers and masternode owners that is unfair and many people complain about that. Moreover, it had some attacks together with other privacy coins recent years. People are still careful with privacy coins but Monero is an exception, it got great rise in 2020 bull run.DASH revoked its design for privacy transactions to avoid further attack on it but I don't know it is good or bad response from their team. So far, it looks to cause a bad journey for DASH. Price can not grow up in last three years.",

It hasn't been shilled for some time now, which is very bad for Dash. It should not be that surprising that the interest on Dash decreased significantly over the years, as it has been pointed out governments have been trying everything they have in their arsenal against privacy coins as it is simply not on their best interests that such coins become used by everyone.However another reason why Dash and other privacy coins are not getting the same kind of interest from the community has to do with the current batch of newbies not being interested as much in their privacy as previous newbies, basically new users for the most part are willing to share their personal information with any centralized entity that ask them for this information, and for people like them a privacy coin is basically useless as it offers them nothing which they may want.",

But looking at some info at masternodes.online, it's ROI annually is just like 5% with a $50k+ worth of capital.Honestly, it was expensive before and I thought that it has gone lower during this bear market but it seems not. Those that are still holding it from long time ago are just making easy passive income on it but if you're going to get on it, I'll choose to buy bitcoin with such capital.",
