From the  year 2011, I was fascinated to mobilise online Gold bonds from different friends & Relatives through a Online Gift Campaign company charging  around 20 to 30 USDs as campaign fee to advertise in medias like Facebook to mobilise small gifts from all friends & Relatives & gift a Gold chain to the Birthday boy or a House to the wedding Bride / Bridegroom.......through BTC Mobilisation Globally....!!!",

Let's say I am far off and I want to send a gift to someone I believe it has to be something good, so this days you can buy things online and even get it delivered to where you want it delivered, so I don't think there is a problem that need solution in that area.",

Today it is normal for every birthday boy to get more than 100 birthday wishes on Facebook from more than a dozen countries. Instead, if these 100 best wishes on Facebook, were converted to Gold bonds.....10 milligrams of Gold costs 1.20 USD / 1.50 SGD / 340.00 SLR / 00.92 GBP / 4.20 AER  / 4.30 SAR / 1.10 EUR / Equivalent BTC, would total to around 20 grams of Gold chain for the birthday boy consolidating all mini gifts from different friends / Relatives from different countries. This will be a good model of BTC Adoption practically in all countries & societies.",

Your hope makes sense if people use Bitcoin regularly already, so I don't think it will drive adoption that much. I agree that a business can take this angle to offer a competitive proposition. I don't think marketing to encourage people to give birthday gifts will be enough to drive up the volume. It's not like a person always has a close friend who lives abroad. CMIIW.",

Yes gifting items like physical bitcoins for example are also a great way to give bitcoin to someone that maybe doesn't know exactly how it works or even has a bitcoin address as well. The whole process here of reaching out to them or having them set up a bitcoin QR code for a wedding or something is definitely a great idea though, results definitely may vary though. I would honestly expect to see more types of those posts on social media advertised like a go fund me page or something.",

Thank You Queentoshi for your valuable Opinion & Feedback. For a Campaign Fee of just $ 10 to 20, every birthday boy is likely to get a Gold Gift of above 10 grams. Here in India, spot Gold of a quarter / half gram too is available. I have been working on this project since 2011. For this to take off, I have a strong Business plan, but to take off, Good advertising & partnership of a few sovereign countries is needed since people will not trust a private company & may brand it a FLY BY NIGHT Company....I am approaching a few countries to partner, so that people may have confidence...& I am sure some countries WILL DEFINITELY Partner due to their bad Economy & share of Profits from the Daily volume of business generated",

If every friend of the Birthday boy gifts just ONE DOLLAR / TWO or THREE Dollars, it is OK. Uncles, Aunts, Close Relatives will feel below their dignity to Gift One Dollar, they will definitely Gift above $10.
