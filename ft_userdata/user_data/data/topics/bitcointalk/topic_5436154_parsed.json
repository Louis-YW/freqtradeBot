Op should rather focus on being a good user of the forum and not a campaign manager, i don't think any campaign manager in the forum joined because they wanted to be one, i am sure they joined to use the forum like every other member, but along the line they developed reputation here and desired to offer their services as a manager.Campaign management isn't probably the best skill for the OP, we have seen managers lose campaign funds, another case happened recently, but i won't link it here. Being a campaign manager requires the person to be careful and attentive to security, but OP doesn't seem to be that, according to his story it was very easy for his roommate to access his PC and steal his coins, that isn't a good trait of someone who is going to handle thousands of Dollars for numerous campaigns if they ever become a campaign manager.",

      "body": "OP, let me get this straight, you're looking to level up your career and become a freelance virtual assistant? In that case, my friend, your first post here might not be the best way to make that happen.First things first, I suggest you create a portfolio. A portfolio serves as an excellent tool to present your work and highlight your skills to potential clients. If you currently do not have any work to showcase, you can offer your services to potential clients for free to gain experience and build up a portfolio. Secondly, focus on building a strong online presence. Having a website, a blog, and being active on social media platforms can help you connect with potential clients and keep you on their mind. Lastly, when it comes to your approach to your future employers, I suggest you brush up on your English skills, and try with something like this:QuoteHello,I am currently looking to grow my career and work as a freelance professional in my field of expertise. If you can assist me in finding jobs and opportunities to showcase my skills, it would be greatly appreciated. I am open to working as a virtual assistant and am willing to put in the effort to help you with your projects. Thank you in advance for your support and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Or better, as suggested in post above, make your portfolio in Services board. BTW, now you're breaking forum rules by making few posts in a row, it's not allowed. You can reply to multiple posts in single message. I advice you to check forum rules:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0",

To stay happy, you must accept whatever life offers you, and don't worry about the things you don't have rather think about the big things that keeps you happy. You've got lots of meaningful skills that can declare you a self made individuals, if only channeled the right way. Amongst the skills on your list, I'd say SEO is the hottest, and you should use other skills on that list to promote the SEO skill. IG ads, and FB ads are good ways to reach out to some audience that'll need the SEO skills, all you'll need is a good CV and portfolio. If that's in place you've solved your problems halfway. Now, I'd predict you don't have much funds to power the ads as it requires big budgets. For you to get some bucks, the service section is a good start for you. Always put the past to shame and focus on your next objectives. Within a few months or two, you'll get used to the journey you're about to begin.",

QuoteIf anyone helps me to grow my career to work freelance to get jobs providing my skill then it will be my achievement.

Even if your friend cheated on you, this is a failure of your safety measures. This is bad and will be used as a negative point in your file.Second: You first have to get some \"good reputation\" on the forum because Newby members are suspicious by default at first until proven otherwise.In any case, it is good that you use your skills to get a job here in the forum. I hope that one of the campaign managers will hire you as his assistant after you gain his confidence.good luck",

But, OP seem to have ignored these skills and focused on cryptocurrency investment. Now, in need of funds, he wants to ignite his knowledge on those skills. Assuming, OP, practiced often those skills he listed, he wouldn't have been left with fewer or no clients, while you practice,often, skills like IG ads campaign you'll get rewards; clients or customers. It's one good thing about OP's niche, unfortunately he left them behind. Though, like I told him earlier, he needs to channel those skills to suit one aim. Taking them one step at a time would yield him enough results.",
