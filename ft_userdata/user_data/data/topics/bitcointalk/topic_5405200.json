If it is banned, it means no cryptocurrencies  that would be created in US again, which is not possible. Regulating altcoins is different from banning encryption.",

Bitcoin will be the one cryptocurrency mostly affected by the government's measures.No matter what is solution or tool used by governments, Bitcoin will be their first target if they are aiming at cryptocurrencies.

I could be wrong but in my opinion, they can not.They can not ban the Internet, can not ban Tor connection. So will they successfully restrict how people use electricty?Some countries can do it but having it at global scale is impossible. Fortunately, Bitcoin network is decentralized, globally and it will survive.",

When Russia accepted bitcoin and cryptocurrencies partly to evade sanctions and the US did not take any action at that time so there's no reason they should ban it from now on. The world is no longer just America's, the axis of world power is shifting, the US banning something deemed harmful to them is no guarantee that other countries will follow.",

So was meth and other illegal drugs. So were other crimes. So is there any reason why encryption or cryptography's declaration as illegal would make Bitcoin cease to exist? Can't think of any.

I just want to ask sir, do you have a source link or article on this thing you say the U.S. did about Cryptocurrency? Because, it seems that this is just a story from your own point of view Sir. It would have been a better discussion if you had references to hold. You know the other community here on this forum will inevitably criticize you for losing any source. Moreover, Bitcoin has been surviving in the industry for almost ten years and is still being enjoyed by Bitcoin Enthusiasts in this world we live in today.",

With such an increased usage, ban over encryption algorithms will lead to collapse of the internet. The much used industries were the finance, medical, bio technology and media. So, such a law isn't gonna pass.Earlier when internet usage started to increase, there were rumours that it is going to be banned.

I believe bitcoin will still survive with or without a ban. we have already a long time here, so we don't need surprise about any kind of ban, what else if only 1 country, and sometimes even if it's a superpower country, infrequent other countries follow them because has other basic rules for each them which is different culture and tradition. And sometimes if a country wants to implement that rules, will be detained in the people's council.",
