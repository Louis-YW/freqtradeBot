  "content": "Taking Defi mainstream is no easy task (I guess ) here it enters the Rebus project on the Cosmos ecosystem! https://www.rebuschain.com/TradFi and DeFi hand in hand? Well we can argue that an intersection bridging the two worlds together could massively benefit the Crypto space, leading to the mass adoption everyone seems to be talking about.But is Defi easy to access and trustworthy enough for serious new investors, who have never tried to manage cryptocurrencies?Investment in crypto assets is bound to grow, and naturally more people are turning to their traditional financial institutions expecting crypto services to be available. Thatâ€™s where Rebus comes in, assisting in building the best crypto products possible for conventional financial establishments.The Cosmos ecosystem allows this type of operation to take place with success. Cosmos is built to be natively interoperable, allowing chains to intercommunicate with the Rebus chain easily. It also allows full sovereignty in running operations, making the regulations and law compliance a checked mark on the list.The https://www.rebuschain.com/ will build the first set of DeFi Instruments, or products, the platform is designed to allow building for 3rd parties,and platform partners.Each channel partner will have the benefit of evaluating and vetting instruments before offering to their clients, just as they would with anything else.This eliminates the need for investors to take unique steps just to diversify into this new digital asset class.In addition, investors can rely upon their trusted advisors to protect them from illegitimate offers that only benefit founding members.The $REBUS token, the native coin of the Rebus chain, carries a variety of use cases within the ecosystem, including securing the PoS, governance and paying for fees.Ease of access, trust, and portfolio diversification. That is what makes me follow this $REBUS token and project.",
