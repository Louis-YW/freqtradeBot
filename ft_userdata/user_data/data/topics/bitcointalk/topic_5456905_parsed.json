But overall, it's a very difficult prospect. Also, by borrowing, I think you mean a kind of credit system. There is no such thing as a loan in credit systems, they will ask you for interest in any case. If you say that you will do something like this, if you have the opportunity, it is most logical to apply for bank loans. But I must state that you should definitely not invest with borrowed money. The probability of losing is very high.",

You can try to borrow ethereum through some defi sites like Aave but the problem is, do you have collateral for doing it? i meant you shall have collateral to get approven borrowing ethereum to be used to buy bitcoin. If you have no collateral and you cannot do it. It's caused by the platform will ask your collateral first before you will be able to borrow ethereum from there. There are so many lending sites in crypto. You can try to take a look at this articlehttps://learn.bybit.com/defi/best-crypto-lending-platforms/It gives you lots of lending sites in the crypto, but to be honest, you will be doing a high-risk decision.",

You are referring to ETH (altcoin) and BTC, maybe you have also researched some DEFI lending platforms, honestly it is quite simple and has nothing to share, you can check the requirements yourself. request and accept participation. But from my experience with crypto loans, I would mortgage less volatile ones like BTC and ETH to borrow stablecoins and use stablecoins to buy altcoins and make short-term profits but there will be risks, and not recommended for those Who does not know proper capital management. Currently the market is having bad fluctuations, so please limit borrowing and investing, it is better to study and accumulate over time until things get better.",

I'm interested in taking adventage of price action so could be settled off-chain.So if I'm right, the plan is to get an ETH loan, buy BTC with it and hope that ETH falls and BTC rises so you can get the best of both worlds? Sounds solid only if it wasn't such a dumb idea really. Taking a loan to invest, especially in a highly volatile investment sounds dumb, and you want to do it in both sides?Even the idea of getting a loan sounds dumb already imo. Just DCA if you really want to invest, no need to rush your investments. The only thing that's rushing id your demise.",

You use your ETH as collateral and you get BTC to do what you wish.

Quote from: Greg Tonoski on June 19, 2023, 08:27:06 PMI'm interested in taking adventage of price action so could be settled off-chain.But before borrowing, this is like an arbitrage that you want to do. I don't think that someone will be easy on you and will just allow you to borrow money. Just a tip, I've seen people that have borrowed money to invest in crypto and then they've ended up with a bad fate. Or you can explain more about your plans but still, I doubt it that there's a platform that you'll be ever allowed to borrow without a guaranteed collateral even if you put this plan on their table.",

It contains more risk than trading or investing with your own money.Because you will have to pay loan interest and a bigger risk from liquidation from a loan service provider or an exchange. My advice is don't borrow money in person or with leverage on exchanges.Why do you need to borrow ETH to buy BTC?The market works like this, Bitcoin leads it so if Bitcoin falls, ETH falls and it will decrease your loan collateral that will cause bigger risk of forced liquidation.",

IF you know what I mean.Sure it was 69K at one point for a short time, but for a much longer time it was 10k and 2k and 1k.Of course the currenct price is something to take advantage of, you might never see the price as low as 10k, 2k or 1k again, thus 27k can be considered as a low price to accumulate. If you think Bitcoin price stays low for a longer time, then sell whenever it appreciates and you accrue ROI on the amount you bought. The thing is, OP's proposed strategy isn't advisable, do not accumulate with borrowed funds, or through staking and other whatnots, DCA strategy is there to enable one buy conveniently if you do not have money to buy with a lump sum. Thus there is no reason to borrow or engage with risky earning platforms to acquire Bitcoin, buy periodically and with the money that you can afford.",

I think the colleague above is very correct, so that you also take into account how much interest you have to pay for the eth loan, especially if the loan has to be paid with eth, then it doesn't seem like it will be maximized because eth will also increase when btc goes up. it would be better to just borrow money if you really want to do it but always do research since when you started borrowing, so it doesn't take too long and you can get a price increase quickly and on time. as long as borrowing is used properly, I think it's good to do.",
