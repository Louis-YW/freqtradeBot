  "content": "Bitcoin BTC managed to surpass the $19,000 level towards the end of October. The king coin was constrained to this level for the longest time and made several attempts to move past it. Both holders and watchers rejoiced because they believed that this time, the end of the long-term resistance may signal the beginning of a new rise.Furthermore, those who had taken short positions against BTC BTC were also liquidated during this small price increase. Despite this encouraging trend, things didn’t appear to be going well for miners in the ecosystem.BTC https://cryptoqed.com/news/bitcoin-news/could-bitcoin-security-be-at-risk-as-a-result-of-this-update-decoding-detailsWaiting for your comments",

Good enough comment?Since the hash rate is on the rise, it's clear that the number of miners unplugging their gears is small. Even more, the price is actually over 20k, hence on a tiny rise. Plus, miners disconnected their gears in other crypto winters and Bitcoin survived. Now, with this huge hash rate (you conveniently shown the chart for only one month, instead of an entire year that shows we're pretty much at ATH as hash rate), some miners plugging out simply don't matter in the big picture.",

      "body": "It's supposed miners will quit to mine since hash rate and the liquidity are very high, that's make it's not profitable for them to mine Bitcoin, right? Although they're quit to mine, but they're still can contribute on the network and get a fee by complete each block. It doesn't have relation with Bitcoin's security, actually when hash rate are high this make 51% attack is more and more seems impossible to happen.",

      "body": "Quote from: cryptoqed websiteA reduction in network security may occur as a result of too many miners giving up. The mining could become more centralized when more miners leave the network and are replaced by others who have greater financial resources. Block manipulation could result from this, which could result in theft or other illegal activity on the network.Who wrote this part of the article? Manipulated block (such as including transaction which use non-existent UTXO or set mining reward to 21MBTC) will simply rejected by all nodes (which could be run by pool, exchange or individual user).",

Despite this encouraging trend, things didn’t appear to be going well for miners in the ecosystem.It seems like you're a miner or rather have someone close to you been a miner but that is nit enough fact to conclude on such assumptions and if you have invested already in the past that after your buying comes in the dip in price makes to to loose hope that miners have gone liquidated, this little shift in price towards $20.6k range is resistive to go below than maintaining the uptrends, you should ask yourself what have the miners been feeding at since the previous dip before now, this will gives you more insight about bitcoin volatility, where you get the ATH and ATL and miners had been making it through since ever then, so this shouldn't be a different case for creating an alarm.",
