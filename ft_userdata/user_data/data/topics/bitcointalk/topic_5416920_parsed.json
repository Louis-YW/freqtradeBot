  "content": "Hi, guys!I'm back with a new podcast episode. This time, I'm interviewing Austrian economist Rahim Taghizadegan. When I met him this summer at Mallorca Blockchain Days, he held a presentation about the cult-like nature of Bitcoin communities and to which extent this is good for the money system.So I've decided to bring him on my podcast. Since he is well-acquainted with Austrian economic literature (he teaches it himself at academic level), I've also asked him some questions related to human action and how BTC adoption works (bottom up through communities or top-down via nation states). Other topics include the pros and cons of maximalism, as well as protocol ossification.Here's where you can listen to the interview.

With the label of cult, there can be some people who are turned off with that something being described as such. As for me, as long as that cultish community is not involved with anything illegal or destructive in nature then I am so fine with it...and I don't really care what other people or the so-called experts can be thinking about it. We are now in the information era...we don't anymore experts condescending telling us anything on something.",

      "body": "Reading the topic of this discussion OP, I had to go check out the typical characteristics of a cult group, so I can on my own compare it with the characteristics of this community to see if there is a similarity. These are some of the characteristics I could find;QuoteThe group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment.The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.The group is preoccupied with making money.Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group.Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.sourceNow comparing those characteristics;QuoteThe group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment.Can we say this is Satoshi?QuoteThe group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.I don't think there is any strong rule that you must bring people to the forum.QuoteThe group is preoccupied with making money.We love money yes, but it is not the primary purpose of this forum, I believe the primary objective here is for knowledge and not money.QuoteQuestioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished. Almost all sorts of questions and enquiries to know more are entertained on this forum, we are all here to learn.QuoteMembers are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group.The forum is a free place, you decide the time you want to be active.QuoteMembers are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.Privacy is key, and even though we are in the same forum, it is still often advised that you still exercise caution with other members.In conclusion, there is a reason why there is the word ''community'' and the word ''cult''. IMO while they may share some similarities, the two word do not exactly refer to the same thing. Cult is the extreme of a community.",

Although there are those who just want to make money, and those who are really interested in technology, as you already well noticed, we don't have a leader, nor do we go around telling people what to do with their money.To me, all these so-called experts who compare us with some kind of cults, criminals, terrorists or environmental destroyers are someone who should be dealt with by real experts, of course those who study human behavior and the brain.",

Everyone wants profit from their investment which makes the tendency high for investors to move as one based on the market behavior. Perhaps there is a price increase, most of the investors will avoid selling early not because they planned it, but simply because they are all eyeing to a bigger profit. Also, in something which is controlled by demand, the best way to survive or to benefit from it is to move or go with the flow of the majority because quantity is the bottomline. Try moving on the opposite, I doubt if it would give you a better outcome.",

As for the headline, I feel like the idea was already disproved in this thread, but despite that, I'll try to listen and make my own mind about the points that you make. After a few minutes of listening, I feel like making a point about people having a subjective understanding of value is completely true, but this doesn't make us a cult in any way. Let's say, I have a car that my father used to drive and I wouldn't sell it for $100k, although the current market value is $10k. That said, you could say it's worth 5k to you and that's all you'd be willing to pay. Does that make any of us right or wrong? No. I see the value in it, the majority sees another value and you can say it has no value to you. We will all be right. I like bitcoin, I wouldn't sell it for $20k, but the market price today is as low as 18k. I don't see any reason to sell my coins and there will be people who will say that they wouldn't even pay 10k for it. That's fine, but the thing is they don't have to, just as I don't ever have to sell. I can give it to my children and let them decide what value it has to them.",

Advocating/ Lobbying for the Growth and further adoption of Bitcoin around the Globe. Aside learning bout Bitcoin, I've learned learned positive criticisms is no bad thing, learned some new word's, and also trying to handle bashing online. In everything there's a piece of good innit, so I'm being focused on what improves my rational faculty daily.The Fiat Currencies have done more harm than good, the more deep you go digging bout it, the more you see they're backed by government as well as CDBC'S. the limitations of fiat currencies didn't affect OP during COVID-19 I guess, ain't it ?",

I think the mainstream media are to blame for the \"cult\" label that are plastered on Bitcoin communities, because they are pushing the hidden agenda of the puppet masters that wants to create that perception. (They are scared of the disruptive potential of the Bitcoin technology)Â  Well, the \"cult\" isn't exactly what the mainstream media describes us. It's also how we show up at conferences worshipping certain individuals (in the past, Andreas Antonopoulos and more recently Michael Saylor), buying the same \"Don't trust, verify\" merchandise (even if we are not technically competent enough to verify our own code), reading the same books (\"The Bitcoin Standard\" is in the bookshelf of pretty much every bitcoiner on Twitter) and posting pictures of the same devices (it used to be the Trezor, now the Coldcard is the cool maximalist device). There are community members who spend every day telling their friends and social media followers that everything will be divided by 21 million (the BTC supply) and that Bitcoin is \"element zero\" in chemistry.There are many nuances, and it seems that every adoption cycle brings in people who are more willing to follow a narrative than to approach Bitcoin critically. You should spend a day reading what's going on in the community chats of Samourai wallet or Coldcard users. I'm convinced that these are bona fide \"micro cults\". And I get it, I know why this is happening. But this doesn't mean that we should indulge in the shallow \"Bitcoin fixes this\" mindset. If you spend too much time on Bitcoin Twitter, you will feel like a cult member â as there are even gatekeepers and hound dogs (Mr. Hodl, Dieter Bob) who do nothing but police other people's speech and bully them into a uniform way of thinking. Even if it's for a good cause, I think we should reflect more on how we're actually improving the world.",

They're either regulating it via taxes or they're banning it. That seems to be the two most common approaches to it. However, I do doubt they fear it. Bitcoin isn't meant to take over, it's meant to provide an alternative, which I do think a lot of people concentrate on it taken over. and judge success based on that fact. When in reality it's unlikely to ever do that.It's not exactly new technology either. A lot of what Bitcoin has implemented was thought of many years ago. The difference for me is while there was ideas of a decentralised currency, Satoshi is the only one to bring it to life, setting him apart from the rest.",
