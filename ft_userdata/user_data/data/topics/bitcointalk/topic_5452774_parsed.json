  "content": "Hello everyone.Lately, I've been talking with a lot of people on this forum and before that, I really thought that most people here treat Bitcoin as a technology that gives us freedom and represents ideas of satoshi, but I realized that everyone I talked to treat it just like an asset to invest in.I don't want to say that it's bad, it's just surprising me. I created a thread where I asked if people think that Bitcoin will become stable enough to become a new currency cos I thought it was the whole idea, but everyone was telling me that it will always fluctuate and it's just a method to earn money.What do you guys think about that? Do you think it's okay that we as a community treat Bitcoin as an asset and not as a technology that should be used to give people freedom from the banks?Personally, I think that Bitcoin is a great asset, but it's strange to think that crypto just becomes a new stock market where people follow hype and money, and not technology and progress.",

Its quite bias that you talked to people and thats what they answered. Its best that youved asked here since many could voice out what they think. But for me, it signify as an asset for now and store of value since Im not using it on my daily needs or transaction. Maybe if bitcoin adopted more it could be a useful for everyone and establishments already recognize that to use on their stores, shops, restaurant. But I think a long way to go to be global yet. But some already using it for that purpose already.",

In essence, it is still itself, the features or limitations are up to us to judge for ourselves, and it is not uncommon for someone to see only limited issues to discuss or vice versa. about the positive rhyme that will help. I personally see that bitcoin has changed a lot and to this day looking at how new people learn about it and people who have been involved for a long time have completely different views, over time I Can imagine some things changing and bitcoin will also be received the way things are.",

Bitcoin is too narrow if we compartmentalize it in one \"term\" which can be much broader if we can see it from various perspectives. So whatever people see it, whether it's as an asset or investment or a movement, just let it be like that because Satoshi created Bitcoin not only as a digital asset, but more than that.",

BTC is censorship resistant, you can't censor people or tell them what to do with their BTC's. BTC is permissionless, people do not need permission from you to use BTC for any reason and purpose; it is a free market. Trying to tell people what to do with their BTC's is almost like censorship, because if you use fiat you can be censored by the government or bank, they can freeze your account and stop you from spending, or give you a limit, but when people choose BTC it is because they want to use their coins how they like.",

Going by the bitcoin white paper, the other part of regarding bitcoin as an asset to be traded or invested upon for financial return could be regarded as secondary while the other part of freedom for the people to have their privacy and financial freedom against government control is the primary objective of bitcoin. So the way we can analyse your question is that it is both primary and secondary purpose which is for financial freedom in control and privacy through virtual cryptographic techniques and the secondary purpose is to regard it as an asset that is not regulated.",

So I think Bitcoin is not bad even he gave me an advantage. Indeed, instability is a strong reason to say bitcoin is dangerous.
