  "content": "I have a old laptop which is not working very well with Windows 10 Pro up to recent updates. I bought it with windows 10 and it was working efficiently until many updates and I started to noticed it is not working very well like before even after I deleted over 400 gigabyte of files on it. This makes me to think of experiencing Linux instead of reverting back to Windows 10 lower version.I have seen some guide about Linux. It is an open source operating system and I noticed there are many Linux distributions (distros). According to my research, there are over 600 distros, but the most common one is Ubuntu. There are other common ones like Dubian, CentOS, Fedora, Mint and many other ones.I have chosen to use Ubuntu though which will require around 4.75 gigabyte of download and burn it on to a USD drive and install it in a way it would delete everything I have before on my laptop. I think I will understand the whole process but I have a question. What is the advantage of Ubuntu over other Linux distros?",

      "body": "Ubuntu has the best repositories where it's almost guaranteed the sotfwares are the most recent. However, Ubuntu requires hardware requirements that your old laptop might not have especially the latest LTS. The best alternative for it is the Mint. It's lightweight and they are also using Ubuntu's repositories. There are certainly lighter Distros than Mint but you may find them not user-friendly because you will be using the CLI for installing some software because they don't have the Synaptic Manager.",

But those who are new to Linux or are not much familiar with Linux commands must go with distribution with Ubuntu. The reason is its has a GUI based interface (a bit different from Windows though) that lets you do everything like installing a software without running commands.Plus there is huge community support available for Ubuntu as compared to other distributions.",

The free term in Linux not only means it's free to download and use, it's more then that. You are free to tweak with Linux kernel the way you want and there are lots of free softwares that works best on Linux they are not only free to use but free to customise according to your requirements. Linux is more secure definitely because of its underlying file system. Make sure your root is secure and no one can touch your distribution.",

Right out of the box, Ubuntu provides a smooth, intuitive user experience for people of all technical skill levels. Yet as an open-source operating system built on Debian's architecture, it retains the customizability and breadth of available software that technical users appreciate. Canonical's dedication provides Ubuntu users reasonably seamless security updates as well, helping protect systems. And Ubuntu's vast developer community translates to answers and documentation for virtually any issue users may face. With options from enterprise servers to single board computers, Ubuntu scales from casual home use all the way up to powering critical infrastructure. Its flexibility empowers people to revitalize old hardware, satisfy special use cases, and reduce costs. For newcomers and experts alike, Ubuntu removes friction so the OS gets out of the user's way while remaining deeply capable on demand. Both pragmatic and empowering, for many workflows Ubuntu simply provides the best Linux desktop experience.",

I personally don't like to use Ubuntu as its interface it too fancy for me and that's why I use derivatives like Lubuntu which is a cut down version of Ubuntu for low end systems and it works smoothly on high end systems as well. The difference between Lubuntu and Ubuntu is the desktop environment, the Ubuntu uses Gnome as its desktop environment while Lubuntu uses LXQt as its desktop environment. You can install same applications on both of those distros but I would still go with Lubuntu as it's interface is easy and it runs pretty fast.You can also check also distros which are designed to do specific tasks. I prefer you to try Puppy Linux that's one of the fastest distros out there and it loads directedly into the ram. Just 300 MB in size but a good one. You can also try Ubuntu Mate as that one is also a good distro with Mate desktop environment. The Ubuntu Mate works like a charm on my old Raspberry pi 3B and it works similarly on my old laptop.",
