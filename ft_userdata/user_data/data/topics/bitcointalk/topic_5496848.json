The qualifications are there and the steps on how to apply is there. Actually, there's really no difference at all when you're trying to land a job in the Bitcoin/crypto industry with the convention or traditional jobs that you are applying for. I can't say if there are a lot of roles that are for part time but start out with the known exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc.",

Starting here in forum, you can post about yourself and your services that you are willing to offer. That is if you want almost a freelancing job. But if you want to be contract-based and you want to work in a proper company then you should seek out companies who are related to crypto. I say good luck in all your endeavors!",

If you are smart and have special skills, you can apply for it in the IT department, especially in keeping exchanges stolen by thieves and you know exchanges are very large pools and are still seen as weak by them.If you do it well and correctly then many people will feel safe and comfortable putting their money to invest and trade on the exchange. A lot of money will come in where you work. Don't be like the case of Bitforex which has not been clear until now and is still not accessible until now.",

Introduce yourself, put all your strengths there, your experience and skills to offer. Then just apply in different places and see where that leads you.

Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you! Look what you should do is invest yourself into the BTC market if you're so sure about your skills and if you're not that much sure that you should work on your skills more so that you can gain the confidence to invest your own assets first.It's very easy to give advice on someone else's money but when it comes to your own money then your real skills will be tested. It will be more beneficial for you also because when you'll bear the pressure of losing your money then you'll work hard on your skills and in order to improve them.",

I think a lot of companies would be eager to hire someone who is not too proud to admit his mistakes and learn from them. That's true. I don't think there's pride in anything the OP has written here and he's neither persuading anyone to forcefully believe in him but that's left for anyone who wants to engage him further. The best we can do for him in this particular thread is to assist him with options or avail him with the opportunities and where he can tap into them. Everyone on the forum today, I believe, came in for a purpose, one of which ours maybe similar or different. So if the OP is here to sell his strength and skills to the forum members to get more opportunities, it is okay to me that he does that. Aside that, you can always advise OP to deep dive into a list of known blockchain/crypto job listing sites such as:1. CryptoJobsList2. BitcoinJobs3. Crypto.Jobs4. CryptocurrencyJobs5. Crypto-Careers6. Wellfound7. Dream Startup Job8. UpWork",

I know of many Blockchain projects (startups and established) that are looking for skills such as his and just like @tabas said, exchanges are one of such reliable companies he can easily get a job to start from. Transitioning to blockchain might actually require some learning no doubt but he can learn on the job which is what I consider the most effective learning process. Simply consider his post as some kind of dropping his resume. He might also need some form of learning or at least basic refining to get started with investing in Bitcoin. A lot of knowledge have already been shared in this forum with respect to how to effectively invest in and manage Bitcoin portfolio for optimal result. The DCA method is an example of such methods with the aspect of setting up emergency funds being one fine addition I learnt by being active in this forum.",

Your best bet is to go to local and international crypto meetups and conferences, meet people who work in the bitcoin, crypto and blockchain industry and try to make a connection with them, networking is the key to success and building a good career. When you don't have experience, you usually need someone to give you a recommendation but there is also another way, to influence the company where you work to implement cryptocurrencies or to build a project around crypto, motivate them to step in the crypto world, show them the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies and show them the reasons why crypto is the future and they shouldn't miss such an important opportunity.",
