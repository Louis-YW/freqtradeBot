  "content": "According to the ongoing rumours, everyone is scared of the crypto ban in the US.If the liquidity is reduced from the market then the crypto market retraces again.The Hot Topic Staking Ban can be seen on everyone's lips. According to a recent tweet by Brain Armstrong, the head of the largest crypto exchange, crypto has become a matter of great concern for now. That said, the US SEC may close the stake in the United States.If this happens then a scary effect can be seen on the crypto market.Liquidity will decrease sharplyVolatility will also be lessOverall crypto market cap could be under $1 billionBitcoinBTC could again move towards 52-week lows as the leader of the rest of the altcoins.",

OP, I believe this thread should be move to the altcoins discussion section, Bitcoin is proof of work by the way.",

It's not like they plan to ban PoS coins, they just don't let exchanges that legally operate in the US to provide staking services. Crypto gambling addicts will still be able to gamble with shitcoins if they want to.And most importantly, Bitcoin is not affected. And Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that matters.",

In any case, preventing staking isn't really terrible for Bitcoin. Holders of altcoins would suffer if staking was prohibited, which is bad news. However, some people will go to any lengths to attempt and discredit bitcoin. Actually, it makes no difference because Bitcoin is completely decentralized and won't affect FUD for a very long time.",

That means there would be likely appeals and counter measures to protect the right of the american people to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets.",

Â fixed that for youright now users are STUCK with the coins being lockedyes they can 'aftermarket' sell ownership rights of their stake but that stake is still locked(whomever owns it cant remove it) untill the upgradeswhat you will find out is thatethereum sat at $1.5k when PoW due to there being a underlying \"non zero\" bottom cost (mining) of ~$900 meaning the price was speculating at a 1.6x premium just before Pos detonation/mergehowever due to locks and crossborder arbitrage. that market price stayed speculative high. (check the market wiggle.. Eth does not have its own dependant price discovery of random wiggles that are independent.. they are instead ghosting btc wiggles due to arbitrage at a 1:14 rate difference but majority of the time btc ups cause eth ups and btc downs cause eth downs.. tracing btc and not being independant)but the underlying non zero bottom value did drop last year. it dropped by 95% due to the Pos change from Pow costsnow it sits way below $40 wholesale cost to acquire ethso with alot of stakers making HUGE profits of the $40-$1.5k spread of value:premium speculation means that the 2023 eth price of $1.6k is a speculative bubble high now of a 40x speculative gap.. instead of last springs 1.6xso when they get the chance to remove stake and then spot market sell the coins they accumulated in the last year. expect a mass sell off. in short. the stake lock caused a log delay in the PoS value:price CORRECTION.. but it will happen",

      "body": "Kraken has just agreed to shutdown their staking services in a deal with the SEC.That's insane. But it confirms the SEC is looking to bar US citizens from staking through exchanges.Looks like in the future US citizens will just have to stake themselves directly on protocols rather than use the convenience of third party stakers like exchanges.I think this will hurt Ethereum a lot. Because ETH has much harder staking (forces you to have 32 ETH and you basically have to run a staking node, whereas lots of other coins you just stake through a validator and only the validators have to run a staking node) that means that most people in the US would have to stop staking ETH, while they could continue staking other PoS coins. If indeed the SEC does eventually ban 3rd party staking services which it certainly looks like they are planning after making Kraken shut down their staking.This is the sort of just blind bad regulation the industry doesn't need. We need exchanges transparent and held accountable, insurance for people's exchange holdings, and attempts to stop scams and illegal activity. What we DON'T need is just randomly banning crypto services just because the head of the SEC is on an anti-crypto power trip.",

If the staking ban.A ban on staking could result in a decrease in liquidity, which could lead to a drop in the overall crypto market capitalization. This in turn could lead to increased volatility and a decrease in the value of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. However, it is important to note that these are just rumors and speculations at this point, and it is difficult to predict the exact impact that a ban on staking would have on the crypto market. It is always important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.",

      "body": "Its only scary to people propagating lies. For example Cardano. Cardano is one of the most centralized projects ever and they claim not to be all the time. I even detailed a little document of evidence about it for fun:Evidence 1: Around 16% of ADA coins in circulation were given to the projectâs founders, who could remain among the biggest Cardano whales today. The remaining 84% was allocated to other investors.[capital.com/cardano-who-owns-most-ada-whales-control ]As you can read here a substantial portion of the supply was initially distributed to insiders of the project, there is no need for me to explain that this is not decentralized.Evidence 2: 75% of the validator set is made up by only 25 staking pools. as opposed to bitcoin or ergo where the nodes enforce SOFT FORK updates, these 25 validators control what is and is not the proof of stake chain cardano thereby putting all other users at risk of malicious updates by the economic minority.[https://cardanoscan.io/pools ]Evidence 3: IOHK making posts claiming to be 100% decentralized (context: the founder of cardano claiming that Cardano is decentralized, like satoshi nakomoto sticking around for 20 years putting his name on everything bitcoin selling tons of bitcoin and claiming it is decentralized) [https://heraldsheets.com/cardano-ada-is-now-100-decentralized/ ] Not even Ethereum lies to their own users this much, propaganda leads to DELUSION. so I highly recommend you STOP propagating the narrative that Cardano is decentralized or unfortunately Ergo will just suffer continuously in its VC funded shadow.Pretty much every other proof of stake protocol works in this way or in even more disturbingly centralized and Potemkin village type ways. Down with the shitcoins. On the other hand the regulators will regulate bitcoin too if they are to be trusted with more power. For that reason I am willing to side with shitcoins, simply because the government has not proved that they will respect bitcoin (USERS) in any way.",
