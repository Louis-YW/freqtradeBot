  "content": "Since August in my country, the price of food, especially food staples such as wheat, rice and others, has experienced a very high price increase. This was apparently caused by the ongoing drought. Which makes several areas of plantations and rice fields fail to harvest due to lack of availability of water to water the plants. And this makes food stocks in the market start to run low from time to time. And yes, the price hike ensued. Rice prices here have even increased by around 9-10 percent in the last month in my area. And I'm afraid the increase will continue. Because many residents are starting to talk that if the drought continues longer then it is feared that the increase will occur higher and faster. For farmers, it can be said that currently they are getting big profits because they can sell agricultural products at high prices. but for ordinary citizens who do not have agricultural land, the current food prices really make them tight.The residents' economic sector has actually begun to recover and improve in the past few months. But because at this time there was another spike in prices again, it made the people around me start to complain again about the current economy.But I was wondering if this only happened in my country or in your country too?",

Tomato used to cost $0.30 to $0.50 per kg, but the prices suddenly went up to $2.50 per kg. The government response was very lax, and therefore the hoarders got opportunity to indulge in black-marketing. And it is not just tomato. The price of other vegetables, as well as that of other staples such as wheat flour, sunflower oil and sugar has also gone up.",

You can find some deals but you will need to drive around from store to store and buy on certain days. Which is obviously not a solution for everybody. We got food banks here which are pretty much empty because over the last few years people are using them more and people are donating less because what you donate is becoming expensive. Most likely the prices will never come down people will just need to buy cheaper meats or eat different types of foods to survive.",

In Spain it has been very noticeable in some products. Watermelons and melons have had prohibitive prices this summer, apparently due to even higher than normal temperatures and lack of water in some areas, which has reduced production. The price of olive oil is also skyrocketing, in this case because although the new intensive crops are produced with drip irrigation, most of the production is dry-farmed, and the lack of rain in 2022 reduced production as well.",

      "body": "Maybe in several countries that have the same climate and weather, namely summer. So the conditions for an increase in several types of food may indeed experience the same thing in terms of an increase. Because some agricultural sectors such as rice fields will definitely not be able to be processed when there is no water. So it would be very natural if the price of rice will increase rapidly. But I believe the increase is only temporary. that is, it will only last until the rainy season returns. So don't worry. What we have to worry about is the current extreme weather that seems to be hitting several countries. And well the hot weather this season really is hotter than usual.But it would be better if we make proper preparations by stocking up as much food as we can buy.Regarding the price of wheat in the area where I work, there has not been a significant increase yet. or you could say it's still normal. But here the increase in the price of transportation costs is actually increasing. However, fuel prices have not yet increased. But somehow the cost of public transportation has increased.However, several industrial sectors currently seem to have progressed quite well. Because more and more workers are being absorbed at this time. or it could be said that many industries are opening job vacancies here. But regarding the salary here there is still no increase. So if food prices rise then of course this will burden people.",

Sometimes it even makes me wonder how people who are earning less than the minimum wage can even handle such a price hike someone like me who is fortunate enough to work for a good-paying company and have investments is struggling to keep my budget. For example, before the rise in food prices, I used to be able to go grocery shopping once a month with enough food to last until the first week of the next coming month, I also had spare grocery money to buy take-outs. However, these days my good for-monthly grocery budget can now only suffice 2 weeks' worth of food, sometimes even less when I want to cook something with more ingredients. Even fast food takeouts now seem like a luxury that I can't enjoy once a week due to guilt that I can just use the money to save it and spend on more important things for the house.",

As it is now, I don't believe there is a country in the world that is not experiencing the current one, or that didn't experience it as the case may be. Those who are saddled with the responsibility (government) will continue to manage it and try to curb it, however, I pity those countries in which governments are brainless and are for their own pockets. This is common in Africa and other developing countries, I'm afraid it might not stop in the near future in such places.It's a pity that such countries have good lands, mineral resources and able-bodied people to feed the nation and also export it to other countries, yet they wallow in poverty and continue to experience Inflation and Shrinkflation of products.",

Since the new president took office at the beginning of 2023, everything has changed, and the first thing to change is the price of fuel. In my country, if the price of fuel changes, everything else will follow because we all know how important and valuable fuel is to every nation. Since agricultural products are the most significant resource in every nation and the price of fuel has increased, this has had an impact on all of the nation's resources, including its supply of agricultural goods. As a result, now that even food prices have increased, no one can foresee what they will be.My concern is that the current state of affairs is beginning to negatively impact many citizens of the nation, especially the poor. Some citizens of the nation are already poor, making it difficult for them to eat, so how are they supposed to feed themselves now that food prices have increased?,I'm constantly wondering: Are the people who elected this government the ones who are suffering because of their decisions? To be if this is due to the government not knowing his responsibilities.",

In countries like United States, they are also experiencimg it, but it is better. What you are talking about is inflation and it is common in all countries but the severity is different. About food, that is the first thing that you should consider. But in my country, there are certain months that food price will be cheap during raining season, there are times in the dry seasons that food price will cost, depending on availability of the food. But there are some food that can be cheap during dry season and cost during raining season, example is banana.What I noticed is that food will be cheap when it is plenty in the market. The more the supply the less the price.",

In my country, the prices of food are going high every day. I just bought some loaves of bread and I had to pay double for them. This issue started immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine. This invasion affected the supply of major grains because Ukraine is a major supplier of these essential agricultural products. The price stabilized after the grain deal was signed between Russia and other parties. But the recent blockage by Russia has compounded the problem again. Russia's decision to annul the agreement has caused the world to experience another shortage in supply. The recent ban on rice export by the Indian government due to domestic issues like inflation has also affected the global price of grain. We cannot also neglect environmental issues like global warming which has led to flooding in some parts of my country. Many agricultural lands have been destroyed by floods leading to less production and price hikes.",

An increase of 10% is actually quite high, in my area it has been quite stable since the pandemic ended. Do farmers in your area only trade their products locally?",

Political and climatic variables are what control the price in addition to economic variables, and since climatic variables are bad, I think that if there is a political consensus, prices may decrease.You can compare the price in your country. Is the price in October of last year higher than the price at the present time? Did the price decrease until last June and start increasing?

I think they could be telling the truth but we live in seperate reality and will likely experience things differently.If you read posts on inflated prices and you believe them, the high price will become your reality & you will start seeing inflated products in real-time.It's hard not to believe those that you share thesame reality with. Better to avoid pessimistic people and be with people who are stronger/wisers.It's also important to avoid places that produce little but earn a lot. When you hear that wages are about to be increased in such places, that could mean increase in consumption and more inflation. Better to avoid such places. Live in places where production is higher than consumption. And much of the products have to remain locally rather than exported. Â Also avoid places where good quality is ignored in order to mass produce things and beat inflation. Always consume good quality products",

One reason is the impact of extreme weather conditions such as droughts or floods which can lead to crop failures & reduced harvests. Obviously transportation costs have risen which affects the price of importing and distributing food.
