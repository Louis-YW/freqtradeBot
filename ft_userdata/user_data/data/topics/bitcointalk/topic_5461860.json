  "content": "Standard government activity of late. Since it hasn't gone to trial, the SEC isn't required to give Coinbase discovery. But why wouldn't they? They will have to if they want to continue with a trial. Simply a bunch of bank-pushing BS against crypto.Coinbase CEO Says SEC Told It To Delist Everything But Bitcoin: Reporthttps://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/coinbase-ceo-says-sec-told-it-delist-everything-bitcoin-reportIn a July 31 interview with the Financial Times, Armstrong revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wanted the exchange to delist the nearly 250 tokens on its platform prior to it filing a lawsuit against the exchange.At the time, the SEC reportedly said it believes \"every asset other than Bitcoin is a security,\" said Armstrong.\"We said, well how are you coming to that conclusion? Because that's not our interpretation of the law,\" Armstrong added.He recounted that the regulator said, \"we're not going to explain it to you; you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.\"It's a similar view held by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who claimed in a February New York Magazine interview that \"everything other than Bitcoin\" is a security under the agency's remit.Armstrong said that agreeing to the SEC's request could've set a precedent and \"would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry\" in the United States.\"It kind of made it an easy choice [...] Let's go to court and find out what the court says.\"The SEC sued Coinbase in early June, alleging it operated as an unregistered exchange and named 13 cryptocurrencies it said Coinbase offered as unregistered securities. Days earlier, the regulator filed a similar complaint against Binance.The SEC told the Financial Times its enforcement division does not make formal requests for \"companies to delist crypto assets\" but that its staff may share its view on what actions could violate securities laws....",

Since the IRS is about to tax the staking of altcoins, they are demanding users report to IRS their stakes when this happens I guess they will also start liking shitcoins. Not all altcoins are shitcoins, though. We can't make such a bold statement when there are so many altcoins that have proven their worth and have a purpose in the cryptocurrency world. I don't disagree that there's an abundance of them that have absolutely no reason to exist, with hundreds popping up every single day, but we can't put them all in one basket. On top of that, if we suppose that all coins except Bitcoin are banned from exchanges, that would cause mayhem in the market and would definitely affect Bitcoin tremendously too. That would also eradicate any competition between different cryptocurrencies, turning investors away from them.",

As Coinbase generates its revenue from various trading activities, a potential reduction to just one trading pair could lead to a loss of users. Even if Coinbase continues to operate, such actions could significantly impact its share price in the stock market. This situation poses a potential threat to the crypto industry, and some perceive it as part of the recent drama surrounding US regulatory actions, where certain businesses are hindered from starting operations if they don't align with government preferences.",

I am not a Bitcoin maximalist but I think that other cryptocurrencies are considered by SEC as security and being a security they need to comply with some of the regulations the government imposes.  And many of these altcoins are not complying reason why the SEC wanted to halt the transactions of these altcoins that they think are securities.  This means, those suspected as \"security\" must prove that they are not or comply with the requirement before they can proceed to normal activities.Quote from: JoyMarsha on August 02, 2023, 08:48:13 PMIf SEC should succeed in this move on Coinbase, let it not come as a surprise when they will want more every other exchange to do the same, making them to have a monopoly over what goes on in all crypto exchanges.
