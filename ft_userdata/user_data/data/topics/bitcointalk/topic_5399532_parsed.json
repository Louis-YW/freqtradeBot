If you try to steal from someone else and get robbed in the process, it is fair enough to say you can have no complaints right?",

You'll never have to trust someone from these two channels and not even from strangers. Honestly, these scammers will talk to you nicely and aim for you to give trust them. They help you and later on, they will scam you.We don't just live ignorant about crypto, as we are investing in this, therefore, it was important to know how this actually works. We don't let other people manage to do transactions on our behalf, it was advisable to do this using reputable exchanges, not strangers.",

Yeah, there might be such things as luck or grace but even then, you've got to put in some effort to attract those.When it comes to getting scammed by the means as in OP, it's very possible and for sure, it still happens. People are getting scammed by even worst schemes or techniques so classic that it's supposed to have to have completely diluted. Ignorant forks are still everywhere and needs to be given this awareness.Although as shaddy as the scheme is, it actually hurts the evil minded and greedy once. Why would someone without being contacted try to recover a wallet address that deonst belong to him or her. It's something that ought not to happen if you believe in an honest living and keep clean.",

Isn't that stealing of whatever's in that wallet?. In my opinion, I think the owner of that wallet have some kind of program where whatever amount is deposited in that wallet and then the bot will automatically send the remaining amount to that person's wallet address. Anyway, I have seen the same situation where there's a newly sent eth in the wallet and it takes minutes more like 10-30 minutes before it got transferred to a wallet address presumably the thief.",
