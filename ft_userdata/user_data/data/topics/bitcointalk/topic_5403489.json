It appears that they are getting better, they won with 4 goals to 0 vs Liverpool but it is a friendly game after all.",

Last year everyone was thinking Barcelona was gonna take it and they got knocked out early in the playoffs. So even with Man Utd being one of the best teams it will be hard to win it because its a lot harder now",

I watched the reverse fixture with Dynamo Kyiv, they dominated despite playing the second half with a man down, missed quite a lot of chances, including a penalty. I'm not sure why they went back into their own half in extra time, played a lot more defensively in an attempt to force penalty shootouts i guess...and eventually, they got punished.According to my scouting report on Slovacko, the team is mostly made up of local players, with only one or two international guys. They finished fourth last season, about 20 points behind Plzen, nothing really that impressive in their preseason matches, with the exception of the aforementioned tie with Trabzonspor. Btw, Fenerbahce's team market value is more than 20x that of Slovacko...",

After having an unfortunate short run in the Champions League they are continuing in the Europa League now. Slovacko aren't a very serious opponent for Fenerbahce at all. They just need to concentrate on the match completely to prevent any surprises. By the way, the odd given to Fenerbahce can be taken into account seriously too. They can even win the match by at least a two-goal difference so I think you @morvillz7z have made a really nice choice.",
