  "content": "Hey everyone, We have been working really hard, for the past year, on creating BitEscrow - formally known as LightningEscrow. Our service is non-custodial, meaning that we do not hold onto your funds - but rather facilitate transactions using hash lock contracts. This also means that we do not require KYC.In addition, BitEscrow is incredibly fast, with transactions being 130-190 times faster than fiat escrow, with future plans to support the Lightning Network. There will also be a full customer service suite to handle disputes.We are scheduled to launch by the end of the year, with a fully functional website and API for wallets, marketplaces, and banks. This will be an important product for Bitcoin because it will introduce the concept of disputable Bitcoin transactions for buyers and sellers - similar to a credit card. We have also built parts of it on Nostr - to help us be the mediators of the contracts, and not the host. Check it out at https://www.BitEscrow.appLet us know if you have any questions, we will answer as many as we can.",
