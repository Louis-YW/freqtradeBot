I have seen many centralized platforms that offer lucrative profits from investing in some of their investment packages. However, I have not tested any of these platforms because of some experience with these centralized platforms. Some relatives lost so much money they invested in these platforms. Currently, I am keeping my coins in a decentralized wallet because I want to have full control of my investments. My only option in crypto investment is Bitcoin due to its stability and good track record. Some altcoins are too risky to invest in and many are not reliable.",

I don't know any other means each person may decided to go with their bitcoin investment but anything that has to do with the use of a centralized exchange for the achievement of this should be considered risk except they are just for a while, using DCA to accumulate your bitcoin is not a bad decision, i think holding your bitcoin alone over some years is a big time investment on itself, maybe using exchages could have more risk and danger together with using any centralized institutions who are into cryptocurrency investment.",

I can see that you are so carried away with the stake thing on CEx. You cant loss your bitcoin when it is in a noncustodial wallet which only you have the keys to. When you are greedy and looking for money where you don't want to work or invest on,you will end up losing what you gat. It isn't safe to keep your coins on a Centralized exchange,much more of staking your coins there. The possibility of you losing your coins is 50-50. I hope that this topic is about bitcoin and if it is not,I will advise you to move this thread to alternative cryptocurrency board. Invest wisely and don't be decieved with high APR.",

No. You need to use a reliable source for your research. Also all that you have been reading are misleading. You can stake many altcoins on noncustodial wallet and you will be able to claim your reward daily. You can unstake your reward and your coins will be released for you the day it is included on the coin protocol that the staked coin would be released.",

Other than that anything that I invest in the crypto-world is either going to give me huge losses or no gains at all. I really dislike the concept of flexible savings because they are mostly a new way from centralized exchanges to trap newbie investors. The newly listed tokens are the riskiest in the whole world of crypto-market because those token can lose a lot of their value within few days. The exchanges know that most of the newbie investors are greedy and when they find such schemes then they will invest money in those without delving deep into it.If for example someone has invested their money into a flexible savings option of a newly listed token and the exchange offered him/her 100% APR, but after a month or two the token has lost almost 60% of it current price value then in that case the investor has lost money instead of making any profits from that APR. The only working investment in crypto world is to buy Bitcoin when you see it at a low price and hold it for as long as you can. That's the securest form of investment for everyone and the investors who follow that approach will make a lot of returns from their investment after some waiting time.",

I understand one is supposed to do whatever one wants with money one has earned, but that sounds like a bad strategy. It is not rare some altcoins lose their relevance in a short period of time, if you want to really have control of your interest you are supposed to calculate it in USD or an established crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum, otherwise those interest are an illusion. 1% APY in Bitcoin is obviously much better than 102% APY of some random shitcoin one does not even know where came from.",
