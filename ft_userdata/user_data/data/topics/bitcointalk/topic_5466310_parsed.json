Many coins that are lunched since 2017 are ponzi scheme in modern fashion in a way the government can not do them (the developers) anything. Coins ICOs are worse than ponzi scheme.",

We can also figured out some of those project that was launched around 2016 and 2017 were also successful but the most percentage of them turned out to be scammed which we both can't point or easily figure them out. So its today there are project who came in the name of IEO IDO yet they also turned out to be scammed. Buttomed line is, whomever that is making investment should try their possible best to do research before investing in their project and it's not a thing of must that you will invest into any project you found here, maybe i will say you should follow your instinct and if your instinct doesn't permits you then don't give a trial as many people has tried to go against their instincts but due to love and greed landed them losing heavily into the hands of this shitcoins.",
