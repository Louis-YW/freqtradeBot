  "content": "As Bitcoin is the main pillar of cryptocurrency which backed the whole ecosystem of digital currency. by keeping that in mind. I should ask that, how does bitcoin affected by Debt Crisis. According to my Opinion, 1. Bitcoin provides a hedge against inflation as we all know with its property of fixed supply. so that's how bitcoin is supporting the financial ecosystems. 2. Cryptocurrency is a borderless-currency which anyone can buy/sell regardless of region restrictions so if there exists any debt crisis such as i live in Pakistan and Pakistan is near to declare as Default so i would prefer to store my money in valuable assets that can give me profits instead of losses. For example. I bought 3 ATOMS token for around $54, 6 to 7 months ago. (Time is estimated). which becomes around 8k pkr back then and now these tokens worth $40 and price in PKR is 11k. so why not i should store my assets in different cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin. 3. Why only crypto why not dollars, Pounds etc. to select for storing you money. Because of access to those assets and uncertainty in the financial framework of other countries. or maybe due to less trust on those than crypto as crypto is fully transparent. Because if my national currency can lost its value than why not others. Note* I am not saying that other's currency must lost value it's just assumption. Overall, these 3 causes will increase the demand of crypto/btc which in return increase the price of them as supply is fixed and high demand can increase there value. On the other hand. no doubt crypto has its own cons such as volatility which no doubt is harmful at some times. But this volatility is what make others to invest there asset in crypto This Article will do the further explaining of my this point. What are your thoughts about this and what more factors are there which causes the boot or whatever impact does debt crises could make on crypto/btc.",

Friendly advice never holds money in Banks as you can realize by the recent crisis in Pakistan. Regardless always feel safe with BTC due to its cyclical nature and fixed supply. I am not sure about any other deflationary projects in the crypto market (Burning System is excluded).The point to be noticed here is No any Local currency here which is deflationary as the primary problem is the reserve system. Interest also plays a bad role in the natural flow of money and services. Inflation and Deflation in crypto and the Local market is a long debate short story is In crypto also BTC is the most and the only if I am not a wrong option that can serve you as the store of value.",

      "body": "Your points are obviously correct, bitcoin is definitely a hedge against inflation and no argument that if I see a wide yearly range of bitcoin it has give mind bobbling returns so volatility can be contradicted with the better returns. So obviously it's a better option than fiat. But one problem that I really feel it has is that in case of a natural calamity crisis, you'll see it will be the first one to lose it's value because connectivity and internet might go down. Economically this is great but practically this can be a problem.",

Are you talking about a global debt crisis or a debt crisis in the country where you live?It has been stated multiple times that Bitcoin can be used as hedge against inflation, but this is partially true. Last year, the inflation levels were really high, but the BTC price dropped severely. Maybe in the long term, Bitcoin might become a good hedge against inflation, but we as HODLers must survive the crypto winter and keep HODLing.2.The golden rule of finance is to \"never keep all eggs in one basket\". This means diversifying your assets. Try to accumulate Bitcoin/crypto as well as precious metals and/or stable fiat currencies like US or UK pound. You could try to invest in real estate if you want. Nobody is saying that we should keep all our savings in BTC.",

In some cases, a debt crisis can even increase demand for cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation or a declining value of fiat currency.",

How did that work in the last year?You simply can't just issue some coin or label some metal as a hedge against inflation if the population doesn't see it as one!We had inflation peaking in most of the Western world, the result? Drop after drop after drop, the only time we experienced finally a pump brining back prices to  2017! levels were when we finally had news that inflation is going down faster than expected.So, how did that hedge fare for the last year or year on year? Really bad, because the same people who decided this have come to the conclusion that money is spent better elsewhere. You can't just have something in limited supply and declare it will be the proper tool to fight inflation if we go by that logic every crypto even all those bitcoin shitclones would do a great job, and we see they aren't.I wish people will finally understand that you can't have them all, you can't have daily trading with high returns and not experience volatility and you can't have something in which year after year you wait and cheer for wall street funds or corporate investments not act just like the stock market does.",

So if they freeze your money, they will now turn to BTC, right? You must be a joker. The USDX has been invested in for centuries, even when the global economy is in a downturn and depression. Investment is an investment, no one has frozen anyone's money in fiat investment because of inflation which does not concern your safe investment.Furthermore, you might invest in USDX in another fiat currency, so it's all about you, and all fiats cannot be frozen because of inflation. But one thing that is sure is that once the company you are dealing with is not insolvent, you will get your money back. Inflation does not have jurisdiction here, and BTC can never take the place of the USD and fiats in many realities.",

I doubt that. In addition to that, SEC is almost everywhere when they see something centralised in the crypto sphere. Though I’m not taking your thoughts negatively at all I am just making point about the stable coins. Personally they are rivals in the war. On the other hand, yes bitcoin is making good progress when it comes to the borderless payments or paperless work. The market is growing slowly. There are some huddles like one country might be good at legal tenders of bitcoin while other country may not thus limiting the bitcoin to get their freely. However it is only when someone wants to cash out immediately. If they are happy with bitcoins then we are in happy world already.",

The predictable result is that the currency loses its purchasing power through inflation.Of course, if a country is in large amounts of debt, its within their interest to reduce the value of the debt burden by spending even more money if repayment is in their own currency.",

Let's be realistic.You made a valid point that no investment, including Bitcoin, can guarantee income, and that success depends on individual's investment strategy, skill to manage risks and timing. Regarding centralized, it is true that it has existed for a long time and individuals and entities amassed wealth through them. However there are downsides to centralization, such as concentration of wealth which can lead to inequality and systematic risks.The decentralization nature of Bitcoin is its key feature, as it allows greater transparency, security and resilience compared to centralized systems. Despite  Bitcoin's reliance on fiat currencies for some aspects of its echo system, such as exchange and trading platforms but still it can be used for daily transactions.",

But we also can not confirm that bitcoin is not inflation-resistant. Unfortunately, 2022 is also the year we enter a bearish cycle after a year of price increases, with inflation or not, bitcoin will still decrease. As of now, bitcoin is still a highly manipulated speculative asset that makes it difficult to act as a hedge against inflation. I believe that in the future, when bitcoin becomes bigger, not manipulated, bitcoin will exert its anti-inflation feature.",
