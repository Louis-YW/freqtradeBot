America should stop playing saint and lord  with other countries when it comes to certain sensitive cases because they are always firstly  involved in cases of national security and after which turning to point fingers at another that gets involved in the same act. America should stop acting like they can have whatever they want from any nations.",

America should stop acting like they can have whatever they want from any nations. Russia detained and arrested the journalist, while the US expelled diplomats. Both countries didn't respond to this crime of spying similarly. In this case, the US acted far better than Russia. But I cannot side with or exonerate any party because they are bullies. Both nations have been rivals which entails that there will always be suspicion and accusations. America will always claim that Russia is behind its travails and Russia will also do the same. Both Russia and the US are guilty of interference in the internal affairs of both nations. Also, America and Russia are influencing the government of many nations and an example is Africa. Both nations should respect the territorial integrity of nations because both of them are not saints. The US can claim that Russia is an aggressor but the US is not clean.",
