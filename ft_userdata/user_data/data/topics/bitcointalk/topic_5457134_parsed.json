  "content": "Is someone being approched by the 10% Cripto SCAM ?If someone can help it will be much appreciated;Here's the storyI have an account with a broker where I requested a withdrawal to close this account.The girl called me saying that she can't proceed with the withdrawal because the Blockchain is blocking her from proceeding with the withdrawal because I have a $300,000 in token sitting somewhere on the Blockchain and I have to receive it before proceeding with the Withdrawal.She said I should deposit 10% of the amount ($30,000)  in my NDAX wallet to allow the transfer. She said I won't have to transfer it into any obscure wallet. Everything remains in my NDAX and I will be able to withdraw this $30,000 once the transaction completed.The fact that my money stay in my NDAX wallet is confusing  me.Question: Legit or SCAM ?Curiously I've been contacted by 4 folks in two weeks telling me that they found big money on the Blockchain which belong to me and they all requested me to invest 10% of the amount to unlock the trransaction. Unlike the previous case, they all asked me to transfer the money into a portfolio they had created for me. Easy to identify as a SCAM.  Is it even possible for someone to find tokens on the Blockchain they can link to me ?Thanks for any help",

The bitter truth you don't want to hear is that you should just forget about the money and move on with your life.This $30,000 that is in the said wallet is not entirely your money; I assume you gave the scammer girl a few dollars to invest and trade for you, and the result was this $30k in a broker site controlled by them. The address on that account belongs to them. Even if you make the payment of the said 10%, you will still not be able to withdraw it.It's payment upon payment, excuses upon excuses, which will require you to pay more money. Until you get tired and decide to stop,I will advise you to abandon the site and those fake withdrawal promises because they will never come out.",

Well, scammers can create new token which they will send to different wallet address they can find that they also know your contact info like telegram before sending you a dm that you have tokens in your wallet and you can withdraw it. The story you told is also a scam and most of the scam scheme is they want you to deposit first before you can withdraw your balance. Better avoid that one just to be safe.",

This is the scam broker website, which is showing the 10% fee before the OP could possibly request a withdrawal, and after the successful withdrawal, that's when it can be recorded on the blockchain (which will never even happen). Those are just stats the scammer wants to use to convince the OP to send in money in order to withdraw the tempting amount.",

They are all scams because otherwise, how could someone call you and say that you are waiting for that kind of money? Scammers will do anything to get you to work for them for an extended period of time. Therefore, I urge you to never put your trust in anyone online, even if you have business with them in the past or have seen them in person.In my opinion, based on your tale, this is a complete hoax; otherwise, they would not request a 10% charge from you and would still establish a new wallet for you. It is therefore preferable that you block the scammers or do not even respond to their calls or messages.",

The presence of such Requests to invest and transfer funds into the portfolio they create is a red flag indicating potential fraud. While we know blockchain transactions are transparent, it is highly unlikely for someone to randomly find a token specifically associated with you without the proper context or valid reason.So my advice if I may say so, Stay alert and protect your assets by avoiding suspicious schemes that promise easy profits.",

The fact they offer you to deposit 10% just to withdraw the amount that they found out is an obvious red flag becausea 10% for the transaction fee cost is overkill and they can just get it without telling to you if there's really a money in there.If you don't know about that money then that is an obvious scam modus. How come they manage to contact you? Do you provide your contact details in public such as social media account of your broker becau se scammer will surely attempt to scam you by impersonating as support.",

I think the broker platform that you used is a scam. Can you mention its name? This girl who contacted you is undoubtedly from the scam poker platform team and tried to access your contact information and messaged you. We point out that if you already own $300,000 of tokens on the blockchain, why not your withdrawal process completed without you receiving these tokens? You mentioned that the NDAX wallet was created for you, and they have security methods and wallet information, and this means that after you deposit 10% of the amount, which is $30,000, they will open the wallet and transfer the funds that you deposit immediately. What they mentioned to you are false inducements, and you do not have $300,000 of tokens on the blockchain; what I know is that the blockchain does not ban any transactions for anyone. No legitimate broker platform demands such exorbitant fees from its customers to proceed with the withdrawal process. You also mentioned that four others contacted you like this girl with the same temptations, so do not believe them at all.",
