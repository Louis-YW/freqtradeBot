  "content": "A small introduction about us. We have been providing FX trading strategies for almost 10 years. The strategies are based on a combination of technical and fundamental analysis. We are not using many indicators, most of the entries are based on raw price action.No bots, all the research is done manually.There is no telegram group (although there are imposters), all the strategies can be viewed on our website. Regarding cryptocurrencies, it has been recently continued. The performance is still minor compared to FX.We have a small crypto portfolio (not more than a few thousands) initially it was all over the place, we have narrowed it down to a handful of tokens and we are always looking out for innovative tech.As we are also holding tokens at their early stage, we will not post entries on any illiquid tokens so we will not be mistaken for carrying pump and dump schemes. It is important to highlight that we will not succeed on every entry. We are not striving for 100% success.We are not oblivious to the number of scammers in the crypto space. What we would like to do is post some of our strategies here. The community can assess what we offer in real time. Likewise, if there are any specific tokens you would like us to cover in this forum, please reply. We will do our best.As bitcoin is quite popular, we will focus on btcusd as a our first strategy.BTCUSD 4hr Charthttps://ibb.co/r2YZB5cBTCUSD is kept in a range as seen in the 4hr chart.BTCUSD 30min ChartBTCUSD is testing a 30min resistance at around $28,290 at the time of this writing. In an event the price will be unable to post a 30min close above the resistance (in about 4 minutes from now), some weakness may be seen.https://ibb.co/9vj7qJDThe target is such a scenario is 28,150.Should the price close above 28,290, it invalidates the entry.If someone can please explain how to upload images that will be nice.",

      "body": "We will be here later, this is the progress of BTCUSD intraday strategy as seen above:https://ibb.co/LYGS40LThe price did post a minor close above the resistance line (former support), which is generally insufficient to negate the entry. Only a firm close above invalidates the entry. We kept the strategy simple for all.We are aware some might think it is a one-off or 'lucky call.' We are very good in what we do. We hope to demonstrate it over time.(until we figure how to upload images directly here, we will use imgbb)",

Since the beginning of April over +300 pips were realized via 3 trades (all in the crosses).While it may appear we only initiate several trades per month, it greatly depends on the market volatility and our ability to recognize the trend.Cryptocurrencies UpdateRegarding our long-term cryptocurrencies basket, 1 cryptocurrency (over 10M marketcap on ETH) has outperformed, over +400% gains at the time of this writing.Regarding the crypto signals, we have been more conservative. Our recently closed trade was in Cardano (ADAUSD) with some profit.All details regarding the trades, setups and outcome are available on our website.Official website: ddmarkets.com",
