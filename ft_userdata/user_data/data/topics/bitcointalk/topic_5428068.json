Whether it is my university free time or part time job I know thing for sure, even with the gap of 5 minutes I would just grab my phone out of my pocket and start watching the videos on YT or may be checkout some quick Reels on the Instagram. Call me social nerd but thats what it is. Now, coming to the topic: Whenever I am touching my phone and accessing these social platforms, there is someone in the world who is getting paid for it! Within that 5 minutes of time there are at least 4-5 advertisements of 20-30 seconds which will be played by platforms like YouTube, Instagram, FB, and basically everything that's digital.Whether I watch the advertisements or not, whether I skip them or not, someone is always getting paid, someone is always seeing their revenue go boom on a platform just because of my spare time and those 5 minutes. Front End StoryAs we know all, there are millions of advertisments are running on these platforms all the time throughout the world. QuoteYouTube has 113.9 million YouTube channels as of July 29, 2022. Only 4.4% of the 2.6 billion active YouTube users created their own YouTube channel.Source [unverified]Just checkout only the number of active channels on YT which are getting paid with their generated revenue. Since these are digital platforms then wouldn't it be sensible to add Bitcoin as digital currency to get paid or lets say to buy premium subscriptions and much more! We already have wallets with instant payment capabilities and it takes really short time to have 1 confirmation these days. With the third party applications its even faster to pay instantly or get paid instantly. The volume that is transferred everyday on the internet is really huge, and instead of getting paid with normal payment processors which also takes up lot of verifications stages one can easily start getting paid with bitcoin. Collaboration with platforms like YouTube, Instragram/Facebook is astounding to imagine. Why are they lagging behind the sole idea of it?Where is the spark of Google, the out of the box thinking and the world which they always think beyond imagination?",

For the creator of the content you're viewing to actually get paid, you need to watch the ad for a stipulated number of seconds for it to be registered. This is one reason I labor through some of the unrelated ads to me, when they pop up on videos of content creators I learn from or who put a lot into their craft.Quote from: Flexystar on December 12, 2022, 04:08:53 PMSince these are digital platforms then wouldn't it be sensible to add Bitcoin as digital currency to get paid or lets say to buy premium subscriptions and much more!

Why are they lagging behind the sole idea of it?Where is the spark of Google, the out of the box thinking and the world which they always think beyond imagination? A lot of digital platforms nowadays recognize and accept bitcoins as mode of payment. For a while the dream was that social media could be connected to the blockchain to make monetization a fast and seamless process for content creators and this is slowly becoming realized courtesy of Meta and Twitter creating individual efforts to onboard the people to cryptocurencies and NFTs. As for payment channels a lot of digital wallets in my country support or will support the use of cryptocurrency so I guess that's a good thing in their own right. YouTube and Google conjunctively are a bit stubborn in accepting cryptocurrency for some reason but soon enough when the rest of the internet accepts it they'd follow suit, they did that with the short videos thing, they'd do it again to remain topical and relevant.",

So they generally prefer to hodl. I think the only platform that I believe bitcoin is being used as a payment gateway are the casinos. I would say the casinos are smart enough to give their customers all possible platforms to use their service without restrictions.",

Bitcoin doesn't care about any of that and just works. Bitcoin IS freedom.I'm not saying that Bitcoin is totally useless. But on a global scale it's insignificant. It has less than 300k transactions per day - that's nine million transactions per month, So a population of one small country would be able to do one transaction per month if they adopted Bitcoin. So what's the benefit of accepting Bitcoin for a large company? It's going to be a tiny share of their payments and not increase their revenue in any significant ways. But it will introduce development costs, maintenance, maybe even legal risks.",

So Lightning Network should be the best option for this because if they won't gonna have any difference as they have been with Steam, then it will be just like a Deja Vu and it will gonna be the same as it was before without any changes.",
