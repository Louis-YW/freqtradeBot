  "content": "Personally I define Trading as the exchange of value for value this is because at the end of the day we trade small money to get bigger money and they are both valued at a price. Before I proceed any further it's important to know that sometimes our knowledge outside this forum may not equate our ranks here so  that doesn't mean quality information cannot be gotten from a low ranked person on this forum, some of us are good at what we do outside here. That been said let's quickly dalve dip into the subject matter.Before you consider going into trading fully as a full time hustle or a hustle on the side, I advise you put the following to consideration first, I will be considering just two points and they are as follows: 1. Mindset.2. Learning. MINDSET:This has a lot to do with the information you got earlier about trading that has caught your interest enough to want to go into trading. There are so many wrong perceptions about trading out there, one of which is, you get rich quick as soon as you venture in to trading. This has to be the height of falsehood in trading. It's true you can get Rich trading no doubts, but then you will have to put in some work as the wealth doesn't come suddenly or as soon as you start trading, so one should take off such mindset, have a change of such mind set if you did have such before as you may be disappointed sooner than later. Trading is not a Ponzi scheme, Rather just like every others, it's a skill and requires time to acquire after which you can then make a fortune out of it. This leads us to our next and last point. LEARNING:It's very important to know that your success in trading depends so much on how much information and education you have about trading before and while you are still trading. As a beginner trader, invest so much in learning before thinking of earning, this is very important. Get good quality education and information about trading, read books, take courses online or offline and make sure to get every good information possible about trading as this will greatly influence your success in your trading journey. Understand that you are acquiring a skill and that means it requires some time to gain mastery of the skill, so dedicate the necessary time required to Learning just as you do in college and soon you will be glad you did as you will be enjoying the results of learning first. Learn before you earn  so you don't have to spend all your earnings learning.",

Not only trading but people have this idea about most of the online activities. People think it's easy to make money online, and everyone can do it. People think it's easy to make money from gambling, from Fiverr, from upwork without skills. I am one who makes some pocket money from the internet and people ask me why I don't teach them? They think it's super easy.",

Sometimes, beginners are drawn to trading because they think it will make them rich, but this can be based on misinformation. I often see beginners looking at market charts without understanding them. Experienced traders became experts after making many losses and having a stable source of income. So, if you're a beginner without experience and enough money, it's risky to start trading. It would be advisable to learn, practice with virtual accounts, and only invest money you can afford to lose. Make sure you understand the markets before diving in, as rushing in without knowledge and financial stability can lead to big losses.",

I was telling a friend of mine last week that if you want to be profitable in trading, don't ever go for trades below 1:3 reward ratio, because in trading you mostly get losses, while you manage your risk properly, but when you trade nothing less than 1:3 reward ratio, any good trades will definitely wipes out all your losses.To me in trading having the right knowledge is the key.",

Even less so when it comes to trading altcoins because of the heavy manipulation that dominates the altcoin market (commonly known as pump and dumps).The only thing that you need and is useful is going to be experience and understanding of HOW the market works. This knowledge is only acquired if you spend time studying the market, looking at the charts and making trades. You need to know what makes a shitcoin pump and when will the pump gives its place to a dump so that you can make wise decisions for your entry and exit strategies.Usually these \"courses\" you mention teach you some nonsense about technical analysis which is completely useless in altcoin market. None of them help you speculate the pump and dump market.",

Newbies who want to multiply their earning via trading get bitten in the ass. We must learn to earn, if not our mistake can skyrocket. Our mistakes are best known by us. An expert can try to solve it. Yet, it's not to be compared to the way we would have solved it ourselves, if we had the skills. Successful traders, lose out huge on trading due to unaware mistakes, ignorant. People excell differently in trading. That is, they can make money in trading and think of themselves as successful, but learnt nothing in trading and would always fail in some aspect of trading. Unless, they take classes or courses, they may not understand why trading is getting difficult to them in some aspect or extent. Achieving this, learning about trading, a trader must adhere to the first advise. Greed! Avoilding sweet syndrome coming from the emotions, can straighten our mindset to focus. A frustrated mind, can't learn. As newbies, the lesson here is to remain focused and terminate quick money making thoughts. Calculating greed as a thing for the experienced and experts can create in me the zeal to learn for a long time. Before trying to make quick money via trading.",

So to be on the safe side,it is good you have the prerequisite basic information on trading so you could be able to scale through while building your trading skills coupled with you have a little experience in the process of practical approach to the trading fundamentals. I believe trading is all about experience and not mind set. It is good one have a good mindset but that does not guarantee that you will be 100% accurate while trading as that has nothing to do with making profit while trading but your skills and experience do because that would help in telling you when to invest and when not to.

The experts in trading today were once a beginner and they start from somewhere as well. If beginners are discourage from partaking in trading simply because it's risky then, I'm afraid in the coming days we'll be short of traders or possibly have no more traders in existence again when the present ones are no more. I understand that trading is very risky for beginners and even the experts but discouraging is not the way forward or will reduce it risk in anyway. What beginners need is guidance, orientation and experience from experts in the aspect.Having a good orientation will change their mindset towards trading. Giving them deserve knowledge and experience will prepare them for the challenges ahead. Losing money is part of the game and you must sacrifice for that if you want to venture into it.",

Even professional traders make high losses most times as a result of market conditions as they too can not predict the market most times.

Rather than trying to predict and forecast market stability and when exactly changes will occur, a better strategy is to have a portfolio that is ready to face whatever it eventually brings.If you want to be successful in trading you must have a mindset that takes responsibility for your emotions, not blaming others. In addition to making you feel more guilty about your mistakes, pointing the finger at others will only increase your sense of personal accountability. There is always a risk in every trade, but people still trade and succeed. You have to look outward if you want to be successful in trading.

That's why sometimes I don't like to teach other people ask me about trading especially if I see that they are not really interested about it and they are there for money since I don't like to be blame if something bad happen to them. That's why sometimes its good to be quiet and live a low key lifestyle so that no people will ask you about anything related to that situation.",
