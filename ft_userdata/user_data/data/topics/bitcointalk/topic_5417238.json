  "content": "I hold Quant and it seems to be the main crypto these days that is not following Bitcoin like the rest and is pumping a lot. £165 is now a price that has become too tempting and I want to sell a few of my Quant to then hopefully buy in a lot lower when we next have a crash.I have just gone to send some Quant from my ledger to Binance but it is saying I do not have enough Eth to cover the network fees. I do not own Eth, what is the easiest way of me getting some Eth on my ledger to pay for the fees?",

And the only way I could think of getting Ether right now is by purchasing some, you could just get like that of $20 just to be on the safe side because Ether gas fee is kinda high.",

Make sure you buy enough ethereum to pay the transaction fee, it's better to buy a little more because the transaction fee will always change, it's not fixed. You are talking about quant network, I think it is growing pretty well, I just checked it went up to 180. For altcoins if profitable you should sell and take profit, don't be too greedy in this bear market.",

If you have fund there then convert some into ETH and I think the network fee is quiet low right now, you can transact this for a $10 below fee for this or to make sure, try to see the estimated fee when you transfer your Quant to Binance. We can’t answer your last question though, you should be the one to know what to do. If you are happy with your profit now, then take some but if you think the price will continue to rise over time, then hold some.",

Coinbase can also be good if that is your only option, just look at the fees there. It’s ok to take profit, the market is bear it’s good to have more cash and buy again once you see the opportunity to buy cheaper.",

You shall try to take a look at your portfolios again if your quant have been giving you huge profits and why not? if your token was not giving you decent profit and then continue to hold it.

That's all he need to have so that he can transfer and sell it immediately if he want it too.He doesn't have to rush if there's no immediate need for him to sell that.
