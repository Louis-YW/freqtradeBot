I was thinking about the whole technology in general so I could understand the terms used often. I've bought coins since around 2019 but I do not know too much (mostly buying ada, xmr, eth, btc). I was also thinking perhaps I should concentrate on learning to use wallets better as I only have a few (mainly just use ledger nano x). Thanks.",

I second that, but I think that's something that basically everyone has to go throught by themselves as I don't know a single persopn who is in crypto that haven't tried trading at some point, thinking thatits a no brainer and an easy way to earn money.

Quality over quantity when it comes to wallets. You should primarily focus on non custodial open source wallets, and ledger nano x fails at the latter requirement.",

I was thinking about the whole technology in general so I could understand the terms used often. I've bought coins since around 2019 but I do not know too much (mostly buying ada, xmr, eth, btc). Thanks.  I frequently advice people to always make us of the search button because almost all the topics have been treated before, so when you search the exact terms you wanna learn you will find best response that have been provided. There are topics like bitcoin technology terms and abbreviations that you can read and get basic know of the frequently used terms. In the aspect of buying crypto i strongly advice not to get involved with shit coins because there are pumped  and dumped for a selfish reason. Just buy Bitcoin and hold for a long time and you will surely get more benefit from it. QuoteI was also thinking perhaps I should concentrate on learning to use wallets better as I only have a few (mainly just use ledger nano x).  Yeah you surely need to learn use wallet better and be more conscious of your security. Here is a thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631151.0 by @Lauda  to enlighten you on wallets",

It would be logical if you learned at least some basic things, and only then invested - although it is good to have a hardware wallet, regardless of the bad reputation of that company.QuoteWhat would you tell your younger self to learn this space efficiently?I would tell myself \"buy more Bitcoin\" and \"stay away from all altcoins\" which would definitely be the two best pieces of advice I could give myself.",

Stick to one strategy, master it and remember learning never stop we just have to continue improving on ourself to be able to beat the market.",

Revise them each day before reading new article about bitcoin. Then make threads according to your understanding so far on the definitions you've learnt. Add your contribution, criticism, benefits etc in the thread. This will open space for more contribution and argument. And the more people respond to your thread you'll learn faster. Sometimes, technically, the arguments happening on your thread can fetch you ideas for another thread, which will also increase your possibility of learning new ideas in bitcoin. Learn and relearn as much as you could. Before participating or venturing into trading or similar investment in bitcoin. Goodluck.",
