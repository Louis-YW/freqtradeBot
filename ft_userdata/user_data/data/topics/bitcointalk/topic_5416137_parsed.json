      "body": "Crypto(bitcoin) should be taught to everybody of age 15yrs and above, and it can be taught anywhere not especially in schools. School is the best place to educate the students about bitcoin since they are the leaders of tomorrow,I mean from Senior secondary school and above are the students that should have this knowledge. The reason why I said it should not be taught in school alone is because bitcoin awareness is still spreading, some persons have  the awareness and some don't have, and some person have the awareness but they don't understand or like the concept because it hasn't be adopted in their country especially the old ones. So my point is this those people that are not privilege to attend higher institution, will you say they don't need bitcoin awareness or education, no it is a digital currency ,that the purpose for its creation is for financial freedom . Bitcoin should be taught every place that brings people together,for example schools,place of work,market place,neighborhood, meetings and if possible also in church. Teaching it in all these mentioned places will help the spread and education faster, whatever you know its good and benefitable like bitcoin knowledge to you is also good for everyone,if you are benefiting from bitcoin directly or indirectly then you need to give the awareness to other people around you not just for only a specific persons.Thanks",

At school, the most obvious integration is into Economics and into IT classes. At universities, it can depend on a degree a person is getting and the courses students choose based on their interests. This way, some will be left with the basics they learned at school, while others will be able to dive into more detail if they want to do that.Also, the op is talking about schools and unis as a hypothetical, but in fact, it's already the case at some places. I remember that cryptos were included into school curriculum in France nationwide, for instance. There are also individual schools and cases in other countries, to the very least. As for universities, it seems more widespread and some crypto-related courses are offered in many countries, while some, I believe, even offer blockchain-related degrees or specializations.",

For example, for those of us who are in this forum, do we get crypto and Blockchain education in formal education?the answer is definitely no, because actually we know forums in various ways, opportunities and not all of them are equal, decentralization awareness grows by itself, when one understands the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain it works and has a good impact on one's life.Quote from: fennic on October 06, 2022, 07:37:01 AMI think it would be so cool to learn about Blockchain in our universities. So that it will give us mass adoption of Cryptocurrency in near future. If this curriculum is available in universities, it may be true that the growth of mass adoption of Cryptocurrency will run very fast, and at the age of an adult, universities are a place to get to know other sciences outside the available curriculum.That's why education at the University is not limited to existing subjects, if these factors have been met, then this step is more likely to be done than junior high school.",

I don’t know about Cryptos, but yes college students are learning about blockchains.In my country, the bachelor degree has the option to pursue degree in computer science and engineering and that too Blockchain as specialisation.I have also seen that college students are learning about encryption etc, which is a part of Bitcoins or cryptos.So definitely we can say that in future, cryptos and Bitcoins specifically will be taught in colleges. They gonna surely add this in Economics section to completely focus on decentralisation.",

But, how many people who ride in a car or bus or whatever understands what the 4 stroke cycle is, or the difference between a 4 stroke and 2 stroke motor, or what the distributor cap does, etc. It is useful, so they use it. As things progress, solutions continue to evolve that require less technical expertise, and people get used to using it. Some day, it will be common just like credit cards, and most people will just use it. Those who want to dig further will do so, but I think most people aren't interested in how it works. All that said, I don't think it's a bad idea to offer classes. Probably see 4 year crypto bachelor's degrees sooner or later.",

What do you even think that you want to teach pre-premary kids?  It is not good to teach at that stage. The best stage to teach bitcoin is colleges and universitie. But it can be taught in the secondary School level as orientation class. There are some bright students in the secondary School level can also learn it in a deep way. But not all.  And for now, it is not all schools accept to teach cryptocurrency or blockchain. And not all Countries have adopted it on their Countries so blockchain is not on the school curriculum for now. If you want to introduce it in your school. It is okay.",
