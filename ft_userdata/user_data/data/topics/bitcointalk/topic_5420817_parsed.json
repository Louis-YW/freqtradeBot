      "body": "FTX and FTX.us were both hacked at the same time, the story behind this is still unclear but it is better for everyone to remove all links and stop accessing both exchanges to avoid unfortunate incidents in the future. I wouldn't believe this was an external attack, this could be their internal attack and someone trying to collect their last property to run away. This could be the worst disaster in crypto history.",

      "body": "This is why privacy is important, do you think the third party can protect your personal information? Nope, when they got hacked, the hacker can know any personal information submitted on the exchange. There's no third party or anyone can be trusted, \"don't trust, verify\". If anyone start to use decentralized exchange e.g. Bisq, this kind problem wouldn't happen. Also anyone should hold their coins on hardware wallet. This will impact significant effect of losing Bitcoin and personal information leaked.",

Drama won't end anytime soon, it's a disaster to use a centralized exchange, I also lost money with FTX and now I am fearing for my other personal documents, here is a lesson for me and the centralized exchange users.",

Obviously, they aren't very smart, didn't even look for a mixer or send it to a dex instead.What's even more weird is that just a day after declaring bankruptcy, they announced that they had been hacked, once bankruptcy means they can't afford to pay users, hackers won't attack the exchange without money. Unless insiders themselves have carried out the attack, or staged a plan, to disclaim liability to users whose assets are on the exchange. If I remember correctly, FTX has not been attacked since its inception until now. I do not believe in that.",
