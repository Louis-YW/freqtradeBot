And if you're struggling to choose, you're already in the forum and it's not just bitcoin trading but it also includes altcoins if you're for it. But instead of bitcoin trading,you may want to choose bitcoin holding instead.",

Both will equally give you $$$, but stocks is way harder to get profits from and usually has movements that are very weak and incomparable against bitcoin. In bitcoin/crypto, you literally just buy and forget and come back after a year or two and you'll get profits. Minimal effort, maximum gains.",

We would simply just look at stocks that we picked and how much money we made and that would be enough. In any case, I have to say that it's a good life that we are living right now in the crypto world the same way warren did with stocks, there are a lot of people who made a lot of returns and I feel like it's not going to be that much of a shock in the long run if someone gets as rich as Warren did from crypto investments.I mean we still have some time, in 10-20 years there could be some worlds richest man from crypto, and it's too early for that now but when that happens it will definitely impact the prices a lot and people will want to become like that person.",

The battle between short period earning and long-term earning. Share your thought about it.I will let you know first --which you prefer in trading, a very highly volatile market that is very risky or a market where all coins have a stable moment with less risk but I don't know regarding generating profit, as we know making a profit in a very high volatility cryptocurrency is very easy. So I think there is a right comparison between the two markets because they are different. If you will ask me, I will do crypto trading since it is highly volatility --the price fluctuates very high which makes you make a profit easily. However, if you technically don't know the crypto market, I suggest you research first before diving into such a conclusion.",

Other than of that, you can also invest your money in property, land, gold and anything that allows you to make money. You can make money even if you don't make much. The best investment is not only about the possibility of making lot of profit, but you must consider the risks so that no matter how small the profit you will get, at least it can prevent you from losing lot of money. So I dare not say which one is the best, because in the long term even chicken eggs will be more expensive due to inflation.",

Every thing has its pros and cons and you have to decide which one cons are acceptable to you while you enjoy the pros.There is no similarity between long vs short and stocks vs crypto so I am not sure why you put that question in the post.Stock markets are regulated and have been under centralized control. Many stocks are kept for long term and often they are paying out dividends to holders. Bitcoin is a more recent asset class and it is also for the long term for most old timers, it's market are not regulated and takes more strict security measures to keep safe.I have personally come from a stock market background and added bitcoin to my portfolio. Have been doing both and I will definitely continue like that.",

So, choose where you think you'll be able to build your empire.

It is not a fair comparison.A fair comparison is Trading in Bitcoin and Trading in stocks, what is better? or Investing in Bitcoin or Investing in stocks, what is better?My personal thinking, Investing in Bitcoin is better than in stocks. Since 2009, you can not say stocks give better profit, ROI than Bitcoin.Trading in Bitcoin is worse than in stocks because with no limit and less regulations on the cryptocurrency market as well as cryptocurrency exchanges, there are more manipulations and shady playing games from exchanges which can kill traders more easily.Generally trading is bad in either stocks and Bitcoin. Investing is better than trading with a condition that you invest in a right one and Bitcoin is one of best things for investment.",
