It brings extremely positive impacts to the development of this market in the future. Let me list what those impacts include!1. Attracting traditional investorsThe EFT Bitcoin Fund is like a certificate proving the legitimacy of this market. It helps traditional investors alleviate concerns about the legitimacy of this market. They boldly pour capital into this market through ETF funds, and this is not a small and extremely stable source of capital for the market. It will create a good premise for countries that previously banned or did not support Bitcoin to become more open in the near future.2. The market will gradually stabilize and grow more sustainablyBefore there were ETFs, the cryptocurrency market was considered an extremely volatile market, sometimes fluctuating up to several dozen to several hundred percent. This not only causes confusion for participants, but also creates extremely risky psychology for those who want to learn about this market. But when ETFs come into play, they can help mitigate this wild and volatile volatility. ETFs will provide diversification, and they are also the ones who will regulate the market, making the market more stable, reducing risks for investors.3. Bitcoin's popularity and acceptance soars This is quite obvious when the major US ETFs were approved, which brought huge worldwide attention to Bitcoin. From there, they will learn what Bitcoin is, and help promote Bitcoin to a larger number of users by chance. Besides, they will understand what it is like to use Bitcoin in daily life as well as in other fields besides the financial market, who in the past they only viewed Bitcoin as a speculative product, and only for fraudulent purposes.4. Create more jobs related to the crypto field The appearance of ETF funds will lead to a strong wave of investment capital flowing into the market to develop projects. The cryptocurrency market goes hand in hand with technological development, so attracting capital inflows is very easy. That opens up more space and economic potential for projects to develop, meaning they will have to expand their company scale and human resources. The labor market in the information technology industry as well as crypto has been very hot in recent years. And I firmly believe that the recruitment demand in this crypto industry will increase with the development of the market.In short, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs I think brings a lot of positive things and opportunities to many people. This can be considered a period of transferring humanity's wealth, opening a new era for all of us. Let's find out and seize this opportunity!",

However, on the other hand, these traditional investors don't believe in the main purpose of Bitcoin. BlackRock's Larry Fink himself doesn't believe that Bitcoin is a currency. These players don't believe in the essence of Bitcoin. They don't see Bitcoin as money. In this regard, I don't think they're one of us. Quote2. The market will gradually stabilize and grow more sustainablyNot true. You must have noticed how the price has been fluctuating wildly ever since the spot ETF was approved. Â Quote3. Bitcoin's popularity and acceptance soars I agree. But, again, the question would be, how is Bitcoin popular? How is it accepted? If Bitcoin's popularity and acceptance are solely grounded on its being a new asset class, then that would be questionable. If this kind of popularity and acceptance flatly reject its being a legitimate money, then it might even be detrimental. Quote4. Create more jobs related to the crypto field Forget about the crypto field. It's heavily flooded with scams. Scam projects, those that are freely riding the waves of Bitcoin's popularity, indeed create jobs, but it's not worth it. The negative effects of these scams far surpass job creation. I would wish that these jobs won't be created if it means there will be scam victims all over the world.",

Making a mockery of the original intent of Bitcoin and the blockchain architecture generally.By definition the ETF is absolutely centralized, meaning that investors are investing in absolutely nothing but the name, \"Bitcoin\" when they buy shares of the ETF. The ETF underscores that very, very few people have a need to ensure their government cannot subpoena their transactions, and most people do not want to hold a large portion of their wealth on their own person, but would rather pay somebody to guard it for them e.g. a bank of financial institution.In a sense the ETF represents the \"grown up\" view of Bitcoin--but it makes the original concept of Bitcoin look like a toy.",

Big investors will put money into it. When something is accepted by big investors, it helps adoption. So now it may no longer be \"that bubble\" or scam to people. And the government will begin to be less strict towards it. This confirms your 3rd point that the popularity and acceptance of Bitcoin would increase. Quote from: SeriouslyGiveaway on March 18, 2024, 01:36:50 AM2. The market will gradually stabilize and grow more sustainablyBut this, I do not agree with. I don't believe ETF would make Bitcoin less volatile. The market is still controlled by the market forces of demand and supply, so it still leaves a lot of room for volatility. Other traditional investments like gold, stock, and Forex are still volatile in their own way, so why do you think Bitcoin would be different?",

Bitcoin's future are determined by the miners fees that are generated by on-chain transaction and these coins stay in these cetralized databases and they generate zero miners fees. Huge amounts of coins are also owned by centralized financial institutions and less people can buy those coins and the remaining coins become very expensive.

I don't see any changes that suggest bitcoin is becoming more stable like we once thought. Bitcoin is still the same, still volatile and even more volatile since the adoption of ETFs. Furthermore, bitcoin's volatility creates an opportunity for us to make profits, why do people prefer it to be more stable? We all want to make huge profits from bitcoin but are afraid of its risks and volatility. Is that unreasonable and are we too greedy? Everything is proportional to each other, high profits come with high risks, so if anyone feels afraid of bitcoin's fluctuations, it is best not to participate in bitcoin.",

These institutional investors have enough funds for advertising which will lead to more Bitcoin awareness and even adoption. But the effect is that they are introducing people to centralisation.Quote4.

First off, it reels in old-school investors, making them feel comfy about diving into the market. That means more cash flow, which is great plus ETFs smooth out the crazy ups and downs, making the market less of a rollercoaster. With big names getting behind Bitcoin, it's bound to become even more mainstream, sparking curiosity and adoption. And hey more investment means more jobs in the crypto scene which is awesome. Bottom line is that Bitcoin ETFs open up a whole new world of opportunities so lets ride this wave",

This can be considered a period of transferring humanity's wealth, opening a new era for all of us. Let's find out and seize this opportunity!Â  A successful Bitcoin spot ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. It could increase the accessibility of Bitcoin to a wider range of investors, which could lead to increased demand for Bitcoin and potentially drive up the price. Additionally, a Bitcoin ETF could help to legitimize Bitcoin as an investment, which could help to reduce some of the perceived risks associated with investingÂ  in cryptocurrencies. However, it's important to note that the impact of a Bitcoin ETF on the cryptocurrency market is difficult to predict, and there are many factors that could influence the price of Bitcoin in the long term. The demand for Bitcoin through ETFs can influence its price. If there is a surge in demand for the ETF shares, it may lead to increased buying pressure on Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price. Conversely, if there is a sell-off in the ETF, it might result in downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.Â  The existence of regulated ETFs may contribute to the perception of maturity in the Bitcoin market. This could attract a more risk-averse set of investors who were previously hesitant to enter the cryptocurrency space due to concerns about security, custody, and regulatory issues. The regulatory approval of Bitcoin ETFs can signal a more favorable stance towards cryptocurrencies from regulatory bodies. This increased regulatory clarity can encourage more institutional participation and investment in the cryptocurrency space. It's essential to note that the impact of Bitcoin ETFs can vary, and their influence on the market is subject to several factors, including regulatory developments, investor sentiment, and overall market conditions.",

Because in my country crypto is banned, and we have taken a lot of debt from the IMF, and which means our government has to accept IMFs conditions as well, in the financial sector only. And now recently IMF asked our government to put a taxation on the crypto sector as well. This means our government has to agree with them and in order to do so, they have to lift the ban on crypto as well. This means there will be more adoption as well because when the crypto ban is lifted more Pakistanis will join crypto and invest more funds in it, although in my opinion, the time to lift the ban is not right because crypto is already on top, and lifting the ban and streamlining the adoption at this time will only serve the purpose of bringing newbies money into the market which then will be used as liquidation to exit the market for old comers.",

It will somewhat bring a sense of legitimacy as this is the main concern of some traditional investors. Although it's going to be still very volatile and decentralized and very technical for traditional investors, but at least this entities will give them the option for them not to worry about it. And that's what we then see there, as millions if not billions already is flowing in the market since last month and pushing the price to new all time high. And now even UK financial watchdogs is allowing crypto asset-backed ETN market for professional investors.QuoteThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a UK listed market segment for cryptoasset-backed Exchange Traded Notes (cETNs). These products would be available for professional investors, such as investment firms and credit institutions authorised or regulated to operate in financial markets only.https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-updates-position-cryptoasset-exchange-traded-notes-professional-investorsSo this could be the domino effect and maybe some countries in Europe could follow too.",
