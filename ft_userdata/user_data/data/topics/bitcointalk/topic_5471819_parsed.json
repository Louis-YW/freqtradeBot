From those points, I can say, in my opinion, the lawsuit means non sense.It happens with all centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and stable coins or more expansion all cryptocurrencies. So why the Senator attacked only Binance and Tether companies?First it is not a fair lawsuit case. Second, I don't see valid points to support the Senator to win the lawsuit against Binance and Tether companies.They can have preventive layers to prevent or reduce money laundering as part of their AML procedure but they can not block all illegal money comes to their platforms. In the USA., their governments can not control guns and Gun Violence Archives still occur. So if they want to borrow that there are holes in Binance and Tether companies for dark money to come in for money laundering, to shut down those companies or with strict punishments, they are playing a dirty game.",

At least they proceed billions of user withdrawals smoothly and their exchange did not collapse after a few days like FTX because of insolvency. I don't know what will happen with Binance in future but based on the past, they are better than FTX.They will surely comply with regulations if they want to keep their business running and I really believe they will not want to shut down their profitable business. Comply with governments and get more money from business operation is good enough for Binance.The lawsuit from the Senator is not like FTX case.",

The story is, they requested a legal case against those funded accounts and then Binance after looking at the case and proof, agreed to ban those accounts. In simple words, Binance cooperated with Israel and other agencies to fulfill the law requirements and blocked those accounts.Actually, someone created a topic on this thing, --> Can the government acquire all bitcoins either by seizure or purchase? as the title give the idea of what should be discussed in it, you will come to know the backstory which I just stated above, when you will read my reply in that topic.Overall, this all is some kind of negative campaign against Binance and this is not new, Binance was being suppressed by many agencies and many cases has been opened against them but still, they are the strong players in the field and that's been proved several time, No doubt they have to leave the US field and some other but they are doing good.",

I am of the type that don't take side, but I value peace more than anything and what preceed peace after is Humanity. US clearly lack that from there dictionary, instead of them to make hasle to provide solution between the two countries, they are fighting Binance when they see Babies are been masacare by the two countries, this is not time to pick side, saves life first and then come back and sue after peace between Izreal and Palastene.There is no hard feelings about Binance and CZ, if they have documents that they are guilty, they should proceed and do, they both have legal person to show up in the court and anyone who is guilty can be fine for their action. Another thing I don't quite understand is how US have power to climb on Binance everytime, isn't there power limited to Binance US since it is only US people that use the exchange, that I'm very certain that CZ and the team will be careful not temper with that exchange to avoid this kind of problems.",

I'm clean now!

I can hardly count the accusations that have been filed against Binance, but almost all of them have been passed by Binance. It's like Binance's dessert for those who are accused of them.  Binance's critics see that, in my assessment, Binance is getting stronger as time goes on. Sometimes I think that the critics of Binance are just jealous. It's like they're really looking for a hole or waiting for an opportunity when they'll attack; that's what's noticeable.",
