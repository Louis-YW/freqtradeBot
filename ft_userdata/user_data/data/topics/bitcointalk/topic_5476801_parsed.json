  "content": "This nation is all we have, and while politicians allocate billions of taxpayer funds to foreign trips and renovating the residences of the Vice President and the President's Chief of Staff straining the economy. Procter & Gamble, a major consumer goods company, is set to discontinue its ground operations in Nigeria, opting for an import-only business model.Procter & Gamble, renowned for products such as Oral B toothpaste, Pampers, Always sanitary pads, Ariel detergent, and Gillette shaving sticks, cites the challenges of operating as a dollar-denominated entity and the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in Nigeria as reasons for its strategic shift.It's noteworthy that this move follows GSK's departure from Nigeria earlier this year, leading to a surge in medicine prices. Similar repercussions are anticipated for Procter & Gamble's products—Oral B toothpaste, Pampers, Always sanitary pads, Ariel detergent, and Gillette shaving sticks.The primary concern is not merely the likelihood of price hikes but whether Nigerian companies exist that can step in with high-quality, locally manufactured alternatives once Procter & Gamble exits the market.https://nairametrics.com/2023/12/06/pg-to-dissolve-ground-operations-in-nigeria-revert-to-an-import-only-business-model/https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/pandg-to-end-manufacturing-operations-in-nigeria-reverts-to-an-import-only-business/55d8rp8#:~:text=P%26G%20produces%20a%20range%20of,toothpaste%2C%20and%20Gillette%20shaving%20stick.",

And the only place I can understand small is the first paragraph which say that politicians are using the money from tax to do things for themselves and if Procter & Gamble stop their operations in the country I don't want will happen because I don't even know these two companies in Nigeria. Op what are these companies producing in the country? Op you can make things easy for others to understand this thread.",

We actually aren’t attracting anymore investors but are actually, expelling them and this time, not by crisis related issues but, the crisis in our economy.The itemized products happens to be an everyday need for a large population of Nigerians and the shift that would be experienced would be on a large scale as well with the price hike these changes would bring and like you said, are we going to have quality alternatives that would be locally made…Quote from: Davidvictorson on December 06, 2023, 05:35:38 PMThe primary concern is not merely the likelihood of price hikes but whether Nigerian companies exist that can step in with high-quality, locally manufactured alternatives once Procter & Gamble exits the market.I’ll like to recount that, Nigerians are highly industrious people. Always on the look out for a means to survive the cruel governance we are constantly suffering. I wouldn’t be surprise to see new brands coming up to fill in the gaps but, I don’t think it’s going to come with lots of quality or would be hoping that our Nigerian brothers and sisters would be devoted to buying locally made goods for its question on quality.",

I wonder how long we should wait for them to help us do this, if they should continue keeping a deaf ear to all this then we start it ourselves doing it personally or as a firm",

The thread no dey difficult to understand , it is as simple as the reality on ground that investors and companies are not feeding it easy to do business in Nigeria and they are packing up to go to countries around west Africa where they can produce at more cheaper rate so that they can maximize their profit and also give customers satisfaction.Me I no blame these companies as dem don try even produce small brands of their products and to the extent companies don reduce quality and quantity but nothing is working. President wey dey carry himself go look for investors, na for on top which amenities dem go take operate? As if the price of fuel don reduce, light wey be the most important for production matter no kukuma dey, so why him dey do the more you look the less you see to Nigerians.Anyway, these companies exit from Nigeria no be today, e start since electricity begin be problem for Nigeria at least since 30 years ago, only say e con worst now. Michelle wey dey do tire, PZ and plenty other companies dey leave. If government fix electricity only self, you go see companies dey rush come Nigeria, no be government go waka go find dem.",

Many Nigerian companies that would have been able to do so and step in to fill the gap have been suffocated by the harsh economy that is in the country. Some have been forced to reduce the quality standard of their products because of the high cost of raw materials so they can still be able to make profit to keep their workers. It is not easy to run a business in our country, it is also tough for big companies as it is for small companies.",

This companies have existed for several years and are major consumer producing companies, there withdrawal of operations from the country will cause market turmoil which will lead to hike in price of this goods in this current economic hardship the country is facing. They could be some other companies that can step in and take the lead but they are likely to misuse the advantage by producing lower quality with same price or same quality with higher price or at the worst case lower quality and higher price. I also saw in the news that the president was imploring multinational companies not to leave the country and that his administration will provide a conducive environment for them to operate in the country thereby removing all obstacles that is stopping them from having to run a smooth business in the country. I think this news came following the withdrawal of operation from the famous GSK company and others (Procter &Gamble) who are intending to leave the country.",

The military, judiciary and executives are currupt. Emagine the the final judgement on presidential election all the barrister who came for the case slept off in court. That is to tell you that it was a planmed predicament. So sincerly speaking to succeed or live longer in this economy one must need to astain from anything government. If those people  that where killed in endsars protest were given second chance to come back to life, dey would run 10000km far away from anything Nigerian politics.

For example, just assume say this country nai motor and driver dey, dey drive us and the driver dey drive us dey go we're we no know, even say we dey talk self them no dey hear, so my brother, just hustle your hustle as long as say no body worry no body, one day e go better.This our country no poor at all, even as say we dey talk say we no get money self, at least 1 or 2 dey account and we still dey find more, so this country no poor at all, if you think say nah our own worst pass make you enter  google, then search for the top 10 poorest county in the world, then you go know say Nigeria is fucking reach bro, but our bad politicians them just spoil everything and even as that self we are what we are.",
