  "content": "\"Users of Solana-based borrowing and lending service Solend voted Sunday to force a takeover of the protocol's largest account: a \"whale\" whose \"extremely large margin position\" was getting, according to Solend contributors, dangerously close to a catastrophic on-chain liquidation cliff.The unprecedented governance vote, Solend's first, will grant Solend Labs \"emergency powers\" to liquidate the whale's vulnerable assets (around $20 million in SOL) via over-the-counter (OTC) trades instead of decentralized exchanges – where decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidations usually occur – if the price of SOL drops too low.Solend Labs said on-chain liquidation of the whale's position \"could cause chaos\" in Solana's DeFi markets.\" Projects that have \"true\" decentralization should not be able to shut the network down. This is one of the important reasons why BTC will always have the true and intrinsic value that some altcoin holders tend to forget, the true decentralization. Thanks for reading my post.",

I guess they will explain soon that there are levels of decentralization. https://twitter.com/Bancor/status/1538662297635282949QuoteDue to hostile market conditions, Bancor’s Impermanent Loss Protection is temporarily paused.

Are they going to have a vote every time something like this happens? Also this means they might still have $20m sat waiting to be liquidated - I don't think anyone smart is going to be dcaing out of a position like that (a more sustained alt crash normally comes after a btc one - compared with both btc and the dollar).",

Once I read the news I checked it on CMC out of curiosity (thank God I never invested in it) expecting to see at least some price drop.I mean there are various reasons for price going up but it could be as well that some people continued investing into this project.

There's nothing to do with Solana but another issue here is Solend which is a Solana-based Defi platform that wants also to save the Solana price which for me is a very red flag.There are a lot of people who are against this, the fund of 1 user will be forced to liquidate just to save the others.I immediately withdraw my funds on that platform after I heard about this issue.",

I am 100% serious. Certainly not a requirement but something that youngsters can learn if they elect to do so. I am sure there will be some crypto enthusiasts in the future who would be willing to do that to prepare young generation to all these  benefits that blockchain can bring to everyday life.

As you made a good point that DAO can not always make sense and Solend was a clear example of that.   It's not correct.Small or big project, it is not big matter. Causes of biased DAO come from tokenomics of a project. If a founder, core team (mostly) and earliest investors (in seed sales) own too dominant tokens in total supply, they can bias DAO vote in a result they want. You rarely find altcoin projects with fair distribution.The Solend case is more terrible, it is not only a biased DAO vote but also an attempt to steal money in a wallet.
