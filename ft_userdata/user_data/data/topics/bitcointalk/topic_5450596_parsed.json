Many will not believe it, but I was able to unravel the MM algorithms on the binance exchange in ETH-USDT trading and based on this I created an MM action analyzer that helps to ideally find the entry point for short and long.

Is it really possible to analyze the market maker behavior completely using an algorithm thingy? Afaik MM behaves based on the actual market condition and having a random price action will surely give an inaccurate data for the analysis since it will just still follow the random behavior of the market.Example if the analyzer provides a long position using the current behavior of the market then suddenly bad news happened. The price will surely go the opposite direction leaving the current long position prediction invalid.",
