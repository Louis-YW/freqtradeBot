This should be important since the you plan to earn on ads. Maybe he is not open to announcing the domain name for now. If anyone is interested in partnering with the OP, I guess they will have to discuss in details because the information in OP is not sufficient to attract any partner to him.Considering that the OP is only planning to earn through ads, the money that will come from ads is not coming immediately and not going to be much. I feel the OP created this thread early. He would have waited to have a more clear understanding of his project.",

If you are thinking of becoming an investor, you can contact me.The crypto industry is going through difficult times right now.  The price of Bitcoin and Ethereum is currently low (due to the impact of the bear market).  In this situation, in my opinion, for new startups large development teams, loans and attracting investors are an unnecessary luxury.  It is better to create startups alone, using exclusively your own resources (without attracting third-party investors).  You write that you are a qualified developer.....Currently, software developers have excellent assistants - language models, neural networks (GPT-4, Google Bard, Claude 2).  All these neural networks can create program code.  They can speed up the coding process, meaning you can bring your project to life faster than you would without using these tools.  Perhaps you don’t need an investor at all - you can do all the work yourself and with a minimal budget.",
