  "content": "The next two years will be 2025, and there's this talk of joining the BRICS nation by then. Supposing our government is really serious and actionable in their quest to make the current living conditions bearable, do you think the idea to join BRICS countries is a solution to our economic crisis?How true is this and do you think this is up for a serious consideration, because the dollar has more dominance over our economy and market currently and would fight to keep it so. It is this same dollar that has been on a steady rise that is a resulting effect on the current high prices of goods and services in the country too?Are we being played again, or this is legit upon careful consideration?Share your thoughts!Source link:https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz-kpDQo2fw/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==",

As a member of UN and other international organizations, nothing positive dey happen with the economy wey don dey retrogress for close to 10 years now if we even exclude PDP regime. Naija problem na leaders wey no want do right thing because dem see Nigeria as business.Although BRICS want to create common currency for their members but that go only benefit the members with progressive economy no be naija wey be consumption economy. Dollar no be the problem, so any currency wey dem still introduce no go mean anything if dem no fix electricity, refinery, roads, reduce corruption through building of institutions and reduce powers of president and governors.",

If taken some countries as example with stable economy, there is little inflation and yet high standard of living (which matters most) in such countries, unlike how things has been in Nigeria.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 26, 2023, 01:31:12 PMAre we being played again, or this is legit upon careful consideration?What we need is within us in Africa but we are not just getting it right. And this fault is somehow beyond government but some extended within everyone of us. Although, joining BRICS or not, if we continue not to know where we are faulty within ourselves we would not still have a good standard of living.We also need good leadership. Nigerian GDP was higher in Jonathan time which was the president before former president Buhari, and now incumbent president Tinubu. Buhari came at the time to worsen the nation economy and made it sink. Bad leadership is not helping at all. This is not even only about former president but our leaders generally.",
