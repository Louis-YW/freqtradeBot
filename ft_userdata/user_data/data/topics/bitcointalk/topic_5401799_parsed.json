  "content": "I have one of those DIY Monero poker chips from Krypto Keepsafes. I've never used Monero for anything else other than redeeming certain pre-funded/buyer funded coins. I was wondering how to load the keys under the hologram of the poker chip, since Monero requires a view key and spend key to be able to access the funds. Fitting both keys under the hologram would be quite a challenging task to achieve. After all, both keys have a long string of characters behind them.If you know how to load DIY Monero coins, please let me know. Any help, suggestions and/or recommendations will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

I was going to place them in text format, but it wouldn't work with Monero the same way it would with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. I'm going to try placing the keys on my brand new DIY Monero poker chip following your advice. Thanks, guys!",
