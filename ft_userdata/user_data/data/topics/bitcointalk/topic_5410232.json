A wise investment should only be made when we conduct our own research and do not listen to the advice of anyone else. I am convinced that bitcoin is going to hit $30k and may even reach a new ATH at some point in the future. We cannot pinpoint a specific time for when this will happen, but it will eventually happen.",

And that's what happen in 2022, getting lower lows of $17,500. The best time to buy bitcoin is yesterday, and the second best time? is today. And you will have to look at the long term to really make profit in bitcoin. A good 2-3 years of investment and buying in the dip will be a good strategy. So we will see if $30k, can be achieved and unlocked at the end of the year, it's not a numbers though, if we didn't hit it, nothing to worry.",

And hopefully even a $20000 at the end of the year is already a big reassurance that maybe next year is very different.",

It's just that sooner or later, it's bound to happen.It's all guesswork and we won't know if bitcoin will go up or down, but at this point if we don't buy bitcoin it will be a mistake because in the long run bitcoin price will always go higher every year.",

What ever your prediction with Bitcoin is, you need to focus on that and don't listen to any noise in the market, Bitcoin may fall but eventually it will rise again, it's just a matter of time before we see it pumping again.",

Currently, we are still in the quarter 3 of the year so maybe there are still declines that will happen but by the time we hit the fourth and final quarter.
