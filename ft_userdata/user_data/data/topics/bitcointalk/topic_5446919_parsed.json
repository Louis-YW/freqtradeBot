Like in my country where I'm from these set of people (politicians) just feel they are the only ones fit to run the country and you find it hard to see someone between the age of 40yrs and above to rule as president or any higher position, is really outrageous and irritating. Why is greed speaking more in politics? Must every politician(s) think only about themselves other than the citizens? I really don't blame most countries that engages in protest year in year out, nobody would be happy to have guys who ship in money into the development of their own businesses other than developing the country.",

The political class, can hardly entrust powders to a younger person not within their circles, So they easily pass the political positions to their loyalist even though the person is 80+ years.",

The most important virtues in leadership are integrity and willingness to serve. A leader that is selfless and compassionate will always perform better than selfless and greedy politicians. I don't see age as a barrier because even some of these youthful leaders end up becoming tyrants and dubious. Nelson Mandela was 75years when he became the president of South Africa and till date he is one of the best leaders in Africa. Abiy Ahmed the Prime minister of Ethiopia was 41 when he assumed office, look at what a Nobel prize winner has turned Ethiopia into. The reason why most people agitate for younger leaders is because they are stronger, open to new ideas and innovative. There is not correlation between younger politicians and good governance. Most youths in my country will steal more than the old politicians if they assume political offices.",

Age isn't a barrier but with the way they make it look like if is not the older ones nobody can handle a certain position better than they're doing. Talking about greed, is like politicians have it in their DNA always them first which is not fair IMO, so they should sometimes let the youth be part of them allowing them to share ideas (like you said) with them (the older ones) and it will go alone way. They're all willing to serve if not they won't be there but willing to serve and take more is something I dislike. And the citizens especially the youths will even avoid some crazy things like crime and all that because they'll know how to talk sense into them.QuoteThe reason why most people agitate for younger leaders is because they are stronger, open to new ideas and innovative. There is not correlation between younger politicians and good governance. Most youths in my country will steal more than the old politicians if they assume political offices.Well that's the truth no doubt but I think is the elderly ones who influence the younger ones to do what they're doing, is like if we don't give them it will look like we're cheating them, in my country they'll say \"scratch my back and I'll scratch yours too\".You have to do something to get paid that's it.",

An old leader will have more experience in handling issues than a young leader due to their experience in life and in politics.Good leaders are good fathers to the nation. The problem with Nigeria political system is that they are the same old politicians since in the 70s that are coming back to rule. Meaning that they were young leaders then,so all I see is the same bad eggs that are re-enforcing back to steal the country's funds because their friends are the ones in government.",

Before a country can develop and move forward, the intending and aspiring leaders would have to put aside greed and the need to swell their personal coffers first.  Just like you pointed out, politics is for the mature, but what then happens if the \"matured\" no longer think maturedly? Also, when room is not given to the younger ones to try, how would one be able to rate their maturity?",
