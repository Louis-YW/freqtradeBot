      "body": "The best advice is the one you give yourself. When you purchased your Bitcoin, what was your initial plan for the coin? Did you plan to hold on for long? Or you planned to just pick up a few bucks and leave? The decision you need to make now is based on the plans you have had from the very start. If you have the plan of hodling for a long time, then I will advise you to keep on hodling until you can make a larger profit. But if your plan was just for a few dollars of profit, then you can cash out now. But I really don't see $6.32 (base on current USD-NAIRA rate) as a big profit. Unless you need to use the funds for something else, if not, I would rather you continue hoarding. The market is always this way; we don't expect it to always be stable or to always be bullish. Sometimes we need to experience a bearish market in order to prepare us for the bull run ahead.",

There is a chance of a bull market in coming months if you can hold it till that time then you will most probably gain more profits than what you are getting now. If I was on your place then I should definitely hold my Bitcoin, and wait for the next bull run. Because, the next bull run will definitely give a lot in return for the patience.You should focus on good ROI, because an investment with less than 20% ROI is not a good decision, and any good investor won't accept that much if the initial capital is not too much. You will have good experience by holding those Satoshi's for few months, and with that you will learn the benefits of long term holding in crypto market and you will not only have good ROI, but in future that knowledge will help you in other investments.",

It would be best if you decided for yourself depending on your situation. If you need money urgently for living and raising children, you should sell it.

We will definitely be waiting for something big.  Don't get too flustered that the value of Bitcoin has temporarily dropped. We should be patient at this time.

It's only a matter of time before the price of Bitcoin goes to $40K. If we can be patient and trust the market then we will see this price change of Bitcoin very soon.

If you're simply planning to sell because it's going down, probably a dumb idea. I'd suggest you to replan your investment ideas and set up a specific time frame instead, or maybe a specific profit at specific time frames, multiple ones so that if it doesn't go according to it you can go to the next one.Now If you're selling because you're gonna buy and sell in the short term, I reckon anytime you profit is a good time to sell, you can simply buy at bigger dips when they come.",

It could go up or continue to plummet from here, so no advice for you, as no one wants you to blame. In investing, you should have a specific goal for yourself, that is, you need to have a goal to sell as well as hold for how long. You should not invest according to emotions and become too greedy, the market moves unpredictably, so it will cause you more pain than pleasure. If you need money, you should sell your bitcoins because your child's needs are still more important.",

True, emotions can sometimes run high when investing, but it is important to make a rational decision based on your financial goals.Regarding the decision to hold or take profit can be tricky due to the unpredictable nature of the Bitcoin market, it is difficult to know what will happen in the future. If you need money for your maintenance, it may be wise to take advantage and use it for your immediate needs. Remember to keep some invested for long term growth.",
