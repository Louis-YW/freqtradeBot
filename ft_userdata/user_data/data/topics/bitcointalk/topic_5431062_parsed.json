But i am still waiting.  It's pure lending. I collateraled a precious thing in the business. My \"Honest\". I collateraled my \"Honest\" in the lending business. (Sorry for my broken English).   Happy New year wishes to youYour \"honest\" has a value of 0 USD so no, it's not a valid collateral. Have you tried to go in a bank and say: \"Can you give me a loan? I give my \"honest\" as collateral?\" If you're lucky they will just let you go without consequences, in some cases they can call a good medical doctor or in some countries even the police !!! Why you think that asking such request to some strange on internet it would be better?  Rhetoric question, you don't need to answer, no ones care about ....",

But I hate to see new accounts ask for loan. It is going to end in scamming someone. Those accounts should still get tagged to save other unintelligent users from falling for their trap.",
