For your sake and mine, I hope he's still bullshitting.Kim Kong Un is an attention seeker that should not be taken seriously. Most of the military equipment of North Korea are overestimated in a bid to move the US and the West to reconsider economy crippling sanctions placed on the isolated nation. All the war threat is nothing but idle babbling that will not be backed with actions. North Korea cannot fund a war because Western sanctions have destroyed its economy. The only reason the US and its allies have not taken any military action against North Korea is not because of its military arsenal but because of its proximity to Japan and South Korea which are core allies of the West. Kim Kong Un will not shoot even a bullet across any country because he is aware of the economic and military weakness of his country.",

Is just an attention seeker indeed. 5years back I used to think he is stubborn and wouldn't want to listen to the world power. Donald Trump first speech directed to North Korea, in a bellicose first address to the United Nations general assembly 5 years ago got Kim K. Scared and everything about his pride was calm. I still haven't heard from him or his threats on social media or on cable as it used to be. He is still hiding and enjoying his dictatorship kind of rule in North Korea .",

Unless something extraordinary happens, it seems he is just exaggerating and flexing his military readiness more to get more attention than getting ready for war. I think the likelihood of some military action going on still is not gonna happen barring some unforeseen incident. For now from my perspective, it appears that Kim is just posturing rather than planning to \"make a war happen\" or pull a trigger on us Westerns ðŸ˜€",

For your sake and mine, I hope he's still bullshitting.I am not sure he will. from the news report, he is doing this as preparation for the future and maybe based on intelligence report that he has received. It is also strategy to publish and make this news very public so it can be intimidating to any country that hears it, and a bold statement to say that they are ready for any situation that will be thrown against them. This will make any country with plans of aggression towards them to rethink their actions.",

They flex their nukes and posture like theyâ€™re going to start a war, then China or the US sends them some foods and all is well again.

Real reason why this pompous blustering is happening right now, is the fact that there are annual US-South Korea joint military exercises happening nearby, and NK doesn't want to seem weak at in eyes of their own citizens or the world. They are viewing this as practise for invasion.",

While they're practicing missiles near Japan and South Korea, that's really alarming when these top officials are being replaced and switched as its internal affairs have something to do with what they're about to do. I also hope that Kim won't press the button on this one, we don't know how big it will be and we don't wanna really know because we don't want that to happen. Whatever triggers them is probably if their allies try to call for them or if they're asked to join them in their war but for sure with economical, they won't have impact but it's a different talk if it's about collateral damages.",

They are viewing this as practise for invasion.I don't think Kim and his generals actually believe an invasion could happen against North Korea. In this kind of scenario where the foe also has access to nuclear weapons a frontal invasion would only be translated to a nuclear conflict, which is the most feared scenario on the west.If the United States ever tries to take over North Korea it would be only if they managed to disable their nuclear arsenal or disassemble their political elite.Whether North Korea actually believes there is a possibility of invasion or not, I do hope they never dare to launch a nuclear weapon anywhere outside their territory.",

South Korea is not Ukraine, they are armed to their teeth and have thousands of modern artillery systems which are strictly designed for decades to fight this precise war.The nuclear option gets US involved and North Korea;s regime destroyed, likely along a number of innocent bystanders. The conventional option gets South Korea seriously harmed, but North Korea's regime obliterated 100%. They have to keep a whole population in check internally. He who has to make an effort to control himself, is unlikely to be ever able to control someone else.",
