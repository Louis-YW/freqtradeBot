That's right, not everyone is destined with instant wealth, there are also people who work hard to get rich with the skills they have, on the other hand there are also people who only receive wealth from their parents not working hard by themselves. But I'm sure people who have the skills to work if they try to achieve the wealth they dream of can get it, because by working hard it will produce something positive also if they have a good mindset then I think they can achieve that. You are right in saying that the economy will not be balanced if everyone becomes rich, because of the cycle of life where there is income and expenses financially or basic daily needs. So if everyone is rich, it seems like there won't be anyone who works hard.",

Truly, it isn't, unlike paper money, BTC and other coins stand as money. The difference is the decentralized system on which it functions. The only way the poor can become rich is by developing the knowledge that they currently have.

Being poor is a destiny that must be changed with advanced knowledge and thinking. People who have been born rich are usually already in the safe zone and just continue what already exists, such as businesses and such.

Cryptocurrency is here no restrictions no limits and only your imagination how much you can earn.This is not how money or wealth works. In capitalism, people don't \"deserve\" to be funded because they are talented. Money is not something fair, nor is society. You can be totally narcissistic and evil and be tthe richest man in the world. That's how capitalism works. And even those rich people can lose money by investing, and if they would invest percentually high amount in relation to their wealth. they can lose everything as well. Also crypto is not here to make everyone rich or wealthy. It can make some people wealthy who enter at the right time. It also can get people rekt when they enter in the wrong coin at the wrong time.Wealth in the world has a cap, so not everyone can be rich. Whole richness would lose meaning when everyone had their equal share. So if you want that, you don't want to be rich or money. You just want decent living conditions and life quality. That you can achieve with some different system than capitalism. If you start to talk about distributing wealth. That wouldn't mean distributing capital flow as that's only a form of wealth, that would most likely break down instantly when everyone got their share of it. Even in social democracy, distribution of money flow isn't even nearly equal. That's still mostly capitalism.",

Those who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth remain to have the undue advantage. this is exactly why the best way to get out of poverty is through education and scholarship because that way we can build our way up from scratch, save all those money, and then invests, might seem very difficult but thats the truth, scholarship exists to give good talent what they deserve and we can be one of them through hardwork, which of course might not necessarily yield the expected results if we lack the required aptitude anyway.therefore its always only very few people could get out of the circle of poverty.",
