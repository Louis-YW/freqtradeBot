  "content": "as these have to be personalized - I dont see really how to do a group buy unless everyone is wanting to do 20 packs each as they are only sold in 20 pack for 139, 50 pack for 299 or 100 pack for 499 USD.there are 4 designs as well and they can be denominated as .001, .002, .005 or .01 BTC - They  are the PURE series plastic cards so will work only with BTCThis is to gauge interest in a possible group buy where the cards say something such as \"From Satoshi Nakamoto\" instead of your personal name.If interested please post how many sets you would like followed by your forum name.The cost would be 4 x 139 or 556 for 80 cards or 27.80 per set --- DO NOT SEND any funds at this time, we need at least 20 sets to be sold but if we get enough interest we could possibly do 50 sets. If we do 50 sets the price would be 23.92 per set. At 100 sets the price would be 19.96 per set.20 sets were ordered - cost for 1 set of 4 cards is 27.80 — pymt address below.Interested:2 - MoparMiningLLC paid1 - pinky1234 paid1 - tweetious paid1 - minerjones paid1 - cygan paid2 - Stackinsats777 paid1 - Spokanistan51 paid1 - amax16 paid2 - yodasredrocket paid1 - MrMojoRising26 paid2 - anonymous buyer paid2 - telegram buyer paidtotal: 17can send pymts to:btc address: bc1qn37ly2yjla0thlnfsverzezrvxtxdsyvecp4esor paypal: MoparMiningLLC@gmail.comor if you want a LN invoice, just let me know and I can send you one via DM",
