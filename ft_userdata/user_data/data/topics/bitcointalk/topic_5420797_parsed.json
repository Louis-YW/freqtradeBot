Precisely forex trading is a little regulated. I said a little regulated because some forex platforms can also scam exit you but it is highly regulated and traders know reputable platforms plus the government under which they are operated have severe monitoring of them especially those in the US and UK. So it is not like cryptocurrency exchanges, so far I'm yet to see total government involvement in cryptocurrency exchanges and of course this was not the spirit of cryptocurrency. We need to be careful handling crypto investment, FTX crash is not the first crypto crash or scam but it is one of the biggest because of the popularity of the exchange.",

ITs been told for thousand times that never ever consider on making exchange platform account to be your main wallet of your assets.In times similar to this then you would really be making yourself getting fucked up since you cant really be able to retrieve or get your funds.",
