Saying something is different than doing something.  Its really up to the seller though. I've been into rare collectables for over a decade and rarely do gold pieces bring 3x, but some do. the rare ones will. which is why I offered. They can always counter offer.If I only have a rare piece and people need it to finish their set. Id rather it go to them so they can finish off the set, but each their own.  10x is closer to 9k for 1/2 oz gold redeemed.",
