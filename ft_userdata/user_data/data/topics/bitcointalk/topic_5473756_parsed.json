  "content": "I received a mail on my inbox. It took me some days before i went through my inbox and i read it.This is the full content of the email. here There is a major scandal brewing at the Wall Street Journal related to their bitcoin coverage. Two reporters, Angus Berwick and Ian Talley, recently wrote an article titled “Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto.”The article claimed that Hamas and their affiliates raised approximately $130 million in cryptocurrency donations. For obvious reasons, this would be very concerning if it was true. That is a big “if” though.Elliptic, the platform that the Wall Street Journal reporters allegedly used to come up with this analysis, came out publicly yesterday and said that the analysis is wrong. In fact, the Elliptic team wrote in a statement “there is no evidence to suggest that crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted.”That should be the end of the story, right?Unfortunately no. More than 100 lawmakers came together to sign a letter to national security leadership calling for a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. What was their argument? That the Wall Street Journal article proved that terrorists were using cryptocurrency to raise obnoxious amounts of money.Think about how ridiculous this situation is.The Wall Street Journal published an article that is inaccurate. That article was read by hundreds of our lawmakers, who then decided to create pressure on other administration officials based on the inaccurate information.The mainstream media is programming the brains of our lawmakers with fake news.There has been no retraction of the story from the journalists.They are actually doubling down on Twitter/X and refusing to acknowledge their mistake, although the platform they used to do the analysis has publicly said they are wrong.There has been no comment or retraction of the letter from lawmakers that is now proven to be based on false information.The scary part in this scenario is that if lawmakers are so easily swayed by inaccurate reporting, we should ask ourselves what other legislation is being proposed after someone consumed inaccurate information?This brings me to a point that I made on CNBC’s Squawk Box yesterday. Bitcoin does not care about the politics in Washington DC. The asset is oblivious to what is happening in the world.If the US was to take the extreme measure of banning or outlawing bitcoin, the rest of the world would continue to adopt the technology. They may even accelerate their adoption because it would be seen as a positive sign that bitcoin is outside of the US system.So while our politicians are being tricked by the mainstream media, it would still not solve the problem that they are claiming to want to solve.Bad people are going to do bad things with technology, regardless of the rules. If the US took the most extreme steps at home, it would not stop criminals from trying to use the technology.Thankfully, the criminals are one step ahead in this situation though and they have figured out that using a public ledger for committing crimes is a horrible idea.The market has solved the problem and does not require new rules or regulations.We have to be very careful that we do not simply become a country where the creation of regulations is the norm. We should want the least regulations possible while still accomplishing our overarching goals.The whole situation on this topic is unfortunate. The media was likely trying their best to do good work and analysis. The lawmakers took the information and analysis at face value. It is easy to see how we got here.Now that we know the information is inaccurate, the media should retract and/or correct the article and lawmakers should publicly correct their comments as well.There is a misconception and i want to focus my discussion on some key points1. Bitcoin itself is not tied to any financial crimes. Yes, it can be use by criminals as a means to receive payment from. There is a difference between misuse by individuals and the Bitcoin technology itself. Bad people are going to do bad things just like the sender said, regardless of the rules surrounding the technology. Even if there is a law to stop Bitcoin in a particular country criminals will not still stop to use the technology in other countries.  2. Government and Information should consider focusing on the need for accurate information before disseminating it to the public. This incident was caused by misinformation that has led to the sudden hash government actions and decision towards cryptocurrency especially the pioneer Bitcoin. 3.  Hasty decision based on inaccurate information can cause a huge consequence not on Bitcoin but to the society at large. The law makers should have conducted through investigation before proposing to take actions on anything. These scenario has exposed the envies of the lawmakers and government heads towards bitcoin and its technology.",

Now Bitcoin is coming up, there are a lot of fingers pointing at it, countries have banned it as if their politicians don’t use it behind the scene. All Satoshi built was a currency accessible to everyone (just like fiat is), so I don’t see why they keep pointing at Bitcoin.

It is just too obvious that the government and its people don’t want the legalization of bitcoin neither do they want the consensus of decentralization in which it operates. This is not the first time we have been hearing many negativity being attached to the name of bitcoin and it continues always. Before the coming of bitcoin, fiat was used for many illegal purposes and that hasn’t stopped till date. Both of them are being used for good and bad purposes but that doesn’t mean we should dislike or give a negative and permanent thought about them in which it was not what they were built on to do.",

It doesn't need to satisfy anyone's unreasonable desires anyway, even if they object to it more, the truth will never be killed, and the truth here is that people will accept Bitcoin more. Well, mentioning the word OP reminds me of another story about a pen, when the user has the right to use it for their own purposes, and when the murderer uses it as a weapon, will people conclude that? That pen is the culprit. The main issue is how responsible people are when using that tool.",

There were wars, terrorism and illegal funding long before Bitcoin's presence and they are trying to link terrorism with Bitcoin & crypto to tarnish it's image and to create some sort of fear in people's mind about crypto. It's better baseless as usual, They will fail this time as well like they did in the past and it's a failure ont heir part that they didn't speculate this and had proper Intel about the conflict and now trying to shift the blame over crypto currency. These conflicts are happening for over 50 years and we should question the. that if crypto is used as a medium to collect donations then what was the medium which was used for terror funding before existence of crypto. We just need to ignore these news as people with even slightest common sense would understand the intention of this news as they used similar claim for isis as well.",

How does criminals make payment for guns on the dark web before 2008? how was human trafficking funded before 2008? how were serial killers funded before 2008? all this are questions they know the answer to, but might not want to say the truth.Bitcoin is here to stay, regardless of what ever anyone does.",

I guess that's going to be helpful because the OP didn't mentioned that how he received the mail and from whom did he received that mail. I don't think that such allegations are any new in the sphere of Bitcoin and those type of allegations against Bitcoin will take place every here and there. I remember that during the times of Russia-Ukraine war such type of false allegations against Bitcoin were raised and now those same people are again raising such allegations to defame Bitcoin. Their main point is to show that Bitcoin is used for crime activities but they never show the truth that fiat and other payment systems are also used for crime activities. Bitcoin is a payment system and it depends on the users who are part of the payment system. They get their own personal wallets and from those wallets they can send their Bitcoin to anyone they want. Criminals or even laymen can have their Bitcoin wallets and people can have literally millions of wallets without any restrictions. Bitcoin is for everyone, and it is on the mentality of someone that how he/she uses it.",

LOL, they are jealous because they can't fully control Bitcoin or crypto and don't get rewarded for their transactions. If Bitcoin is associated as a tool to support acts of war, the wrong thing is not the tool but the user. Like criminals using dollars to buy guns and bombs. Random emails like this that are sent to many people just want to do propaganda, and spread bad news about Bitcoin or the crimes of one of the camps. Especially the US which openly supports the Zionists.There will be no point in banning Bitcoin, Bitcoin cannot be regulated by anyone and they can only provide regulations in their country.",

It's either they are incapable of digesting such data or they're biased or they're simply irresponsible. Either way, they should have just avoided acting on them.

So anyone can use it to keep them safe. Bitcoin is not to blame here. It will be used as we use it. Those who commit crimes should be brought under the law. We won't find a healthy solution just by keeping one country away from using Bitcoin. The era has changed so the government of any country has to find solutions depending on technology.",
