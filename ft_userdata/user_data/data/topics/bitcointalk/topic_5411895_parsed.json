If anyone is interested in learning more, getting involved, or supporting feel free to reach out or reply!This is very interesting but what's the update now, if you are a coalition of 100 universities and you have a great goal in the blockchain, you should create your website for interaction or a chat group, by posting only your email you become a suspect of hidden agenda I'm sure you have thousands of people in your coalition, how do you communicate and where members can access updates on their coalition, we are living in the age of the internet and having an online presence is a must for a big group, even a small group have one.",

If anyone is interested in learning more, getting involved, or supporting feel free to reach out or reply!Look interesting, if possible, can you expand to another university in our country (Indonesia)? if yes, what are the requirements?, and What methods are used for the students to make it easy and simple to learn?, as I know Blockchain is a complex science which needs focus in studying it, when separated by country, we can use zoom or meet aplication, but it's not easy because not face to face between students and teacher which makes it difficult to realize.",

      "body": "Heyy everyone!!We are Learnoverse, the platform where you build crypto skills with courses, data, certificates, and degrees from leading blockchain companies.The conventional centralized higher education system takes 4-6 years to educate a person and there is no guarantee of employment afterwards. We believe that the digital industry today lacks workforcebecause higher education institutions are not responding to the needs of actual labor market. Most of the skills needed by the digital industry don’t even require a degree in higher education. Workforcethat has practical digital economy skills and willingness to learn is needed. That is why today more and more tech-savvy teens get freelancing jobs and earn more than their parents do.BitDegree is world’s first blockchain-powered, smart-incentives based online education platform which will revolutionize global education and tech recruiting. The main purpose of the BitDegreeplatform is to let Students acquire skills that are currently required by the labor market. The way to do it is not to ask business what skills they need in the far future (3-5 years), but to respond to explicitly expressed skilled labor demand quickly. BitDegree will directly align the incentives of students and anyone who wants them to become knowledge workers in digital economy - like current or potentialemployers, digital service providers and sponsors. Smart-incentive is a smart contract on Ethereum network ensuring the exchange of tokens between a sponsor (the Incentive Creator) and a student(the Incentive Taker), who is committing to study a specific subject in order to receive tokens (the Incentive). The BitDegree platform will offer students online courses with a clear and transparent blockchain-based reward system and achievement tracking. Our use case for blockchain is not sensitive to prolonged waiting periods before transactions are committed, thus, overall platformoverhead (as in expenses) of using Ethereum network for transactional and immutable data storage needs, will be low. To make the learning process as exciting as playing Minecraft we will use Octalysis framework of gamification design.",
