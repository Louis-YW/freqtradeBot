  "content": "CNBC's host of \"Mad Money,\" Jim Cramer, has visited the Squawk Box show to talk about Bitcoin and traditional markets. The host shared his skepticism regarding Bitcoin reversing and starting to go up. He mentioned that recent appearances of Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz and MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor on CNBC earlier this week were \"a stand show.\" He believes that these two major investors in Bitcoin had to put it up as \"they can't let it go down any more,\" so they took up the role of people who say that this price dump is a norm before BTC skyrockets. This is a normal state of affairs for crypto prices.Finally, Cramer shared that he believes Bitcoin is going to go down to $12,000, the level where \"it was before this whole fiasco began.\" Details: https://u.today/jim-cramer-expects-bitcoin-to-dump-to-12000-its-pre-fiasco-level What is your comment after reading this article?",

It’ll get bigger and bigger and bigger.\"Quote from: Jim Cramer“If my boom thesis is true… you are crazy not to have Bitcoin… I don’t care if it is $70,000 right now. I’d be saying the same thing… The boom means Bitcoin.”",

That being said, i am not sure how low the market would go but one thing is certain that the price would rally, the only positive aspect is that to wait for the next halving and the price would rally without a shadow of doubt irrespective of how low the price will go.",

Idiots who start predicting the next price and their opinions are spread on the internet as if it matters!The real question is why does bullshit of a local TV personality even worth repeating in a speculation board?!!",
