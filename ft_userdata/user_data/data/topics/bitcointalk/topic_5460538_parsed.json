Could you please tell me how can I fix this problem and how can have access to my funds inside. OP, Ensure your firewall is not blocking the internet connection to the Electrum wallet. You will see a red or green circle bottom right corner; if it's red, you are not connected to the server. Click on it, and Check the box Select server automatically (Another way is Tools>Network). It should work. If it doesn't work as well, try deleting cache data. Delete \"recent_servers\" file from the electrum data directory. Make sure you back up your wallet before doing this.If you are using a portable version of Electrum, you might face several issues. Try running it as regular software. Oh, oh, several replies were already posted during my writing time. Never mind",

If you did, Electrum doesn't automatically select another server even if you were to check the box to select server automatically. The remedy for this is to right click any of the server from the server list (unchecking select server automatically in the process) and then select that as the server instead. Do this until you are connected to at least one node.",

Setting use a local proxy service or such as Tor to reach the internet as 'no' if connecting directly with IP address, and connect to server as 'auto connect'. If not synchronizing, moving to a new device would be the better option. But I am wondering why the OP has not posted anything yet because I think one of the above suggestions would have worked.",

Probably things happens like that and I think LMT16 should try your suggestion too. But on both mobile and desktop Electrum, I connect to inactive servers that made the green icon turns red which means no connection again, I did not connect to any active server, I just check connect automatically and it turned green back on both mobile and desktop Electrum. I even played with it and it is automatically connecting immediately.",

So I think it would be safer to uninstall the Electrum first and download it again and verify to make sure he is using an authentic Electrum wallet.",

The workaround to spend the funds is to create a transaction even while its offline and broadcast it elsewhere.Take note that it'll only work if your transaction history hasn't changed since you last synced the wallet.Here's how to do it:After filling up the recipient and amount, click \"Pay...\";Set a fee rate based from mempool.space since the fee estimation algorithms wont work offline, then click \"Preview\".In the Advanced transaction preview, click \"Sign\", type your password to sign the txn.Then export it through: \"Share->Copy to clipboard\".To broadcast, go to any blockexplorer with broadcast/push transaction feature like blockstream.info/tx/push,paste the copied signed raw transaction and lastly, click \"Broadcast\" and it'll be sent to the Bitcoin network.Electrum wont see it since it's offline but you can query the TXID in any blockexplorer.For the sync issue, you might have to enable and check the logs and provide more info.
