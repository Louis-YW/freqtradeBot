  "content": "I do not see any thread dedicated to the discussion of only the Rugby World Cup that are happening in France at the moment. Let's use this thread to discuss the Rugby World Cup and your betting strategy for this tournament. I do not want us to discuss this in a mixed thread, where other Rugby tournaments are discussed. It was a mixed bag of emotions with the winners and losers of the opening games, with the All Blacks losing against France in the opening game of the tournament on Friday. Â South Africa are the defending champion and they did not impress with their first half performance against Scotland. I was amazed with the good performance of England and also very impressed with the fast paced win from Ireland. The betting in this tournament will be tough, because we have a lot of teams with very good chances of winning their matches with close margins. Let's share betting strategies and discuss the upcoming games for the rest of the tournament.",
