      "body": "This animosity has become a classic and has taken various forms, including competition in several areas. This was one of the most prominent remnants of the Second World War and is a direct result of it. We are still witnessing it today, and it was not possible to stop it even after the collapse of the Soviet Union.This does not cancel out the fact that the two forces are obliged to deal side by side in several sectors, most notably scientific research and the exchange of some basic raw materials for different industries.",

      "body": "In politics, interest changes with time. It happened even with Nigeria during the administration of Goodluck Jonathan and Barack Obama. Jonathan fell out of favour with the Obama government over the way he handled insurgents in the north. But the current administration has done worse in that aspect yet the US government is not concerned. Interest has changed. That is what happened with US and Russia. Maybe tomorrow they will go back being friends again.",

      "body": "Well, Russia/US relationship is nothing new nor is ir secret. The iron curtain went down much earlier than we really think. I always remember the story of Pepsi being introduced in Russia in the 70s (or something like that), way before the curtain fell and other brands were let in. I know this is a small example, but it just one example on how Russian/US economic realtions have in fact never been bad, and were, more or less continous. And I bet you they would resume tomorrow if Russia stoped the war.",

      "body": "A change in government most time comes with changes in foreign policies and alignment. When a leader feels that the actions or inaction of a particular country affects the national interest of his country, their relationship would become frosty. Sometime the selfish interest of leaders also determines the friendship and economic relationship with other countries. It was rumored that Donald Trump was aided to win elections by Russia and all through his administration, Putin was a close ally. Barack Obama made China extremely rich by his economic policies and his government felt it was also beneficial to the US economy. But Trump felt that China was US economic foe, hence his policies was targeted at reducing US imports of Chinese products.",
