  "content": "hi all,i have been looking at this model and would like some other opinions about it.i want to mine BTC however i cant seem to see feasibility as the numbers just dont add up..My Aim: to accumulate as much BTC for the least available pricethis is based on a 24 month periodOption #1:- Spend approx. 50k on S19s 110th (which will purchase me 7 units here, $AUD)- energy cost: 0.16c/kw- approx. monthly energy cost: $2784.00- giving me a hash rate of roughly 770over a 24 month period i would have outlaid, my initial equipment cost of $50,000.00, plus 24 months worth of energy $66,816.00, for a total exposure of: $116,816.00And based on my hash rate and some adjusted difficulty, i would have produced roughly: 2.15 BTCVERSUSOption #2:- spend $100,000 now in full and buy: 3.41 BTC- if BTC goes down, i still have 3.41 BTC, great- if BTC goes up, the value of my 3.41 BTC has increasedmy question is, based on the info above what is; my incentive to mine?over a 24 month period, it seems the Buy Now option will render me owning more BTC than mining, will not expose me to energy rate fluctuations, and can liquidate for fiat fiat faster if necessary.have i missed something in my analysis?thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and helping",

But, small miners are really in a tough spot at the moment.Think about it before just jumping in. -Dave",

      "body": "Seems your purpose is to know which can be more profitable for you in a long run between mining and DCA'ing. Both are profitable I would say, just depending on how you see your profit. But you should also know that most persons who can engage in mining do so at times not just because of the profit but also the technical knowledge and love they have for it, love most importantly because some factors can be discouraging but it takes a lot to continue. So I would say before you take a decision on which to do, take into consideration the love you have for each of them, and weigh your options. Nothing also stops you from doing both if it is within your means.",

Both have their risks, both have their benefits.Some prefer the apples, some prefer the oranges, others prefer both the same; it doesn't make one better than the other.This being said, pick the one you think it's better for you.PS. Some also compare holding mined coins with holding bought coins, but that's imho a mistake in the logic.",

      "body": "In my humble opinion mining protects you (mentally ) from the BTC/USD price drops, as long as you have very cheap electricity.You get returns during the bear market, even though they're small, but they are constant, although declining over time.Generally, not too many miners join during the bear market, so you can collect substantial bag of BTC over time.Later, when the price is high, you have the coins and the gear, which you can sell for double the price it cost you to buy.As others mentioned - taking good care of the gear is the key, as it can suddenly break. But it is also usually not very expensive to repair in a bear market.",

I mean aside from the mania phases we had in every cycle where price goes up 2-5x in a few months before difficulty does, anything above 10 cents has always been risky despite the efficiency of the gear you mine on.Before the China ban we know the average power rate for the Chines miners was anywhere between 4 to 6 cents (accounting for the rainy season and the 1-2 cents rate that lasts for a few months), now the large US corps claim they have rates as low as 3 cents, which makes the global average even lower compared to how it was 2 years ago.So 16 cents didn't do well before the last halving and all the advancements in the mining sector, it sure as hell won't do good now, not even in ten years, in fact, as we move on, halvings will come, every cycle will suffer diminishing returns and mining's profit can only go down (ignoring the mania phases that last for 3 months or so), heck, I pay close to nothing for power and I question myself every time I decide to buy mining gears, let alone paying 16 cents.",
