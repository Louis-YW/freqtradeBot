BE AWARE, SCAM!!!!Based on your report, you could be from China thus your post is not quite clear which is understandable. I also see you made a report on bestchange -- https://www.bestchange.com/nadex-exchanger.html?review=3150134 though they claim to have resolved it to which you did not agree to.I would like to just make a follow-up, were your funds returned?",

BE AWARE, SCAM!!!!I am sorry to read about you being scammed. Was the matter resolved in your favour?Quote from: JeromeTash on March 02, 2025, 06:40:49 PMI would like to just make a follow-up, were your funds returned?I think the member (Yurahu) should have posted his concerns in the Scam Accusations board as it would have received far more prominence. If he does return to the thread I hope he understands this was not the only place he could have posted to highlight what happened to him. It seems the Nadex representative claimed the issue was resolved but the complainant posted one minute later to claim the funds were not transferred to him and after that he did not post again therefore clarification about the status would help.",
