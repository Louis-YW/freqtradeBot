  "content": "Hello everyone,I’m looking for a loan that is really consequent. I know, I look really bad for going into a lending channel first as a newcomer.The reason I’m asking this loan for is for, -being able to pay some  overdue bills, I can send you more details and info in private if possible -I want to upgrade my computer specs-I want to start to gain money with my passion which is streaming and drawing illustrations Why I can’t ask to another financial institution such as banks for example :- I’ve been refused once in July and now my credit is bad even tho I earn enough to pay back, I can give you more info about all that in private - I am only 19 yo and I’m soon 20 ( end of March ), some of the financial institutions I tried to apply to refused my application due to my young ageI can provide you all the needed info about me, I would like to talk with someone that could help me.My main problem and I totally understand if no one wants to take that risk is that I don’t have any collateral for my loan request.Even tho, if someone wants to talk with me about it and would like to provide me a loan. I’ll gladly give you the infos you need, write a contract if you want to make one. The % for the pay back and everything needed for this request.Thank you and I hope someone would like to take the risk and talk with me.( I don’t expect really much from this post but I can still try )",

      "body": "This request will not get you even 1$ dollar instead of that you getting quick and easy red trust, if you already know that every loan request needs a valid collateral then why asking in first place. We have seen many loan requests from newbies of 200$-600$ even if it’s also impossible but you gone too far there buddyYour story and plans aren’t a reason for someone to invest in you such a big amount of money, if you are serious in what you doing start from 0 work on your phone or whatever device you have, if you got skills and work hard you will make it.",
