I'm not against any form of escrow, but this is simply an exchange. I have my ways around this and it's my intention to utilize the skill, to earn myself some money.",

I have my ways around this and it's my intention to utilize the skill, to earn myself some money.Please you aren’t making any clear point and I still maintain the fact that no one would want to pay any reasonable attention to you because they might be skeptical about the whole deal and since your account has no reputation, it will be nice if you give a detailed explanation of how this will be done as well give previous sample of your works at least that will even let someone ask you further questions.Scam attempts are grown at heavily in the forum and I don’t want to tag you a scammer yet that’s why I’m giving you the benefit of doubt , good luck Quote from: _act_ on December 16, 2023, 08:36:29 AMThis is scam, scam and scamYeahBut I don’t want to draw conclusions yet Quote from: _act_ on December 16, 2023, 08:36:29 AMQuote from: Obari on December 16, 2023, 07:32:23 AMHope you don’t mind to throw more light on this or are you in any form running a deposit bonus program or how to you intend to get this accounts credited?I think you have been on am this forum for some quite number of months, you should be able to know scammers and that you should avoid them. There is nothing that OP is trying to do than to scam people. But no one will be fool to be scammed like this on this forum.lol I know a scam when I see one but on the other hand, I think we are to quick to judge or conclude on people’s ideas maybe because of past experiences, I know the drill that we shouldn’t trust any story online but in some cases we should be willing to give people a listening ear.N/B: I  really wanted him to explain more better because it seems too real to be true as no one sells something to make loss but rather expect profit",

And what is it, it is just the old scam means that may be used to scam some newbies. Quote from: Obari on December 16, 2023, 12:15:07 PMBut I don’t want to draw conclusions yetI did not draw conclusion just like that but it is just what I read in the OP that makes me have such conclusion which I think is absolutely accurate. Let the OP convince us that I am wrong.",

But no one will be fool to be scammed like this on this forum.this is absurd for a Hero Member with merits to bully OP's and get away with it, if you goal is to prevent scam. Please come to DM and inquire as to how I intend to fund, so I can clear your doubts... like I said earlier, it's more of an exchange situation. I don't need to disclose how I intend to fund anyone's betting account until I'm asked to do so. You can try all you want, but I'm not disclosing my method on the thread for it to become useless.",

What you will do and what will be the benefit of you. I don't think there would have any way to get more than 10% bonus on deposit at any time while you are telling about all the US gambling site. I think you may scam in several way as mentioned below:*** not depositing on the site*** deposit scam/hack/stolen fund *** transferred fund from hack accounts and there might have many more like this.",
