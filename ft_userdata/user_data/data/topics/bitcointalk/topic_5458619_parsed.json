The scammers posted a tweet inviting them to claim their ZRO on a phishing site - https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1676325729997586432. Be careful, stay safe.Really bad news, I don't know how scammers get access to Twitter accounts so easily if the account owner has secured his account protection well. And suppose the phishing link was posted on the CEO's account only without other LayerZero accounts. In that case, this is conclusive evidence that Bryan's account has been hacked and that there is no airdrop already. [If people did their research for a few minutes, they would solve the equation and not be scammed]Through ZachXBT's tweet, I saw that the hacker had stolen $1,000 of the victims' assets through this phishing site. Sad about the losses of these innocent people. Fortunately, the tweet is now unavailable so that more of the LayerZero community will not be scammed and stolen. I don't know if CEO LayerZero has recovered his account now or not?!Source: https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1676336058798096384",

It surprises me how this guys who are supposed to lead by example can't even secure their twitter accounts with 2 Factor verification.Under the warning tweet.

Hackers are now targeting social account as this is easy for them from hacking contract. unfortunately this is not first time and we have seen many cases in these two monthsRecently Hacked social accounts:Karatdao Discord hacked Source Shell Discord hacked Source Starknet Discord hacked Source Slingshot twitter hacked and stole 3.6 million [Months ago]Source Tabi Discord hacked 18-19 June Source Orbitor Finance Discord hacked  Source",

A few days ago I saw so many blue verified accounts posting phishing links with a ton of likes and retweets. Not sure if the account was hacked or if it was a bot account that managed to pass through Twitter filters. I'd never click links from Twitter if security is my main concern from now on.",

Well, obviously he didn't protect his account well because if he used a solid password with the combination of 2FA I doubt that they would be able to hack him.

Not sure if the account was hacked or if it was a bot account that managed to pass through Twitter filters. I doubt those were hacked accounts because it is very easy to get verified nowadays. All that you really have to do is not change your username in the last few months and not spam too much, pay the money and you get your Twitter account verified so its no surprise that Twitter is overrun with them.",

Although a similar message should be published by Musk and return the money to the victims, since part of the blame, of course, lies on his leaky social network.",

I don't know if CEO LayerZero has recovered his account now or not?!In my opinion, the problem is more than 1,000 dollars, and I do not think that the hackers invented the CEO LayerZero Twitter account without all the accounts, which means that the hack is not random, but rather its face.Can I trust the technical team of the smart contract that they manage or any purchase of any airdrop they will request, as such news affects the reputation of the platform.If LayerZero team's failure to publish how the account was hacked and promises to enhance the security of future users means that they do not give security importance.",

But the CEO of  LayerZero Labs Bryan Pellegrino page describes in great detail the situation that led to the hacking and its solution. To briefly describe the problem that led to the hacking: the scammers reissued the SIM card using the discarded badge as an identity card and gained access to his account - https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1676726408520015873.",
