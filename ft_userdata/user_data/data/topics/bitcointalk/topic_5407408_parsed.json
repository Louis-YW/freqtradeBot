You just can't run it from a browser lolAlso, it requires zero BNB to run other than some BNB for the gas fees and contract deployment.So yea, this is a scam. And you will never find a working arbitrage alpha bot on youtube. You will have to code it yourself(I tried in 2021 but failed due to massive competition and frontrunning, it ain't easy).",
