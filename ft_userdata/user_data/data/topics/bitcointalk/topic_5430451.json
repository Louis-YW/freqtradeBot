But if I may ask, why do you chose to use bolded text as the previous thread created in 2018 as imamusma said earlier and he provided the link and when I clicked the link to see the thread, I would not lie you just paraphrase and edit the Christmas wish from there. If you did it from you IQ, I don't think you would have remembered to bold every text. That means you have seen the former thread before creating yours.OP We wish you the same.",

My observations on this post are; firstly, the previous thread and yours is very similar that you might need more than luck to convince anyone this is not a replica of the former president. Secondly, I was expecting you to say something nice and respectful But in contrary, you responded harshly without convincing us that your post is unique. You can tell us perhaps if it was a coincidence and we'll understand. By the way, it serves the purpose it was created for and you've archive your aim. Xmas wishes to everyone. 💙",

It's from lafu secondly, it is not a replica of the previous president   it is just a similar thread, or maybe OP copied it or whatever. Best wishes to everyone for Christmas and New Year.",

And I'd just stay away from alts, focus only on BTC and trade it based on american sentiments. Thats how it is moved nowadays unfortunately",
