  "content": "On Tuesday the First Republic Bank  experienced a collapse in their shares due to depositors withdrawing more than $100bn and with the current condition many investors and analysts express fear of an impending collapse of the bank. Although as a recovery plan, the bank plans on selling off some of it's unprofitable assets and also laying off many of it's work force.QuoteFirst Republic’s stock closed down nearly 50 percent on Tuesday, after the San Francisco-based lender disclosed that it lost 40 percent of its deposits in the first quarter as the banking sector suffered its biggest crisis of confidence since the 2007-2008 financial crash. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2023/4/26/first-republic-shares-hit-record-low-after-depositors-pull-100bn.With economic crisis facing the world, the banking sector isn't left out and since has been facing different financial crisis forcing some banks to merge in order to be able to continually stay in business, while some others hqs been forced to close down.Ho vulnerable the banks are becoming in their shares due to the economic crisis plunging the world economy, and I fear the situation may grow worse and contiguous as today it's First Republic Bank, tomorrow which other will it be.",

Maybe they will just file for bankruptcy if more than 10-20% of the assets are withdrawn from that particular bank. Considering the fact that they are giving away money off the other assets, for example, fixed deposit interests, loans that they might have lent, and mortgages that are just having shitty values and salaries. They will have no choice but to file for it. The real question is why there was such sudden withdrawal from the depositors anyway? QuoteFirst Republic said on Monday it was considering “strategic options” to strengthen the bank’s position.The bank’s recovery plan includes selling off unprofitable assets and laying off up to a quarter of its workforce of about 7,200 employees.That's a very large number for such a huge lender. Imagine the cost to the company for this management and how are they going to recover any of the deposits from the so-called unprofitable assets selling.The only thing I did not like about Reuters is, they are calling it a chain reaction and fear amongst the investors followed by the failure of Silicone Valley Bank and Signature bank. Seriously they have to blame an institute or company which literally connects the dot with Crypto Space investment.  Quote from: Solosanz on April 27, 2023, 11:34:12 AMI'm curious why the bank allow the depositors to withdraw $100 Billion of money?

It's your money when you deposit in the banks. There is no rule on how much you can withdraw OR how much you can spend from your bank account as long as everything is within the law. We have seen denominations crisis in a few countries and governments have halted the money withdrawal. But have you seen the riots that followed after that? That's because its personal savings, and one has all the right to withdraw it. In addition, that's collective amount that was withdrawn, it wasn't from an individual.",

Not every bank makes it difficult or prevents people from withdrawing money, they have the right to get it all back as long as they follow the bank's regulations. The Fed or the US government is more than capable of saving these banks, but there must be a reason why they shouldn't. Many people look at it and think the banking and fiat systems are collapsing, which is a rather short-sighted view. For me, it's just a purge and reset game because we have millions of banks in the world.",

Furthermore, the other action that triggered more panic and the price dwindling on the stock market is that they plan on liquidating close to 100 billion in assets to prepare for more withdraw and balance sheets, thus proving they still have at least another 100 billion ready. This is a bit of fucked up situation where a bank that has the money is going down while others who are probably in worse situations are watching calmly from the sure simply because their users are not that keen to cash out.Anyhow, I don't know why everyone is panicking now, the major storm was back in March when they went down from 120$ to 12$ per share.",

Q1 financial report was released and it showed their earnings are poor, so naturally depositors would want their money away from the institution that isn't involved in healthy investments. First Republican doesn't have banking by the federal government, they've explicitly said they won't be providing them with aid. Naturally, the bigger banks would come in and provide some liquidity because they're already in 30B due to previous investments when SVB fell. And if not, First Republic gets seized and sent over to FDIC to redistribute funds to depositors.",

Banks can face difficulties due to a variety of factors such as loan defaults, market volatility, and changes in regulatory requirements.Regarding interest rate hikes, while they can have an impact on inflation and the economy, their effects can be complex and unpredictable. It is also worth noting that the decision to raise interest rates is typically made by central banks, not individual banks. The goal of central banks in raising interest rates is typically to manage inflation and ensure economic stability, rather than to drive the financial sector into stagnation.",
