  "content": "Runes are one of the most hilarious* economic systems ever created, after perhaps BRC-20.1. Someone creates a token with a specific name.2. Other people can create their own units of these tokens. There is a limit, but usually it's not very low.3. Then all try to sell their tokens, thinking there will be someone collecting them, either because of the \"creative\" name, or because it was created on a specific date (e.g. Halving Day).4. Rinse and repeat (protocol is open, everybody can participate in each step).Basically it's like \"you can create your own money! and you will be rich if you do that!\" Are you really willing to waste thousands of dollars of transaction fees for that?Technically Runes is not much more advanced than Omni/Mastercoin which was created in 2013. More than ten years ago!If you think Halving Day is special to create your own Rune, think again:During the halving day, 144 blocks approximately will be created. Each block normally has 1000-3000 transactions. 74% of them currenty are Runes according to this dashboard.This means probably more than 200.000 Runes will be created today.Now try to sell them all. Order books will be thick, but only on the ask side *not in a positive way",

For example, the ICO market is already much less hyped than it was in 2018. The NFT market is in problems since 2022, only having re-surged temporarily in 2023 due to Ordinals, but on Ethereum its status seems quite bleak. The memecoin market is also bearish, even looking at longer timeframes. Shiba Inu for example had a pump, but its high of slightly less than $0.00004 was far away from SHIB's ATH in 2022 ($0.00008), and now it's already closer to 0.00002, having lost 40%. Even Doge, which has some more \"intrinsic\" value because it's running on its own blockchain, and even has its own Ordinals clone (sort of, as it uses an older technology), hasn't reached even half of its ATH in 2021.So in general I think these hypes will be smaller in each wave. It's likely that some of the halving day rune collectors will make a profit, but I'm almost sure most won't. I admit that the relative persistence of the BRC-20 hype during most of 2023 surprised me, I believed it to be shorter. But there is a lot of blood in the streets (ORDI, the \"most established\" of the BRC-20's, lost 50% of its ATH already), and each of these waves will see more disappointed bagholders. Eventually, the market will collapse, not to 0 but to the same low-level state the Ethereum ICO market is now.In general I think also that even compared to most \"normal\" altcoins the Rune/BRC-20 value proposition is very thin.

We have known that some miners called ordinals spam the blockchain to increase the transaction fees. Trying to deal with this we are hearing Runes. Those who are not that savvy like us will see this as big issues happening behind the scene and could be very much of a problem to the network.
