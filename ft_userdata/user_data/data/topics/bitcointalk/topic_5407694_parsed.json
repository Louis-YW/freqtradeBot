It it a fixed amount calculated by multiplying the fee rate times the transaction size, and is not deducted from each transaction input, but sent from your wallet as well inside the transaction.This works because the amount that you must pay in fees plus the total sum of the outputs must be less than the sum of the inputs, e.g. if you have a 0.5BTC input and want to send all (i.e. 0.5BTC) of it to some other address, making an output in the process, you must either add another input into the transaction or lower the amount being sent to one of the outputs.",

      "body": "Here's a good and simple explanation about the dust limit:Quote from: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/86068/how-was-the-dust-limit-of-546-satoshis-was-chosen-why-not-550-satoshisThe dust limit is not actually fixed, technically - it varies based on the type of output. 546 satoshis is simply the most commonly known one, for a p2pkh output. Being the longest-lived output type, I suspect some wallets/blog posts/literature might treat it as a hard coded dust limit.As to how to arrive at 546 satoshis, we must first know what \"dust\" means. A dust output is an output which costs more to spend, than it is worth. In other words, an X BTC output that costs >X to spend, is a dust output. This is directly proportional to the amount of data required to spend an output, since fees in bitcoin are commonly denoted \"per-byte\". The more bytes you must add to your tx to spend an output, the higher its dust threshold.A very basic tx consisting of 1 p2pkh input (~148 bytes), and 1 p2pkh output (~34 bytes) comes out to 182 bytes. The dust limit is 3 times this number (assuming a relay fee of 1 satoshi), or 182*3 = 546 sats.For more complex txs, such as p2sh, this number is larger. For less space-intensive ones such as the newer segwit options, this number would be lower.-snip-",

The downside of using multiple inputs is that you will be paying more fees compared to when you use a single input.You are multiplying the size of the transaction by the fee set by you and that will give you the fee you will be paying for miners to include your transactions in the next block. For example, if you have 112 sat/vb and you set a fee of 2 sats, you will be multiplying 2x112=224 sats as a fee",

So, sending 140 satoshi and paying 140 in fees, being the dust limit 294. First of all note that it's unlikely that you have an output of 280 satoshi in your address. Because that's smaller than the dust limit. Anyways, there is no problem with transaction fee of 140 satoshi if the fee rate isn't lower than 1 sat/vbyte.The problem is with the value of your output which is lower than the dust limit. Your transaction should meet following requirements:1. The fee rate should be at least 1 sat/vbyte.2. The outputs you create should be bigger than the dust limit. (Dust limit is 294 satoshi if the address is segwit and 546 satoshi if the address is legacy.)Quote from: P2PECS on July 27, 2022, 06:33:58 AMIf I have 300 sats, theoretically I could send them being the dust limit (segwit) of 294.

The remaining 6 satoshi isn't enough for the transaction fee. Assuming the transaction is 140 vbyte and you set the fee to 1 sat/vbyte, you need to pay 140 satoshi for the transaction fee.",

So, sending 140 satoshi and paying 140 in fees, being the dust limit 294.In the previous related replies, hosseinimr93 was talking about the virtual size of his 1in-1out transaction which is 140vB, he didn't sent 140 satoshi and didn't used a dust input.It's just an example which shows that the absolute fee can be lower than the dust limit (which shouldn't be linked together in the first place)What I'm telling is if the fee rate is @1sat/vB and the outputs aren't dust, the transaction is standard.Just take note of the thing's I've previously listed.Quote from: P2PECS on July 26, 2022, 04:21:36 PMI suppose it is per transaction but assuming that it is so, I am not clear what minimum fees would be paid in the case that I have two inputs, with 547 sats, because having two inputs also makes the transaction more expensive.One more things is, dust limit is by default based from 3sat/vB average equivalent of an input, so if you were to add a 546 sat (legacy) input to a regular 1~3 sat/vB transaction,usually it can still pay for the additional size that it will add to that transaction.But since it's only based from the input's size, if both inputs are only 547sats, it may not be enough to pay 2sat/vB (needs computation).But for 1 sat/vB, it's definitely more than enough.Here are some examples (testnet):9e3d0c4089ea141ca9f9870985c4bb0e37f05231628454381df92ce56fe1b7d1Two 546 sats input (min) sending 752 sats to one output @ 1sat/vB.05ffb639cc25b0c792e9dd075f3e1af5f92e5984260942b9b14b68255327c6cbThree 546 sats input (min) sending 1150 sats to one output @ 1sat/vB.Thanks for granting my request to unlock the topic for me clarify my previous post.Hope this can clear the confusion.",
