I mean the wallet can not be downgraded, you have to do delete the wallet and install the lower version. Only the new version can be upgraded. It is better to use the updated version.",

Have you tried common things to fix application problem such as clearing cache, allow specific permission or restart your smartphone?Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 04, 2023, 12:25:37 PMQuote from: Eternad on May 04, 2023, 11:01:24 AMThe new version just improved the UI but it removes some feature that is important like copy button.

But it take some time and obviously it's not recommended since it could cause corruption or other unexpected behavior.[1] https://www.xda-developers.com/downgrade-an-app-android-no-root/[2] https://www.xda-developers.com/downgrade-applications-with-appdowner/",

Is this possible?It is possible, but I do not advise you to do so because wallet files are among the hidden files and you need to access them for root to reach this file /data/data/org.ectrum.ectrum/files/data/walletsSo writing it is the easiest solution.

I remember the address use for by browsing my transaction history and check the amount. The previous version is very helpful because I can just copy the address on the sent and receive transaction history without the use of blockchain explorer and manually pasting the txid. This is not a big a deal but the previous version have this feature which is why I’m not use to using the blockchain explorer just to copy address that I made transaction before.Quote from: nc50lc on May 04, 2023, 03:45:48 PMYou can post the missing \"copy to clipboard\" feature as a new issue in Electrum's GitHub page: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issuesI've checked and v4.3.4 indeed can copy the previous transaction's outputs just by tapping one of them.Thanks on this. I will report the missing feature and probably improvement.Last question: What’s the purposed in security of manually writing down the seed phrase? I’m copying my seed phrase most of the time.

Now it is closer to cache memory, as the data is preserved even if you restart your device, and therefore it is better not to copy the seeds.some third-party virus can access/read your old copies in clipboard.",

Your clipboard is one of the first places the malware looks into. If not, you might be using a third party keyboard which most mobile users do and some of these third party keyboards could be malicious and can leak your clipboard contentsImagine you just copied your seed and now the malicious actor knows it.This is why some people lose bitcoins without even know how the hacker hit them. I think you have seen such complaints before. Manually copying and writing avoids exposure of your seed to probably malware.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 05, 2023, 12:18:15 PMQuote from: logfiles on May 04, 2023, 11:50:14 PMOr you could wait for the new update of the wallet which is most likely to be released soon (planned release of 4.4.2 is sometime this week according to one of the developers).It's a feature to enhance privacy and it was a loophole in the old versions so they fixed it.
