  "content": "Heya! Can anyone share their bitcoin node setup? I am just looking for some ideas which I hope I can implement slowly. You can also share the hardware specification  .And also I have found another alternative for raspberry pi 4 named Beelink MINI S[1]. Would this be any better for Raspberry Pi 4? Looking at their website, it looks like the MINI PC includes 8GB of RAM, so you'll basically need 1 or 2 TB of SSD to complete the setup.[1] https://www.bee-link.com/catalog/product/index?id=302Related threads:- [Guide] How to run a Bitcoin Core full node for under 50 bucks! | topic=5364742.0- Most Efficient Way To Run A Full Node? | topic=5295984.0",

Nothing unique, except i use HDD store Bitcoin Core data.Thanks for the input!! Maybe that's my last option. I don't know, I just feel like having a separate hardware used specifically in running a full node is pretty fun especially with the knowledge and experience you can extract from doing it. Thank you @ETFbitcoin. Very much appreciated.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 23, 2022, 01:04:43 PMQuote from: Maus0728 on August 23, 2022, 12:44:39 PMWould this be any better for Raspberry Pi 4?
