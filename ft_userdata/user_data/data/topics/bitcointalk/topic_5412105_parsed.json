  "content": "I made a deposit through Ethereum in the amount of $ 330, I wanted to bet on volleyball, but the odds changed and the bet was not accepted, after that, after a while, I wanted to bet $ 130 on Newcastle, but they wrote that the maximum bet was $ 1.5 , after that I decided to withdraw the money, put down a minimum wager of $10 on the roulette table and put it on the withdrawal, after that I was asked to confirm my identity, I confirmed it. after that they just told me that you are a scammer and we will confiscate the funds, they threw off the \"bye bye\" gif and stopped responding, after which they deleted the account. All this is due to the fact that I did not make a wager, but how can I do this if the maximum bet is 1 dollar with a deposit of 330? I don't play casino, only sports betting. they thought i was laundering money lol 09:30 PM | basedin2@proton.me: can you rejected my withdrawal?09:31 PM | JR5 from Rollbit: Hi there, is it pending?09:31 PM | basedin2@proton.me: +09:36 PM | JR5 from Rollbit: It looks like your withdrawal requires manual review. I've escalated this to my colleague to check this for you.   There's no exact ETA on this one. Depending on my colleague's workload this could take a few minutes or up to hours.﻿﻿There will be no actions required on your part, this will be sent out to the wallet once the review is completed. Expect a reply shortly!09:51 PM | basedin2@proton.me: 1 hours max?09:51 PM | JR5 from Rollbit: \"There's no exact ETA on this one.

Created an account-deposited 330$-bet $10 only-tried to withdraw remaining balance. If you are an experienced gambler, I do not think you will do it although you cant bet on what you want because of a reason. At least, you should have wagered more in other events or maybe in other casino games so your account activity is not considered as suspicious. Lesson learned for you, do not do the same thing again in other casinos. Every casino has their own terms, if you are proven to break one of their terms, you should accept the consequences. No other thing I can suggest except: try to contact rollbit's bitcointalk forum by private message and hope there will be a way to solve it.",

You are an experience person in the forum. When I meet people like you I respect them. Now that you have given him the break of the transactions he did, he will finally deny it that it was not him, someone used his account to place bet and the person deposited funds to his address and funded back the rollbit address. These are stories of the sky. I also support BitcoinGirl.Club opinion. But we have to hear from their part of the story before judgement will be given. We advise them always, when you are gambling, read the terms and conditions before playing any game so you will not be a victim of any issue but their want play smart game because it is a gamble and you want over gamble. I even saw on accusation on  Roobet.com. And these are reputable casino threads and sites.",
