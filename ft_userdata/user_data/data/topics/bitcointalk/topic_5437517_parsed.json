If you nail the predictions you get more views and more money if you fail completely and nobody likes you anymore at least you didn't also lose your home trading. Think of selling books on how to win the lottery!",

And you don't assume someone to be a financial advisor cause they made a couple of videos talking about the potential outcome of an investment. On this forum price speculation is talked about a lot, and we discuss what the future of Bitcoin is going to be, that doesn't make the users here advisors, does it?You can't expect people to stop doing what they profit from, you can only advice investors to do their own research.",

If you are an expert in any area, you don't have to show yourself on Youtube. Mostly successful people like this want to have spare time, freedom and they can share their knowledge when they want but not with any regular basis like 1 video daily, weekly.Especially if you are free financially, very successful financially, you don't waste time to make videos on Youtube.Exceptions are only if you have love with videos and obsessed with sharing knowledge, technical support and advice to community. You want to give away your knowledge and if you are clever, you can realize that such Youtubers will mainly share video about knowledge, technical things than shilling projects.It is very easy to watch videos and feel that Youtuber is shilling a project but not focus on knowledge. If you watch that Youtube channel playlist and find more similar videos, let's ignore that Youtuber.I only follow one cryptocurrency Youtuber, Andreas Antonopoulos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ",

I don’t see anything wrong with these since youtube is not an educational platform so content creator can post whatever they want to entertain all viewers since that platform is a social media.",
