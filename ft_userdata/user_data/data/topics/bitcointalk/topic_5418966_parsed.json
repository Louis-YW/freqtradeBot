      "body": "There's probably a lot more examples than what I've mentioned below but it's a gist of what to expect. If you don't have a strong income straam you might see problems facing day to day expenses and then won't be able to harness all a recession has to offer...And with that out of the way, recessions normally pose good opportunities for those with cash and liquidity. Good debt gets valued like it's toxic, good companies get valued like they're only going to survive 6-10 years (in some places), gold and other things considered stable go into bull markets - if you buy wheat and it drops in value - you've still got food. Bad news causes panic in markets, more panic than is necessary - you can make a decent amount by buying crashes and selling them back to the market when the price appreciates (but manage your risk with this one). The federal reserve released stress test documentation too which seems to either have been influencing the market or an accurate prediction (if you're interested in forex in any way particularly).These are risky ideas that should be originally tested with no more than you'd be happy losing down a grid - if you make profits, reinvest those instead of expanding too much and getting carried away. Placing high orders might affect how others trade or the price you buy at and that could invalidate what you're doing or make it harder.",

The fact you said that you just recently got laid off, you could face problems with your regular day-to-day expenditure like utilities and essentials just like what the others have said here. If you could find a way to solve that dilemma, and at the same time have enough to invest on assets that are not affected by recession, you are indeed safe. Thing is the statement made by Warren Buffet exclusively works for people who could afford to invest on something. If you couldn't you're in deep crap.",

How can one take opportunity of the recession to become rich or at least not go broke?In a recession, people are forced to sell their assets to bear their expenses. Warren Buffet talks about these opportunities. When people are selling you will buy and when people are buying you will sell. Rich people follow these simple rules. Now do not ask me where did you get the money. These are the skills most people do not have. You can buy and sell millions of dollars of properties without having money in your pocket. Human minds are very unique so use them.",

How can one take opportunity of the recession to become rich or at least not go broke?There are many opportunities to grow rich during recession although this opportunities are patronised by rich fellows who could not get hit even if it fails. But for the average man, it is a situation where you need a plan that just has to work. The safest I would suggest is Agriculture holding. One needs to study his environment and past recessions to know what is mostly needed during downturn. Agricultural holding reduces risk if planed well.As for not going broke during the period my suggestion would be one needs to plan ahead by possibly increasing its emergency savings since warnings of the downturn is always given before it arrives. The savings could help during the recession period when some things don't go as planed",

This difficult economy is getting companies to minimize cost and to do that is to put some machines out or make one person to control more work and underpaid, this is bad. Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 31, 2022, 05:13:18 PM I do not want to see this as a bad thing. It is not a bad thing. They say it that when one door is closed, it will open another opportunity to open another door. So get up and dust up from the memory.

How can one take opportunity of the recession to become rich or at least not go broke?The reason that rich people get rich more in recession is they have the capital to buy up properties and other things from the people that have financial problem because of the recession. The things are sold cheaper than real market price in a robust economy. The hidden opportunity is if you can buy or invest in recession that is cheaper. Buying gold, commodities are cheaper that you can hodl longer until economy recover so you can sell but doing the buying in recession is difficult because money is not that flowing or easy.",

How can one take opportunity of the recession to become rich or at least not go broke?Recessions can be huge sources of opportunity for people who are able to retain a job and keep their income going steady. You're able to pick up company stocks at much depressed prices which are likely to bounce back as the country moves out of recession and provide a solid income into the future. However that can be easier said than done, because typically companies are also looking to cut back heavily throughout this time and the highest earners can sometimes be a target of redundancy first. Other companies might simply be badly placed and end up going under, which leaves you in the job hunting market at the most inopportune time when you want to be investing.",

I don't know how much money you have, but if you are good in business, now can be a good time to consider starting one that is carefully thought out which renders important services or provides essential commodities.QuoteHealthcare, food, consumer staples, and basic transportation are examples of relatively inelastic industries that can perform well in recessions. They may also benefit from being considered essential industries during a public health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic.source",

If you get push to the wall, it will make you stronger and you bounce back better. You are correct during the covid-19 many individuals has to feed to through online and making different content. There is a business of comedy I think has developed and find it way online by making people to laugh, it develop the time of covid-19 many youth find their comedy talent and they started to make comedy skit, they post it on Snapchat, Snapchat, YouTube and some in Facebook.

Thanks to shifting demand and need.Gasoline prices rise. People seek alternatives. Having a good alternative product in stock can be a million dollar opportunity. Transportation options like electric scooters might be in high demand at the moment for city regions. Accessories like trailers that can be pulled by electric scooters to haul cargo might also be in demand. Mopeds with engine sizes 50cc and smaller need no insurance, which could put them in high demand on the fossil fuel side of things as people seek alternatives to cut monthly costs.Food prices rise. People seek alternatives. Someone with extra field space and time might plant crops to sell locally at higher than normal market prices. There are people who buy a $5 pack of carrot seeds to grow carrots which they might sell for $50 to $100 for a 10x to 20x profit. Food prices being what they are now, margins are higher due to prices being elevated.Disposable income is on a decline, which can make it harder to attain profitability. The target demographic of consumers is narrowed and swings in favor of higher income bracket. I think most can guess in which directions markets and demand are headed. It might be profitable to stay one step ahead of the current crisis.",
