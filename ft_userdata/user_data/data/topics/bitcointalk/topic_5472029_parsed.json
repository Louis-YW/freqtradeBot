They also doing this to quench most of there listener speculation since it’s common nature of trader to wish for more dump when the price is dumping so that they can buy lower and same when the price is pumping so that they sell at higher price.Predicting based on the current trend gives influencer a bit of support from their followers instead of opposing them. Surely they will mention again the lower lows prediction and quote their previous statement when Bitcoin price becomes bearish. They always play safe when it comes to prediction.",

And is a scenario of World War III (Israel + USA + NATO vs an alliance of Islamic countries) bullish or bearish?I listened to DataDash a long time ago, but I left watching him because I was not getting anything useful from his long 30-minute-plus videos, I could get more information about the market than wasting my time on his videos. I respect your choice, and everyone has their own tastes, so I will not say, you wasted your time on watching him. You might have got some benefit from the DD channel.Overall, I don't know what factors should he have discussed in his videos that have convinced you that the market will touch $10k price tag. That's so idiotic for you to not invest anything (if you really have not invested anything) because DD channel must have mentioned a term that indicates that, \"one of the possibilities for the market to go $10k\" or anything like it (as a disclaimer), they give ideas in all possible ways they can, like the market will touch $10k, or $15k or $50k, etc., etc. That's the main reason, I left them watching. The market will cross $50k if ETFs get approved and that's because BTC will get more demand over supply. And this war cannot be called WW3 because, in WW3, atom bombs were used, but currently, no one is willing to use those bombs, they were not even used in the Russian and Ukraine war so why were they be used in this war even though if one country wanted to bomb, they will not. Because they have colluded with each other to not use atomic bombs until some countries cross the limits. (Its my observation only).",

Considering the possibility of a bitcoin ETF if approved, I think the price of bitcoin will soar high, especially since the halving moment will occur soon. maybe $50k, or even a new ATHLooking at the current issue of war, it is likely that it will not make the price of bitcoin go down but will instead tend to rise, this is in line with the Covid-19 conditions which have made the price of bitcoin even higher",

Been watching him since he was interviewed in Kitconews and I was also wondering how it would happen. It only takes FTX for it to plunge. We didn't see it coming but it did happen. I'm sure he didn't foresee FTX incident happening but he rely mostly on his TA. But this time because of the near ETF, hard to believe it going under $10k",

This means that they say according to the trend at that time, maybe when they say about the price of bitcoin in a bearish market then he will choose the lowest price but the current cycle of prices is not the case and only the lowest is $16K.By saying now when the recent increase says $50K it is normal because guessing according to trends is not data obtained, maybe that's what I mean.Influencers always say what they want while followers will follow their words, no wonder.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on October 28, 2023, 04:45:36 PMWhat are your thoughts?

He even mentioned a 50k possibility for this year. This switch of analysis of bitcoin by proclaimed analysts of it going to be bearish down till the $10k level and a later change of position that we wouldn’t reach there again shows that they are no bitcoin expert that we need to place our trust in there analysis because it is all speculations that every knowledgeable investor can predict if the investor understands the events that affects the market. In long run this market fluctuations will prove more to naive people that bitcoin cannot be manipulated by just anyone as people proclaim it is. QuoteWhat are your thoughts? How big of a price rise do you expect if an ETF gets approved? With just the fake news of its approval causing this huge FOMO, i would say if it gets approved then we might face a pump and maybe a mini run due to its hype. If there is another thing that causes bitcoin price increase aside the halving bull run, it is the hype of a positive news about it and that’s one thing that yeh ETF will cause. So my prediction is $45k+ should it be approved. QuoteAnd is a scenario of World War III (Israel + USA + NATO vs an alliance of Islamic countries) bullish or bearish?This where the predictions takes different turns, a pro longed war always causes destruction of properties and lives and this affects the economy negatively. When there is a down turn in the economy then it is hard for people to invest which causes low demand of bitcoin and probably high supply of it because many will like to take there funds off to solve emergency problems like during the Covid crisis, so a world war will have a negative impact on the bitcoin price and causes a low base on my predictions.",

Another war will affect the global economy which will in turn harm the Bitcoin market. But an escalation of this war is unlikely.",

I see the positive in the fact that after such an impressive growth, Bitcoin maintains the level of 34k, this leaves for us with the possibility that after some flat period growth may continue, at least if this pump was immediately followed by a decline, this would look worse. Yes, there is a gap around 21k that would not hurt to close, and this may happen on expectations, but I don’t think that we can go below 15k, since Bitcoin has hardly reacted to any negative news lately, and this suggests that there are buyers who are ready to buy Bitcoin.",

It seems 15k was the bottom for the bear season and there's no way Bitcoin price is going to retrace to such a price. Bitcoin halving is just few months from now and spot Bitcoin hype is gaining momentum gradually and all this will help to drive the price up. I don't really expect the price go up to 50k before the year ends but if it does it will be because of the approval of spot ETF. I expect the price to be around 120k - 150k during the bull season.",

Honestly, I'm a bit confused when I see the crypto market in such a sensitive period as it is now. Now, before that, we had the news of the bitcoin sale from Tesla and a series of accompanying news items, although it is said that it is convincing enough to cause a price drop, and indeed, volatility is a characteristic featured in the crypto market, not just bitcoin.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on October 28, 2023, 04:45:36 PMAnd is a scenario of World War III (Israel + USA + NATO vs an alliance of Islamic countries) bullish or bearish?I'm not sure about WW3 in each different region, the instability is increasing. First, look at assets that people are looking for, like gold, to see the reaction. And back to bitcoin, price increases in the near future are dominating, although I am still speculating along with many others that bitcoin will have a sharp decline before entering the bullrun phase.",

And is a scenario of World War III (Israel + USA + NATO vs an alliance of Islamic countries) bullish or bearish?I think you lost the opportunity to enter the market in the hope of entering at the price of $10,000 or lower. You should do your own research and never rely on others. You made a big mistake by following only one channel and not listening to other influencers or market analysts. Because by listening to at least 1+, you will have a better idea of the market and the best practices that can be made.For example, in this scenario, the best practice is to invest some amount at the current rate. For example,  if you see BTC at the price of $25k or $27k, you should invest some of your money in BTC and keep some funds to invest when the market reaches $10,000, if it comes because the chances are so rare.If ETFs get approved, then we will see BTC crossing $50,000 easily because a huge pile of trading volume will be seen in the market, and demand and price will increase. The potential of ETFs can be measured from the recent incident of fake news about ETFs and the ticker delivery of Ishare.",

Even if we say bitcoin etf will soon to be approved by SEC, but I can't give fixed amount as to how high bitcoin will reach that time. Although  a lot of bitcoin analysts are now very optimistic about the future price of bitcoin, but we all know no one holds the future of bitcoin even Satoshi himself, so all these predictions will remain to be predictions until they're proven true.
