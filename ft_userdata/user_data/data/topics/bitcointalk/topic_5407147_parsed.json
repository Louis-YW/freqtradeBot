  "content": "Hello matesRed dragon cards are not said to have really good fans, so i had to replace them since one was not working. I also changed thermal pads. Because original fans are really expensive and hard to get, i went for \"compatible\" ones. The Compatible one lasted less than 2 weeks. I still can't figure what was wrong with it. Well, for sometime i just mined with this \"only one fan brand new\" fan and pointed a case fan 120mm to the fan not working to help cool the card but something weird was happening. The card could not hold the numbers I placed on MSI Afterburner. My settings are 850mv/1350mhz core/1820mem 85% fan. Phoenix miner was used. the card underclocked itself harder than the numbers placed on MSI ,so they went for 750mv/1000mhz ish/1800/85% fan.I thought this reduction was due to high temps (remember, only 1 out of 2 fans were working). Card was at 80ºCToday i received new fans. So mounted the card, and went to mining as normal.But the card still underclocks to 750mv/1000mhz ish/1820mhz and 85%fan. Temps are OK (not more than 70 for core). The issue comes with phoenix miner. When i place the numbers on MSI, this card that begins at stock 2000mhz/1200mv/1750/auto , once i put the numbers of my other cards on MSI, this card automatically goes to the 750mv numbers. Tried changing the riser, the cable, the adapter, DDUU+ new drivers, older version of phoenix (using 6.2 but i was using 5.9 aswell), tried new power cables on other PCIE slot on the PSU and new pcie slot.  Drivers were installed only. Nothing else. Updated also MSI from 4.6.3 to latest version. no luck, so i put it on my testbench. The card could run perfectly with Valley Benchmark at stock settings for 20 minutes no issue and also i could apply the undervolt settings ( 1350mhz/850mv/1820mhz mem/85% fan and run the benchmark with no issues with the card holding the desired values. But the moment i begin mining, even on the bench, it would gradually go down from stock numbers to 750mv/1000ish mhz/ in a matter of 30 minutes. Phoenix miner , btw.it's as if the card was being affected by autotunning in a weird way. The weird thing is that in this rig i have more RX 5700XT but those are not affected. It doesn't matter the order in which i begin putting the settings on MSI for the other cards. Eventually this card will go to the 750mv values reducing its 56MH to 46MH at most since core should stay above 1280mhz to hold 56MH on almost all RX 5700XTI also tried +20% power. nothing. Also adding voltage doesn't help. I managed to increase voltage to 850mv but the core locks at around 1100mhz on the core ,both settings on MSI. And if you press the reset button on MSI afterburner, the card once it goes to 750mv, it will not return to stock settings. It locks there. Also tried uninstalling the card several times (in case there was some kind of log telling the card to hard-undervolt. Still no solution. I even disconected the card from the rig, turn it on, mine with it like 30 min, and then turn it off, put the card again and run the miner. Nothing. It continuously happening the same.  The only solution by now is to switch to TRM and give it a try. In any case. Someone has any idea of what can be happening??? Thanks in advance.",

Can MSI hold a log for one card and don't allow it to go higher for whatever reason??Why don't you configure your overclocks with Radeon Software,anything you can fine tune in MSI for AMD cards you do it in much more granular details in the Radeon Software panel.I have a Gigabyte Rx 5700 XT which works great most of the time as I configure it through Radeon Software which MSI gets the info from there,but since I have a mixed rig and all my other cards are fine tuned through MSI Afterburner,this Rx 5700 XT sometimes out of nowhere jumps to default settings.",

You should definitely have the AMD Radeon Software in Windows and there you can fine tune the settings to this card and it will probably work much better than doing the overclock in the MSI Afterburner.I am saying this from my personal experience and the pic below should just demonstrate that it is a sure thing that the AMD Radeon Software should be in your system,otherwise most likely you have not a correct driver causing you the aforementioned problems.",

      "body": "Hello guys. I haven't been able to make the card hold 850mv and around 1300mhz on the core while mining,It doesn't matter the driver used, or even using the amd radeon software as suggested. The issue is not on mem temps, but on core temps.The card behaves as if it was overheating but only while mining, but the core is running around 65ºC with 90% fans. Checked on MSI and on amd radeon software. Only when the temp goes below 55ºC is when the card pushes a bit more on the core (around 1150 or so giving around 50mh/s). So it's basically as if the card thought it's overheating and for that reason it should undervolt itself really hard.It's so weird because it only undervolts hard while mining. You can play games with it at full RX 5700XT core and everything ok. It does this weird issue with every miner i tried, phoenix miner and RTM. even on different Pcs. The final conclusion of this weird issue, seems to be that due to the aftermarket fan replacement that i had to install since the original died, maybe there is an interaction between sensors and gpu bios and the card cannot check fan correctly so assumes it's not working ok and undervolts while mining. I know it sounds weird, but there is absolutely no explanation to this. I'm almost sure than in winter it will run as intended due to low temps in the room (now around 35ºC and around 26ºC in winter).Since ETH is going PoS i'm not wasting more time on this, but i would gladly try something not said in this long post if someone has an idea.Cheers.",

If they are to thick there might be not enough contact between the heatsink and the GPU (even with thermal paste). Depending on the card usual thickness of pads ranges from 0.5mm to 1.5mm somethimes even as thick as 2mm.YMMV",

I have 5700 (non XT sapphire pulse) running stable for years at 56MH, they pull 780-825mv, clocked at ~1300 core and ~1820 mem. the core is around +60 while the memory junction is about +100. Using old drivers 20.11.1(+no amd gui crap), mod with morepowertool and set volts/clocks with overdriventool. never use Afterburner for AMD - its shit, in fact I don't use it for Nvidia as well.",
