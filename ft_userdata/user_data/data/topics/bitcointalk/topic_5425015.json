  "content": "I'll get straight to the point;We offer a crypto casino development service, as well as this in the past we have created csgo casinos for clients. All services come with installation on your server at no extra cost and make custom scripts for each user. My discord username is digby#9927.Prices are in the range of 1k to about 10k but theyre always negotiable. Youre gonna have to dm me for some demos and we always use a bitcointalk middleman, that is not negotiable. If you want to stop gambling and actually start making some money, get in contact.",

And opting to using a bitcointalk middleman for your safety and that of the buyer of your service is a good one, atleast, this gives you some credibility and shows you are not out here looking for whom to scam Quote from: casinodevservices on December 01, 2022, 01:50:39 PMIf you want to stop gambling and actually start making some money, get in contact.I have a fun question though, by the above, are you insinuating that gamblers don't make money?I don't think the high rollers would agree with you if you actually mean that gamblers don't make money too..  That's by the way, if I refer a client to you, what is my commission?",

If you refer a client to me and i close the deal ill give you 10% of the deal - of course if you are serious you can dm on discord. And no, in general gamblers dont make money its the casinos who make money. Thanks for your comment",
