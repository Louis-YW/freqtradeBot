Short-Term Holder Supply is currently at multi-year lows of 2.33M BTC, and captures coins up to 155-days old that are statistically the most likely to be spent.QuoteGlassnode developed another supply heuristic that monitors the spending behavior of wallets, classified into Illiquid, Liquid and Highly Liquid buckets. The latter two are shown below which represent wallets that both receive coins and also spend a significant proportion of them.QuoteThere is significant overlap between Liquid and Highly Liquid supply and Exchange Balances for obvious reasons. This multi-year downtrend is visible again, suggesting coins are moving out of Exchange wallets and towards more Illiquid wallets with little history of spending.The analysis is in-depth, so I tried to quote the points above, but you can refer to the link above to read it.'Available supply' is at historic lows and 'supply storage' This may not be a price prediction signal but more people are preferring to hold Bitcoin.",

And by this I don't mean that the price is going to go down now, because at this point in the cycle we are in, it is normal for 2024 to be positive, but there are things that escape so much analysis.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on November 16, 2023, 04:30:30 AM'Available supply' is at historic lows and 'supply storage' This may not be a price prediction signal but more people are preferring to hold Bitcoin.I do read it as meaning that the price will tend to rise, as we all know that it does after the halvings due to supply reduction, if we add that more people holding bitcoins means even more supply reduction.",

I don't know how Glassnode can scrape data and how they analyzed it to come to that conclusion.But you know the interesting point from their report is why did they choose this time, when the Bitcoin market is like overcooked, to release this information?If this is fact, they had to realize this fact for a long time, not recently. The time of insightful information release is very doubtful. I believe they decided to publish this information to hype the market more. When people are FOMO, they are more easily believe in whatever they read.",

With time, Bitcoin and blockchain industry become more famous and the adoption for them becomes bigger. Even without halvings, without block subsidy halve, demand on Bitcoin will still be bigger with time. With subsidy halve, it will increase the imbalance between new supply from block subsidy and demand from people.As principle of supply and demand, price will be higher with time. Halving helps to make the imbalance between supply and demand, or more correctly new supply and new demand, more skew to demand.",
