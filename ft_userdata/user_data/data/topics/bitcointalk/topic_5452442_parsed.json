That would be way cooler!check again please.Now i write it manually and edit it.thanks for your advice....Your account is a year and one month and you still haven't learnt that , this forum is against AI created post because it is not real and not from your thoughts or observation of topics discussed on the forum. It is easy to create self made topic. The forum main aim is to teach it's members on bitcoin and every aspect of it. Therefore anyone here is expected to learn, and add positively to the growth of the forum in your contributions through what you have learnt outside the forum or inside the forum that will be helpful to other forum members. You shouldn't rush into creating topics, instead try to read other forum members topics and contributions on them,make your own research on google on whatever topic that you want to write. Using AI will not improve your knowledge on bitcoin and help you grow in the forum because,you will be spotted out.",

You don't have to make it complicated, just keep it simple yet interesting enough to get your point across. That would be way cooler!I just went to the OP profile and I noticed that the account was created since April 21, 2022. The OP haven't created any thread since then, but he woke up today and decided to create three threads, two among the three threads created is having just 24 minutes interval. The OP might have used Ai to post but am sure the main purpose why the three threads are created is just to phish for merit, I see no reason for you not to be active for so long and you came back and you decide to create three threads the same day, and maybe he might still create more before the day runs out.I just checked the post now using 1text.com but it's showing me that the OP plagiarized, am not currently free to report him, I don't know if anyone can investigate and report him.",

Those AI won't help you in the learning process and that's not a good thing for someone who's into Bitcoin.I recommend you to learn about Bitcoin and the technology behind it first and then create your topics. If your main intention behind creating such posts with the help of AI is to gain merits then sorry to say but you won't get any merits with such posts. The members in this forum are all aware of Bitcoin and they won't spend their sendable merits on non-worthy posts.Once, you have got enough knowledge about Bitcoin and the technology behind it then you should definitely create some good posts with the intension of helping others rather than for gaining merits. You'll be amazed that members of this forum are very nice and they appreciate good posts and spend their sMerits without rethinking.",

The problem is not that your post fails the AI test, but that it is AI generated and has little to no value. Tweaking the wording just so it passes the AI test changes nothing.What's the point of posting basic information about Bitcoin on the Bitcoin forum? Where's the value in it? Isn't there any legit and constructive way you could contribute to the forum? Aren't there any areas that you would like to learn about, or don't you have any own opinions you could express etc?",

He didn't plagiarise anything, he just used AI to generate that post. What exactly do you expect him to quote or link here? A link to chat GPT (or whatever tool that he used)?",

This has made Bitcoin famous among those who value privacy.(.....)This is one of the many features that Bitcoin has that I really appreciate and amaze. Because just think about you can make a payment for someone without any other people knowing that it's you, same with your recipient. Users can avoid being targeted by hackers and guard against asset theft without disclosing any personal information.",
