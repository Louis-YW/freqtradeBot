Bursts our brain with your expertiseNormally, every individual who is into Bitcoin has to decide whether they want to become a trader or just a holder. Either way, there is nothing about investment that is zero-risk, so anyone who is aspiring to become a crypto trader should learn to fully understand what they would be investing their funds in. The same goes for individuals who are just investing and holding Bitcoin in their wallet. It's easy to invest, but some investors don't have the patience to hold.Some people love the word \"trading,\"  but they don't really have the time to spend and learn about it, probably because they have other daily activities that they are engaging themselves with, so they just prefer to invest and hold since it would not cost them time to buy and store in their wallet. I think if most individuals had the time to spend and learn about trading, there would be a lot more crypto traders than just holders. Finally, for myself, I love the word crypto trading because it earns a frequent profit if properly learned, but I don't have time to do all the learning, so I just hold on tight to my Bitcoin while I keep accumulating more.",

I’m not good at trading and I’m not the type of person that’ll be keeping an eye on the market because I easily lose focus when everything gets bored or don’t work in my favour. The risk involved in trading is not worth something I can take so I’d rather go for investment and watch my savings grow whether in my favour or not, at least the loss is going to be minimal as compared to trading.",

The only thing needed is to find a way or Know a way to buy bitcoin. Then set up one’s wallets which is the only difficult part In investment because many people can easily forget their seeds or key’s since they are leaving the coin for a very long time. The risk of losing is very minimal in it and it is the best strategy to get an ROI for saving funds. As for trading it is very risky to dive into it, one needs to be equipped with bitcoin knowledge such as security, types of exchanges that supports some certain pairs and also fundamental analysis. Trading is what has actually lead some people to store their funds on centralized exchanges just because of trading on spots and futures. The risk and the time spent on trading can’t be overstated. One needs to be on the look out every time for signal. Someone can lose his wealth within a day without proper knowledge of bitcoin. Investing is way easier and more secure but trading isn’t. Also the amount a trader profits In a day is bigger than what a holder can earn. And the risk of it is also same.",

Because if you are in trading you think it is your investment capital, you don't know if it will make a profit or not, or it will easily wipe out your entire investment once you made a wrong decision. Separate the amount of money for trading and also for investing, because they are both different. By separating trading and investing, you can better align your strategies and objectives with the time horizon of your investments. For example, you may want to use trading to generate short-term gains while using investing to build long-term wealth. Because for me separating the two can help you manage risk and avoid making wrong decisions that could impact your long-term profit target.",

Profits can be earned very easily and quickly from trading. But you must spend a lot of time on the trading platform. Long term investment is better for those who do not have enough time to spend. 70% of my earned profit is invested for long term and 30% in trading.

Bursts our brain with your expertiseBest experience? Investing alone. Worst experience? Trading.Of course it all depends on the investor. Investors who are solely investing can incur losses still when they entered at a wrong time, and on the other hand, traders can still lose money if they don't know what they are doing. On the flip side, investors can make investing their best experience when they got profit, and at the same time, traders can not say that trading is their worst experience especially when they are gaining profit from it.Where am I good at? I can say both, but I'm not the expert when it comes to trading. I mean I made money thru trading already (though it wasn't enough for me to make it as an additional income source for some reasons), and as for investing, I've also made some as well, so I guess I can say that I'm good at both of them, but not the best on both. Investing and trading have pros and cons, and I guess many here already stated the goods and the bads on both sides, so it's up to the investor already to decide whether they will stick into investing where there are little to no stress at all, or trading where you might get stressed especially when you are losing.",

The problem is people think that they will immediately become successful when they first put their money without knowing it is just the first step and they need to finish the other steps in order to reap what they sow. The mindset is everything, if you think you can immediately beat the market and earn a lot of money by just investing then you are in the wrong path. There are always risk around in this market and it is because of its nature of being uncertain which means there is no a sure thing.In order to make money, you need financial literacy, right knowledge and right mindset. Take note that you cannot earn it by just studying whole day. It takes a lot of time, maybe months or even years just for you to have foundation that you can use in order to beat the market.I'm a both investor and trader, how do I do it? Let's simply first explain what is trading and investing. For me trading is under of investing which means that is is also considered as investing if you put your money on trading account. The only difference for me is the timeframe that you are using. In investing, it takes months to years while trading it takes to minutes to weeks. I simply have 2 trading portfolio where in my first portfolio I'm a trader specifically a momentum and swing trader and on my other portfolio I'm a investor where I do long term holding.",

Although you're right there, people perceive investment as just purely hodling and not really trading anything especially with Bitcoin. It's usually synonymous to long-term investment while trading is like either quick investment or short-term investment specifically like doing day trading where you treat your coins as your 9-5 job inside an exchange you're currently holding your coin.I do also prefer long-term investment like you although I do not trade anymore since it is not really for me and having to stare at the monitor and charts for almost 8 hours with breaks would drive me insane.Quote from: Stable090 on April 28, 2023, 09:20:41 AMI prefer holding bitcoin because I don’t want to be among people that will regret why they didn’t accumulate bitcoin when the price was still low, but holding a coin is not really a easy task, you have to be dedicated and you should be able to control yourself.
