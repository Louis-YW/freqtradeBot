But not too late for me. So @MaverickGames what's the reason for creating the new topic again? It's due forum username or something else? btw I have visited the website and spent a few minutes there. And I think the casino page design is very basic according to recent most famous crypto casinos. So think it would be better if the dev take care of it and improved it.",

Congratulations on your launch and accredited license to operate. I like your UI as it looks organic and cool but however, I had to go through your website and I found out in you term of Service, you pay suspicious account suspected to have been involved in placing similar bets. Now I ask how can you be able to ascertain that? Is it not better you withhold the prize instead of giving it out? If you say you would pay those accounts, are you paying them fresh or you would split the win amongst them? and lastly,  you can not disenfranchise a winner from claiming his or her full win all in the name that you suspected a multiple win linked to that account and I asked what if the win is from different registered members would you still split it for them?Here is your terms and conditions. Would it not be nice you say a little on it.",

Most of the known casinos are operated under Curacao operator here. Perhaps, they have this KYC rules for their license operator.@MaverickGames, don't make consecutive posts. You have the option to quote those posts together to reply them in a single post. BTW, Isle of Man is the main license operator of MaverickGames, but the casino is operated by 'Shelgeyr Limited' company, isn't it?",

They may not ask for verifications immediately when you open an account or lose some bets but just try winning and withdrawing some profits.Yep, KYC sucks, but I would rather know the devil I am dealing with rather than an Angel I don't know well about when signing up.",

Most of the known casinos are operated under Curacao operator here. Perhaps, they have this KYC rules for their license operator.I really respect the rules and policies by which this casino is licensed, therefore maybe we need to review it longer and not rush into playing before all the rules are properly read. Providing data that is transparent enough is true to be avoided and at the beginning, this casino requires requirements that are quite tough to fulfill so that gamblers who travel from casino A to casino B will not like it too much.Quote from: logfiles on January 18, 2023, 10:59:11 PMBut isn't this approach better, rather than wait for you to play and make some winnings only to shock you with KYC verification requirements when you are trying to withdraw?Maybe it is more precise to provide withdrawal limits for non KYC users so that it is not too burdensome for users who must meet the KYC requirements at the start.

Maverick players can deposit, bet, play, and withdraw safely and securely without having to provide personal documents on sign up.  In order to ensure we are keeping our promise of player security, there will be a time that we ask you to further verify your account by providing KYC. Players can verify their account at any time and once they do, all of our promotions are available to claim! It doesn't matter, after all we only reveal what really comes up when the rules are often restrictive to play more freely. You and the casino are doing well as the rules apply. So what we convey is only a form of positive response for the casino.",
