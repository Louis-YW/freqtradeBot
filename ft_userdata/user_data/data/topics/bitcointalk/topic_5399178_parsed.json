He used the tokens to drain our pool on the dex we're using, so it stands to reason that any liquidity we use to repopulate the pool will be drained in a similar manner.",

Im feeling so bad with it. It seems like that hacked may have drained the whole of funds in the wallet, right? There shall be a vulnerability in the code, this may be right as your wallet can be accessed. This pretty similar thing with what happened with vulcan forged.

That's why as developers and you must also put very important function to your smartcontract to avoid this like frozen or blocking function into your smartcontract. if your smartcontract didn't contain this function and that's impossible to cancel the tokens.",

How could you expect such things is possible? especially since the attack vectors are unknown and even if it is known, the fund that have been lost has nearly zero chance to get it back. Have you heard if there is any vulnerability of another project that results in the funds can be retrieved back? I don't think so. Why exactly would you think that possible anyway.",

More than a few projects that were audited by established and respected teams have gone on to have exploits discovered upon release.The most recent publicised one I can think of was critical exploit in MinSwap's smart contract(s) discovered by Wingriders (a competitor swap/dex on the Cardano network) once they went open source.",
