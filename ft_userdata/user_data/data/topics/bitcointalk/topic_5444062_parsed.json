  "content": "QuoteRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has taken to Twitter to share his thoughts on the state of the crypto industry in the United States, stating that the industry needs to rebuild trust through both utility and transparency. In a tweet on March 7, Garlinghouse said that the industry needs to move forward together, adding that this can only happen through transparency and utility. He cited companies like FTX and Terra as examples of firms that shattered trust in crypto.  However, Garlinghouse also pointed out that the industry is facing significant headwinds, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring war on crypto. He criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler's call for firms to register, saying that there is no infrastructure in place for a \"registered token\" to trade and no clarity on what these tokens are. The Ripple boss also called on regulators to regulate the industry properly, saying that many other G20 countries are already building frameworks and setting guidance. He cited the EU's markets in crypto-assets (MiCA)  regulations as an example of what the US could do. As reported by U Today, Garlinghouse recently stated in an interview with Bloomberg that he expects a decision on the XRP lawsuit with the SEC to be made this year. The Ripple CEO emphasized the importance of the lawsuit, which could have far-reaching impacts on the entire cryptocurrency industry, and criticized the SEC's approach to crypto regulation. He also stated that the case was not really about Ripple or XRP but rather how the SEC was attacking the entire industry. The outcome of the lawsuit will set the stage for how crypto will be regulated in the U.S. and will be pivotal for the entire industry.https://u.today/ripple-ceo-says-crypto-industry-has-to-rebuild-trust....It would be interesting to know whether most blame the crypto industry for negative fallout in 2022. Or whether most would hold a small number of bad actors responsible for cryptos big downturn. Is it perceived as an industry wide systemic fault. Or the actions of a few rogue individuals working alone, who may have made a few questionable decisions along the way. Prior to the 2008 economic crisis and the US real estate market crash. It was unthinkable that such a financial crisis could occur on american soil. Everyone was taken by surprise and few were prepared. I think the last big american economic crisis had occurred during the 1970s and was close to 40 years removed. There has been a major shakeup of social norms and prior precedents, concerning US finance. Bucking decades of previous positive trends. Given current economic conditions, is it fair to say that the #1 priority for most is searching for a viable exit strategy. Which would allow them to escape negative fallout associated with rising costs of living. Given our current and likely future obstacles, our environment appears to be one where rebuilding trust would be a difficult venture. Is there a likely scenario where a blueprint for this can be created. If our goal is to rebuild the public's faith and confidence in crypto, what would be our 1st step?",

The centralized exchanges that have broken the trust of the public are the ones who need to look for a way to build it back, but I doubt that will be possible again. The real crypto believers don't need anyone to convince them to have trust over what they already have. To me, the work to be done here is left for projects like Luna and FTX, who mismanaged public funds over their own interests; they have more work to do to convince the Sec and other governments that they can be trusted again, assuming they still have the intention of coming back strong under the same name.",

This market no longer needs to build trust for investors because this market is already trusted enough in terms of security, architecture, and systems. What needs to be built on trust are the players who often take advantage of the crypto market for their personal interests and cause losses for many people.What's more, are the forex and stock markets reliable? In my opinion both markets are not much better than crypto, because there are also many players in these markets who cheat their customers, money laundering and many other crimes.So instead of commenting on the crypto market to build trust, Ripple CEOs should instead focus on being able to improve their product and provide better crypto products to users or they could try to educate CEOs of other crypto platforms or other stakeholders to stay on the road and not mess around.",

All the problems of 2022 come from ponzi schemes set up with shitcoins or the use of bitcoin away from Satoshi's original idea, that is, leaving it in centralised entities that set up a ponzi like FTX or by using leverage.Although I am a realist and I know that this is not going to happen, but at least the SEC has already made it clear that bitcoin is a commodity and the 22,000 altcoins are securities. How the 'crypto industry' will have to be reconstructed if we refer to securities doesn't really matter to me.",

First of all, Ripple is a security, while bitcoin is a commodity, so XRP has some real problems on its hands at the moment. Then there's a problem of Ripple dumping its tokens to cover Brad's wage, which isn't small. Makes me wonder if the Ripple holders are OK with generously supporting Ripple's board every month, or maybe they aren't aware why the price of Ripple is tanking so hard that it's lower today than it was in 2018.",

Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency. Ripple is a company. It has a CEO. This is hilarious. His opinions about crypto are no different than the opinion of a fiat banker.The crypto industry needs better regulations, not more regulations. The scam shitcoins and scam crypto companies have to be wiped out of the crypto world. Unfortunately, we can't do this by ourselves. The governments have to step up, but I'm not optimistic about the crypto world having better regulations anytime soon.",

Trustless systems need to be built. Regulations just give the government an excuse to hamper crypto growth by introducing nonsensical provisions that force compliance. Very rarely is government regulation an answer. In the case of FTX, what SBF was doing was already illegal in most jurisdictions so it's not as if new regulations would accomplish much. The entirety of FTX balance sheets were corrupted.",

      "body": "Well, the trust was meant by Satoshi to be in fraud-proof features that always follow the right rules/programs with no freewill to cheat or choose to be evil. But certain people/things weakened the features. It's like keeping a vending machine in a public or trustless environment for users, but you have to be worried about the vending machine getting corrupted or reprogrammed to cheat if it not decentralized, immutable, transparent, and allowing anyone to checks and balances it for correctness or obedience to its rules. True cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is designed to be more trustworthy than corrupted/lawless humans who have ultimate control/power over people's assets without proper checks and balances. Satoshi came up with a way to tackle this problem by building system that should always obey the rules that guides it. Still, you have to be worried about a corrupt/lawless humans changing the rules or not following it by centralizing the system, making it opaque, mutable, Etc. Isn't that the issue with Ripple and false cryptocurrencies?",

No wonder trust in cryptocurrencies, especially among retail users, is at an all-time low.This explains the fact that many trading platforms have disclosed more data about their financial resources and the emergence of the concept of \"proof of reserve\" to achieve more transparency in their activities.On this article it was noted (without citing the source) that Coindesk mentioned in a detailed report that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is currently assembling a group of crypto companies with the aim of rebuilding trust in the industry.",

Just look at the IPOs from 2017/18, most of them were scams. All the fake bitcoin cryptos were scams made to capitalize on having bitcoin in their name and being cheaper, so that the average Joe would throw some money their way.

XRP was made as a bitcoin's competitor from the start. They wanted to make a more centralized bitcoin with a large pool of coins under the team's control. They thought the traditional financial system would like them more if they had a CEO and a team of lawyers, but as we can see banks don't like crypto at all and registering a company just makes you a bigger target.",
