This idea doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.I think we can all agree that the world would be a better place if Putin were to be removed, but obviously this is far from straightforward. How do you envisage him being removed?Please could you expand on your statements, and outline the logic?",

A hero to those who like the rape, torture, murder and enforced disappearances of civilians.But the atrocities under Putin in Ukraine are nothing new. He was in charge of similar activities in Syria, and indeed everywhere he's been during his entire time in power. For just one amongst innumerable examples, we could go back over twenty years to Russian forces, under Putin's command, performing summary execution of civilians in Grozny.It's one thing to rant about 5g masts and nanobots and contrails, quite another to worship the worst war criminal the world has seen in decades.Sixty feared dead in bombing of Ukraine school",

You are contradicting yourself, bud. Putin cannot stay in power but I think he has managed to hold power for 22 years now. If you can achieve the feat of trying to install a Zelensky kind of ruler in Russia, well you have my best wishes. I think it's only the US who can hasten his descent from power but no body's lifting a finger.",

They've tried for decades to remove Putin, several US presidents later he still control Russia. The response by NATO to the invasion was lukewarm at best, what makes you think they are invading Russia proper, which has only become harder after the land Russia managed to take?",

A hero to those who like the rape, torture, murder and enforced disappearances of civilians.i am against putin. but looking at the wide picture of who is presented as 'heros' in history100 years ago. the west invaded the middle east. stealing land and killing the ottomans. yet america/UK were setting themselves up in media as the hero's. rewriting historymuch like america(via the british/spanish/french) validated itself as a 'great land of the free' while killing native indians and enslaving africans. (understanding a situation does not imply that you support it)..even now. the middle east are angry with the west. (for good reason). so when the west again invaded the middle east in the 90's-2010.. the middle east were fanatically and savagely trying to defend their country/land. from armies that were born thousands of miles outside of the land.yet again media present the west as the hero's(im against the actions of middle easts involvement of 9-11, but you can atleast understand why they done it,.. if you look at the history books at the US invasion of the middle east pre 9-11(understanding a situation does not imply that you support it))america/UK had no need to ever be in the middle east in the last 100 years. it was not their land.. if the US/UK never went to the middle east. there would be less hate between both sides(understanding a situation does not imply that you support it)..UK/spain had no need to be in africa/america 200-300 years ago, it was not their land/people..putin is not a hero for invading eastern ukraine. its not his land.but if the US/UK can be seen as hero's for the middle east. and if america can be seen as 'land of the free' with all its native killing and enslavement.. well.. the word 'hero' becomes meaningless..",

True Putin will be Russian President till 2036 because the law he signed will always be in his favor,  democratically if America does not want him to win in the next election, they can influence the people of Russia not to vote for him but that may lead to another war. Who will the American government present to stand and defeat Putin who is regarded as the most powerful Russian politician since he took over power in 2000 from Boris Yeltsin, IMO only death can bring Putin down easily.",

If you are telling us that Putin regime is going to be over soon, then that's fine. But you need to know that Putin is also working to stay in office forever. You can go and read other articles and publications about is agenda. If Putin is not going to stay long again in office, do you think he will allow is adversary parties to take over power from him?",
