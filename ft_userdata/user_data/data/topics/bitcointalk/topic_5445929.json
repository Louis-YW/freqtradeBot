  "content": "Hello crypto bros, it's me again with an update on my \"inflation\" and \"the best time to buy bitcoin\" topics.I already talked about how we all should wait for the FED to start cutting interest rates cos it will be a great signal that bitcoin and stock markets WILL go up. (because the economy will get better)So today I want to talk about a possible date when it could actually start happening. If you will check the CME website you will see that the market expectation is that FED will start cutting interest rates in June. And it's a very important thing for the economy and crypto. First of all, it would be a big signal for people to invest in crypto. Secondly, it will mean that economy will start recovering which will be huge for all markets including crypto. But you all should know that things won't happen in one day or month. Bitcoin will pump, but then it will start growing slowly. The economy needs some time to recover. But it will already be a starting point for us to buy bitcoin.So let's hope that we will see FED cutting interest rates in June. Good luck to everyone BTC",

I believe it will have very higher price than $30,000 in 2024, any month in 2024.With this vision, why do I have to care about when Bitcoin will pump, soon or late. I don't care about FED decision on interest rates in 2023 and 2024, it's their job and Bitcoin has its job too. I have my job too, working and holding my bitcoin.",

This tells you that the market is not entirely influenced by any singular event, but there are lots of things that goes into price increase or decrease.Do not sit around waiting for a signal that would determine the direction the bitcoin market would take, just buy and secure it in a non custodian wallet.- Jay -",

Good luck to everyone BTC If you look at the performance of the Federal Reserve, it really considers various economic indicators, such as the inflation rate, employment data, and GDP growth, among others, when deciding on monetary policy. Their decisions are based on their assessment of current economic conditions and their future prospects.Related The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is based on a variety of economic factors, and it is difficult to predict for sure whether they will lower interest rates in June or any other specific month.Market expectations and speculation do not always accurately predict the actions of the Federal Reserve or other central banks. While lower interest rates may be beneficial to some investors and potentially impact the cryptocurrency market, especially the higher BTC price,",

(because the economy will get better)The only issue with this theory is that Bitcoin has de-correlated with the stock market over the past few weeks after a years worth of correlation. Even yesterday stocks went up as Bitcoin pulled back. So the correlation between stock markets and Bitcoin will have to return, otherwise these theories have no subsistence, and if anything the opposite would instead be true.

Then when Bitcoin pumped back up to $25K people changed their mind and said \"this is good fro Bitcoin\", because price was rebounding. I imagine if Bitcoin had gone sideways people would of said \"this doesn't affect Bitcoin\". It's the same old story.It's almost as if Bitcoin might not be as inter-connected with macro economics as we think, but it's always possible to attribute certain events to Bitcoin's rises or declines...",

It dumped later when powell started his speech saying they might keep raising rates in the future which drived the markets down.
