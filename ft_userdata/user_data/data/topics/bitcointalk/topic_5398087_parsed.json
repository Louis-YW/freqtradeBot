This is too early to draw a conclusion about that. I do believe if we can see a better thing to come soon. NFT is relatively new thing in the crypto and this needs more development. NFT may unfamiliar and that needs more time to make people aware about NFT. We know that instagram has so many users but i believe less than 10% which familiar with NFTS",

NFT still needs a lot of development because it is still very new in crypto, investor interest is starting to be seen in NFT with the various innovations it offers. Social media is a great market to get more followers, because its users cover the whole world.",

I see a lot of NFT but I am not sure what are the things you can do with it unlike some NFT that is gambling related where you can constantly earn passive income by just holding their NFT.",

It is a funny world indeed when we are celebrating Facebook boss who clearly is not interested in our benefit but his own,,, first he spies on us, then he sells our data. What do you think NFT and metaverse under Meta creation will do for us? Get us more hooked and fed to his brain machine.No thank you",

What is important is investing in the right projects even if it takes time to develop, it is better than the quick money grab that is available in the market.  Don't forget the whole crypto space is considered very young so imagine where digital and virtual reality will be in the next couple of years.",

A limited group of US users will take part in the pilot project. Perhaps with a full launch, we will see a new bullish rally in the entire cryptocurrency market. This is definitely positive news.",

I do believe when you are watching the market and you will be seeing that if the bearish market has become the main problem. NFT hype is actually depend with the market trend and so even with this big news and im sure that the position of NFT will remain the same. I just wanna know how many actual users on social media will be actively using this NFT feature. Whether the influencers with big followers will try to take the advantage or not.",
