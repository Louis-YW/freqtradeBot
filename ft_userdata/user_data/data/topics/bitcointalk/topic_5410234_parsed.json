After its done, after \"buy rumours sell facts event\" and spectacular dump, bitcoin will come back on top once again.This is what happening right now, the market is down again and the price of ETH goes back to $1500 level after failing to sustain the level of $2k, I can say that the market condition also affects the price and of course it didn’t invalidate the update, the hype might still be there but the market influence of Bitcoin still dominates here. There’s a lot of altcoins that outperforms Bitcoin, this is not the first time and probably it can still happen as the altcoins continues to grow as well.",

No reason if outperform in trading operation meant that was even better than bitcoin. The fact that if everything is still remain unpredictable. More volume doesn't mean if that would be good. People are still speculating ethereum due to the next fork. Once it will be done and bitcoin will lead again.",

That is why rumors should not easily provoke us and it is better to research and seek further information so that we know what really happened. But it seems that many people are repeating the same mistake by following the rumors that circulated so that they buy in inappropriate conditions, which results in them experiencing losses. But that's just how it is in the market and when more rumors circulate, it will make people panic and think they should follow suit before it's too late. Only people who can act wisely can take advantage of the situation because they can observe what is really going on.",

And the usual thing that the market triggers is to \"buy the rumors and sell the news\".It's the possibility that there will be a huge pump before the merge and then eventually going to pump.But for the long term holders, nothing to worry about as it's going to be normal again and likely to increase.",

So ETH volume doesn’t really mean much.Many are buying ETH on spot and shorting on the futures, so basically 1 hedge equals to twice the volume.

Another reason is that there are misconceptions about the ethereum upcoming merge which many people thought ethereum and ethereum token transaction fee will be reduced to almost zero and that the transaction speed will increase, but they were all misconceptions.

Eth has less marketcap and smaller liquidity than bitcoin so it moves more easily up or down just because of that. Also it's still considered to be dangerous tech wise as the code is way more delicate then in bitcoin.",

If you follow the rumors that are circulating and you, without researching them first, immediately buy under unsuitable conditions, you will experience losses.",
