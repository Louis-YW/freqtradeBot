So better to keep an eye on themP2E trend is not started yet and you have to wait for gaming trend and then all gaming coins will start pumping.. Currently real world assets based coins, Ordinal based coins such as ORDI are trending in the market.. You can check ORDI price which is most trending and gainer coin in the market.. When you choose gaming project then you have to look for a project which have a complete ecosystem of gaming.. If we like gaming project just because of one game then results will be same like Axie.. Gala, Mana and PYR are some projects which working on full ecosystem of the game and can be trusted for long term while other all old or new gaming project are just fir short term",

Although this field still has a lot to exploit and develop, we still have a lot of time for it to have an independent foothold in the market without being completely dependent on fluctuations.",

So better to keep an eye on themI dont think so and im a Pixel player too on which a VIP and having that level 30 farming skill on which i do have focused on a farming that watermint. Fast farming would be the keyon which generating 5000 berries on almost not more than 2 days on which it do really amounting to $4-5 depending on the berry price in the market on which it isnt really that badfor someone who are really just that trying out to make some farming game. I dont know on what would be their plans on trying out to burn those berries that been produced because if they wont really be finding ways on how to make use of that Berry or simply burning mechanism then i wont really be that get shocked nor surprised that they would really be ended up on how SLP did really become on which the price had been been slammed down into the ground because of too much supply and without having that burning mechanism.So far this is the game that i do see for now.",
