If you are looking for an exchange free from KYC and support with BTC segwit deposit seems difficult because all exchange are required with KYC and better use personal wallet like Trustwallet if you want get segwit btc address without need KYC.",

The exchange also supported multi-wallet which will allow you no to re-use a single wallet address and the same thing goes for their USDT (trc2.0) wallet address.You can also try Coinsbit.io, they have option for Bech and legacy address.",

Segwit was implemented in 2017. That was six years ago. It will not be a surprise if such exchange is hacked. Most exchanges allow segwit transactions.After this thread I wonder, is there is any exchange still yet to implement segwit for BTC deposits?AFAIK, most exchanges adopted segwit because it can save a huge amount in fees with their withdrawal and it is one of the places exchanges make part of their revenue from its users. So, yes the exchange doesn't support Segwit and should not be preferred because if they are such lazy to implement this basic upgrade then their security system should be a big question.",

What most people care about is to use a bitcoin wallet, but most bitcoin wallets are segwit by default and that has made segwit transaction to make more than 65% of bitcoin transactions . It was more than 90% percentage before. Exchanges transactions are still the one contributing non segwit transactions.https://mempool.observer/",
