  "content": "Hi all!Lately, as Bitcoin approaches to 100,000$ I’ve found myself in discussions with friends who are intrigued by altcoins (not only Bitcoin), particularly those tied to AI, and other trending narratives. Many of these projects come with flashy promises, and while I often point out that 99% of altcoins are scams, Ponzi schemes, or poorly designed experiments, but I’d like to build a more well-rounded argument.I’m seeking solid, fact-based arguments to explain why Bitcoin remains the superior option and why altcoins often fail as alternatives. If anyone has good articles, podcasts, or research papers on these topics, I’d love some recommendations. I’d like to arm myself with more than just the “99% are scams” argument to engage in thoughtful and productive discussions.Thank you in advance for any insights!",

Although some altcoins are quite competitive like bitcoin, but they are always below the level of bitcoin. Why? Because there is no clear utility case with altcoins, unlike bitcoin that serve as a highly profitable asset aside from being known as a good currency. And altcoins do have regulatory uncertainty, the reason why they become less reliable from its investors, reason why they cannot compete well with bitcoin.",

      "body": "My number one rule for investing is, don't invest in anything you don't fully understand. To me bitcoin is very easy and simple to understand. All bitcoin is is an extremely secure and decentralized store of value, that can be sent and received instantly anywhere in the world.But whenever I read the description of any altcoin to try to understand its purpose and value, the language used to describe it usually extremely technical, abstract and convoluted. I doubt any ordinary person can understand it. Many have described it as techno-babble. I always think to myself, what the hell is this shit even for? It sounds like they pull this crap out of their ass to make it sound impressive but also to hide what it really does behind a bunch of techno jargon. Like how lawyers try to sound impressive with legalese that no ordinary human can understand. Similar to how slimy lawyers  (is their any other kind?) try to hide their shenanigans under a mountain of legalese.At  the end of the day shitcoins are little more than a bunch a high-tech ponzi schemes.That is why I invest primarily in the stock market and bitcoin. When you read about a company in the stock market it is pretty simple and straightforward to understand what the company does. But whenever I read about some altcoin it makes my head spin with the amount of techno babble used to describe it. Altcoins are also easily manipulated by the founders and VCs. They can print unlimited number of tokens and dump them on you at anytime. That is not possible with bitcoin.My number one rule is, don't invest in anything you don't fully understand! If you don't know who the sucker at the table is who is about to get dumped on, then the sucker is you!",

      "body": "I don't think altcoins are not good maybe new altcoins or tokens are useless because most of the new altcoins don't have any unique features, and most of the features you want in an altcoin is already on the market. So why would you invest in new altcoins/tokens?That's the thing that I think is better to argue than including old altcoins that are already on the top 100 in Coingecko and CMC. The chance of getting profit on these old altcoins in altcoin season is higher than the new altcoins.About Bitcoin, then, as we all know, Bitcoin is the king since that is the first crypto created since 2009. Altcoins are just a copy source with additional features and algorithms to make their coins more advanced than bitcoin, but even they created an altcoin that can't beat bitcoin in terms of development and current marketcap.",

No matter how big your effort is to warn them about risk of altcoins, and more like risk of Margin and Futures trading, they will mostly ignore your warnings and want to explore these things by themselves. They will experience all these by themselves and learn their own lessons with money, then either profit or loss or both like profit today and loss tomorrow. The bottom line is they will end with either net profit or net loss, but by engaging in this market, they will learn more valuable practical lessons that mean more for them than just learn from paper.If anything to share about risk of altcoins, I would recommend.Dead coins: How many cryptocurrencies failed?Dead altcoins.Failed cryptocurrencies by year.Cryptocurrency historical snapshots that show even how weak top altcoins are.Bitcoin vs. Altcoins – projected Marketcap",

The point is that most altcoins are founded upon shallow promises and that they don't survive long. You can then proceed to present them the history of the altcoin market. Where are the altcoins that came out 12 years ago? Where are the top 10 altcoins 10 years ago? Where are the solid altcoins 8 years ago? Are they still in the top 100, 200, 300? Or are they still alive?You can also point out to them the various trends in the altcoin market. These trends come and go. And then there's also profitability. Many solid altcoins haven't recovered from their ATH in BTC many years ago.",

A friend of mine mentioned Fetch.ai as an example, so I decided to look into the project. As I read more about it, I kept asking myself the same question: why does this even need a token, a currency, or a blockchain? The explanations were full of technical jargon and abstract language, making it feel like they were trying to sound impressive while obscuring the true purpose (get our money?   ). Just like you said, if you don't fully understand what you're investing in, it's best to stay away. Bitcoin's simplicity is refreshing compared to the confusion so many other projects create...This is a good point, I feel like so many people are investing on \"AI projects\" just because they are \"trendy\"",

Arguing that Bitcoin is the best and better than others won't help your accumulation in any way. You ought to focus on ways to accumulate as much as you can or maybe even study about Bitcoin itself, rather than looking for ways to convince, because from what you've said, it seems there's nothing that can change the minds of your friends.But if you still insist on arguing, because I know for sure that most people don't like lossing a fight or argument, then you should try to know and understand Bitcoin not just as money, but as a technology. But, you should understand that trying to overshadow other people's idea with yours won't do much, especially to your accumulation.",
