I just checked out the page, and the attendees are really dignified people from top crypto projects and exchanges around the world. Do the attendees who are not speakers or media representatives pay any kind of money to purchase tickets, or is the event highly sponsored by those big boys in crypto? I would have really loved to stream them live since I can't be there.",

But, it isn't for free the Early bird ticket of the Event with basic package costs around 350 AED which is at least $95.30 USD to be accurate. I don't think that normal crypto users can have any benefits from this event as the ticket cost is priced so high for average crypto users. I've tried to find that if they are offering live stream as webinar, but so far I was unable to get any information related to that. If anyone still manages to reach at that event then kindly share the discussion with us. That might be helpful for new users as such events are organized very professionally, and the speakers in such events are highly knowledgeable.",
