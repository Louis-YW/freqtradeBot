  "content": "I make it clear here tron justin sun have built one of the best blockchains.Currently our economy moving to deflationary stage.There is plan to Also make trx limited so sun will burn the tron coins. Also matter of fact many people now use USDT trc20. Only pay small fee for transactions by using tronlink wallet.Also Justin sun want to make trx legal Tender globally.The USA don't need tron as new currency becouse usa have all ready future CBDC-s ready all they waiting is just to approve USDC , USDT,BUSD as Free legit new USA currencies.The UK don't have new Stablecoin gbp so UK will be one of the first countries who Will replace gbp with TRON. Everything is good about tron just one thing is missing is that papercurrency of tron.The digital currency are future but people want to use cash Also so there Will be atm -s all around the world wich Will give you paper tron currencies.Old banking system Will go down becouse nobody don't need them anymore thanks for Justin sun and tron.Also dont forget that tron and usdt trc20 are very liquid currency Even more then original USD.Europe new digital CBDC Will be on ethereum blockchain connected with atm-s cash machines so tron will be not main currency of EU zone. But UK Have no currency choosed so tron Will likely be the legal Tender of the UK new currency.Many of you think it's some joke but think about If you heard first time about bitcoin how many of you was thinking that btc price can go so High ? You see guys you always get wrong information to get your attentions to wrong Direction so the elite can get best assets and then those assets become legal tenders.The BIG old Banks Will be gone anyways and fiat currencies Will be worthless.The first new cbdcs- s Will be ethereum based euro and usa usdt USDC busd new legal USA Tender CBDC-s.People waiting now some magical CBDC it's not going to hapening it's a biggest bluff the central banks Will announce soon failure of their some not realistic utopian total control dictatorship centralized currencies and the real ones like tron eth btc Will Arise as real legal tenders.Off course cash will stay and Stablecoins Will be directly connected with ATM cash machines so that you can get as much cash you need but all the paper bills will have expiry date on from the time you have taken out cash from cash atm.The cash with expiry date Will ensure that economy stay stable and no inflation and currency dont lose value.But digital currency like tron Will be normal without expiry date.So Im happy great things about to happening soon the banking and money system Will be changed into how it should be.You don't belive ? Well look at our world now who would think that we Will go this way ? Nobody but it's your duty to know future so you will do right moves to insure your future for you and your loved ones.Our Banks and goverment have defaulted and very soon all economy Will be taken over crypto.Also to know that fednow project Will be not aproved by sec becouse its not protecting privacy and human rights they know that only way is crypto that's why they created fast USDC and USDT and BUSD so those Will be first new digital currencies those ones Will be the CBDC If that's happens ma y of you Will be surprised but that's why the apy of Stable coins are so good becouse Stablecoins are future and crypto wallets and exchangers Are our new banks protected by SEC and insured by UK EU fca.Stablecoins adoption allready happening.In new York soon only Stablecoins such us USDC usdt busd Will be accepted for real estate or Property related transactions. If we talking about UK and USA then tron Will be UK official currency and USDT tron trc20 Will share Market share with USDC in USA.What we know that world going to tron economy standard If you go along early you are winner.It's all not hard to understood becouse info is public sec pdf files and you can Google find info connect the dots and you Will know everything.But what's most important is that regular Banks are done and soon coming new cash machines they Will replace regular Fiat system very soon in USA cash machines will be connected to USDC usdt busd and Europe with new EUROC ETH based membrane finance group cryptocurrency. Also money printer companies prepare to start giving out paper Notes with expiry date on.About new cash bills with expiry dates: It works like this the longer expiry date you want the higher withdraw fee you Will pay to take out cash.And yes there Will be tron paper bills with expiry date on it.Im sure all this info you dont find anywhere by yourself. Im out of all fiat currencies becouse i know banks will be closed down and Stablecoins Will replace all the old fiat currencies.",

      "body": "No offense - don't you think that the article contradicts itself? Seriously !Look - what is a stablecoin? This is a CRYPTOCURRENCY, with a hard link to.. FIAT! Yes Yes ! Exactly. Not by the power of its network, not by the number of tokens, not by the number of wallets, and not even by technology. FIATOM!And what will happen to \"stablecoins\" if fiat currencies \"disappear\" tomorrow? It is logical - and stablecoins will disappear, since they will not have real collateral! And they are called \"stablecoins\" precisely because they do not have wild volatility like classic cryptocurrencies, based, today, solely on speculation! And this is provided by fiat \"reserves\" or liabilities.And now back to what you probably didn't guess. Yes, there is let the development of STATE currencies which is called CBDC. But this is not anonymous, \"independent cryptocurrency\"! This is a new level of fiat! Now it’s clear why you shouldn’t rejoice and shout “Goodbye fiat, long live CBDC”?  This is the same thing, but not the stablecoin you expect. This is a digital fiat with an even more global control and management mechanism!",

This is a digital fiat with an even more global control and management mechanism!I don't think it's an independent cryptocurrency, both of them are same but they're work in a different way. If stablecoin is backed with fiat, then when fiat price turn 0, the stable coin price turn 0 too. But CBDC price is always stick with fiat, so when fiat price turn 0, the CBDC aka digital fiat turn 0 too.So the conclusion is when the country suffer banking crisis, currencies deflation or other economy disaster, either stablecoin or CBDC that has a link with that country will suffer a same impact.",
