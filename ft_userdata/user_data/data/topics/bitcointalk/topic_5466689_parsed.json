  "content": "Ill start this off by saying that i do basic security testing as a hobby for exchanges and for casinos. And dealing with most crypto related casinos/exchanges frustrates me so much that it makes me want to quit regularily (and i do, i just come back after a while).There are several casinos that fall into the categories below that are currently on Bitcointalk. Some even have active exploits that have not been fixed simply because the casino operator can not be asked to reply to the email they provided for such reports.IF you operate an exchange/casino or any other service, especially if you deal with crypto/money or anything that has value. Please have a clear and easily accessable documentation/policy about bugs and exploits.Currently what i see is:1) Many exchanges and casinos just ignore the bug/exploit reports. They then fix them and pretend they did not even exist. OR they will tell you that they \"knew\" about it already. (but somehow still kept the casino running till the exact point where they were made aware of the exploit and then promptly taken offline). - IF THIS IS YOUR POLICY. Please state this clearly in your documentation.2) Often Casinos and Exchanges treat critical issues as if they were minor or non-existent. A bug that can clearly drain ALL of your wallets gets a bounty of 50-100$. This just shows the lack of care for the safety of your users funds. Often these sites also delay the fixing of issues as usually the Dev who works on the site is either new or has been outsourced and only works on the site once a week or so.3) Very rarely do i see sites that show actual appreciation for somneone finding the exploit and reporting it. Maybe 1 in 5 if lucky. Probably closer to 1 in 7.Please. IF You operate a site that deals with user funds/gambling or know someone who does. Have them set up a documentation.1) Let the user know how to report the bug/exploit or any issue found. - Make it easy to find, dont burry it deep into TOS2) Give estimations or at least a rough idea what a bug might be worth to you. - Even if you dont reward users for it, that is fine aswell. Just state it clearly.3) Respond to these types of issues in a timely manner. -  so often i wait for days on a critical report. This type of transparency will benefit everyone. Users will be more safe with extra testing. People who find exploits are less likely to exploit if they know they can be compensated for the find. The industry overall will benefit from this.",

Better give some examples to support what you are claiming and of course, it is not really tough for someone who is smart enough to run and find bugs will have a hard time contacting the dev/owner of the site.",

      "body": "I see how noble and awesome this may be. But since this means less profit to the gambling site, I don't think they would be so keen as to implement such a feature even if it means that this will drive more users into their casino. For one, it doesn't make sense for them to invest money on coders and bug-catchers when solving simple bugs within the site is as easy as refreshing the website, and automatically refunding the money/wager that the customer has made. Sure this is a huge bummer on the customer's end but at the very least this absolves them from the responsibility of solving these bugs. Another would be the fact that most of these casinos aren't accepting of other people touching their code base. It's so easy to fetch source codes nowadays that you can basically create a derivative of a centralized casino on your own. They knew this much and are afraid of the legal repercussions that they might get tied with if such a situation comes around. So, they just wing their bugs.",

There are some bugs that act as if they are benign initially, but becomes devastating once discovered that it's connected to other parts of the game or platform. Pretty sure that the casino will have their eyes and ears on those minor bugs, though not as intently as what they give to the bigger ones.",

The development of applications certainly requires a process and cannot be just developed and run at any time. There are stages where application development takes longer and if there is a bug that is not too disruptive to the service, usually the platform will note it and include it in the next stage of development. As long as the bug is not fatal and a danger to the service, usually it will be left until everything has been developed by the team.However, it is true that the platform's appreciation for bug bounties is sometimes not commensurate with the bugs found and that is why many bug hunters prefer to exploit these bugs and sell them to hackers.",

Perhaps a little bit of negative marketing would force the owners of those casinos to do something about it and solve the bugs/exploits. I don't mind having a publicly available list of crypto casinos, that currently have bugs. Such list will definitely force the casino owners to improve their websites. Waiting to get paid for finding bugs won't work. Most casino owners are stingy and most crypto casinos don't want to put some money aside for such purposes.Many crypto casinos are using the same templates and gambling scripts. I am no expert in this field, but what is the chance all those casinos to have similar bugs?",
