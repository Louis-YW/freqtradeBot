  "content": "Hi, we have enough of losses.We need to little more syncronizing the trading so we use time trading way.Best time would be London time zone as it's world financial financial capital city so we could use London time zone.the idea would be 3 times per day trading either Long or Short.This way we can eliminate the gamble efect and give better Direction for the coin we gona choose.The daily trading plan: For example: morning after noon and later evening so 3 times per day.Off course Even this can't give you guarantees 100% but at least we know Market has some volume and you don't have to wait once you enter at this time you can see action.So time frame should look like this If it will be long position day then ....3 times per day.UK London Time zone 9.00 -9.40 long entry 13.00-15.00 long entry 20.00-21.00 long entry Or 9.00-9.40 short entry13.00-15.00 short entry20.00-21.00 short entrySo this way everybody who want to trade Will have opportunity to use that time. So with each time morning after noon and evening there will be either long or short i guess days ahead.The point Will be Like trading calender Im not sure about targets but at least traders can entry when it's sure long or short.So it should work like a clockwork inspired by CME Cbot comex If we work together we can get this crypto trading thing function better for us.The volume and little more syncronizing will give good results and finally we can say that crypto can make daily income If we timing Properly.We use what we have and when people see this trading not so gamble more people Will interested about it and more people Will invest their money in.So If everybody knows exacly time when market or even better some coins will move then they trade only with this time predicted direction either long or short.3 times per day money people can choose best time for them becouse we have times to entry to Market morning / after noon/ evening so it's suitable for everybody.Regular person don't have time check Market and ta analysis the average retail person need some time frame just when to entry in position.We now think If we make trading calender with 3 coins positions daily long vs short we think how long time we give plan ahelad ....daily weekly or monthly or Even few months ahead ? Any ideas about that ?Your suggestions are most Welcome",

It is just like the local YouTube comedy that I do watch when I am not busy doing something at home  This is just gambling trading, a means to lose more and more in trading.Please explain to me why do you think so ? I think you are wrong did read that i said \"insipred of CME\" If you want to get results like big ones do it then follow their actions not their suggestions the time trading is quite much about them what they do it.But would be Nice If you give some better reasons why you think it's comedy i don't see nothing funny here.",
