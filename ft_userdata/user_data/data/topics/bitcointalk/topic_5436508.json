Lastly, it's highly volatile, meaning its price will be an issue if ever it's used in world trades. Perhaps it will be the top dog when it comes to investments and that's it, but not the leading currency that nations can use.",

I do not think that even at a much higher adoption rate, it will not \"lead\" the worlds market, it will be a good alternative and it will be used by many people but I do not think that it will be leading anything at all.It will probably be something normal and it will probably be used by a lot of people, tens of millions of people already owns or owned bitcoin before, maybe it will reach a billion one day, not number of people who holds it, but at one point ever had it, and if that's reached that would be awesome. But the whole world is using fiat now, and I think it will continue to be like that for a long time and it would not be that easy to stop doing that anytime soon.",

And even if more countries accept it, it is hard to see Bitcoin 'leading' the currencies. Many people or governments are even against its usage or promotion towards their people because doing so will put them at risk of losing because of market price volatility. Unlike with USD perhaps which has a stable market value and is being used across majority of countries. This technology is indeed having advantages in terms of fees and it also promotes faster transactions. But let us accept that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are more beneficial as an asset or type of investment, to its users.",

Do you think bitcoin will be the commander of the world’s currency market like the US dollar in destiny? While many people see Bitcoin as the lead, in actual fact it seems to be the follower to what is happening in the main economies of the world. You could see this for yourself if you were paying attention to the interest rates, it was no coincidence that when cheap borrowing started to get more expensive, that the most risky assets were the first ones to drop. All that cheap money was creating a bubble of speculation which drove Bitcoin up to the high price it hit. Even before the latest disasters like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, you could tell that companies were starting to wobble with profits and consumers were starting to rein in their spending as the years of excess give way to the years of bust. Bitcoin rid the wave, some people made lots and others got burned.",

Do you think bitcoin will be the commander of the world’s currency market like the US dollar in destiny? It is indeed very possible to happen to Bitcoin if the whole world wants to accept Bitcoin as currency in any case including world trade. But to become a commander in a market like the US dollar will not be as easy as we think. Because rivaling the US dollar which is so popular in the world, it is clear that it takes a lot of time and the recipient must also think about what risks they have to face by accepting Bitcoin in their trading.The US dollar currency is a currency that is very guarded now so other currencies and Bitcoin I think can only be an additional option in payment in trading because it's not going to be easy enough to get rid of the US dollar and surpass it in any case in a short time, because Bitcoin needs to move all sectors and lines in order to accept it in all respects.",

The cryptocurrency market is here to stay and we are going to see more of the greatness when Bitcoin reaches like 100k dollar. In order for bitcoin to lead the international market, it is necessary for states to use it for settlements in their international agreements. But this is hardly to be expected either in the near or in the distant future. Non-cash settlements of states are obsolete, but they will move to national and regional CBDCs both based on the blockchain and without it. High price volatility and lack of control over decentralized cryptocurrency will not allow states to use cryptocurrency on the world market. But citizens of different countries can do it.",

That'sstill too soon to talk about bitcoin becoming the world leading currency and becoming stronger than the US dollar because there is still a long way ahead for bitcoin and in order to reach that level there are a few things to happen for bitcoin and the adoption of bitcoin. However and regardless of that, I don't think if that's ever possible to compare a centralized and fiat currency with bitcoin because these two are really different and the supplier of the US dollar can easily change the total supply while that's not something to happen for bitcoin, also there are more countries they need to accept bitcoin and step into the adoption before bitcoin become the leading currency of the world.",

Inlfation for fiat money and removing gold peg is done by design. It can help in the times of crisis with short term fixes like .when you can print emergency financial aid. Binance isn't designed to be official currency of countries, it's people's money and storage of wealth.",

Not even to the limit of $100,000 but bitcoin us going far beyond it with all expectations coming from the 2024 halving about to take place next year, if we are to jusge by the current market situation now, we could see that it present us with more hope as we are approaching the halving while the bitcoin price is still dip and yet maby were accumating the buying, because they wanted to take part in the next bullrun a d since everyone wants to have a future with their bitcoin investment then this will encourage more demands to make the price goes higher thore since the market is on demand and supply equilibrium system and with time it can be the lead of every other economy around the world.",

I don't think this will ever happen, no country will be able to be this much sure to sell it's currency to a Cryptocurrency to do a transaction and similarly redeem the cryptos received for a transaction to another currency. This will give a huge foreign exchange exposure to all the countries and their currencies as well. Infact to protect themselves from this most of the countries have decided to forego USD as well so definitely they are not going to move to btc for this.",

Bitcoin is acceptable worldwide because it is borderless, and resistant to censorship but the big guys who control the traditional financial market will not allow it to prevail the way it will naturally spread if they don't use their power to suppress it. However, power fade with time, those who think they control it now will some how lose their energy and opportunity for bitcoin will open, that's when you will here that Mr.A has 10 bitcoin worth billions of dollars. The world revolve and the people you think today that controls this traditional finance will become insignificant tomorrow, bitcoin will lead but we should accept it that no matter how valuable bitcoin is, not everyone will like it, that's the reality of life.",
