  "content": "Hello mates, I have observed the benchmark/reward, dropped significant on nicehash mining software, for principal algos that worked well (Kawpow, Octopus), it dropped from 0.00002xxx BTC/24h that was last week, to under 0.000017xx yesterday and today dropped again, less than 0.0000015xx BTC/24h, as coin prices didn't fall so much in down.What's happened?Graphic card that I use is RTX3080, with classic overclock to give 48-50Mh on Kawpow algo.Also I saw from time to time that Dagger Hashimotto algo, rises crazy from 0.00000750 BTC/24h to 0.00019816 BTC/24h (as was in good time when mining ETH), it stays couple seconds, and then falls down as initially 0.00000750 BTC/24h.Also payment increases too from around 5x cents to couple dollars during this time, but is not real in final earning, I think is fake or nicehash errors?Thank you for answers, mates!https://postimg.cc/bskTq9Rzhttps://i.postimg.cc/CL66HvBf/Nicehash.png",

      "body": "So let's clarify first, we all speak same language, and discuss in the same way, the situation.I use nicehash software  for more than 3 months, always updated to the last version and miners plugin, keept just GMiner active as plugin, others disabled/not installed/uninstalled, because GMiner looks more attractive to me regarding stability, simplity, design, even if takes bigger fee than other miner plugins .Let's say I have a weakness for GMiner.So, I have stick just on Kawpow algo, other algos has been disabled (not interested), so I mined just kawpow algo, 1 month continuous and been payed in BTC.During this period until around 10 days ago, for 49,5 to 50,5MH/sec, on RTX 3080 with 80% power limit (around 297 watts), and +1250MHz memory (10501MHz), benchmark of Nicehash software, showed reward of around 0.00002341 BTC/24h.This reward 0.000023xx BTC/24h lasted more than 7 days continuous, with small variations, between 0.000025xx BTC/24h (highest observed) and 0.000022xx BTC/24h (smallest observed).I speak just about reward in BTC, not coin price(s) or amount in USD showed by nicehash software.So, assuming BTC price drops and rises a little, as RVN coin price drops and rises too, almost in same procentage for both of them, average reward during those days was around 0.000022xx BTC/24h, as I counted in nicehash dashboard mining payment.Problem starts around let's say 10 days ago, where for the same price of BTC and RVN coin (Kawpow algo), the benchmark reward dropped alot, from  average of 0.000022xx BTC/24h measured one full 48 hours of continuous mining, to less than 0.000015xx BTC/24h average, measured one full 48 hours of continuous mining.So, if the price of BTC and RVN did not fluctuate so much (under 5%), why the benchmark reward droped so much, more than 30%, also real payment in wallet, too?",

Nicehash software is not Nicehash. Nicehash is a market where sellers (miners) mine of behalf of buyersat the going rate. It has nothing to do with the price of BTC or the mined coin, just what buyers and sellers agree on. If they don't agreenothing happens, that is there is no mining.NIcehash software is just a fancy front end for miners, it has nothing to do with the order side of Nicehash, it just mines it.",
