  "content": "Bitcoin developers aimed the creation of this decentralized coin to avoid transactions going through financial institutions. Developers and its early investors and believers never expected that it would be the gambling companies that will start the massive acceptance of bitcoin as a currency. Gambling companies accepting bitcoin have two effects on people:1. People will think positively on bitcoin because gambling companies are carefully and well-managed kind of business. They are built to entertain people and to earn money in return. And there are hundreds of millions if not a billion or billions of people that are into gambling and many of them are exposed to bitcoin and its potential. Investing companies also have no problem with this as investing is also related to gambling with both facing levels of risks. 2. Many people take gambling companies as something dirty. People might as well take bitcoin as something dirty too. And bitcoin's decentralized form as a good way to evade authorities and government regulations.",

The presence of online casinos is enough to help those who don't want to interfere with their authority, bitcoin is enough to complete the effort so that none of financial accounts are related to gambling sites. Luckily, my environment doesn't think bitcoin is anything \"dirty\" in general because they think bitcoins can only be earned and stored on exchanges.",

They still are not clear about Bitcoin and most think it is used only for illegal activities. Therefore they themselves spread the fear about Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Gambling, like many things, if is done on the volition of a player, is just the free market in action. As long as no one is being coerced into anything, there shouldn't be any moral panic over it. And yet there is. And this causes a black-grey market for gambling in many jurisdictions as a result. People want to play, and yet bad government policy makes it difficult for players.Bitcoin helped to fix that, like many other problems. Bitcoin's major penetration early in it's adoption cycle was into grey market industries. Now that it has become more mainstream, it's worked it's way into more standard businesses and with time, if it is successful, it will continue in that direction. If it were super successful, it would eventually become a world reserve currency, but it's quite a long ways away from that.",

      "body": "There are some distinct benefits for gambling companies using bitcoin. Majority of these gambling companies are registered in Curacao so they can't legally operate a business using banking intermediaries. Accepting bitcoin allows them to defy that requirement. Secondly, gambling companies can avoid asking KYC documents from their players because they are not answerable to any financial agencies or banks. Bitcoin has done a great job to protect the privacy of the players. Some people may think bitcoin as dirty because of its association with gambling but in reality this industry is the very first adopters of bitcoin. Can't leave them for granted!",

Crypto is like saviour for them to avoid the taxes and heavy burden of regulatory bodies. Moreover crypto gave them wings to go borderless and have more countries and peeps on board. With this the hassle of using international credit cards reduced and most of them can easily transact with crypto after buying locally and transferring directly online through portal. However, the regime is not long enough and government already started imposing regulations on them to get KYC of users done and shit. Hope so it does not become problem for them so that we can continue to enjoy that way.",

The pro is that it's a use case where cryptos are treated as money, not an investment. The con is that it's usage via a centralized platform, usually by depositing and storing some coins in a casino wallet, where the money actually belongs to the casino itself. But still, to this day, I use BTC for gambling and it's my most common usage of cryptos.mk4 seems right, though, that it wasn't the earliest use case because there were also things like Silk Road.",

They usually invest so much in advertisements and this has made Bitcoin to be known in different areas. In my country exchange companies are number one in Bitcoin advertisement and gambling firms are the next.     Quote2. Many people take gambling companies as something dirty. People might as well take bitcoin as something dirty too. In my country, society perceives gamblers as no do wells. They see them as time and money wasters. Although I don't blame the people sometimes because some gamblers in my country see gambling as their main source of revenue. Gambling companies would give Bitcoin a bad name. The people would see Bitcoin as a currency for unemployed full-time gamblers.",

Now crypto is regulated yet but by and large, crypto casinos who're smart can and do still actually operate with the flimsiest of licenses.The serious ones who actually have a physical presence and a proper company like Sportsbet are a different monster, and comply with proper licenses... but the bulk out there actually have a license even I could buy right now for a few thousand dollars.",

People are somewhat okay with the thought of gamblers proliferating and using a lot of media to gamble, so long as its industry provides something back to the community. It's like accepting something 'bad' can still give out something good if kept checked at all times.Also, it's just natural that the gambling industry are the ones who will use bitcoin and crypto first, because they tend to want to expand and use whatever available media there is to promote their games and whatnot. Their need for a lot of media to continue expanding never ceases, and they found a way to use bitcoin and crypto and make it so that it becomes big so that people will take notice of it, and hopefully use it to gamble too.",
