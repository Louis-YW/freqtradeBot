If they can show that they have available huge amount to pay to their possible winners then they can legitimately run a business here. Also there are forum users like @lightlord which is donator on this forum running a business and there are other more.If new reputable forum user will create a new casino well maybe the same with other we still need to be vigilant because there reputation will not count since what matter the most is the way handle the casino and how it perform.",

Some people might also think owners don't have enough money. If they stopped, then all good.",

If ever there will be a casino that will be created by members of the forum, I think they will collaborate with some existing casinos and will try to offer all the things that other casino lacks either on design, games and services.

Also, I don't think that existing users will try to create a casino as there are already reputable members that are already in collaboration with some online casinos on their promotions, advertisements, and other services.",

If they reviewed previous casinos, does that mean that they shouldn't have the right to create their own? As long as they are not tarnishing other crypto casinos' name, it's fine by me.",

In the end, I'm a customer and the casino would be a business, if the business fails to live up to a set of standards that I've set beforehand, then even if I was a member of BTCtalk, I wouldn't support it. The only thing it has an advantage of compared to others is that I at least know to a certain point the team behind it and I know how to contact them or make them notice my issue directly without any difficulty, not to mention that this forum would be similar to the forums of some casinos so the community would've already been set in stone even before the casino was fully fleshed out, making discussions about it rather abundant. I don't think there'd be much conflict, most managers here were hired and that's it. As long as they don't multi manage (if allowed then ig its okay) I think it's fine.",

We have to know how to separate things, a person may be good at investigating scammers and scam casinos, but that person will be a failure in running a casino.

Trust issue on crypto casino is not a big deal anymore because there are already many casino that proved there honesty for more than many years of operating without any major issue. So even if the casino is owned by trusted user here or not as long as they provide a good service and have a gambling license then I don’t mind playing at all on this casino.This owner background thing is not a huge factor anymore on choosing casino due to a lot of available reputable casino out there.",
