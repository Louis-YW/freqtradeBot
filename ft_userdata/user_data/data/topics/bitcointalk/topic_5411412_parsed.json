ATH was also become impossible to be reached by grin again. I guess i kinda feel this coin might be dead rather than reaching its all time high or even surpass it. You shall avoid to invest in a non potential coin like this. There are better coins in the market that worthy to invest rather than beam. it's easy just to use marketcap of while the fact it will never happen",

Everyone is struggling as you can see, still red and bleeding and even if this is a new project and being hype, it will not reached because of the current bear market.Well if you believed in this project then maybe you can invest, but for the majority of us, we are very reluctant even if the roadmap is solid. As least though you should be at least as detailed as possible as what is your main reason from $0.18->$50.00. What is unique in this project that we haven't seen yet?",

But I'm not sure if Beam can increase, but it can happen if there is a lot of good news from the team that can convince investors to invest in the Beam project. But apart from that, you have to find out the advantages of the Beam project compared to other projects because, as far as I know, projects in the top 100 also have the same opportunity to improve.",
