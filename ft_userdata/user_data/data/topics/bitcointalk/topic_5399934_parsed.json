Those beautiful ladies you see were inspired by someone's money to transform her.Likewise yourself, you are not ugly ,the moment you start to see yourself as beautiful and as relevant enough then you can control others opinion about you, think less what they say about you, spent money on yourself to look good then people will be surprised at how you tranformed for good.Command some respect and values to yourself.",

      "body": "When it comes to physical beauty I believe no one is ugly. Being beautiful is about radiating a positive attitude and being good to others. Every human is unique and we all have special qualities and something to contribute. And physical beauty is definitely distinct from being attracted to somebody. On the other hand, a person can be ugly if they treat others without respect and dignity.",

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder & there is somebody out there for everybody.Looks don’t last forever, they fade with age so it’s always best to look for a potential partner who is great on the inside too.",

But it's important not to reject the fact that there are actually people who are more attractive than others even in animal world. But sometimes I feel like being attractive/beautiful is a curse because of how difficult it's to be normal without living fake life pretending to be what you are not when you know you sometimes stink & poop like others.  However, I tend to focus more on the inner beauty than outer appearance. There are ugly people who just melt my heart when they speak or behave, while the behavior or speech of those who appear beautiful could make you not to want anything to do with people with similar beautiful appearance. I tend to think that our CREATOR could hide good things in things that appear ugly for those with wisdom to find them. No need to envy beautiful/handsome people too much as it's not really easy to live normal life (from my experience) in the midst of people who aren't so attractive",

      "body": "Beauty is a subjective concept, and everyone has their own unique features and qualities that make them attractive in their own way. While some people may conform to societal beauty standards, it's important to remember that there is no objective measure of beauty. What one person finds attractive may be different from what someone else finds appealing. Additionally, physical appearance is just one aspect of a person's overall beauty. Personality traits such as kindness, humor, intelligence, and confidence can also contribute to someone's beauty. So, it's safe to say that nobody is truly ugly, and everyone has their own unique beauty that is worthy of celebration.",
