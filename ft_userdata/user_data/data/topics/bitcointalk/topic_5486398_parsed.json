It's like trying to take advantage of the religious people by using the name of Bitcoin.Bitcoin in itself is a crypto-currency and it has nothing to do with someone belief system. A priest can use Bitcoin similarly as an atheist or a communist. Bitcoin is free from all such things so it makes no sense to me to have a Bitcoin Monastery.",

People just love combining completely separate topics just to see what would happen and this is one of those cases. What are people going to do in Bitcoin monasteries? Pray for Bitcoin to go up? Who will fund them? What services will they provide?",

What is you take on bitcoin monastery?People who are very spiritual will always find ways to make everything they get involved in spiritual or fix spirituality into every activity. In my logic, this is also another example of someone trying to fix spirituality into bitcoins whereas it is far from it. If people start using technology under the guardians of spirituality you will see that the spiritual head may begin to abuse this privilege of being in charge of other people under his spiritual guardiancy. That should not be how it should be. Things should be between you and your bitcoins, not between you, your bitcoins and any other spiritual head.",

We should apply whatever knowledge we have about the particular subject. When we try to do something outside of what we know and understand, that is where we are most likely to make mistakes. We have no idea about investment but if we invest only based on our own spiritual knowledge, we will never get anything positive from that investment. We may know less about a subject but we must apply what we know. Do not invest or do anything on such sites without first confirming yourself. First we have to do our own analysis, if our analysis reveals something positive, then we can decide on these issues.",

I think I am familiar with how this works. These folks would establish a bitcoin monastery where a self-appointed leader would emerge. He or she would then lead the group in a cult-like manner, such like an \"in-group out-group\" dynamic. Eventually, they attract significant media attention so much that their sentiments begin to influence the market price of bitcoin in subtle ways.This should never be supported or promoted.",

But basing on your topic, the thing that I can say about this is we've got a lot of science fiction stories out there that have talked about the merge of spirituality and science and there's not a lot of them that's talked about the merging in a positive way, at least from what I've read and watched, the closest thing that I can think of that talks in a positive way is the theme of Fullmetal Alchemist (manga) and the negative one is probably Warhammer 40k Universe.Personally, I think that spirituality and bitcoin should be different or at least will only coexist and not mix together, and I don't think it's a good idea that there's people out there that's basically building a cult surrounding bitcoin, it's not a good image for bitcoin.",

Mixing it up with spirituality, you'd see it for every thing that there's a monetary benefit thinking that praying for it to their gods would help them cope up with any updates and to have financial blessings.Honestly, it's the first time I've heard of this concept.",

What is you take on bitcoin monastery?I thought you must be using the monastery as a metaphor to represent BTC enthusiasts but you were talking about religious ones, I also think we should keep BTC away from religion but that's not up to us, if one person wants to inscribe religious beliefs in BTC and wants to follow that way, just because that person thinks his/her religion is guiding him the right way and by following that way he can also leverage BTC technology to propose different visions then that's ok and should be left on that person. But considering the other angle which is a cult will be made where people would follow the one leader, and act upon that leader's wish then that's not good.Because this will make it centralized, while it is not by nature, I suggest you to provide us with the link to that YT video so we could get some idea about what you really are talking about, I got not so much after reading your post, but cult is bad but religious belief might not be.",

I don't go with that idea! Individual spirituality is fine and needed, but spiritual leaders made it a business. If someone wants to follow spirituality that's fine, but when someone promises you to run you through that path, that's where the problem begins. let the technology leave alone, please! Do not bring spirituality into it. They don't get well together so don't try to mix them together. Bitcoin is a technology and let it flourish as a technology only.",

Was the person interviewed even a well-known person within the community, or some spiritual guru wannabe that popped up overnight?Bitcoin is in the stage of breaking mainstream and the very last thing it needs right now is to create some sort of cult around it.

This is why people from all walks of life, with different religions/beliefs are all welcome here. In such a way that we can always have borderless transactions not interrupted with religion or any belief from someone.Also, been here long time but I haven't encountered any group or thread mentioning about bitcoin monastery, because for one, no one will support such cause. Basically, we are free to act on how we do things here and not bound by any religious or spiritual beliefs. I believe this is one of the reasons why people are appreciating this market, as there is no discrimination here. No racism or whatever, where people can do what he needs to do on his own accord, and at the same time, can do transactions anonymously.",
