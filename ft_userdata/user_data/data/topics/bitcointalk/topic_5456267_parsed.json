Not in this market. Almost a break even - btc wise for me If memory serves me correctly the last lucho mask on scarce city went for over 3k (I wanna say around $3500)Either way - thanks for bidding!",

[/quote]I agree with that! And this auction reflects what you said too.  lately from what I’ve been looking at cass coins are always fetching very high premium even the peeled ones… I think it was a 1 btc cass went for almost 80k! Approx 3x the load value…This I understood was loaded at .0021 and sold for approx 50x loaded value… the sale I think reflects the scarcity of the item. I wanted it, not as bad as others tho… Congrats on the sale!",

Let’s be honest tho - zero chance I would still have the sats. I see something shiny and there goes the sats. I once had .25 saved to a ballet - then a new squirrelbit was released so had to peel. I’m not a saver, I’m a spender - which is why I love crypto collectibles. Also why I prefer lower premium over load value than the Lucho mask. I like to actually stack sats with my collectibles. Either way - thanks to all who bid - was fun and nerve wracking at the same time",
