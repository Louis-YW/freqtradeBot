I am participating in soccer pools also just for fun which is good experience for me hopefully things could be good and interesting here in this pool as well I will send my fees in next few days. Now we have almost three peoples those are interested and going to pay fees, hopefully before the start of this event we will touch double figure, which could be amazing.",

Organizing a pool does not mean that person is dedicated to it 24/7. Also, there is no extra incentive being given to you, if you organize a pool.I have been through this phase and I know it is a responsibility. Once you send a payment, you can wait for at least 24 hours before reminding the other person. This will give him enough time. 5 hours is nothing as we never know where the other person can be busy despite being active on the forum.Anyway, it's sorted and all good now.",
