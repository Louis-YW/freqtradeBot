  "content": "So, from the article, https://www.bitget.com/research/articles/12560603801825Several coins that did well this season got mentioned which I believe is kind of seem like it due to the season we are in right, and already have some like (Eth and Link), but this coin, JTO has gotten my attention not just the coin alone but the massive airdrop and some ongoing giveaways is what is attracting me to the coin. Aside from that, the features behind the project as well fascinates me. What do you guys think about this project? Do you think it will be good for a long-term holding or is it just the hype around it that is making the coin feel this important. You know what makes me confused is that the coin came in has an airdrop, so I can't pinpoint if it is worth to be an alt or not. Unlike other coins I know they started as presale or just launched in exchanges (like Binance, Bybit and the rest) I could easily just know whether or not if this coin would yield something tangible in the long run. Because they don't have any hype, I can't say the same for JTO. What do you all think?Edited; so you will understand my speculations",

Seeing Jito Network as a major contributor to the Solana ecosystem through its JitoSOL liquid staking pool, and its collection of MEV products, I think it might go a long way but what I don't know is some came in as an hype if it will really do as said",

They just list it but most of the supply circulating are from airdrops by staking their sol into jitosol. I did missed this one but hopefully can have anothet like that. I dont want to fomo but its really envy on the part of thosw who received tokens. Anyway will get our time, maybe there are other solana tokens on the go out there.",

No doubt that a lot of SOL tokens have been doing well and even the meme coins from this network.

And any coin in which  Binance  has listed it in their site means it will run long. So it is good to invest in it because you can even use p2p with Binance. You can sell and buy. All the coins in these season are on the bull market but today as Bitcoin price comes down every other coins prices are coming down. Even though it came as airdrop if it is doing well in the market then you don't have to be confused and fear but invest in it but remember the risk involved.",

They are self funded project and since no one has the token they list on whatever amount they want to list and people buys it, the project owner are in control of the market they are holding major allocation of their coin without anyone dumping it on them i think if most project adopts this methods it would really help in times of market control/manipulations. What I will say is that since we are on bullrun all project seems to always be successful so if you must hold such coin/token you should be brave enough to know what to sell, basically I can't give an accurate results about what the future of that project would hold, so as a real investor you can spare like $50 or any amount you can seems to let go maybe you aren't in any haste of using that funds then watch out to know what is the outcome of the project.",

Jito only did well because Solana and it's ecosystem tokens are all the rage right now. If you're thinking of investing, keep in mind that Jito is the new kid on block and yet to undergo a solid market downturn.Liquid staking is a huge infrastructural project regardless of the ecosystem — similar to how Lido had unlocked a lot of value for ETH staked on ETH Mainnet. That said, Jito is fundamentally good, it just needs the solana ecosystem to avoid another major fud event.",

But we need to consider this is bull run and even shot coins can perform well. I think we can give a try during bullrun and test it out during the correction phase. Even though I have mentioned that the coins listed on Binance are better than others and can go longer run but if we look at the darker side I mean those coins which has been delisted by Binance for example Nebilo, etc you will see they just liquidated millions of dollars of investors so it would be better to focus more on what the project has to offer instead of just exchange or ecosystem ots build in.",

Are they worth it?A: If asked that, then we have to refer to the current conditions, referring to the current condition of the Solana ecosystem, then it's a good decision to make an entry (despite the fact that several times the Solana ecosystem has found their ecosystem exploited). So, are they worth it? It depends on what token you mean, if it's about meme tokens on the Solana network then the answer is big \"NO\", because it's only based on hype.Quote from: livingfree on December 11, 2023, 07:19:22 PMDon't get confused just because it has an airdrop, it could have been part of the marketing budget that they have so it's just to get attention or more people to get into their share and community.True, it's part of marketing with the aim of getting the attention of the crypto public, but with this airdrop it will make the price of the $JTO token tend to be unstable in the initial phase, which might make the OP confused about whether to include $JTO in his alt portfolio or not.",

You have a good idea on your own but you are not the first, many have tried and people have been disappointed, so I wish you luck on this. All I know from my experience with the crypto world is that we should not trust anything and anyone's idea, but rather risk anything we think is worth risky for the sake of the return.But this is certainly not a style that is so new to the crypto world or that people do not have much interest in. Instead, I will rather focus on the primary projects and their blockchains which I know, after all, they are already well-known and gaining little from them is better than losing everything with the project or a person I do not know.",

Since Solana coins drop drastically until $15 and current seems want return to their ATH price seems the best moment right now keep trust again with Solana coins for long term investment.

In essence, I have never accepted Solana's technology as being true to what they say, but some things in this market do not necessarily work according to quality, their potential is too great to easily get that hype.Looking at some things going up in price, or some publicly airdropped products to the community, is all just a way to bring general attention to SOL. With JTO, in my opinion, it's worth taking the time to research JTO, but if it's just looking for profit, I personally wouldn't really invest in it, because I would simply look at many other options.",

They both have good potential and the pump is largely due to the projects running in their ecosystem. I was checking Defilama to find out which project has achieved good gains in a month in the Solana ecosystem. I found out that more than Jito, Marinade Finance has gained an ROI of 59%. Unfortunately, both of them would be distributing their tokens through airdrop which is a red flag for anyone planning to invest in them. I would invest in Solana as it is still below its previous ATH and through staking you can generate a decent passive income stream.",

This is why it wont really be that bad to throw up some bucks into these projects knowing that when it comes to potential then there's no doubt with that.",
