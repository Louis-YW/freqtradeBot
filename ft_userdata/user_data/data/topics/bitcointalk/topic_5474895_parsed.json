Or is it just a marketing trick, to make the service packages sound more powerful?Also, To pay with Bitcoin, do you use an intermediary service, a payment gateway, or is the service directly through you?",

      "body": "Offshore dedicated servers is not a marketing gimmick, mostly dedicated servers have physical location located in USA, Canada or UK, these are called onshore dedicated servers, the major difference is the type of content and freedom of speech on both of these servers, as onshore dedicated servers are strictly abide by the rules of USA, UK etc (depending upon which country server is located in), so that means there are quite a few regulations on which type of content you can host on them, and if you violate it, your server will get suspended or terminated, an offshore server means that a server that is physically hosted on an offshore location like Switzerland, Bulgaria, Netherlands etc, and these servers are abide by the local law on these countries, which are very open about freedom of content, that means you can almost host any type of content on them without any legal issues.About the BTC payment we do use blockonomics to accepted BTC payments, though blockonomics only act as an address generator and current USD to BTC conversion, and all payments are directly credited to us (blockonomics has no wallet or any other stuff of their own).Thanks and if you have any further questions you can always update here, or can visit our website and contact with sales.",

      "body": "Almost all types of content can be hosted without issues. Almost. If we are to host a Mixer that requires to be untouchable is likely not possible. But maybe adult content is not gonna be a problem for these servers as long as the owner uploads original photos and videos.Â  But if warez and movies, that's when they'd be taken down.What are example sites hosted on the offshore if you don't mind telling?",
