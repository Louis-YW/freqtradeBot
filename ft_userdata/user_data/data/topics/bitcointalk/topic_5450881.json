I have some testnet BTC coins that have been scooped years ago, I will check my offline note if I still have the wallet that contains the testnet coin.",

I think his offer is still available I will be posting his thread link below:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5278247.msg55264315#msg55264315I hope he will be helpful for you in your search for the testnet Bitcoins. Hope he will send you some testnet Bitcoins, and your project will begin to work. Best of luck my friend!",

If you mean 2-300 testnet BTC, it's hard to obtain such amount and you might want to use regtest[1] instead. But if what you want to test can't be achieved with regtest, consider mining testnet BTC[2-3] or take a loan with collateral[4].[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5268794.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415861.0[3] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415335.0[4] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5306684.0Thanks man really appreciate it.",

But that is a different integration model based on time locks. What is planned with BTC/LTC/FIRO and the project own coin is op_return based options taking so deposits to specified addresses with the correct tag on op_return= a position ZMQ timestamping is using on incoming tx for entry against public market data, on expiry it's timestamped again to determine win or loss payments are made on the hour following win or loss determination (if doing some of the very short timeframe options offered may need to wait till hour after full confirmation of TX). So no accounts and 100% transparency.It's not revolutionary but a \"defi\" option on native BTC and we're opensourcing the parsing/matching engine 12 months into being 100% live.And yes I will happily send back Tbtc or refill a faucet of your choice once done with the tbtc aplha.Forgot to add that this is for testing the house side wallet handling and a hackathon with prizes for anyone able to move tBTC from any of the platform wallets.",

The problem with setting up an own btc testnet is that you're then expecting potential users to run at least a gitcompare on your integrated testnet to verify it and the second you start doing that users start dropping off hurting the overall project. I appreciate the help man! The nicer a balance the platform has during the hackathon (yes it's tBTC) the easier it is to motivate some people to give breaking it a try.",
