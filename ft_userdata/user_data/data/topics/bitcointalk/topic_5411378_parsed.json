And also - is it possible that Blockchain may disable ALL of the options for the unverified wallets? (disable send/receive option)",

I'm not in the apple ecosystem but on android, everything works fine. They won't be able to stop you from sending and receiving if you have your backup phrase with you. I say ditch blockchain.com and move to a far better wallet like electrum.org-- send your funds to a newly generated wallet. Pretty sure blockchain.com will just add more clutter in the future...",

Blockchain.com follow the standard derivation path, the seed phrase should be easy to import on other standard BIP39 wallets.@swaggerlikeflow, never trust a web wallet, if you have successfully imported the seed phrase, best to still generate another wallet, like electrum wallet for bitcoin, move your coins on the imported wallet to an address on the wallet you newly generated on electrum.",

They need to be sure you aren't from a restricted country in case you'll need to use their exchange. QuoteWhen I try to close this screen/warning in their mobile app, I get back to the main page (wallets, etc)Not sure why it's redirecting you to the main page, but I believe selecting your country instead of closing the form should solve the problem and you'd be able to send your coins. Quoteis it possible that Blockchain may disable ALL of the options for the unverified wallets?

There are lots of issues with blockchain wallets there are many people who were hacked before but blockchain didn't know the reasons and also there are lots of scammers who use blockchain wallets before you can use the search button above to find those threads.If I were you better not use their wallet and switch to other non-custodial wallets like other said Electrum or build your own airgap or offline wallet.",
