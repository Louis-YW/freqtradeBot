The ability to make these type of things is with legacy I think, because I have never seen any segwit versions of this, some say that it is possible and there are some examples I have seen but it's so few and rare that I think it could just be coincidence as well so I am not really sure if segwit has this yet.",

Well, for this person that is running this type of address transactions, I guess they don't have much to do with their time.",

It would take millions of years to generate a vanity address, and its corresponding private key, of that length. These are only burn addresses that can receive BTC because they are technically valid but nobody has the keys to spend from them.",

Then, it's the same, compute the checksum (for bech32 address) to produce a valid SegWit address.Now, examples of this is rare since there's no use-case for such burn address aside from \"Proof-of-Burn\" and the useless spam transaction example in the OP.",
