To avoid being put down by panic as a trader you have to use good management and don't take huge risk. At all market also, you need to set your stop loss incase so you only can lose like 1-2% of your fund on the market and not to lose all.",

So this thread is more about bitcoin investment.As for bitcoin investment, if you are afraid to buy at once, you can DCA instead, to buy at different prices over certain period of time.",

Their focus is for today, not the future, as opposed to investing.The definition of panic is different for different persons but in a nutshell, panic selling or panic buying means that you buy/sell against your initial plan or without a plan.Panic is that you are an immature trader or investor, meaning in case of a price dump you sell your coins in a loss that you initially invested for long-term duration. Similarly, if you are a trader, so you did not put a stop loss and then on negative news or price dump, you close your position in a loss.",

Your option is highly welcome.You have made an interesting topic here which based on the current situation. I am also facing the same thoughts in my mind which are keep telling me to book the profit but other side of me also keep telling me not to book.Because i do know market still has potential to at least touch $40k maybe it could touch $50k too. But it depends on the fundamental news by different governments and institutions. I think BTC will touch $40k once the block rock got approval for ETF. The only thought i  have in my mind to avoid this panic state is, i always said myself that i am holding not doing trade so why should i fall greedy for such a small profit while by bearing small pressure i could earn more. Plus the knowledge of market's sentiments plays an important role here too because without knowledge, anyone could fall prey to market sentiments and could become panic",

It is only natural for a newbie trader or someone that just got into the Bitcoin or crypto ecosystem to panic at any slight price movement, but it is mostly associated with altcoins not Bitcoin. Most newbies are now aware of the fact that Bitcoin price will surely go back to it's ath price it will only take some time but it's certain that it will return back, but the same can not be said for altcoins so if a newbie should panic at the price movement of altcoin then it's understandable.QuoteNow that the price of BTC has increased higher in the market, will you still panic with this new moved of the price of BTC or to remain focus for a better future? Your option is highly welcome.Like I said earlier, it's only natural that newbies panic at price movement. Imagine putting your money into an investment for the first time and all of a sudden the price of that stock drops by 5% - 10% I'm sure you'll have the tendency to panic and even sell to reduce further losses that's what is also happening in the case of newbies panicking.You won't expect a hodler to start checking the price of Bitcoin every now and then, they don't even concern themselves with the current price of Bitcoin so you won't expect such a person to start panicking at price movements.",

I have seen such people who always fear to accumulate Bitcoin because they thing that the current price of Bitcoin is very high and if we buy it now then it will drop further down in coming days. Because of such fears, those investors just only dream about buying Bitcoin, and in actual life they don't have the daring confidence to invest in it.The market has always been volatile and it will always remain volatile, and if someone who gets scared because of the volatility of the market then that user should never ever delve into crypto-currencies. The Bitcoin is still far stable in volatility compared to some shit-coins, as they are totally out of control and move up and down like a heart beat.",

It's interesting how much traders underrate the power of discipline and proper risk management when it comes to trading. I used to overlook this in the beginning of my trading career but now, it's on the top of my priority list. No matter how juicy or interesting the trade opportunity or opportunities are, I always have to follow my risk management rules strictly. Once a proper risk management system is set, trading psychology is the next item to be learnt. Whoever masters both have nothing to do with panicking.",

The fear of trading or investing or of taking risks could have a name. I wonder what it is called?It is normal to panic as a new entrant into the trading world. If you are just joining, now when the price is almost above, if not above 30k, the signs of panic would take the shape of asking questions that one would have normally known.  With focus as to why you started trading, nothing should deter you from still going about your trade despite the charges or fees or market speculations. Fortune favors the brave, not those who panic in the face of challenges. No need to stress further. No true successful crypto trader, lost focus even when it comes to bearish seasons, that's why we have them many and why the decentralized system as well as the P2P, as an initiative works well.",
