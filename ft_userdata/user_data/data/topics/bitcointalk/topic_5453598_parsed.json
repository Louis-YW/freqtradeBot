      "body": "Depending on what wallet other party/sender is using, it's possible. If they are using electrum, it's easy to cancel. And what wallet are you using? Instead of waiting for the confirmation, you can also boost up the process by creating a new tx (to yourself) with the unconfirmed parent tx, with enough high fee. Again, it depends on the wallet you used.",

      "body": "When you create a bitcoin transaction and broadcast it to the network, that transaction is not something that can be canceled. It will remain valid until (1) it is confirmed or (2) it is double spent (so it becomes invalid) and this secondary transaction is confirmed or (3) every single node out there forgets about it which may not happen since a single node can be out there with a different settings that keeps your transaction and keep broadcasting it to the rest of the network.What people commonly call \"cancel\" is option number 2 where the sender resends the same coins to a new destination with a higher fee and gets that tx confirmed instead, ergo \"canceling\" the first one.",

The problem is the transaction is already stuck in an unconfirmed state for so many days due to the very low transaction fee set by my buyer.

If your wallet has RBF (Replace-By-Fee) enabled by default (you can check this by scanning the transaction ID on the Blockchair explorer or your wallet settings), you can increase the transaction fee by replacing the transaction with a higher sats to expedite its confirmation. However, if your wallet doesn't have RBF enabled or you didn't enable it prior to the initiation, there is no way to fasten your transaction, maybe accelerators can help but then, depends on the quantity of your input(s).Alternatively, you can consider performing a Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) transaction. To provide a clearer explanation, it would be helpful if you shared the transaction ID since it involves a transaction between two individuals. If you are anticipating any change in that transaction, you can initiate a CPFP transaction, which should facilitate a quicker confirmation or, you could also advise the recipient to initiate the CPFP transaction and you guys can settle about that later.",

The problem is he doesn’t want to bump the fee while the bump feature on my wallet for the incoming transaction doesn’t have this option. Appreciate all the reply everyone. I will try to ask first the person I’m dealing with if he wants to post public our transaction. For the mean time, I will lock this thread since I knew that there’s no way to completely remove this stuck transaction.",
