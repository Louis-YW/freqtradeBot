All these easy, high-margin ways of making money always come with pitfalls or conditions that are never in our favor. So be careful.By the way, I digress a bit, are you using Poloniex? I've known this exchange for quite some time but never used it. Is it safe? Do you have any problems using it? Because a friend of mine also asked about this exchange recently, but I don't know too much about it.",

There's TerraClassicUSD (USTC) but that's not pegged to anything, or based to anything either. So why would you buy anything like that? Again, one of the problems with UST was unsustainability against the usd peg. Unsustainability is not the key word here. Term you are looking for is pointless fiasco. It doesn't really matter how much staking it has. It's eventually going to zero.",

UST is a stable coin, how you can still trust it when the price is never back to $1? currently UST is worth $0.015.The price of LUNA or UST is keep decreasing, 12% return per year isn't worth it because it's useless you earn more token when the price is decrease more than the token you earn.[1] https://www.wsj.com/articles/do-kwon-jailed-crypto-ceo-rejects-sec-fraud-allegations-3c631ebc",

Infact staking itself a risky investment scheme for long term and making investment on high risky platform which is Poloniex just add more risk to it. Considering the risk reward ratio then 12% doesn't look worth.",

One more thing Poloniex is a well established cryptocurrency exchange and I think the stability and reputation of the platform is also at stake for the risks associated with it like the OP said.",
