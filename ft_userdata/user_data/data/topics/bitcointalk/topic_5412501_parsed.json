You are going to sell doesn't mean there is no buyer. Bitcoin is the most volatile cryptocurrency, so price up and down is normal. Nothing to worry about that. A lot of haters around us and they don't like Bitcoin's growth. So they will always try to create FUD and dump it. But who knows if they like to accumulate at a cheap price?",

The energy crisis, Corona crisis, inflation and the FED and EZB acting like they don't know what to do. One question to ask yourself right now: Is cash or bitcoin a better asset for hodl or invest?",

(their hope is for the rich to spend their fiat hoard on goods and trickle some of that elitism fiat down to the basic low paid retail employee's, to stimulate the economy by making it bad to hoard fiat)what we have seen is that people in Q1-Q2 knew the fiat world of goods would raise the price of goods. so people went on an asset to fiat swap to buy up fiat priced goods quick to stock up on things they might have bought next year, but knew next years fiat prices of those goods would be higher.. so obviously best to buy those goods soonerbut now people have stocked up on physical goods. they will want to save up their spare/disposable value/wealth.by which its not good to save it as fiat. .. and instead best to now put wealth back into assets and crypto. like bitcoinbitcoin is cheap so a real good time to get back in if you have now stocked up on your lifestyle stuff for the next few yearsin the video the so called \"analyst\" thinks fiat rich people are now in Q3 going to invest in energy markets.. HAabout 6 months too late for that \"analyst\" to have come up with that idea..i seen that back in february..",

Bitcoin right now isn't a way to lose money for me thus, it's helping me to gain some financial help and help me deal with inflation. Also, I wouldn't sell before or after the crash happens. I'm just good at holding it and no problem with whether I'll be seeing the crash again, there's no problem with that. I've even endured $20k down to $3k and the same goes for $69k to $17k. That's not a problem, everyone can endure a potential crash that you're saying might come soon.",

      "body": "Many people don't get it that if you price goods in fiat money and then print a ton of it, the goods are going to get more expensive - inflation. When they play around with interest rates they want it to look like fiat is gaining value. They want to make people save up fiat money which is a counterproductive action because fiat is and will be inflationary. Tight or lose policies of the FED are nothing but a big scam and they will make it look like they can stop inflation, but all they can do is make your money lose 4% a year instead of 8%, but ultimately you will still lose in the long run. Despite what they want you all to think, holding bitcoin is the best way to go because the FED and central banks can only destroy companies that take loans. Bitcoin has no front man and is not in debt. It cannot be touched. What you're observing on the bitcoin market is companies who took loans to buy bitcoin getting wasted, but there's a limit to it. At some point money printers will wipe out all those who depend on them and fiat money will continue to inflate. It's a war they cannot win, but bitcoin holders can, as long as they can wait until Spring 2024.",

Certainly, stocks and cryptocurrencies are correlated, but the Federal Reserve is currently the least of our causes for the bear market. The excessive oil and electricity prices, the disruption in the supply chain, the possibility of another Covid-19 winter and the ongoing war in Ukraine are all events that are not assisting investments. I also believe that Bitcoin is susceptible to crashing even further in the upcoming months and definitely not because of the FED. It might have an effect, but it's certainly not the end of the world. It's kind of expected that in such periods of recession, we can't expect Bitcoin or stocks to be performing at their greatest capacity.Even if that's the case, people always claimed Bitcoin is expensive, well, here's your chance to shine!",

Well, their loss. I already have twice the BTC I had before the bearish season.When BTC does its usual correction recovery they're all going to melt away like rats in the sun.Watch as almost nothing significant happens to BTC after the aftermath of the federal reserve meeting at Jackson Hole (I do not count a -$1000 price correction as significant).",

Now, there is nothing wrong if one is going to share whatever opinion a person has today and into the future but to act like he is so sure what can be and that only his own view of things can happen well that is something else. As for Bitcoin, there is no denying that forces right now are affecting its ups and downs travail and I am seeing the same thing to be true for the rest of the year. So in my own prediction, it would be so hard or just a dream for us to expect BTC to go beyond at least $30,000 this 2022 - but then who knows as impossible dreams can still come true anyway.",

After war started and Europeans started applying embargoes to Russia, their politicians wanted to cut gas demand. Russia also (sort of) wanted not to supply countries who embargoed them. So USA > Euro era started. I feel like its not favorable for Bitcoin for now, but in future usa will be key to fix both Bitcoin and European markets.",
