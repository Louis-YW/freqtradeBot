I kept wondering if perhaps most of those bounty hunters accounts are being controlled by bots.",

It is though harsh to block participants and not listening to their queries and problems. Maybe OP is doing something wrong here so would suggest to check again, sometimes one has to tweak their wallet settings in order to access those tokens as well.@OP try checking your address on klaytn explorer as holydarkness has made in quoted^^ post.",

Also for continue joining campaigns which we don't know if they pay you just making those scammers scam many people because you are helping them to promote their scan project. So if I where those people who still seeking a bounty campaign to join they better stop it because majority is a scam.",

      "body": "Hi I'm writing this because I faced the same situation not only his Asan bounty but also in Oscarswap bounty. I worked 16 weeks and during the 13-16 weeks he bring coinmarketcap event and those who don't did it correctly no reward. That's how he reduce the bounty workers to 300 persons. Once I submitted and he said time over but in my timezone I submitted the proofs couple of mins before the timeline he gave. I didn't upset also because at that week I was with my sister in hospital because she caught dengue. So I thought it's ok, but I told him whole story and he said not worry you are eligible keep work. So after 16 week I check my work stakes and everything updated correctly and no worries at all. During this period his previous bounty Oscarswap final results was released and somehow half of people work in that bounty was ineligible for reward. I pm him, no replay and then he make announcement saying if someone talk it in the bounty group or official project group he/she will be banned and he did it. Then asan final sheet was announced and when I check it I got 35$ for 16 weeks and my details raw in the excel sheet was green. But after 3-4 hours passed and again checked the sheet my reward was reduced for 25$ and my raw was red, but no reason for that. So I ask what did I do tell me the reason because he did this same in his oscar bounty. Messages are seen but no replay, group closed and then he as previous his bounty he told not to complain it, if someone complain in his inbox or group he will banned. So I asked in the group \"how can we trust you in the next bounty if you work and act like this?\". I kicked out, then I went to see what happens in official telegram group, surprisingly he is an admin in that group also and he delete all the messages regarding complaining about him. I'm sharing my experience because I worked in 3 bounty that he did and same experience in the 3 bounty projects. Everything changed after bounty over. wallet address changed, stakes changed, people kicked out when complains and etc... If anyone can joined his group and stay there until one bounty over you can see that I'm not lie. I don't have single faith that my reward will be back to me. But I want to share the experience here. Most people are not complaining because they worry that they won't be able to do next bounty on his, So he take it as a opportunity and rip off the workers. I believe mod will take this serious and observe his next works and action. Thank you",

That thread came to my awareness last night when I am about to sleep, so I didn't do much other than archiving their spreadsheet just in case it got locked or we need them for future reference.Reading that thread again today when I have free time at hand, I have to agree that it is not much better. If any, it just further complicate things as that thread is --in a way-- validate the BM's decision to cross some people from the final sheet, as specified on their rules of no multi-acc, there's quite a big chances that bounty is filled with multi-acc abuses, given people posting on that thread are mostly tagged in the past for that violation and they're waking up from a long inactivity just to protest there, and they're not even enrolling that account on Asan Verse. The other reason why people are disqualified from the bounty was because they posted on Asan's group, which was also not allowed as per the bounty rule.Though... I looked at the group again and it seems there are cases of changed wallet address, the representative of Asan Verse even acknowledged this,Is there an allegation or findings by someone that the BM redirect those \"replaced wallet\" to their own? I might will take a look at other campaign managed by the BM, if it could fit on my currently swamped days.",
