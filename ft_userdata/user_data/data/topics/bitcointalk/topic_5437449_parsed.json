  "content": "Hey guys my name is Jason Stat. I am from the city of London, United Kingdom, and also a new member of your community. So I want to ask is that I am thinking to start a bitcoin business on a smaller level. So does anyone of you know any professional bid writer? Or anyone has experience with bid writing in uk? Although I heard positive reviews about them. But still want to make sure or for any better suggestions. As this will be my first business. Looking forward to positive responses.Regards.",

      "body": "So you need a bid writer on trading advices? Don't you think if people knew a sure way to successful trading, they'd use it themselves rather than wandering in off topic forums? ðŸ™‚If the business you are talking about is only trading, I have nothing to share, but if you need policy and managerial advices, I might be able to help from a psychological stance.

      "body": "In my opinion, starting a bitcoin business on a smaller level can be a great opportunity, especially considering the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency. As for finding a professional bid writer in the UK, I think it's important to do your research and find someone with experience in the specific field of cryptocurrency and bitcoin. You may want to consider reaching out to industry associations or forums for recommendations or even posting your own job listing.",
