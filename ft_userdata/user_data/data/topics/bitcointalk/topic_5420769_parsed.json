  "content": "So apparently, soBTC de-pegged and crashed to ~3000$ earlier today. The cause? FTX:Quote from: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin-solletsoBTC tokens are wrapped BTC tokens issued by FTX or Alameda. Both these entities have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the BTC tokens are no longer redeemable.Just thought I'd use this to remind beginners that WBTC is not the real bitcoin and you shouldn't be using it, especially if your plan is to hold for the long term.If you want to read more about the risks involved, you can check this article: https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/how-safe-are-todays-wrapped-btc-bridges-b0f35a7b15e2",

I don't understand why people still purchased Bitcoin on other chain.  I remember when I joined bitcointalk, that was when I knew I was getting a lot wrong. Example is 'who is the creator of BCH, BSV bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond? My answers were Satoshi Nakamoto, but I was wrong, Sotoshi only created bitcoin (BTC). I joined this forum before I knew all that and saw how centralized people wanted to take over bitcoin but they all failed. If you want to withdraw bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges, you will see those fake networks like Ethereum, Binance chain and some other networks which are all not the real bitcoin but pegged and existing on another blockchain entirely. They have low transaction fee which will encourage novice. But not only that, many newbies are confused, some thought they are actually bitcoin, not knowing they are only stable coins, but if anything wrong happen, it would become depegged and fall in value than the real bitcoin.",

I have used Binance and I have also tried withdrawing Bitcoin from it and those other networks came up, but something was very clear and that's which is fake and which isn't, the network names where boldly written and it would take a Newbie that doesn't observe to fall for some fake.Also as a Newbie and not used to all that it's best to ack a more experienced person who has used the exchange.",

The problem is that people can't see the difference between a fake promise and actual peg. What all these tokens do is that they give a fake promise to convert your useless token to bitcoin at a promised rate (eg. 1:1) but they can always break that promise and change the rate to something like 1000:1 if they wanted to and there is nothing the user can do about it!We have the same problem with stablecoins too since these days many newbies are converting their coins to them.
