Re: payment probably eth?Thank you!I understand why you want to pay for something that's literally given for free, you wanted to get your hands on this testnet ETH ASAP so you can go on and get crazy on Göerli network doing whatever it is that devs do.While waiting for any seller, you could just try and gather whatever you can from some faucets, here's one (you can claim upto a max of 1.5 GöETH): https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/",
