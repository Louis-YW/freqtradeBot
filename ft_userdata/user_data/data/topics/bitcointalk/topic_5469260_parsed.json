Attending conferences and guiding newcomers I wouldn't do it for privacy, and I don't have a twitter account, but the rest are fine. The only thing is that they will be useful for those who are just starting out, not for those of us who have been on the forum for years.

If you are only interested in bitcoin and don't want to invest in altcoins or new projects, don't go anywhere else but bitcointalk. Here you will find everything about bitcoin that you cannot find anywhere else. Twitter is my favorite place to read daily news but since Elon introduced a policy of writing content to make money, things started to become a mess. People repeat the same content over and over again just to attract more followers for a higher chance of receiving rewards from Elon. There's no denying that it was a pretty good business strategy for Elon to attract more users to Twitter, but it also made things worse in terms of content.",

You can bring a device on which you store small part of your capital, consider it is your hot wallet that you afford to lose it.Attending those events that are surely crowded, will bring risk to lose your devices and even you afford to lose your devices, you have to protect your capital that should be kept at home, not bringing around the street and events.",

Amongall those DCA is one of the best and easy options. I have been doing this and I'm pretty happy with it (thanks to JayJuanGee from WO who introduced DCA to me).

Do not think or wait for maybe a perfect time like when the bitcoin will fall to a low price before you will invest. The more days you wait might be the days you will ever get to meet the price at such low. All the talks about it coming down again are just speculations or predictions that it’s certainty aren’t guaranteed. Invest immediately you have the money and have acquired some essential knowledge, using the DCA method saves one from being hit hard even when the price falls and maximizes profits when it raises.

Just to be sure as to prevent people from following you.https://chainsec.io/wrench-attackA very important advice to anyone but most especially someone in a country in which the government are not too friendly to bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. If you can’t miss this gatherings then be sure to have security etiquettes and never go to places like this and boast about your holdings. Keep them private Quote from: adaseb on October 05, 2023, 04:00:16 AMBitcoin twitter has been awful lately. Sorry to admit it but it got worse after Elon took over. Basically you got nothing but bots posting phishing websites and scams.Since the switch of twitter to Elon the place has become a den of scammers, but why wouldn’t it be when even the tag or blue tick meant for trusted or long term accounts can now easily be bought and be paid for. Now a days I will advice everyone to just treat every information from there with caution and avoid clicking on links, most especially those related to cryptocurrency",

Are you saying this in general, or are you referring to altcoins that are not good to trade?   Be clear first: when you trade altcoins, you won't make money? Are bitcoins and altcoins non-volatile? How can you learn to trade if you avoid trading in altcoins? Do you think you can only learn to trade with Bitcoin?
