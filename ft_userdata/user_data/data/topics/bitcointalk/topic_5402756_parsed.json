Technically,  you have to pay axes when buy services or any other stuff with cryptocurrencies.  If you are verified and identified, the usage of this binance pay can lead to some tax issues in some countries.",

Honestly he have nothing to lose to adopt any hypes in crypto space to his exchange, but what I'm disagree with his move is he only want to take an advantage for him and his exchange e.g. Binance without think the risk of it.They're known as friendly exchange without need to perform KYC, but after SEC investigate his exchange, he forced to ask all clients KYC or his exchanges will be in trouble.DEX is decentralized exchanges and doesn't need to give any personal information, but they're ask user to create accounts, can't use Tor etc that's kill the purpose of DEX.It's more terrible he's creating his own chain and coin that run in centralized way, honestly both BNB and BUSD doesn't have any use cases, the price is just depend on the exchanges reputation. If Binance fall, we will see the another LUNA and UST crash.Before add IDO, DEFI and NFT, honestly he need to think twice since he's high likely will add shitcoins.",

I still remember those times when a lot of people were skeptical and distrustful of the then new exchange, which was manifested in distancing themselves from Binance. Who would have thought that after some time Binance would firmly take a leading position in the industry and begin to expand into new areas. And now a selfish question: if Binance launches its \"tentacles\" farther, does it mean that in the future bnb is waiting for growth and you can invest in it in order to earn money? It seems to me that the potential is very good because of the reliability and prospects.",

Those NFTs that are now actively sold on the market, for the most part, they are not worth their money, well, they are not worth the hundreds and thousands of ETH that they ask for. In general, the price of many NFTs is based on the so-called concept of rarity and popularity, but these are such subjective concepts that people speculate on them. I will not even give a bunch of reports on how NFT schemes were organized on opensea and what these tokens were used for.In its current form, people see in the NFT only a speculative component, they don’t care about the technology itself and the possibilities, that’s why the application of the NFTs themselves is such.It appears that you do not differentiate the NFT market from the concept of a new medium of expression and art appreciation. It is very much similar to those mainstream people who do not differentiate the cryptocoin market from concept of cryptocoins. The market is full of manipulation, wash trading, moneylaundering, however, is a cryptocoin like bitcoin a scam? No it is not but it can be used for moneylaudering, fraud and other crimes.The artists and the collectors will come to the cryptospace even if we do not like this. Similar to many people who discovered a new type of medium of exchange, there will also be many people who will discover this new type of medium of expression. We have not yet witnessed how big the concept of NFT will be. I reckon this is only beginning and this is getting ready for the next bull market. If you are a speculator, start doing your research.

I am quite certain many people who are holders of NFTs will disagree with you.

Everything that you listed did not happen, but is only the fruit of your own expectations and your own vision of this concept. At the moment, 99% of NFT crap is a scam that nobody wants except for a quick profit. At the moment, NFT technology is used only as an attempt to cash in on your digital property, in an attempt to sell as expensive as possible ... and that's it. This is how the NFT industry seems to be and its main platform in 2021, OpenSea, as the personification of everything that the NFT industry is currently, this perfectly confirms.By the way, recently a service was opened for issuing loans against well-known NFTs (Crypto Punks, ape board, etc.) with the possibility of NFT liquidation. This is the true purpose of your art, usury, speculation, margin positions and no self-expression, only business.It appears you are not separating the concept and the market. You can try to consider the medium like how I am trying to. It is a new medium for artists where the can monetize their works through the cryptospace. This will make NFTs the gateway to bitcoin and the whole cryptospace. Also, of course they are only expectations because everything is still very new. However, should we always say something that is not bitcoin as always a failure? There is nothing wrong with unlocking liquidity from property someone owns. It is the same as a person who borrows against a Picasso, a Banksy or his house. The choice is his if he wants to borrow against his NFTs or not and it will be his responsibility if he is liquidated.@Bitcoin_Arena. But did the concept of ICOs, IDOs, IEOs, STOs as a democratized method of funding a project go away? Separate the market from the concept.",

The choice is his if he wants to borrow against his NFTs or not and it will be his responsibility if he is liquidated.What is the use of the concept if almost all the use of cryptocurrencies is reduced to a banal pump-and-dump scheme? This is especially true for the altcoin industry. Bitcoin also has a beautiful concept: a means of payment that cannot be seized or blocked, and which occurs without the participation of third parties. But in reality: bitcoin has become regulated, with the possibility of arrest, blocking, and a large number of bitcoins revolves around third-party services. The overwhelming use of bitcoin is speculative rather than a means of payment. But on the other hand, he has such a concept, different than the market one.Many technologies or individual projects had an interesting concept that would bridge the gap between the crypto industry and everyday life, including various businesses, hobbies, art, cinema, mass media, etc. I do not deny that there have been and will be further attempts to link it. But all these beautiful concepts collide with reality when speculators, participants using borrowed funds, etc. come into the project and begin to parasitize the price of the asset. Until people learn to see cryptocurrency as a technology, and not just a means of earning money, all these beautiful concepts will not get the proper distribution.Is the concept of crypto a pump and dump scheme? You are not separating the market occurrences from the concept. Bitcoin is also a victim of this occurrence. Does everyone really accept that bitcoin's price bubbles are not an effect of speculation and price manipulation? Regulations cannot fix this, look at Wall Street. We should accept this reality that people will always buy on speculation.I reckon that we might have different attitudes on the concept of NFT and ICO because I accept that from this, market speculation will always exist and scams will always be created. However, I do not consider that everything that is not bitcoin is a scam.",

Bitcoin and the cryptospace would be shutdown if they can do anything.Are there examples of recent trends that are following their concept at the moment, or at least getting close to it?Recall the most striking trends over the past 2 years:- DeFi, the concept is decentralization. In fact, many projects are centralized and tokens are reduced to a pump & dump scheme.- Play-2-Earn, the concept is to combine gaming and cryptocurrencies. In fact, projects are not considered as a game, but as a means of earning money, where users come to work, to earn money. Most users are not talking about any investment or reinvestment in the game.- Move-2-Earn, the concept is to combine sports and cryptocurrencies. In fact, the problem is the same as in Play-2-Earn.- NFT, the concept is to combine art and cryptocurrencies, tokenization of art objects, collectibles, etc. In fact, the industry is not flooded with art objects, in its tokenized form, but with various digital garbage, the purpose of which is speculation and money laundering.That's the whole point of these concepts, which so far only work on paper.I do not disagree with much of your reply. Also you are correct in saying that much of the projects from the concepts have only worked on paper. However, the argument is the same. The concepts are good and they will not die because the cryptospace needs the products, the services and the solutions from those concepts.  There are some comments in your reply that can also be used against bitcoin. Bitcoin can also be used for speculation, moneylaundering and many other crimes. From the point of view of some people, bitcoin is a ponzi scheme because it is an asset that produces no financial value for the owner. I have also seen some arguments that bitcoin's development is centralized to the lead maintainer in Github. They can argue about anything but our argument is the same. The concept is good and implementations should be created.",
