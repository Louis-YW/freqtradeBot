And if the test comes, there must be a lesson too, which is to be patient.And what I always remember, when we experience difficulties there must be happiness. So, what we need to improve is struggle, patience, and gratitude.",

It's about responsibility. Of course people can get more good things that they \"deserve\" without doing any work for it, but that's also a matter of perspective. Some people appreciate those things as good things and some take them for granted. So they don't even realize what they are getting for free.But if you want some specific new things in your life, without any plan those wants will be just dreams. With a plan (work), they can become reality.",

Even generational wealth that had been past down to a more recent family was hard earned through forefathers and what have you.Good things are always hard to come by so when it comes, you learn to value it, safe guard it and hope not to waste all efforts in your time.Everyone is out here seeking better and hopes to pass better down to there later generations too. It never meant no one didn't work for it.",

How did you think you will use that money? I believe you will be thinking of using it without a proper plan. So If anything good comes your way in a very easy way without you stressing yourself, believe me you are going to misuse that thing you won't use it in such a manner way. However, if you go through hardship before obtaining something, you should always keep in mind that what you experienced was likely similar to the stress of finishing school before landing a job and beginning to earn a salary. In this case, I believe the first thought that comes to mind is to make plans for how you will spend your salary wisely in light of your academic experiences.",

A worthwhile goal usually requires devotion, effort, and perseverance. We often grow, learn, and ultimately achieve goals by overcoming obstacles and disappointments. The road to success is rarely easy, and the hardships we face along the way make the accomplishments all the more satisfying.

The statement is true no need to doubt again because almost everyone in life have come across certain challenges in one way or the other but your ability to endure and continue working hard remains the only way you can come out with a good result.

It reminds us not to cut corners or follow illegal shortcuts to pursue our desires. You don't need to doubt the truth in this statement because it is the truth. I know many people are making money or getting success by not putting in any effort because they can manipulate the system and achieve their aims. Most investors or businesses men failed so many times but they kept on working until they achieved success. If you start doubting this statement it might lead to laziness and the pursuit of illegal wealth. I know it is very discouraging to see people that don't work as hard as you do getting more results than you do. But you don't have to give up because nothing good comes easy. If you want to have success, them you must work hard.",
