This may be detrimental to you if you receive payments in the form of BTC. BTC is very volatile, maybe you need help from a third party as a service that converts BTC to USD.However, if you really intend to accept BTC in full as an investment goal, that's no problem, the decision is all in your hands. Bitcoin is indeed feasible if used as a long-term investment. Even though the price falls, Bitcoin is also able to rise again and sometimes exceeds the initial price we bought BTC.",

Bitcoin is a good means of investment but it has a higher risk, just like other investments. As you already know, it still depends on how you go about your investment plans and how you think Bitcoin will be of good service to your business.Bitcoin knowledge is good and you still have to practice what you have learned so far. There are different ways to practice the knowledge of Bitcoin. As you mentioned already, you can still practice it by using it in your small business and also as an investment.",

You need to maintain and invest an amount which you are comfortable losing and then, you will never have to worry about the risks involved as Bitcoin will never be at these prices again.  what if one is not a salary earner ?@Peter faith, I would like to tell you that, it doesn't matter whether you are a monthly salary earner or not, all you just need is any good means that could provide money for you on a daily, weekly or even monthly, but if you don't have any anything that would put funds, on your pocket then forget about it, you can't invest in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter if you are not getting funds monthly, like you said earlier, that you have a business which you are doing so far, and I believe businesses give little money daily even in a week (although it depends on the type of business), if the business is a good one, it can provide money for you, it is just for you to think on the amount that you could invest into Bitcoin that will not affect you after everything.Investing is one of the most important things, but during the process of holding, you don't need to be in a rush. If you can only afford $5 weekly from your business after all expenses, it's good to invest with it, but lastly, I would like to say never invest with emergency funds, without you having emergency funds you can't hold for long.",

If yes, then you need to set aside some money for that because accepting Bitcoin payments is the same as spreading some good news to encourage people to adopt Bitcoin, but if you keep withdrawing the Bitcoin to run your business, then it is not called a Bitcoin investment.",

You have a chance to earn more if you accept payment using Bitcoin while the price keep pumping hard during bullrun and vice versa whenever Bitcoin is on bear market.I believe you already grasp the general idea on how Bitcoin investment work when you said holding Bitcoin till dear life. Bitcoin is good for long term investment so if you have enough funds to cover those profit that enter through Bitcoin payment then you will have never problem on accepting Bitcoin because the price always bounce back every cycle.",

You can also use Bitcoin for value exchange as part of your trade with another trade partner, you can use it for trading on exchanges. You can gamble by using Bitcoin as a collateral for your leverage, futures trading but I don't recommend it.

It will not be strong against financial issues and if you accept Bitcoin in your business, your business fund can be changed a lot in value with Bitcoin high volatility.You must think about it and must have another reserve for your business, best in cash.
