Without log, it shows there is a lot of gap to be filled however on log chart, the price is at the resistance.",

Fair oneÂ  Personally I don't use linear anymore, only log. As you pointed out the trend-lines are very different between the two, and over time I found that log trend-lines to be more reliable (even if the linear are still relevant), probably because Bitcoin moves in a more logarithmic manner than linear. That said, for shorter time-frames I can understand using linear. The RSI otherwise looks interesting right now.",
