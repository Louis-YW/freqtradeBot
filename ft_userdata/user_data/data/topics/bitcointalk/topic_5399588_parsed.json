Teh beauty of using bisq is that the govt does not know if you bought or sold BTC!however if your yearly tx goes above 10 lakh  then IT dept might send notice asking you how you got so much money from whom and the reason.ps: to be more secure connect bisq with your bitcoin core software.never sell BTC and hodl as in 10 years 1 btc might go million dollars.",

Real-time transaction and I can come down to a mutually agreed place. I can pay in any of the cryptos that the trader wants - can take the amount in UPI.Looking for trustworthy folks - having a +ve trust score helps.On the conversion rates: I will give a discount of 1% on the INR/USDT/other crypto priced from the last transaction on WazirX/CoinDCX.May I know why aren't you left with any other option? We have localbitcoins or Bisq available for p2p trading. You can also use Wazirx to convert your bitcoins to INR. You can use Coinswitch to sell your coins etc. You have multiple options available. So it's really important to know why aren't you left with any other options? It's extremely difficult to make someone interested into meet and trade. Localbitcoins had such functionality available but now they have stopped.",

I mean they have Bitcoin to INR transaction available, wherein there isn't a single transaction happening as most indian crypto community is still going for the government control exchange. I would not blame them as Bisq desktop app struggle to get connected and then if it does get connected you need to follow a hell of procedures.
