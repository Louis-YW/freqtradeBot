Were can I still find trustable BTC marketplaces which also work with other currencies?It's best to use decentralized exchange Bisq (install it on your computer) for trading Bitcoin with fiat currencies and few main altcoins.If you want to use something with similar style like Localbitcoins/Paxful, you can try using Agora Desk or LocalMonero.One more interesting option for p2p trading without kyc on mobile devices is called Peach Bitcoin, and I wrote about it before:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444162.0https://peachbitcoin.com/PSI am not supporting any services I mentioned above.Do your own research.",

The real p2p is peer to peer with no middle man.But these innovation of p2p makes safer transaction since there's an escrow to both funds, to avoid scam.I think this is a good idea for p2p to have a middle man due to the emerging scams, because it's hard to trust a person who's not reputable.",

Another frustrating thing about this centralized exchanges is the lack of ability to cancel an initiated transaction when a buyer/seller is not available. Overall as the centralized exchanges continues to face regulatory challenges in most countries one just needs to trade more on decentralized exchanges",

Bitcoins is a peer to peer network with no middle man. Would it be \"safer\" if it has a middle man? The middleman you think will secure your funds will instead be the one to scam you.This is the same idea that should be pushed to p2p exchanges. No middle man needed and one just be very careful with their assets, and they will never be scammed.",

However it would be a detrimental trap if interested in using it. As in other scammer attacks that provide a new link exchange that doesn't even have any activity and is required to make a deposit. It would be a little ridiculous to believe it. Be more vigilant because scammers will be present anywhere.",
