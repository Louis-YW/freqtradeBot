I see you came in prepared with a copper member account, which will enable you to post images.I don't see an ANN thread with a self-moderated topic as a good one, as this can create room for the deletion of a few reviews that might not be in agreement with what you offer on anything of the sort. I have a few questions regarding:1. BM token: Will this BM token be used as demo money, which anyone who wants to try out the casino without making any deposit can use to test through the platform? As I see from your details, they can't be withdrawn or exchanged in the open market. If they can't be traded and withdrawn, why offer to buy them on the platform? Or I misunderstood the statement.2. KYC: I notice your casino is KYC enabled. I don't know how many people like to play in a casino that asks for KYC nowadays, as there are many other options out there with less of such an offer. I want to ask about KYC: is it also a mandatory thing for everyone, or does one need to reach a certain level before it becomes mandatory?3. I registered with a random email I picked from the forum, and I noticed the account just logged in without them even asking for an email code to confirm if the email was valid or not. Was it meant to be so? If yes, then why the email?Typed this earlier before you locked your first thread, I’m glad this one is no longer self moderated..",

It’s actually good to see another site who are serious in operating their casinos. Though some concern are being raised about the KYC but upon registration it is not being asked, is KYC mandatory or level 1 KYC is fine?  The site looks interesting for me, do you have any plan to have a marketing campaign as well?",

Was it meant to be so? If yes, then why the email?Typed this earlier before you locked your first thread, I’m glad this one is no longer self moderated..Hello, I am a beginner in the bitcointalk forum, the first topic was opened with self moderated (in my head it means that if I opened the topic I must also be a moderator ), I was helped and guided by a member whom I want to thank.Now let's move on to your questions:1. BM (Bonus Money) is play money, however I wanted there to be a value for this currency and then I implemented this option to unlock CPC (Cryptoplay Coin is our internal currency that has no restrictions and can be exchanged for any other currency). The idea of the BM Store came to me after I received many requests for BM and exchange offers from players.2. At Cryptoplay KYC is not mandatory. We use it very rarely, in 3 years at most 7-10 times we have asked some users for KYC. The reasons why we ask expressly and in writing from some users are multiple accounts. So fair players will never have a KYC request from us. All games are created by us and we are not forced by providers to ask for KYC. This is the purpose of cryptocurrencies, the anonymity they offer, and in this case I want to continue with anonymity.3. To confirm the email, you must access your profile and ask for confirmation, at that moment you will receive an email to confirm your email. Confirming the email helps later in case you have connection problems (forgot the password, forgot the username or even reset 2FA). I recommend that all security methods be updated, namely: a strong password, confirmed email and 2FA activated. Every time you log in to your Cryptoplay account, you will receive an email stating that a new log in has taken place on your account.",

But looking at their promotion of race and rise to riches, the wagered amount of the top 20 players is quite huge already starting from $675,883 at the moment. It means, they already got some high rollers out there. And if I may add in their FAQ section, if they can also add the minimum deposit per currency so potential users can already see how much they need to deposit before they can play on this site.",

For every 1000 BM wager, you will get 1 CPC which is equal to $1 real money if I understand it correctly based on what I read in the OP and the available information in the website. What attracts me here is the Jackpot, as it seems to be easy compared to other jackpot system since the requirement is just to have bet ID ended with 777 or 77 (10%) but of course the bet amount does also matter, the bigger the bet amount = bigger jackpot to win. Edit: Ah I missed the part about the jackpot, as there is also need to hit the jackpot number 777. So it is combination between hitting number and bet ID.",
