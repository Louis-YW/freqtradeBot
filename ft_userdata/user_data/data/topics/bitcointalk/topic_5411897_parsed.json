One thing strikes my mind again, bear market don't stay for long, highest is 2 years, so what is the right state of mind for you. I have told several times my story of 2018-2019 here.Back then coins crashed really big while I had the rigs built with the Rx 580 cards in late 2016 early 2017.At that time most people decided to turn off or liquidate completely their rigs.I choose another route,I thought to myself since I am always a believer in new ATH (all time high) of prices of crypto to keep mining even at big loss because of my energy costs.I kept doing so until late 2019 when I turned off the rigs that through Nicehash had made me a nice amount of Bitcoin and was just following the news as always.At February 2021 when the price hit near 60.000 for a Bitcoin I sold most of them,build a new powerful rig I still have now and got some nice amount of money for myself.I continue mining even in the bear market again,not yet at a loss but even if I will be with price increase of energy in October most likely I will continue mining.The conclusion is that is better to keep mining rather than buying coins,as buying coins will not keep you as busy as mining so you may do some wrong moves that you normally don't when you are getting small amount of your favorite cryptos through mining.",

      "body": "Mining is like killing two birds with one stone, you don't need to sell whatever coin you mining, just hold and it's same thing as buying altcoins with money and with mining you still have your rig in tact, it's wiser to keep your rig and use that to keep accumulating coins.",

If you do not need money, if the mining farm does not cause problems and you can pay for electricity without problems for your budget, then continue to mine cryptocurrencies.I advise selling a mining farm when for the money that you spend paying for electricity, you can buy more coins than your farm mines.",

We are in the accumulation phase so you should be accumulating Bitcoin.  It's likely that prices will trend down for another few months, so don't go betting with leverage or selling your personal items just yet...  We're closer to the bottom than the top though.  Mining is a great way to dollar cost average so just stick with it and when we hit new highs you'll be glad that you did.",

I have a lot of gear hundreds of cards, but I am paid off. I will mine at break even or I will shut gear down and wait for action to get better.I may even buy gear if it drops lower.And of course Mr V.B. Has about 11 days to blink and delay the diff bomb for 300,000 more blocks about 100 days or so.",
