  "content": "So, most of you here might have heard of this company (at least in the last 24 hours) but for those who didn't, here are a few links to check[1][2][3]. In short, this platform will allow its users to buy/sell information about a wallet's owner.From my understanding, say for example you got your funds stolen, you can use this platform to post a bounty so people could help you track down the hacker's identity for a fee. I guess we think of it as peer to peer version for ChainAnalysis.It's still unclear to me how everything works, and how data is verified but I would like to hear your thoughts about this, and the potential good (and harm) that this might cause.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/10/arkham-intelligence-rolls-out-crypto-data-marketplace-privacy-advocates-cry-foul/[2] https://decrypt.co/147920/crypto-twitter-reacts-arkhams-new-dox-earn-intelligence-exchange[3] https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1678339355314900992",

Northowl!I'm trolling a bit but that's exactly what Arkkham wants to do. Look at their own words: \"We believe that deanonymization is destiny in crypto markets\". We, here, are preaching anonymization every day LOL. It's the total opposite of what we're looking to build.edit: exactly this, a “dox-to-earn program”Quotethe phrase “dox-to-earn program” to describe Arkham’s new oddity. Other features we're adding to our dox-to-earn program soon:- Wallet owner physical address- Telephone number, email- Social security number- Family background, children's kindergarten location and many other identifying information!All in a single app! https://t.co/9IgptuNpRv pic.twitter.com/Fbg6S8QJBV— Capoordart (@poordart) July 10, 2023",

After all Bitcoin maximalist can't accept that because they always verify and never trust anyone.There were few projects in the past has similar work, but I forget about the project.",

I don't even understand how a marketplace like this is legally allowed. If an open marketplace like Silk Road is taken down, why would a marketplace that is intentionally designed for people to sell and buy personal information be allowed? Is this not obviously an outright threat to the people's right to privacy?It's also misleading for Arkham to call these analysts on-chain analysts when intel bounties could actually be offered for certain data like names and addresses.",

I mean if they sell basically data so they can sell it to bad people to right that using their data for criminal or something else right?and how data is verified I mean from where they gather all pieces of informationEverythings seems little blurry for now I will keep my eye on this",

I don't think anyone can easily figure out real people's names just from wallet addresses unless the user posts their details publicly on social media or something else. At the end of the day though this service is going to cause so many troubles and privacy issues regardless of how the company spins its articles.",
