Never at all was I saying scalping is a useless trading strategy and my post was nothing of such too. My post was an advise to focus more on few trades so that it could easily and closely monitored for higher chances of winning as against cluster of trades that are difficult to follow up and monitored. Trading manually however if you have multiple trades on a volatile trade, it is difficult to check all in few moment. Myself I have realized this and giving it as advise. Scalping obviously is a wonderful trading strategy buddy   And for example If a trader is not originally a scalper but enters a trade (like a ship) that he saw it was going to hit the iceberg, he diverts or stop the trade before it gets there, then he has scalped to safe the ugly situation of total loss.",

If all the problem lies not in the programming or speed of the bots as much as applying the correct strategy and it is the mind that makes trading bots give great results.So focus on learning trading strategies and you will find a lot of good open source bots that will work with you.",

I don't understand bot trading so I don't encourage anyone for that. Also, I don't think small traders like me need to use trading bots anyway. Rather than we should learn more. Keep in mind you are going to connect exchange API with the bots, so there is a potential risk. Don't pay with that you aren't familiar with.",

Some tend to become unprofitable with something as small as a change in trend. Basically, there hasn't been a single bot at least something I have found which is robust enough to serve you as a good trader so that at least your screen time can be reduced.",

I see that you are experienced and that is why you open so much trades.

Bots can go wrong if not properly adjusted and you lose all you have if you fail in it. I have heard instance of such happening to an account where it was using bots but unfortunately the bots traded against the trader and it was gone. Using bots requires a lot of care.",

It is good to use when you are just doing ordinary buying and selling with minute profits but in a consistent and quick manner. You know that we can not always be available to check charts and trade the market as fast as possible but the use of crypto bit really helps a lot but it is only meant for the spot market. It has disadvantages too of you not making consistent profits if the market is stagnant. You can't make profits when the market is stagnant and in a case off bear market, one could have loses if you sell your holdings.",

One of the best well-known bots is  [GUNBOT] Trading Bot with 136 exchanges available!!!. I'm almost tempted to buy it before, but I decided not to. Anyhow, just remember that all the parameters is still going to be set by you, so if you don't have experience in trading then for sure you might lose money. So they are not a guarantee for a passive income as you might think of, just saying.",
