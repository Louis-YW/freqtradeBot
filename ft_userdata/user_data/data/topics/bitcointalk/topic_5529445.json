Many softwares most likely already allow people to make blockchains and all things required to make a cryptocurrency of their own. But AI doesn’t dictate which one would be valuable to the public. We do. People might not be as trusting and open to switching from bitcoin to whatever AI can come up with despite features that could potentially be better than bitcoin’s.",

I mean, what kind of threat are you referring to? Because if it's just about the coding aspects, by developing a new project that can be superior to Bitcoin, nothing like that will happen. It took many years for Bitcoin to grow to the length in which it is right now, people keep buying Bitcoin every year and the growth is continuous.There's no AI that will just code a coin today and you expect people to starting buying the coin, then the coin starts to grow rapidly. It will not happen like that, but if peradventure this your assumption come to light, the coin will not be superior to Bitcoin because before it will want to get to the value at which Bitcoin have attained now, Bitcoin will be far higher than what it is as of today. Take for example Ethereum, why has it not even cross $10k? Despite all the bull Run of Bitcoin?",

Bitcoin will still reign supreme because of it's history as well as been the face of the market. The only way another can replace Bitcoin is if Bitcoin fails And even if Bitcoin does fail and get compromised Who would trust any cryptocurrency again? In summary, Bitcoin success has gone past its current Technology.It has become more of a concept of Decentralization and been the First.",

A centralised company controls each of those AIs that are trending. Some might redevelop themselves and advance in whatever way they can, but that does not mean there won't be a way for it to be controlled, so even if they can develop and create a blockchain, which might appear superior based on its features, it will be hard for a centralised tool to create something that it itself won't have control over. Bitcoin censorship resistance alone is enough to defeat the development.",

Bitcoin is valuable because it is independent safe and open and AI can actually make it better. For example AI can help make Bitcoin mining process more efficient or make wallets more secure or even predict what will happen in market. However it is unlikely that AI will create better cryptocurrency not like Bitcoin but little better than others because value of cryptocurrency comes from its community and how widely it is used and how useful it is in real world. AI might create new cryptocurrencies but it is not clear if they will be better than Bitcoin existing system.",

If some parts remove work force, the it opens another opportunity to others. This kind of cycle already exists in the past years, people invent something that doesn’t require some jobs but open to some cool opportunities. The tip here is to get updated too like AI, improve your skills because we’re still the one who’ll lead in this world.Regarding to your question, I don’t think AI will be a threat to bitcoin. Bitcoin built trust to everyone and it take years before it happened, the foundation of bitcoin is solid as of today. Like what I’ve said,If you didn’t improve AI will replace you but Bitcoin has something that can’t be replaced, which is us, the people who holds the powerpf bitcoin.",

There are many developers who are focusing on the negative things that artificial intelligence can help them achieve instead of focusing on promoting the good and better use of artificial intelligence. If I could think about it, it is also possible that a criminal somewhere is already thinking about it and working towards developing an artificial intelligence that can help them achieve this.",

Even if it code superior to Bitcoin, the only way for it to overcome Bitcoin is to have consensus or support of the majority. But even which such good alts coins that we have, still there's no one to beat Bitcoin even if others call it old and traditional and can't evolved.So just because of AI becoming very popular right now will it mean that it will challenge Bitcoin. I think investors are smarter than that. And Bitcoin becoming the first crypto that really pave the way for others, that's already a very hard thing to topple and I do not see any altcoins that can do it today or in the near future.",
