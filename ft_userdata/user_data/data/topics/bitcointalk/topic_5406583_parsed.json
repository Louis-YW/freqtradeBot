  "content": "Mugle Fact Sheet:Mugle empowers anyone to transact or save modern money without the fear of external control or oppression. Mugle hopes that everyone can use it anywhere, regardless of national boundaries, cultures, skills or access.Mugle is committed to providing privacy, lightweight, scalable cryptocurrency, which has several unique attributes: using a blockchain format called mimblewimble privacy protection; Only a small amount of data is stored in the blockchain, and it is cheap and easy to run a complete node; Mimblewimble was developed by anonymous people, and the team is distributed all over the world; There is no pre excavation POW mechanism, which is more equal and decentralized.Mugle is a community driven project without ICO or pre excavation. The block rule is constant: one block is produced every minute, and each block is rewarded with 60000 tokens. So mugle is an inflationary currency, but its inflation rate will gradually decrease over time, and finally tend to 0.Mugle project is committed to the lightweight and fast synchronization of node data, as well as to solve the problem of excessive data volume and long synchronization time in digital currency projects.MUGLE forked from the Grin code base, and modifications to the supply function.Mugle specs- Algorithm: Cuckoo Cycle PoW https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle/blob/master/doc/pow/pow.md- Block Time: 1 minute- Block Reward: 60000 MUGLE- Block Reward halving schedule: none- Total Coin Supply: infinite- Pre-mine: No- Founders Reward: No- ICO: No- Masternodes: NoMugle background- Website https://mugle.org/- Github - Node  https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle/releases- Wallet https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle-wallet/releases- Miner  https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle-miner/releases- GUI Wallet  https://github.com/muglefans/Thestral/releases- Wiki    https://mugle.org/docs/wiki/table-of-contents/- Twitter https://twitter.com/MugleOrgHow to join1.Install and setup keybase.2.Join the grin community:  From the app: Select “Teams” » “Join a team” and then type “muglecoin”  From the command line: keybase team request-access muglecoin",
