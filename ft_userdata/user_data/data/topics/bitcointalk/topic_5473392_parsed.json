Does this signify the return of a bullish trend?Nope we are still far from bullish trends and we still have 6 months plus waiting time for that to happen,  Gamefi token may have increased in popularity lately,  but then also we have to know and take into account what the possibility for the success of the token class,  what awaits them in the market and how have those project in it class who have existed before have operated and succeeded in the market. Much more than this also,  we have to avoid associating every trend with a mean bullish tendency,  because doing so could lead to wrong investment decisions, especially for newbies who may nohaverd any experience with such possible market trends and what are their resultant outcomes.",

It’s a decentralized games where they have their own token that you can use on their platform, its like a play to earn games, to further know more about those projects better have your own research about it. Anyway, some GameFi projects are really following the current trend but it’s too early to say that it is a bullish trend so better to wait for other confirmation if you are planning to invest or to take profit already.",

Does this signify the return of a bullish trend?Have you chosen from your favorite gamefi tokens? or have you been saving from a while ago? the altcoin market is still going its own way and I don't see any bullish trend yet, indeed the price swing makes me think so too, but the recent bull run indicates that altcoins are playing a role from several distributions including airdrops still running, allowing people to get gamefi tokens and can exchange them for any token including other favorite gamefi.Right now what we need to pay attention to is how we allocate to add to the portfolio either daily or weekly, major tokens are already on the pump and we can add to the game fi token lineup if you have your favorite gamefi tokens before.And I think sales and rankings are good, and volume is also a strong turnover.But if there is a new gamefi and you intend to buy, you can read this first before deciding, because DWYOR's new project. and possibilities can happen, not all projects go the same.",

Does this signify the return of a bullish trend?Hmm I see that most of them are up the last 7 days, some even going up as high as 25%. I'm not familiar with the current events of GameFi though so it might just be a bull because of some sort of event/update/change that the game themselves have made, or something changed within the ecosystem. I don't think we're at anything significant though, and most especially not a buy-in phase since you'd most likely lose out buying tokens after a small pump. You can probably short them though if you want. I don't think it's a bullish trend though, at least not now anyway.",

Where you can play games to earn rewards that could be converted to real money? If you have, play2earn uses the GameFI technology. With GameFI, players can earn by joining different game activities like tournaments, winning battles, completing some tasks, and even collecting some rare items (that can also be traded for an in-game item or sold). And all of this is done by smart contract so it is transparent and safe. You can simply say GameFI is the combination of gaming and finance.",

It's an layer 2 ecosystem build for Gods unchained because at the time it didn't make any sense doing small transactions in ETH, as fees costed more then most nfts. This tech was surpassed by many others, so imx was quickly outdated tech.IMXHere's their in-game reward token GODSHere's axie infinity, one of the most famous gamefi tokensDo they still look like they are recovering from here?",

Does this signify the return of a bullish trend?I won't call it a definite bull market for gamefi tokens now but the current uptrend is welcomed . The main reason I'm not convinced is because there have been pumps across the board (across different industries) so it's definitely not a case of just GameFi tokens. I'm keeping an eye on tokens such as Sandbox and others to possibly scoup some before we have a full-fledged bull run in the coming months.PS: if anyone has any more gamefi tokens on their radar or in their bags, please share.",

Actually, I think this is always a potential field, when looking at MC around 11b is still a quite modest number, although these statistics do not represent it completely.We still need more quality appearances, and as well as time for the harmony between the ideas from developers and users to adapt to it, the current model does not have too many products worth trying.",

These games Ive mentioned are on different chains and we cant have solidarity yet if the p2e games are totally back on track. A few months ago, the GameFi sector was experiencing a bit of a downturn, so it's encouraging to see increased activity now. Even affiliated alts like MANA and SAND have been showing positive signs. Shrap made waves in the GameFi world yesterday when it made its debut on platforms like KuCoin, Bitget etc. The latter even introduced airdrops for users. I would say it's a promising start for GameFi in the months to come.\"",

So time to keep your eyes open for the newcomers Usually we have seen the same narrative trend the second time in the alt season. Always few narratives came forwards and investors moved on to the next one. Last bull season gamefi was trending heavily and we have seen projects like axis infinity and few others show significant growth in price. So I don't think this time GameFI narratives will be trending at least not with the same business model they were using in the last season.Though I have seen there is lot of development going on in the GameFi sector but its growth potential in the altseason is average. We have other new narratives that the investors are focusing on like RWA, Web3 and AI.",

There are Gamfi projects that has play to earn games we can always play and earn tokens we can with and swap to any other coin that we are interested in depending on the chain the project is built on. Since the network fee of BSC projects are less compare to erc20, I prefer flexibility so it can reduce how much I would be spend send coins to play project games.",
