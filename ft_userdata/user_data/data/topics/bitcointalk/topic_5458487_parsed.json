Well, I'm not certain but I think that should be my thread and here is the link for all those  who missed and might still want to have a look.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on July 03, 2023, 11:09:44 PMWe all know that the \"youth are the hope of our Country\", this is what Jose Rizal said, known as a national hero in the Philippines before he died.I guess this post is basically directed  to Philippines and I also agree with the fact that kids are the hope of a country(maybe Philippines and every country that is supposed to be normal bjt not my country) I also don't mean any disrespect  to my country mean and women over here but I don't think the kids are the hope of my country because they are deprived alot, and most of them are forced into drugs taking and some unpleasant lifestyles.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on July 03, 2023, 11:09:44 PMSo if we relate this with Bitcoin, kids has a lot of time, strength and potentials than Seniors, and I think most of you agree with that. I don't agree with that and firstly, stop relating what your hero said to bitcoin  and let's handle bitcoin  as bitcoin  considering its volatility  and high mental work required.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on July 03, 2023, 11:09:44 PMHowever, we shouldn't force our kids to learn Bitcoin if they're not willing, we have to wait patiently for the right time. Well this already makes an affirmation to your support on my opinion. I have no issues with parents introducing bitcoin  to their kids possibly in a more friendly and comic manner there by increasing their curiosity to wanting to learn about it and not making it seem they're trying to use their children to make corrections to mistakes they .are not to have accepted bitcoin  when the price was nothing and that was where my interest was.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on July 03, 2023, 11:09:44 PMDo you agree that kids is the future of Bitcoin than with seniors?I don't agree that kids are the futurenof bitcoin  and when talking about kids, I mean children from the age of 13 and below.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on July 03, 2023, 11:09:44 PMAnd which of them will contribute the most?Seniors and I mean the vibrant and intellectual ones.",

They are fuel for development, adoption and evolution in the world.The most painful conflicts among the old and young generations are their different world-views and it is difficult for them to understand each other. However if your are parents and already know about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, you can teach your children about it. They will be able to absorb such news knowledge, technology very well. Children are very adaptive to learn new things and practice new things.Like the elderly can feel hard to learn using Youtube but children can learn and practice it quickly.",

But I guess what's important here is this senior is going to teach their knowledge to their kids, not necessarily kids but maybe if they are already a youth, it is probably the right timing to teach them about finances like saving and investing, maybe if they are a teenager you could teach them saving and investing and then when they rich college you could start teaching them about cryptocurrency and them Bitcoin what is it and why they should start investing on it.There are a lot of new ways hacker tries just to scam people and there are times that even experience trader falls into the traps of this hacker but it is most likely that newbie investors become the victim of these hacks because they don't have enough experience with these things.",

But we can be evaluating the many things that younger people - I guess those belonging below 30. Being technology-driven, younger people has a big space in cryptocurrency and in fact we have many famous personalities who made their mark in crypto while still young though we should not also discount what older people contributed along the way. As of now, we can promote the education of cryptocurrency and the importance of this into their future as the world is really changing in  a fast-paced nature. I am sure that the future of today's children will be so radical or different than what we 'seniors\" had. Right now is the right time to prepare them to be tough and be resilient and never be feeling \"privileged\" so they can survive the nastiness of this world.",

Once someone isn’t into these technologies then the idea of bitcoin becomes wouldn’t sit with them. Bitcoin no matter how easy it seems needs these knowledge for either daily transactions or even how to secure the funds. QuoteYou simply don't expect majority of the older generation to buy bitcoin, unless fiat currencies get screwed in the next decade and bitcoin goes supercycle.Second again, because the older generations already have the narratives that anything that actually promises return on the internet without having a physical entity then such thing is branded a Ponzi scheme. And the continuous rate of which Alticoins crashes or the number wallet hacks will certainly discourage them. The only way that the older generations could pick massive interest in bitcoin is when the government comes out fully to support it because these people without government support bitcoin has no future. Also the stereotype spread around bitcoin if it continues certainly reduce there numbers",

Seniors are once their target due to their lack of knowledge & understanding of cryptocurrencies. Seniors usually see Bitcoin as an easy way to multiply their wealth and the scammers find them easy to convince with the pretext of investment. As investing might not be that easy to understand for many seniors in the era of Bitcoin. I am against forcing children to learn about Bitcoin, In my country few particular states have already incorporated Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the school syllabus of children. Now it would depend on them whether these children in the future would like to implement those learning in their regular life.",

However, we shouldn't force our kids to learn Bitcoin if they're not willing, we have to wait patiently for the right time.  Talking about children people generally think about their maturity in being responsible and this category is generally not yet formed in children, because it might talk about an immature age for the responsibilities they must have. Children do not need to be limited in learning something they want or something we want to introduce because their memory is still strong and it is very easy to teach something new. There is no compulsion in terms of investing or getting to know bitcoin because children do not yet have the responsibility to make money.But it's best to provide direction and understanding little by little for them, so they have an interest in learning first.

It's because they have the brightest minds that can invent things, build businesses that can help the country, and have out-of-this-world ideas that the older ones don't have.
