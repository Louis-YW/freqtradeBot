Is this what you are talking about? It seems a kind of hardware wallet same as Leger, Trezor?PS: You still got an animated avatar. Just a heads up, if you change it then you will never have this type of animated avatar again.",

I don't intend to change the avatar.QuoteLedger research team had spent times on Ellipal Titan wallet and was able to break their security. (https://donjon.ledger.com/Ellipal-Security/) This doesn't seem good though I haven't found if they had solve that issue. That's very informative. I think they've improved the security on the new Titan wallet.",

This doesn't seem good though I haven't found if they had solve that issue.Thanks for sharing.Ledger even won a bihnty from their bug bounty program. The vulnerabilities were fixed:Quotehttps://blog.ledger.com/Ellipal-Security this kind of device, the security can be guaranteed only if:    The software running is genuine: very difficult to guarantee this on a Android phone)    The software is well written and flawless: We hope, we could help for this    The attacker has no physical access to the device - or a very strong passwordConsequently, the security model of the device is very similar to the Bitfi wallet one.Anyway, I wouldn't risk my coins in such device as it doesn't look as safe as a ledger.",

The Ellipal wallet was just the board from an Android mobile phone with a new case on it. It still had all the same capabilities as an Android phone, including WiFi and booting to a factory testing mode, that were simply soft locked by the software and trivially re-enabled. Ledger were able to connect up a USB port without issue, access the bootloader, and dump the private keys, which is a very basic attack.They were essentially marketing a mobile phone on flight mode as a hardware wallet. This is incredible amateurish, if not borderline scammy, and is enough to mean I will never touch one of their devices, even if they say they have improved on all these things. Also, it is closed source.",

Also, it is closed source.Yeah, they pretty much ruined their reputation with this amateur move, but they can always try to improve in future.However, I don't see anything special with this new Ellipal Mini version, and it's part of my list of wallet manufacturers to be avoided, along with Safepal that is also coming from China.",
