How does that work?Isn't this like giving your customers a false sense of privacy, but then at one point you hijack their transactions and ask them to send the documents and data they thought they would never need to send to you?Also, who determines a link to criminal activity?I receive my ETH from Uniswap after a trade and send the funds through your service to get Bitcoins and hold my funds citing suspicious activity which I have no idea about. Does that make me criminal in your terms?QuoteAML Procedure4.1.To make an Exchange in the Service, the User does not have to register or log in to the Service system and provide personal data. However, when the User sends funds that are clearly related to criminal activity, the User's Order may be suspended in order to request details about the origin of the funds sent until the requested information is provided.4.2.SecureShift may determine a direct link to criminal activity based on information from business partners, public sources, victim complaints against SecureShift, and law enforcement requests.4.3.SecureShift reserves the right not to disclose the source of information about the connection of funds sent by the User with criminal activity.4.4.By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction you sent can be verified using the security system of the Service.4.5.By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree to provide full details of the origin of the funds sent by you and confirm the honesty and legality of the receipt of these funds upon suspension of the Order and the corresponding request by SecureShift.4.6.By accepting these Terms, you agree and warrant that true, accurate, current and complete information about the origin of funds sent is provided and you take full responsibility for its accuracy, completeness and reliability.4.7.The data must be provided directly by the sender of funds under the Order.4.8.If you refuse to provide data about the origin of the funds sent or provide false data, and if the data you provide confirms your connection to criminal activity, SecureShift has the right to freeze the funds for the subsequent return of funds to the victims with the assistance of law enforcement agencies.4.9.In some cases, when for objective reasons the User cannot provide sufficient evidence of the source of the funds received, as well as in the case of a personal acquaintance of the sender with the alleged criminal who sent the funds to the User, as an exception, the User may be asked to undergo identity verification.",

Does that make me criminal in your terms?Surely you know that these new platforms are trying to lure users through fake promises that they maintain complete privacy for use and that they will not ask for any data as if they are a fully decentralized platform. At the same time, they are keen to include the conditions for verifying identity in the TOS to justify any move against any of the activities of users later, knowing that most people do not read these conditions before use.I guess they didn't think that the users on Bitcointalk weren't as naive as they thought and they were certainly very disappointed after reading the comments here.",

It has yet to be polished. For one, you're saying one thing and requires another. Echoing logfiles, you claim you believe in anonymity and yet you adhere to KYC/AML policies. Those two are mutually exclusive. You claim you \"honor the initial concept of cryptocurrency\" and yet your ToS makes it clear that you bar individuals and entities that are sanctioned by political bodies. You impose a blanket ban based on geopolitics. That's censorship. That's one problem which crypto tries to solve.There are three items under your Announcements: 1. \"Unlimited\", 2. \"Anonymity\", 3. \"NO LIMIT.\" I don't how numbers 1 and 3 are different from each other. Also, your history tab doesn't have any data.",
