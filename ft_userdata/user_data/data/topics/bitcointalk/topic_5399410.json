Laszlo, in Florida sent 10,000 bitcoin to someone in Europe. That person in Europe called Papa Johns in FLA and had pizzas delivered to Laszlo.The person in Europe has said they gave many away trying to get folks to use them.",

The guy who owned this amount of bitcoins and sold bitcoins because he didn't truly leave on it and couldn't hold it, I believe a few years later when the price reached much higher price the people who sold their asset at price will have the same feelings of the guy who traded bitcoins for a pizza.",

If I had my own pizzeria, I would run something like an advertising campaign using bitcoin's theme that day. I would offer customers a pizza with a design similar to yours (that is, using bitcoin logo and a similar theme) with the option to pay only in BTC. A small bonus to bitcoin connoisseurs who know about this significant day for this community.None of the pizzeria chains thought of this?",
