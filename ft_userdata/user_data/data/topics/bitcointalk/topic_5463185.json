I have Braiins OS+ and am looking to install their proxy service as well on my mine but I'm pretty confused as to how the proxy works. How do I know what server port my ASICs are connected to? I need to configure the proxy for multiple pools as I have some of my friends' machines here as well.",

      "body": "You might want to check out stratu.ms proxy service. You can manage the proxy via a web front-end, I've found this is easier to use than the config files in Braiins farm proxy.To send hashrate to multiple pools in stratu.ms, you can create multiple proxy instances. You can also create sub-accounts to view / manage a specific proxy instance.Quote from: MikeyGod420 on August 14, 2023, 02:39:04 AMHey y'all, relatively new here and I'm excited to dive deeper into the bitcoin world.
