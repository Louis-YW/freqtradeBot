      "body": "This is one things that is not working effectively in casinos nowadays all less in a decentralized casinos where you connect your wallet to deposit and also withdraw directly to same address without any approval from the team. Usually using this type of casino required you to create a new separate wallet and send only the amount you wishes to gamble with or play to that wallet maybe if there is any hack or possibly wallet compromisation it would only affects the connected wallet. I think this types of casino offers instant withdrawal to their bettors. But if you are that comfortable with the casino I don't think there's any need to panicked concerning your withdrawal rather to have patients, it's your due to lack of patients that you lost your money because you couldn't wait for your withdrawal to get confirmed. Then lastly always look for a reliable casino to trust on that you could always have this confident about your withdrawal than writing to them for quick approval at this point it looks very suspicious and unusual for them which might likely even elongate your confirmation.",

      "body": "I assume the casino you're playing on isn't reputable; otherwise they would pay you within a few minutes to a few hours imo. Your withdrawal request shouldn't stay pending for more than 24 hours except in cases of fraud or when there are issues with your account. I believe they were simply buying time to delay payment since they may not have enough funds or they were waiting for you to continue playing and lose your money as has already happened.Quote from: GxSTxV on May 26, 2023, 11:55:07 AMIn your opinion why you should choose instant withdrawal casino instead of regular ones that can take days to receive your winnings?A reputable casino that offers instant withdrawal is what everyone should look for. Waiting to receive your winnings won't be a problem for them since they already have a great capital to pay their gamblers. I believe it's better for both, the casino to process payments quickly (to maintain their reputation and for positives users reviews) and for a gambler to avoid becoming greedy and playing more when already requesting a withdrawal.",

I'm not sure what gambling you are choosing, but for sure, if there are instant withdrawals, the fees are too huge, which is why others are forced to use the other method. It is also your fault as you were unable to control yourselves and cancelled the withdrawal. Also, it doesn't make sense if you already withdrawn it and received the money, and again after 24 hours, you will deposit back those winnings.",

However, that's not the point. It's not about the outcome, but the fact that if you think you might regret your actions later, then you should reconsider gambling altogether. It's important to make decisions that align with your goals, and if gambling conflicts with those, then it's best to avoid it altogether.Quote from: GxSTxV on May 26, 2023, 11:55:07 AMIn your opinion why you should choose instant withdrawal casino instead of regular ones that can take days to receive your winnings?I have never gambled at a casino that did not offer instant, or at least near-instant withdrawals. At least in terms of crypto casinos. One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies in online casinos is the ability to manage my funds more efficiently. For instance, I can set my daily gambling budget, and once I'm done, I can withdraw the funds back to my wallet, or transfer them to another casino if I choose to do so. This is not possible with casinos that do not offer instant withdrawals or with traditional payment methods.",

In what you are talking about, it is not about how fast the withdrawal is fast on gambling sites, but it should be how discipline and not greedy you are while gambling.",

Even if there is why you play on a slow casino like that, this is a re -question of the validity of your story, sir, but honestly if there is indeed a slow casino like that, the worst casino in this era in the era of all fast -paced.And you also as a gambler must have patience if you want to win, in fact even though you win in gambling but you don't win against yourself which causes you to play the money you have won before.",

In my case, I use Bitcoin as means of gambling and I also withdraw it on that method paying 7k satoshis in Stake.com and after 3-5 minutes I will already see an incoming fund alert on my wallet. The stress of knowing your money is in the air and not knowing where it is, I don't like that. It gives me the idea that someone could tweak or alter my transaction and steal if it takes longer than what I am used to.In your case, you had the chance to cancel the transaction which I think can also be an advantage if you do it right. For example, you win more after the withdrawal and you want to add more funds to the withdrawal amount, then you could cancel it and make it one transaction.",

Those that takes many hours delay in withdrawals are mostly not worth our time. They have added that delay on purpose because many people like you want to gamble more and earn more from the platforms everyday. With the delay they have no other option than playing and the result is mostly the loss of the money.The best casinos know that the priority of the withdrawals should be in the possession of the customers and they consider the customers as bosses in that regard. The allow us to withdraw our earning as soon as we win and they don't put any delays or ToS that could dishearten a gambler. The reputable casinos do that because they care the customers far more than the ones who care about the money of the customers.",

      "body": "Most So-called casinos always experience this kind of issue you just talked about, and this doesn't only happen with instant withdrawal; it also happens with instant deposit. In some casinos I have used in the past, sometimes one will make a deposit and it will not reflect in your balance. You will then need to contact support before they can rectify the issue. I got a so much paranoid because of this deposit issues. Why? I was supposed to bet on a match that was supposed to start in an hour, but I made a deposit and did not get it on my balance. I waited until the whole hour was timed up, and I couldn't even bet on the sure odds I had that day. What angered me the most was that the game did not burst; if I had made the bet that day, I would have won the game.But what I realized with the platform is that those delays only occur when people use the fiat option to deposit and withdraw. There are no such delays for the crypto deposit and withdrawal options.So my advice is that if the casino you are using has a different withdrawal option, try to use it. Also, be sure you are dealing with a reputable platform. You can even inquire from support about the best deposit and withdrawal options, which are so fast.",
