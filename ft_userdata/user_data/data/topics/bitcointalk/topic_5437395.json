  "content": "So, one of my colleagues lost her phone and got a new one. I can't say am more excited for her, because it's been due. The only issue she have encountered in trying to recover data and passwords to accounts online, including social media, is that, the trust wallet just won't open for her. I got entangled in this case because of our common interest in Bitcoin and we do chat on the subject matter when work is calm and everyone is bored.However, this new matter of trust wallet is one I know so little about. A user with similar experience of this sort, would give an answer better than google.I had to reinstall a new trust wallet app on the new phone. To get ahold of the trust wallet account is the issue, because we keep getting, 'create a new account' or 'I already have an account'  as options. On clicking on 'I already have an account' option, the next slide comes with the security verification to 'create passcode'. What's next she asks, but I pretend to be on call and keep fiddling with the phone. I later told her am too tired to start bothering with the issue now, but would get back to it once am well rested.With more experienced and virtual users of the trust wallet herein, The question is this, am I supposed to have this as a response after clicking on the 'I already have an account' option?How do we recover or reunite the old wallet address with this new trust wallet app on a new phone, with hopes the wallet is not lost?",

If she did not keep any backups to her seedphrase, then it's impossible to recover the address.She already made a couple of mistakes;• Storing your crypto assets on a device you carry around. It's better kept on an airgapped device, which is never connected to the internet and not carried around.• Not backing up your wallet securely.• Not using an open source wallet.",

At this point, I heave a sigh of relief until dawn when I can  help her try it out again. My fingers are crossed.",

      "body": "You can always import your seed phrase into a new device. When the “insert password or biometrics” pops up you can put a new password for that phone you don’t have to remember the previous one. You should really look into what @Upgrade00 said, I also think it’s not a great idea to use closed source wallets. Newbies do not know much about closed-source and open-sourced wallets, you should educate your friend on the pros and cons.",
