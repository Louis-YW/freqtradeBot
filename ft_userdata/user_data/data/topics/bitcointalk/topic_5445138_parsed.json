Or maybe they're get restricted or blacklisted by those casinos because they always make money on the casinos, so they don't have any way to continue to make money except become the house or looking for the other opportunity.",

For sure that some of them build a business due to being successful in gambling which involves money therefore they have knowledge how to make the money circulate and work for them. Having an investment while earning huge amount of assets in gambling will make you millionaire easily plus your business. But always remember that gambling doesn't guarantee you success in life. There's always a risk, if you want to be one of them it would be better to learn from the best first before taking risk of betting your money because its better to have proper background, knowledge and experiences before trying gambling.",

I mean I think they are actually rich and professional gamblers when in gambling they bet big amount and when they win they also get big win and can set up their own business. is my thought correct?and the person you mean is just dreaming without daring to take risks such as realizing what is planned like starting your own business, I think that person is just an ordinary person who is not rich and bets small amounts when gambling and when he gets a win he only gets an insignificant amount big and unable to create their own business, as different as people who are already successful in having a big business from their winnings at gambling.but I have also heard of a gambler who was a professional and had expertise in gambling and eventually founded his own casino and decided to make money from the casino business instead of throwing money at other casinos.",

Of course it corresponds to a minority portion of gamblers, but they do exist and it's possible to win and to use the money smartly, instead of continuously spending it during more gambling sessions until losing everything.

Use gambling money as much as you can afford to lose.There is only one way to make all of these dreams come true, and that is to be brave, in the sense that you are willing to take risks or dare to lose some money to be able to realize your dream of big wins so that you become a person who succeeds in getting success.But out there it's true like what you said that more people have dreams without the effort and ability to achieve these big achievements.Understanding like this is quite good and useful because it can indirectly encourage someone's enthusiasm or suggestion in taking steps to pursue what has been dreamed of in the future.",

Another thing is if gambling was really that good they won't have switched business the would have continued their gambling career and tried to make more money from it. What this means is that you're not supposed to depend solely on gambling a point will come in your life when you'll realize that it's time to leave gambling and focus n a more prominent business.",

He's not really a professional gambler per se but it has been known that he's good at playing blackjack, that guy's Fred Smith, the Founder of FedEx, that courier company that treats your packages like they're made with kickable material (lmao). So anyways the story goes that once in FedEx's infancy, it has been short of more or less 7 grand in fuel fees, and not paying that fee on time would literally mean their business failing, so unbeknownst to his board members, he took whatever was left in their treasury and betted it all on blackjack, turns out his aptitude for blackjack paid handsomely and he bagged 30grand in the process. Was able to pay for the fuel and was able to save his business. This is by no means a way to inspire all these wannabe pro gamblers, just a funny and a really cool story as well.",

And they are not afraid of losing money when taking those risks.Sometimes it pays off big time. Obviously many of their businesses have failed and lost them very large amounts of money but every now and then they hit the jackpot and raise a business up from the ground-up whoch becomes extremely successful and profitable.The average person who is not all that risk-loving will have achieved nothing.
