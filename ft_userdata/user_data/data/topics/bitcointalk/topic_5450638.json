Becouse by that time it's calculated we would run out of liqutity the Banks and markets.However markets and exchangers Will do better then many small Banks becouse the exchangers and markets are connected with global liqutity better.Anyways who needs those small Banks ?

Most would predict it as the most possible scenario based on the real and present happenings in our current situation on our economy. Same as you do, I don't really rely on those predictions since even the most veteran traders failed to predict most of what happens in our economy nowadays specially in terms of bitcoin. There have been so many predictions that been concluded and most are even close to accurate but not as accurate as to when it will stop. We should also consider that not \"them\" the people who are doing predictions are the market but us all of the people who are into this is considered as market specially those whales.",

      "body": "2023 to 2030 seems a pretty long year to make an accurate prediction. Although I won't expect this to be accurate since it's a prediction. But predictions need some basis for it to make sense, not just a random thoughts that pops up on your mind. But you've mentioned that you have a background so I don't know whether you really studied about this or you just come up with this prediction instantly. You also mentioned about the crisis this year, I wonder what crisis are you talking about? To be honest it's hard to predict something that is years from now since we really never know what will happen before that year. The closer it is in the present, the easier it is to predict more accurately but regardless if it's around 2023 or 2030, I won't be believing this (also given that it lacks basis and reference).",

Unfortunately that country is already on the warpath and has some weapons which will soon be obsolete, so why not use them. It only takes one drone to explode a church in Moscow. And that drone could come from anyone.The UN is one of the most powerless international bodies. The FMI has more power.",
