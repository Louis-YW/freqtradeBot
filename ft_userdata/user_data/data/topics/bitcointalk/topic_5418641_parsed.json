Either that or testing how many addresses the bitcoin client could actually handle over a course of time and transactions. It also sets a bad example of reusing addresses and might have been suggestive to users to keep reusing theirs rather than shuffling around the addresses they normally use and refreshing new ones.",

How this estimate is made then?Okay, I have google searched it. Let me quote it:Quote from: https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/satoshi-net-worth/#:~:text=Jordan%20discovered%20Bitcoin%20in%202013,which%20reaches%2020%2C000%2B%20readers%20daily.&text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto's%20net%20worth%20is,Satoshi%20mined%20the%20first%20bitcoin.Satoshi Nakamoto's net worth is $22.4 billion.We know that Satoshi mined the first bitcoin. He proved it by telling others in his email group that he would provide the following message in the genesis block and he did: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.How do we work out how rich Satoshi is?In 2013, Sergio Demian Lerner, the designer of RSK, begun some detective work to find out just how much bitcoin Satoshi probably mined, and how much of it was still sitting in those wallets. The answer, which has been supported by several researchers since was… quite a lot, actually.Sergio’s initial assumption was based on the logic that throughout almost all of 2009 the hashrate stayed at the low level of 7 million hashes per second. This seems consistent with the idea that a lone miner was the only one contributing to the network at that time.To try and put into perspective how little hashpower 7 million hashes per second is, consider how much more computing power is now dedicated to the Bitcoin network. These days, miners contribute 1.2e+18 (that’s 12 million with another 12 0s on the end) hashes per second toward mining bitcoin.Sergio also noted that this 7 million hashes per second was the same amount of hashrate in the first 14 days of Bitcoin’s life and he adds to the assumption that at this time Satoshi was surely the only miner.It may be right, it may not be right, it is an assumption.",

How this estimate is made then?So basically you are making an assumption based on seeing a number on the internet. There is no addresses leaked, there is only a guesswork[1] that made an assumption that because of a certain characteristics in a portion of the mined blocks, they should be linked.It is worth noting that Hal Finney was at least one of the other people who mined some blocks at those times which is ignored in this guesswork.[1] https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/",

Satoshi covered this in the whitepaper:Quote from: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.In other words, don't reuse addresses.If Satoshi had sent every block reward they had earned to the same pubkey, then everyone would know exactly which coins belong to them and exact how much they owned. By using a different pubkey for every block reward, we can now only guess at which and how many coins Satoshi owns. For all we know, Satoshi could have spent some of their coins recently and everyone has just assumed it was some other early miner, since we don't know exactly which coins belong to Satoshi and which do not.",

Satoshi obviously knew that, since they designed the system. They would be fully aware that the very first blocks of bitcoin would send their coinbase reward to an address (actually a pubkey) which would be public and which would obviously be linked to them. The software at the time was designed to always send a coinbase transaction to a brand new address every time by default, so that's what it did. The question of which addresses actually belong to Satoshi came much later. Sure, you can be certain that block 0 is Satoshi, and you can be pretty certain that the next few dozens blocks were Satoshi too. But beyond that, it starts to become educated guesswork. Until someone comes out and either signs a message or moves coins from one of these early addresses, then we just don't know if it belongs to Satoshi or some other early miner.A classic example is of Faketoshi who claimed a bunch of addresses as belonging to him, and then a signed message appeared a few days later from over a hundred of those addresses calling him a liar and a fraud.",

I believe the reason why Satoshi used different addresses is mainly because he doesn't really want to be revealed to the public. The man is using different addresses to coincide with the miners from his time and even then these supposed \"leaked\" addresses aren't really confirmed to be his, just a hint that it could be someone who is connected to the man himself. Going back to my answer, he wants to be able to use his bitcoins still but is looking to find a way where it's gonna be hard to discern that it was him. Hence, he created multiple accounts all with bitcoins to spend.",
