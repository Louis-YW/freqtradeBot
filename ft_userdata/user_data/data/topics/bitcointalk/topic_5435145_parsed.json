      "body": "I only play one musical instrument and that is the piano as a hobby, which I would not consider calling myself a pianist, not a professional one at least. There is nothing more enjoyable than playing as it does help my mind be at ease. Like when I am having a bad day or even when in a happy mood surely boosting my energy. The soothing sounds of the keys hitting  the strings, electrifying through your veins, hits the soul. It is so electrifying through the different piano music genres, like classical music, jazz, contemporary classics, or even piano rock.",

After that I didn’t ever try again, I’d love to play guitar but I feel too old maybe.I don’t even know how to read music if I’m honest. That’s something that needs to be taught & again, maybe too late for me. If you have the gift to play an instrument well, don’t give up on it. Keep on playing that sweet music.",
