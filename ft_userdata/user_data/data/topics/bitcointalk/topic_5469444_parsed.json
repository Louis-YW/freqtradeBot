More notably, that the wallet address receiving money from this Galxe hack is closely related to the hacker who attacked the Balancer protocol on Sep 20.Perhaps we have all received warnings to stop using and connecting to galxe at this time, according to what I have been told, Revoke should be done in this situation. But in terms of scale and severity, we can still hope that this is just a small incident and Dev is still diligently finding a way to fix it.",

What a crazy thing to happened actually, how could they exploit just like that. Also it worth noticing that the hacker only moving funds from those wallets that contain bigger amount of eth and neglect the smaller values.Its like the process has autoskipped on contracts if the wallet only have few gas and cant even profit from transfer.  Very smart and scary hacker.",

The system of approvals itself - signatures for identification - is very convenient, but as we see, it is not safe. That is, we need to make changes to the signature mechanism itself; it should not be directly related to the funds in our wallet. As for Revoke, it’s worth remembering the situation in the summer when he too was attacked using fake contracts. Any service is vulnerable.I express my gratitude to MetaMask, which I use - today he blocked access to the Galxe website and warned me. And this is not advertising.",

After reading the X post of Galxe regarding the incident, I checked to see if the address being mentioned by them was in my history of approvals that needs to be revoked. But good thing it wasn’t. I’ve also disconnected my wallet from Galxe. If I was not aware of the incident and immediately go to Galxe and approve signature, I might be one of those people who are affected and got hacked. Thank God I did my homework making sure that all of the hardwork that I’ve built would not be put to waste, especially those NFTs and OATs that I’ve minted. I really feel for those people who have lost their money and drained to the hacker’s wallet who compromised Galxe back then. Stay SAFU everyone!",

If bad thing happened and those hackers will have full control of these platform for sure there's a lot of users will get affected with it especially that they connect their wallets before they can do some task there. And to awful to read that there are couple of people has been affected already and maybe best for users to drain their wallet before the hacker can locate it. Lucky to use a dummy wallet on their platform so I don't have anything to lose there, but other people might get affected with this especially those people who are late to receive this news since provably they might wake up that they don't have anything left on their wallet and that is bad sight to see especially those balances is their hard earned crypto's from participating on multiple platforms.",

Galxe is popular site and to many people which hope to earn huge from doing some task, but now that this site has been hacked it open some sleeping consciousness that we must secure our wallets and don't ever trust any site even if they are popular since the same issue might happen then for sure we can't afford to be their victim.I also see a lots of post saying their lose regarding on incident but we can't verify if this is true and hopefully that's case since if many got scam with that for sure these scammers will attack for second time so we need to be ready or careful on next platform to be attack so that we can assure that we are safe from getting hack.",
