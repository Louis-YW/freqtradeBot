  "content": "I am not a trezor user, but I saw this new update which I like very much. I even thought Trezor had coin control before. One of the reasons I like electrum wallet, but which is often used as a desktop online wallet. The Trezor Suite update, version 22.9.3 which I like very well is the coin control. Coin control won't be new to people that uses Electrum, or people that connects their hardware wallet to electrum, but now on Trezor Suit according to the new update.https://blog.trezor.io/coin-control-in-trezor-suite-92f3455fd706If trezor has included coin control, that means that people using Trezor Suit would be able to select certain UTXO(s) to spend from. This can improve privacy to some extent. QuoteUsing Coin controlThe best place to learn how to use new features is directly in Trezor Suite. Click on the lightbulb icon in the bottom right of the app and you’ll find the following instructions in the Trezor Suite guide:Navigate to the Bitcoin account you want to spend fromIn the Send tab, complete the ‘Address’ and ‘Amount’ fieldsClick the Coin control button to reveal your available UTXOsYou can then manually select the UTXOs you want to spendOnce you’re satisfied with your selection, click Review & SendThen confirm the transaction on your Trezor device as usualRemember, your choice of UTXOs must cover at least the amount being sent and the transaction fees. Avoid using low-value ‘dust’ UTXOs of 546 sats or less, as you will overpay in fees.Follow the above link to read more about Trezor Suite coin control feature and other updates.Other updatesDisplay bitcoin units as satoshisImproved exports for transaction historyTor progress bar",

      "body": "I just saw the update available today, I am downloading it as I type this.I was personally looking forward to this version, since I was considering to switch to Electrum because there one can choose to display the balance in sats and also have coin control, now I do not need to move from Trezor Suite.I feel coin control is specially important as addition to keep security and privacy of Trezor users, however according to Trezor, they are aiming to release Coinjoin by next year, if they manage to do so it could be a game charger in their favor in the eyes of privacy advocates,  I doubt other wallets and specially Ledger will take such step so quickly because they may end up risking some partnerships with highly regulated entities, but I am afraid I am not so well informed as I should on Ledger's road map for their products, if anyone feels like commenting on it, please do.I wonder how exchanges and regulators will react when Trezor releases Coinjoin, though. Things could get nasty, Binance and Coinbase could be forced by regulators not to accept/froze funds without a clear path across the blockchain in order to pressure Trezor to drop the feature.",

Electrum has a feature.which allows the user to freeze coins inputs, so they won't get spent in any case, on the other hand, it seems Trezor Suite needs us to specify which inputs we don't want to spend everytime we want to send satoshis. This requires the user to constantly remember the input they want to avoid to move, of course there is also the option to tag the input but there must be people who wish not to use the tagging. In this matter, Electrum still has an advantage over Trezor Suite, quite useful when comes to managing dust attacks, for example.",

I prefer Electrum's coin control over the one I have seen in Ledger Live and I am sure I would do the same if I used Trezor Suite.Can someone post a few screenshots from their app so we can see how their coin control feature actually looks like?

There is a timestamp and you can tag the UTXOs if you want to. Ledger Live doesn't have timestamps. They only show a confirmations count for each UTXO. Similarly to Trezor Suite, each UTXO has it's own line. I would prefer if I could see the USD value besides the BTC amount for each line, but that's also missing. The thing that's really badly done is that when you open the coin control window, all your UTXOs are selected by default and you have to unselect each one manually. It isn't that annoying if you have only a couple of UTXOs in that particular BTC account, but imagine trying to spend coins from an account with 100 UTXOs. You need to unselect 99 times to spend only from one. And there is no unselect all button anywhere.  Amateurishly done, and without much thought.",
