Actually the lowest price was around $15xxx, although I've already forgotten the exact number.Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM1. Will Bitcoin ever fall to zero someday?If everyone who bought it and those who intended to buy it thought it was worth 0, then it would be worth exactly that much, i.e. it would be worth nothing. However, the chance of this happening is very small, regardless of how many times someone writes that Bitcoin is dead, or that its real value is equal to zero.Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM2. What happens if it ever falls to zero?Then all BTC that exist will become worthless, no one will trade with them anymore and no one will accept them as a means of payment. Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM3. Will Bitcoin go back to previous levels? You didn't specify which levels you mean, the lowest or the highest? As for the previous ATH of $69k, I think it is certainly achievable and most have no doubts that we will see that price again - and as for the lowest price of $15k+, that is something we can return to if the market is shaken by some extremely bad news.",

I am sure this was asked plenty of times already....Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PMThough I haven't invested a reasonable sum in Bitcoin, I've at some point after watching how the market and price of Bitcoin fell from over $69k to less than $14k something similar to what altcoins do There's a difference: bitcoin has a history of recoveries from low prices to new ATH; most altcoins never recover from the low price.Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM1. Will Bitcoin ever fall to zero someday?Possibly; sooner or later everything turns to dust. But most probably Bitcoin won't go to zero in the next 20-80 years.Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM2. What happens if it ever falls to zero?Most probably nothing special. Bitcoin becomes worthless either because there won't be humans left (or internet), either because humans have invented something better and lost interest in bitcoin. Probably at that point there will already be no mining. However, all the relevant things would have happened before bitcoin going to 0.Quote from: RM$1 on February 16, 2023, 05:14:21 PM3. Will Bitcoin go back to previous levels?Previous levels as 60k, or previous levels as 1k? About 1k the chances are slim (but see point 1); for new ATH the chances are very good (although it may not happen this year). But please don't make purchases based on my expectations, I can easily be wrong.",

      "body": "What happens if Dollar ever falls to zero or the Ruble, oh that already did.  In fact every national currency has failed at some point sooner or later its just a promise of value.   There is hard default or soft default for the Ruble they allowed 10,000 old Rubles to convert to 1 new Ruble and did that really help anyone who believed their currency would not fail; only an illusion unfortunately.    BTC is being used, so long as that is true it wont go substantially down when viewed over many years, its been gaining a long time now mostly because so many new dollars exist over just five years ago and so on.  Almost every country is like this because nobody wants to break ranks with Dollar global reserve system, if a system cant adjust it will fail.  BTC is only place you are promised a set issuance and security of that, its something which has value for that unique quality so zero is unlikely.   Anything can happen of course but probably we will see a repeat of Dollar losses & everyone copies their stand, BTC continues to be of use globally to the people more then any other entity.   Yen is most likely to cause tremors globally, the people and nation are good but the currency has dire problems they just got a new chief.",

But talking on it about the reality, it's very highly unlikely.2. Then the entire crypto market will shutdown for sure. Some may remain but interest of people might be gone if it happens.3.

What are the chances that bitcoin would have zero demand? Zero. You'll even catch me making bids at 3 digit bitcoin prices.Simple supply and demand. How would anyone, including OP, make you and me not buy bitcoin for $10 a piece when it's literally nothing, the price of a burger. If I would buy at 100, somebody would outbid me and buy at $150 and so on, until we'd come to a level of equilibrium between buyers and sellers, at which point we'd stabilize at a range, the way we did at 16k for the last couple months. There's a number of things that could stop demand, one of them would be a fast and cheap way to break bitcoin's encryption. That could make it go low, but an example of LUNC shows that even a scam coins that got exposed don't go to 0.",

It will be if this questions are answered without sentiment as I'm open to learn.Firstly, the bitcoin price has never touched $14k since ATH $69k, so you need to correct it for the information to be correct.Then this is a general answer that you should already be reading if you are truly open to learning:1. I believe the price will never go to 0, unless bitcoin is actually destroyed and technically fails.2. There are no high trading volumes, and ATH is just a memory. You can expect all transactions to still be stored on the blockchain, but no one will mine or handle transactions, it's not worth the cost.3. Very likely, you have to be sure that this cycle will repeat itself.",

No one knows on what would be the future would be and it is really hard to make out conclusions basing up on future events.Everything would be basing up on the community support or simply with the demand.2. If ever it would fall to zero then for sure there would really be another coin which the community is hanging on and not on btc anymore.3. Hard to guess but if you are really that going for long term then there's no price point that you would really be minding.You would be buying on whatever the number it would beunless if you do tend to make out some short or active trade then it would be possible but if not then you would be sticking into it.",

It will be if this questions are answered without sentiment as I'm open to learn.The three questions are all related to the price of bitcoin and not to what makes bitcoin valuable on the first place, if you take the time to look for this information you will understand why it is very unlikely for bitcoin to go down and reach a value of zero, however assuming it happened I would venture to say all altcoins will go to zero as well, but even more importantly I think our last chance to try to resist fiat money and the centralization governments are pushing for will die with bitcoin, so this is an event I really do not want to see.",

If that happens, every cryptocurrency that start with the price of bitcoin would probably plummet as well. We will never know if it could recover. We will know once you’re there so have your plan and if you are planning to buy more just buy. Make sure that you are risking what  you can afford.",

My answer: anything is possible, and no one has a crystal ball to tell you about the future. If you believe and are willing to take risks to get great rewards, you should invest in bitcoin, if you do not believe and do not accept losses, you should not invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin is called opportunity and opportunity means both risk and reward, and if you want to succeed, you need to make trade-offs. If everyone knows the future, bitcoin is definitely profitable, then that is no longer an opportunity and will not be your turn.",

It will be if this questions are answered without sentiment as I'm open to learn.We don't hate but you should get your facts straight, it didn't fell to $14k, the lowest low is $15,500 give and take.1. it's too big too fall, so I doubt that we will see it going to 0. It has existed in the last 10 years or so, meaning if there is a  chance that it will fall, it should be in the beginning of it's existence2. ok let's say for argument it goes to 0, so obviously, our investment on it will go to 0 as well, bitcoin mining gear will be worthless to miners.3. looking at it's past history, all it might break as some time, we are expecting a new all time high right after the bitcoin halving. Meaning, it will not just go back to its previous levels of high of $69k, but we might see looking at least 6 digits in the next bull run.",
