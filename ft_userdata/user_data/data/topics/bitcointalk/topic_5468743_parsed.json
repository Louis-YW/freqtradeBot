He asked around if there is anyone that can show him ₦5 from their wallet and he is ready to gift them the mp3, this dude walk around the street for an hour for anyone that can provide ₦5 cash and nobody could provide it, that's to tell you that ₦5 is no longer needed in the society because it can't but anything again. There is nothing that sell for ₦5 again, maybe there is for ₦10 but very soon, that could disappear from our eyers.This is to tell you how bad the economy has become, our inflation is not longer smiling to the point that I asked the question if the inflation announced is really the main value, things are getting for common person, the salary is not eco friendly. I wonder how you plan to spend ₦30,000($30) for one week. It's high time the government call for emergency meeting from the legislative, executive and judiciary and make things work because the suffering is not selective, it's for all and every citizens.Happy independence any way, even if things are not working.",

I hesitate to attribute the decline in our country's economic policies solely to external superpowers; rather, the avarice of our leaders, their lack of competence, and the absence of effective planning have played a pivotal role in the prolonged degradation of our economy. Over the years, Nigeria has struggled to enhance its Gross Domestic Product and establish robust economic ties with other nations to facilitate trade.\"",

Any salary or wages in cryptocurrency must be converted to our local currency before use. Even our local traders who are crypto traders adjust their prices with the CBN exchange rates and right now the Naira is almost at 1$ to 1000naira. With interest rates increased since the sitting of this new government, we are hoping that minimum wage and other avenue to make extra income is available to the common man without crypto knowledge or devices to eke a living online from. Crypto currency education is still the way forward and this government should do more campaign and sensitisation workshops, they should also introduce the subject of cryptocurrency in educational curriculum throughout the country .",
