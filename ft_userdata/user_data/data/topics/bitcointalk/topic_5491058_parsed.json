  "content": "[← Previous Question][Next Question →] Bitcoin quizzes are technical questions of educational character that improve the average user's knowledge on Bitcoin, and help him rank up. You can read more about it in here. As of today, we acknowledge the probability of a malicious pool turning evil, attempting to reverse your transaction with 10 confirmations. We are also aware that the probability of finding a certain number of blocks within a certain time frame follows the Poisson point process, which is a random mathematical object consisting of points distributed independently of each other within a space.Question: At the time of writing this, a rich billionaire decides to purchase lots of unused, available ASICs manufactured by Bitmain, with the intention to attack the network. He has acquired so much computational power, that he, alone, can generate 300 EH/s (exahashes per second). Once his setup is done, he turns his ASICs on and attempts to reorg the chain. Assuming that the rest of the hashrate remains constant, how many confirmations do you need to be 99% certain that your transaction will not be reversed by the attacker, and why?",

The third quiz was just like the first one, with different unknown (confirmations instead of chance of reversal) and another variable, the computational power that is outside the network. In the previous quiz, we were calculating probability of successfully reversing a transaction when a mining pool turns evil. Now that there is no honest hashrate turning evil, you'd have to consider the sum of the honest hashrate and the attacker's hashrate.Quote from: Mia Chloe on March 31, 2024, 05:32:11 PM[...]This is incorrect, because the attacker's hashrate is not 30% of 595.05 EH/s. I'm not sure how you worked out 595.05, the total honest hashrate was 564.9. But, either way, the attacker's hashrate is not 182.92, and that's why everything following is incorrect. Quote from: Amphenomenon on March 31, 2024, 02:19:56 PM[...]This is also incorrect, because the probability of the attacker succeeding is not 300 / 564.9. You have to get the sum of those two, which is the new hashrate, and use the formula used in the first quiz to work it out. Quote from: GxSTxV on March 31, 2024, 01:43:47 PM[...]You were right in the first half, but in the second half ChatGPT didn't use the correct formula to calculate this probability. You can check it out in the first quiz. Could you share with us the prompt you used as input?",

I made 2 mistakes. And they were;I got the question wrongly thinking the rich billionaire was the  good guy and assuming the bad guys were the ones in the previous question with 30.74% of total hash.Plus I used a total hash rate of 595.05 EH/s as the latest Bitcoin hash rate.  Instead of 564.9Eh/S.Anyways I look forward to another math quiz    solving was fun anyways.",

Could you share with us the prompt you used as input?Apologies for my late response because I needed some time to address this properly. Thank you for the clarification and the correction of my first mistakes. After reviewing the first quiz results, I have indeed learned something new. Regarding the prompt I have used, what I did was provide ChatGPT with the C code from the Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Code:  #include <math.h>   double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)   {       double p = 1.0 - q;       double lambda = z * (q / p);       double sum = 1.0;       int i, k;       for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)       {           double poisson = exp(-lambda);           for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)               poisson *= lambda / i;           sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));}return sum; }Then sending its the total hash rate at that moment, it gave me the formulas beside the results I shared with you in my previous post.",
