But kinda funny that they stress “ONLY” 5000 will be minted. If these are .999 silver, a 5000-coin mintage is a huge undertaking. Some of the forum mints are only a few hundred.Somebody is devoting at least $150k to this poor looking mint design. Whoever is minting these has seriously gone on an undertaking.  Maybe they only mint XX amount of coins at a time?From the post above, looks like they are just silver plated, so even if they had all 5000 coins minted at once, would not be that much to make that many plated-alloy coins",
