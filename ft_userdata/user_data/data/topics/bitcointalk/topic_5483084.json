Same with guessing seeds",

      "body": "He actually was talking about seed phrases and he is bluffing You can obviously see that from his post engagement. Seed phrases are one of the most secure forms of pass security and protection due to their present in ability to even be brute forced.Let's take a normal 4 digit pass code for example. Now the number of possible permutations of making a passcode is about 10⁴ now taking this into consideration if one should guess like he said he did, your chances of getting it correctly is;  1/10⁴ which is about 0.01% which is practically impossible but however not impossible to brute force since it's about 10000 permutations. However the number of possible permutations of private keys out there is 2²⁵⁶ . Of which brute forcing from scratch is currently impossible. Even for a 12 word combination seed phrase, assuming you already have all the words but are wrongly placed, the permutations of placing them is 12! = 479,001,600 of which guessing the correct placement is impossible.",

      "body": "I think it is just a bluff or lie because from how he constructs his statement, it is evident that he doesn't know what he is saying, and he doesn't have enough proof that he actually did it. If it's just guessing, then who's sane will believe in him? a different combination of words? Are you kidding? There are many words existing in the world. How could a mere person unlock a seed phrase just by guessing? That's why seed phrases are one of the most secure ways of securing an account because the combination of the words makes the password complex, and even a program that would run different combinations just to unlock a seed phrase will take a very long time. We would appreciate it if you also paste the reddit link to that post so that we can validate if he's provided proof that he actually did it or if he is just bluffing to attract attention.",

I mean the fact that you can just fake it like it's actually just your wallet and you pretend that you've lost the seed phrase is just the only way that it can possibly happen. It's a lie to generate karma in that Reddit account. I don't think luck is a factor here because there's hundreds of thousands of words in the dictionary and you just happen to stumble upon the right words and the correct sequence of that? I don't think so.",

And I don't understand why he is trying to do it by himself; if he's interested in it he can use some program to try those combinations.I think I found the explanation in an older post here:_________________This is not true.The checksum isn't the last word. The checksum is the last 4 bits.Each of words include 11 bits. The first 7 bits of the last word have been generated randomly and its last 4 bits are the checksum.So, if you have 11 word, for selecting the 12th word, you have to test different words until you find a valid word. As I already said in my previous post, 128 out of the 2048 words will lead to valid BIP39 seed phrase. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414874.msg61008375#msg61008375--------------------So the guy just created valid seed phrases, means he selected 11 random words and for the 12th word he had a chance of 128 out of 2048, or about 5 percent to get a valid checksum...... sounds quite doable, but of course no corresponding existing wallet with plenty of bitcoins...",

      "body": "I mean, he already answered part of the question when he revealed that the wallet had no transaction history. You can brute force seed phrase to find a wallet, but finding a particular/specific wallet is much more harder than just getting a random seed phrase that can match a random wallet. There's a difference between finding a specific wallet address versus finding a random one. And to those curious, here's the reddit link to the thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1abhe89/i_guessed_two_seeds_under_5_minutes/And quoting the OP of the thread QuoteHello Everyone,I just need Explanation about seed words, every one say that they cannot be guessed or they need 20000 years to guess a seed pass in order ...I successfully guessed TWO 12 word seeds under 5 minutes and had access to that wallets ...The wallets was empty with no Transaction history....How is it possible?The comments under actually answer OPs question and even more really. Just knowing how many combinations there are should be more than enough really to explain how hard it is to guess a valid address, let alone one that actually has funds in it.",

That with enough GPUs you could crack private key or at least find the private key of some address with a balance on it.But if you dig into it you will find that it’s near impossible. Some keys have low entropy because they were brain wallets and those are easy to crack but for a regular key made with a regular wallet software you are never going to find any key to an address with a balance or with some prior activity.",
