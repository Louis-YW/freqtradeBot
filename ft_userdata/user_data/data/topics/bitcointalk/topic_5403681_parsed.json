Luna is a token of Terra which was a blockchain Developed in South Korea company called Terraform Labs in 2018 and it was lunched in 2019. The spearheaded founder is Daniel Shin. In the month of April 2022, the company could not withstand with the test of time so it drastically crashed. And after the crashed, the team was trying their best to revive it and Luna 2.0 was also created but a lot of questions were answered if the new Luna was different from the old one.And by the month of June, 2022, South Korea banned the Terra/Luna team to fly out from the country.https://www.google.com/amp/s/gizmodo.com/terra-luna-terraform-labs-crypto-bitcoin-flight-ban-sou-1849087540/amphttps://currency.com/amp/what-is-terra-luna-your-ultimate-guidehttps://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Terra_(LUNA)",

I wonder how they can still work with this kind of restriction, LUNA is drowning to death here and investors should know this if there’s still is. I’m leaving LUNA behind, this is a useless project already, and I wonder why Korean government acts like this lately, this is another warning to every holders of this LUNA.",

Hopefully this will not drag in years, those who lost money here wanted a fast and swift action and justice.",

Luna staffs are not responsible for the current situation of the project and they are just ordinary staffs that are being paid for their services. Retaining them would noy solve the current problem but add more effects to those workers that had nothing or know nothing much about what had happened.",

The government may a bit too late to do that but at least the terra team can't leave the country to move to the another country to hide from what already accused for all of them. It's quite clear that if this team was a criminal caused by they were being blocked to move out from the south korea. They are all criminals and do kwon as the main actor that allegedly hodl bunch of money from scamming the investors must be catch as well.",

They must be punished for their actions, and the punishment is that they have to solve everything that happened to the destruction of $LUNA, they must not leave the country before this matter is resolved. But I wonder, is the South Korean government's decision aimed at security? We know that there are many people out there whose lives have been ruined because of $LUNA.",

So many people were loosing their lives. this means if the developers must be responsible for this kind of accident. This will never happen if the developers didn't try to did a garbage experiment like UST. People were also so dumb by believing in this piece of shit. I hope that those who lost a lot in this case can get their justice.",

They really have to unravel and investigate Do Kwon and his men if they did it intentionally or if not, why is there no safety nets to protect their investors because this is one of the worst meltdown in crypto market And when you think that this people can be trusted, they pull this off, whether scam or not. Many lost a lot of their hard earn money in the course and at least the government should look for ways to compensate them back courtesy of Do Kwon if he has assets that can be liquidated.",

From the look of things, it would be very difficult for Luna to regain the trust of the market as there's still a gap in information as to the cause of the crash. Of course they are under investigation so they are not allowed to travel outside and hide. Because we don't know, maybe they will just disappear and run from the law without us getting our answers and money.As for what transpired, simply put, they don't have the reserves to put back the stable coin to 1:1. Their reserves is mostly in bitcoin so when bitcoin goes down and so is their reserves. So it de-peg causing a large withdraws until it can no longer recover back causing their market to crash.",
