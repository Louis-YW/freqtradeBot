  "content": "Recent statement by a British MP Matt Hancock  wherein says we need liberal regulations for bitcoin.He said  \"The underlying technology is so powerful … Just because the dot-com bubble crashed in 2001, we didn’t discredit the internet as a technology\"\" No country can stop this revolution. We can only choose whether it happens on our shores or happens to us from elsewhere\"Though we all know crypto is here to stay and bitcoin will surely rebound. I was wondering if these soft regulations will keep the crypto decentralised.His interview can be accessed in the link below.https://news.bitcoin.com/british-mp-calls-for-liberal-crypto-regulation-no-country-can-stop-this-revolution/",

What should be regulated are ICOs, IEOs, IDOs, DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse cryptocurrencies and other new scam projects that will eventually be invented by a centralized organizations that will call it decentralized but leading to another means scammers will earn more money from victims and the projects are centralized.",

      "body": "Hancock's idea of 'liberal' cryptocurrency regulation is very one-sided. It could end up hurting investors more than helping the industry.  Regulation should be in place to protect investors, but he wants to prioritize the industry instead. Isn't this what happened during the dot cum bubble? Companies had too much freedom   He's contradicting himself, with no clear vision and understanding. Expected from a politician tho. You know it's a dumb politician if his lips are moving.",

These risks don't threaten existence of Bitcoin, but they can cause certain problems. So ideally everyone would use Bitcoin in a way that is harder to regulate, to avoid government controlling certain aspects of Bitcoin.",

Majority of the several thousands of cryptocurrency projects have never been decentralized. Decentralization as far as these projects are concerned is just a bait, a mere word that would help them sell their coins. They're just using it because it's the current hype.",

The man has some good understanding of this fledging industry and how it can be a good opportunity for his country too. I am looking forward how this so-called \"soft regulation\" will really be materializing and how it would affect the crypto industry. As for me, there is really no stopping for many big and important countries to do some regulations on Bitcoin and other digital assets...this is not anymore a question of IF but of WHEN and HOW.",

He said at the London Crypto Club in April: “If we get the regulation right crypto will not only accelerate growth but make financial systems more transparent and reduce crime. We must understand and harness the potential of new technologies, not fear and avoid their disruptive power.”I love this part of the article. He is right about it. What's more? It's not just transparency and reducing crime like corruption and money laundering, they are also lifting a weight for investors making too deep research about every cryptocurrency they will invest at. That's the hardest part of all and time consuming for every small or big investor. We want to avoid being scammed so regulation will help a lot especially for new projects that are based in their jurisdiction. They don't need to worry about Bitcoin, it's the altcoins that is being abused.",

I am not saying that we can't do that at all, all I am saying is that we should be careful about it. Regulations means that there will be some governmental control, which means that there will be plenty of people who will try to squeeze in some more stuff in there and it may look to be a bad thing eventually when we are done.If done correctly, just like the article says, dotcom bubble caused a crash, but the biggest companies in the world are in the tech world nowadays, if you could do that then you could do anything you want in the future.",

There's no soft regulations, if the government start to regulate Bitcoin then you need to expect in the near future there will be a more regulations comes up and then it's no more soft regulations. The example is Binance where they let anyone to withdraw without KYC for 2BTC/day, but after SEC force them to implemented KYC on all customers, after that they're ask anyone KYC even you're not doing anything.Bitcoin shouldn't and never need to be regulated, it's only need to be not banned and everyone have a freedom to buy or not.",

What we need here is not hard or soft regulations, we need understanding that crypto is a currency and should be taxed based on that. So, let’s take UK for example since that is the topic, they use Pounds as a currency right? Sterling, pound, quid, whatever you want to call it.If one person buys euro or dollars, and then that goes up against pound, then they made a profit, right? How is that profit taxed? That is exactly how crypto should be taxed, because that is exactly what a crypto is, not like a stock, but like a foreign fiat currency.",
