Fun fact is that I saw worldcoin team at Delhi metro station and they were asking users to give their biometric data and they would get 4000rs worth of tokens.I didn't buy their idea and considered them a scam and then 2 days later I found their coin getting listed on binance.",

Of course for everything in India I need the aadhar card but I have zero clue why I would need the world ID that they are offering. For me it is a controversial  project but the hype it has been gaining lately is good for anyone who wants to invest in this project for long term gain. As soon as it got listed on Binance it pumped for more than 50%. At the moment it is trading sideways and in the next bull run it might reach its ATH.",

Such kind of coins usually creates a buzz at the beginning but later we usually see an exit scam. What's hilarious is that the creator of an AI company talks about a more human driven crypto ecosystem. Oxymoron!",

You can change your fingerprint but you cannot change your irish. Your irish scan being unique is linked to wallet which makes it ver safe & secure. The proby here is that it is centralized. Like picoin they have not blocked the tokens. You can straightaway trade them. Still privacy is a major concern for me.",

The craze of world coin is rapidly gaining support in third world countries. I stumbled upon a news which I am sharing here:  Why Kenyans are scanning their eyeballs for Sh7,000 Worldcoin cryptocurrency tokens. It seems at the moment they won't need to anything. All they need to do is to take permission from the government to install their orb in different cities and lure citizen with the offer of free token. The pic that you have published is a clear indicator that the government of India has allowed them to scan the irish of Indian. Now it all depends whether a person want to sell his irish scan for INR 4000. Those who have the knowledge of cryptocurrency would surely fall for the airdrop.",

This is just my personal opinion and people can DYOR.What I meant is that it does invade privacy and can be deadly. What I did feel is that this project because of its uniqueness and originality can be a big game changer if we invested in it. I feel I was not clear and to the point earlier, this might be the reason you have asked these questions. I do agree with the risk of privacy when you are scanning your eye. Apart from the Irish they can also get details of your race and create something nasty like the COVID-19 virus. That being said the project is different and can revolutionalize identity globally if we think on the brighter side.",

I still remember how Unocoin CEO was jailed for opening a Bitcoin ATM kiosk. But for 4000₹ are you willing to risk your privacy? That's a major question that one should really ask. Also providing the initiative of digital identity to a private company is always highly risky and that also who is into AI, god knows what product will they really make out of this.",
