None of the world's most evil people are in prison. The law isn't there to protect you from bad people, it's there to protect bad people from you. That's why you should always, always, always be distrustful of all efforts to extend the law and expand government power over you. It's not happening because your government wants to help you. Your government is not your friend.Republicans push war with China while sometimes acting as skeptics on Russia warmongering, Democrats push war with Russia while sometimes acting as skeptics on China warmongering. This creates the illusion of opposition while giving the war machine everything it wants....",

However, the borrower should pay back the so-called loan over the years, which money should be held in trust for the borrower, by the bank. At the end of the loan term, the money should be given back to the borrower, in full, including the interest. The bank has earned by investing the borrower's money, little by little, over the term of the loan repayment.As it is right now, the bank gets the money twice:1. Once when they get the promissory note, which they use as money. It goes to the big bank owners, the elite of the world;2. Second, when they get the repayment of the loan over the years, by the so-called borrower.It works this way with both, the USD/Federal-Reserve-Bank, and the Euro and their controlling banks, probably in Germany.Until we stop giving money like this to the elite of the world, there will always be problems that they create for us... including their controlling of the mainstream media.",

Notably I would agree that the American electoral system is in a best description to be called \"democratic \" hence it tends to hold core value on what is democratically documented than mere individual ambition. So the emergence of a new party for into the American democratic system may take forever ever to come unless such political party has a clear cut idea which differ from that which the already existing two has offered in time past.",

But it is a democratic process only in the direction of the formal government. Here's what I mean.An elected President may sign executive orders, and give orders to the people. But the people don't have to obey them except if they are part of government or the military. Average Americans don't have to obey.However, many Americans think that they do, and will obey even when they don't have to. That's what happened with the Covid vaxx. It was the peoples' voluntary obedience in many cases, even though they didn't want to, and even though they were not required to, that caused them to get this vaxx.The Republic of the USA includes within it the democratic US government.",
