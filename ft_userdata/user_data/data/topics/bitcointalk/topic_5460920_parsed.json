It is as high as 87 years in some countries and as low as 56 years in some. The leading countries in high life expectancy include South korea, France, Japan and some other Asian countries.

Many factors play a role with the key among them being pollution, habits and sometimes, culture. However,  it seems there should be more that affect life expectancy that I would love to know. Let's discuss. War and conflict have led to a decrease in life expectancy ratings in most countries. When I consider how many people have died in Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Nigeria, and other conflict-torn nations, it will be evident that many productive youth have been cut short in their prime. In my country, armed conflict, crime, and police brutality have killed more people than some sicknesses. Poverty is another silent killer. When people cannot afford to eat balanced meals, they become exposed to sickness and disease. Many people die of hunger every day. Some persons live in a highly unconducive environment exposing them to sickness and death. I have seen people die because they can't afford to buy drugs that cost less than $1. Poverty has also made many people not access quality health facilities which have led to death. OP most of the nations that has high life expectancy rate that your mentioned has reasonable governments that care about the welfare of their citizens.",

For me it is the environment the biggest factor and I will make a simple example which most probably not many people know.There is a tribe somewhere in Pakistan where people live long enough up to 150 years from what I have heard and they never are ill of cancer,which is because of apricots being in huge quantities there and their core of such fruit is a natural anti cancer cure.The environment there is also mountain where the pure fresh air is always available much different than where we live in the super polluted cities and we have huge cases of different fatal disease around us.",

I' m notsure war and conflict are the biggest threat, I would say disease and illnesses are the biggestand having access to a working health system is extremely important.What seems to be trending currently is the environmental issues and the threat they pose to uslike natural disasters from climate change and food security from the decline in wildlifeand the imminent extinction of certain species. Taking this a step further, current food productionpractices are probably not actually doing us any favours in the long run.",

A cleaner and safer environment can increase the lifespan of someone, but someone who stays in a place that is dirty like the people in some under developed nations with poor and unsafe environment, their life expectancy is affected. Another thing that affects life expectancy is habits. Good and healthy habits will increase life expectancy.Another thing that many people do not talk about is the state of marriage.

Let's discuss. I consider heath care as a very big factor. I am a Nigerian and I have lived in the rural area of the country and I have also lived in the 3 major cities of Nigeria (Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt). There is something about the rural dwellings. Most of them die because of far proximity of hospital to their homes. Before the rural dwellers could transport a patient to the hospital, they will die.Also, the rural dwellers do not take malaria as a serious sickness as they neglect to treat it. And most of them die of malaria. Some will get to the hospital and no money for treatment as there is no health care package for the citizens.",

Migration, people from across the world migrates from one place to another, this mobility of the people also affect life expectancy of the people confined in a particular location, there's also war and natural disasters which is the key factor which triggers people to migrate from one place to another for a better settlement, food, water and shelter also causes a change in this because people will always depends on them for survival, these are the basic needs while accident as well is another major factor that affect life expectancy, people fall a victim of accidents in different categories and some managed to live while others die along the process, sickness is also what is very common and what the people eat as well, all these mentioned above affects life expectancy and is common to every geographical settings of the world.",

Terrorism is another factor that has affected life expectancy because these terrorist are everywhere in various countries terrorising and killing people daily and the painful part is that in my country, there is nothing the government is doing about it.

Apart from curative health system, the environment and nature also affect it. Our inner health is most important because we don't see what we have inside of our body, if we take proper care of what goes inside our body, our inner hygiene is important. Like you mentioned the role of apricot whose health benefits are numerous including good digestion, good eye sight and general health.",

However, I've seen old people in my country that have told me that you can eat whatever you want and whatever you wish to but the important thing is to enjoy the food and you eat it happily. I do understand that there are studies that if you're always happy, your life can go on for so long.
