  "content": "I just came across some somewhat peculiar news and that is that the well-known actor Tom Cruise, famous for his starring role in \"Mission Impossible\", brings us a new action... let's say an action related to our current times that is nothing more and nothing less than cryptocurrencies and the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.QuoteMission Impossible (Dead Reckoning Part One), one of the most anticipated movies of 2023, promises to be an exciting crossover of trends, exploring two of the most prominent themes of recent years: cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence.Figure: Tom cruise mission Impossible 7.Funet:https://diario.mx/espectaculos/lucha-tom-cruise-contra-la-ia-en-mision-imposible-7-20230709-2074477.html                    This film that relates to new technologies, I think it has the opportunity to change the way people see and use cryptocurrencies in general. Honestly, I don't know in what context these issues are related in the film, whether in a positive or negative way, since I haven't had the joy of seeing it yet. but what I do know and I am sure is that without a doubt The entertainment industry and the film industry are extremely influential and have a wide audience. and whatever the context, the film could arouse the interest and curiosity of viewers in these technologies (cryptocurrency and AI) in a fun and accessible context.but more than that I think that this film could break with some stigmas and negative perceptions that surround cryptocurrencies, presenting them as something exciting and full of possibilities. It could foster a more open mind towards these technologies and allay the fear or uncertainty that some people may have due to a lack of understanding. Personally, I don't know what you guys think, but I find it intriguing that they're producing movies related to this field on the big screen. What is your opinion about it?Funet: https://criptotendencia.com/2023/07/13/mision-imposible-tom-cruise-se-enfrenta-a-la-inteligencia-artificial-y-a-las-criptomonedas-2/",

Didn’t know there was an existing thread for that on the forum. Still a great material source for sure even with one yet to watch.Still, it doesn’t matter much if cryptocurrency was or is being used but the most importance is the context to the usage. The context that is being put to it defines just how the audience would perceive the innovation.Tom Cruise is a great actor, one of the best and have stared in key roles in several box office movies and this is another big one but, I do hope it carries the right notion about cryptocurrency. My feelings isn’t so good about this but, hope that’s an having the wrong idea.",

Sorry if it offends but usually a new technology will be considered as a dangerous technology that is contested by the enemy and the protagonist tries to save the world by taking over the technology. It's the same as the eyes of the gods in Fast Furious, isn't it?",

We know that all the movies made by Tom Cruise really make a lot of money.Now, here in the movie will surely be a blockbuster again, based on this story that is related to AI technology, it was mentioned that the opponents of Tom Cruise made a big transaction worth 100M$ using cryptocurrency not Bitcoin, it seems the villain is doing money laundering via crypto, and I just don't know if it's Ethereum or what. This Tom Cruise movie is a little different now. As far as I know, this actor besides Keano Reeves also holds Bitcoin, I just don't know what year Tom Cruise started buying Bitcoin.Source: https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-mission-impossible-movie-sees-tom-cruise-dealing-with-ai-and-cryptocurrency-3082857",

Could be positive, could be negative.Although I have a feeling they’re gonna put AI in a positive light and crypto in a negative one. So far, the closest thing I got to this was a few recent movies where an actor at one point says something like “I will pay in Bitcoin”. Nothing more, nothing less.OP, you said you’re excited about the way it can change how crypto’s perceived. I’m not, because we know how the wealthy want us to perceive crypto!",

Scammers are spread on the Internet and are waiting for beginners, so perhaps if these films carry out awareness campaigns, they will have a greater impact.Quote from: Baofeng on July 14, 2023, 11:33:32 PMIf this film mentioned Bitcoin then we could add them here: [Collection Thread] Series and films in which Bitcoin (or Altcoins) appear.It's been several months since the last movie I watched, I'm going to choose one of them on the weekend.",

There would be always a FUD and negative opinions about Bitcoin. Since there's an upside and downside of Bitcoin due to it's volatility. As long as there's a risk involved, there would be always a thing to say. It's already good that it's open to public for them to be introduced to crypto but you are right. No matter what others comments that doesn't matter as long as we mind our own business.

It's actually good you should try watching that. It's not actually related to crypto but the AI thing which is very intelligent you will love it.",

Can't blame them though, it helps the plot run along just like the nanotechnology explanation for most sci-fi films. Don't underestimate the influence of movies my guy, if I recall correctly, there's a person who defected to South Korea because that person saw the movie Titanic and that person sponsored a flight to rain down flyers of the movie The Interview in North Korea to hopefully inspire some of the people there to think about freedom.",

But all the same, the movie will give crypto a mainstream promotion since the first mission impossible was heavily watched and many also becoming actor fans who are looking out for his next big work.",

It won't be anything new if this movie mentions Bitcoin or cryptos in general, as many others have already done that, but it's a very major blockbuster, so unless it's a negative mention (cryptos being used by the bad guys), it's still great publicity. I think I've watched all the previous Mission Impossible movies, so I'll most likely watch this one as well.

Some old movies had depicted the reign of robots, and we got scared when we started seeing robots replace jobs. I believe this movie wouldn't portray AI and cryptocurrency in a way that would cause panic, but the reality is that advancement in the crypto and AI field has opened opportunities for new job creation, specialization and as a source of income. Unless one upgrades their skillset and knowledge of cryptocurrency, the possibility of earning in the nearest future may be slimmer than now when interest rates and charges are doubling up.This movie could also help push countries to adopt cryptocurrencies as a legal tender without strict regulators clamping down on the exchanges or crypto holders.",

So, the current trend is of both things and which is really on hype. And i think if the movie intend to cover them then this is good for crypto. Because this will create an image of how crypto and AI will be used to revolutionize the Finance and other sectors of life respectively. As the film is not released yet so how can you watch it.   The image of Crypto in front of people also depend on how it is being represented in the movie and how much time it is played in the movie. Because there are many other movies too exist which had showed the use of Cryptocurrency like in the latest film Fast&Furious 10 where i watched a short clip in which they talked about crypto but only for 1 or 2 second and they said, it in a way which would create a bad image in front of those who are new to crypto.Overall, i am excited for such news and hoping that such acts will being respect and will build trust among newcomers.",
