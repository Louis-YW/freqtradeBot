Be happy about it and leave them. It's not that cases like this are coming against them regularly. Which means they are paying legitimate gamblers. Why would they deny you for only few hundred dollars? Something did not add up about you of course. I would have an argument with them if they would say that they have confiscate everything.",

( maintenance was going on every single day since like a week so i thought no problem) then after i again tried to withdraw the balance , it was cancelled again but this time i was told i violated some terms which is quite impossible cos i ve been betting on sports since like 20 years, know how the things are going. i NEVER use bonuses, NEVER open accounts more than once and never obviously launder money. i just bet with small amounts and thats all. never even touched on casino or games etc..so they couldnt give me an answer of course about the violation, basically stole 360 usdt of the money -god knows why not more or less of it- and blocked my account, which i already asked from them after my first withdrawal failed, cos the site was a total disaster, impossible to bet cos of technical difficulties, so i told them to send me the balance and i ll close the accountanyway. i wrote to their licence provider in curacao, which looks like a complete joke compared to IBAS or any other serious foundation. not giving a lot of thoughts abt the money but giving u guys a heads up abt this site. i openly challenged them to declare my violation to public on their official thread here too but dont think they will either, since it doesnt exist in reality.good luck allps. this was the only ss i could take before they closed my accounthttps://ibb.co/B4CgkdMHi ziportan, apologies for your bad experience and thank you for waiting, we have checked your account and we came to know that your account is flagged by the provider's compliance team due to abnormalities found this may be referring to a member professional betting style has breached the fair play betting rules that might have violated and triggered your account to be suspended.Besides, after following up with the provider, I am happy to know that you have withdrew your deposit previously and the amount they were holding were only the extra winnings. Hope this is able to answer your queries. Please do not hesitate to contact us again should you required further clarifications.oh thats rich. `professional betting style ` with a few hundred bucks.. so apparently you dont want winners as members and when you do have them, just confiscate their winnings and give their deposits back and expect them to be thankful for the situation? jesus . there you go guys.. keep losing and you ll never have problems .. gl allQuote from: ziportan on October 07, 2022, 01:13:29 PMQuote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 07, 2022, 09:55:11 AMQuote from: BK8.Official on October 07, 2022, 09:42:41 AMBesides, after following up with the provider, I am happy to know that you have withdrew your deposit previously and the amount they were holding were only the extra winnings. Hope this is able to answer your queries. Please do not hesitate to contact us again should you required further clarifications.This a is a better solution. In the cases of scam accusations like this it close when the accuser get his deposit back. Additionally you can KYC the user so that next time they can not create another account and you do not need to go through same hassle of defending yourself again for the possible same person. There are many cases where player take the opportunity of being anonymous in crypto gambling sites and create multi accounts then comes to the forum with the hope of getting their deposit back once they fail everything.  here we go.. a genius..  taking someones winnings just because basically they are `winning` and kicking them off of the site is ok for you ha? and they need to defend themselves from me? seriously ? by doing kyc?  i already wrote that i was fully verified and also wrote that i was gonna close my account after the last withdrawal anyway so no worries that i ll ever use that joke of a site again.. jesusThis is not the first time this has happened, online gaming is an entertainment platform for all to enjoy and have fun, however they are always be someone to take advantage of the platform. Please be reminded that providers are equipped with competent intelligent compliance team to flag the abnormalities, hence, if the betting style/pattern/behavior has breached and violated the fair play betting rules, then the account will be flagged and suspended by the providers.",
