I don't think anyone who has basic crypto knowledge is going to trust this phishing site as XRP isn't going to launch any Airdrop when it's 2023 as it had been launched in 2012. But some new users have chances to participate in these fake airdrops and connect their account to be scammed because some of them rush to participate when they saw a newly launched airdrop without any research of legitimate. So mass awareness is needed. Basically we have to identify which is official campaign and which is just a trap.Quote from: ScamViruS on July 21, 2023, 05:46:00 PMAnd now because of Twitter's paid blue badge, it is becoming difficult to identify who is a scammer and who is a real user.

We must do own research before joining any campaign. If it seems suspicious then we must avoid in terms of security of our assets or wallets.

Well, I didn't mean it in the sense that Metamask or any wallet should individually spot and block every website one by one. Clearly that's an impossible thing considering new drainers with different domain names are created daily in large numbers. What I meant is that wallet services like Metamask or any wallet that allows web3 interactions (which usually called connectwallet), should establish an automatic security system capable of identifying unaudited and insecure smart contracts. These contracts are mostly exploited by scam web3 apps to steal all assets, token and nfts in the same way as a drainer.Here is a very simple example of how these drainer looks just before giving them permission to interact with your wallet, picture found is this article  [1][1]: https://nftevening.com/metamask-add-feature-to-stop-wallet-drainer-nft-scams/",

If they do that, the whole system will be centralized, and then there must be a central authority that allows and prevents smart contracts, which is very harmful to technology.The easiest solution, if you are greedy, is to create a new wallet in a computer that you do not use for cryptocurrencies or that does not contain any important data. In the end, if the wallet is empty, they will not be able to steal anything, and all your loss will be gas fees.",

I see that the blue checkmark feature has increased the rate of fraud on Twitter, as they delude users that they are legitimate by using this badge. Therefore, beginners believe them at first sight, after seeing the blue checkmark and the number of their fake followers, and through the large numbers of retweets and likes of the fake giveaway tweet; in addition, no one can reply to the scam tweet because only people who the author of the tweet has mentioned are allowed to reply, so they prevent negative responses in this way as well.Thank you OP, for sharing this warning. I hope newbies do their research first and don't believe anything on Twitter; even official accounts can be hacked, so they must be careful and make connecting their wallets the unlikely option.",
