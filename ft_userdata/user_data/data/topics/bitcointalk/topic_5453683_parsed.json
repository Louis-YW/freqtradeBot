IOU coins don't exist in the blockchain and are created out of thin air to make money by the exchanges. People don't understand this shit scam lol.Anyway, I'm surprised that you have missed sharing one of their biggest scams. They disabled Dogecoin withdrawals to manipulate the price in their exchange so they can buy cheap Dogecoin and sell higher. When Dogecoin was trading at $0.5+, it was way less than $0.40 in hotbit if I can remember correctly. It's because they halted the Dogecoin withdraw for a consecutive few months since Dogecoin started to pump. They forced users to sell at lower prices so they can make significant profits which they really did.",

Regarding the unofficial listing, I think they rule loosely even for coins that don't come close to the eligibility standards for exchanges in general. That being said, where the hype token has enough support and potential to contribute trading volume like Pitoken, at that point hotbit will be the first exchange to list it. It doesn't matter who submits a listing proposal, as long as they are willing to pay, the token will be listed seamlessly.",

Do you call them as scam exchanges?Don't call Hotbit as a scam exchange if you don't call the same with other exchanges because of their listing policy.At least I see Hotbit are doing good thing to give their users 1 month to withdraw money. At least they don't abruptly shut down their exchange, make a shady hack announcement and run with user money.At least we are not witnessing an exchange like Livecoin or a hack (scam?) like Cryptopia exchanges. You can not withdraw your money from those exchanges like with Hotbit.I don't know will Hotbit smoothly proceed all withdrawal requests from their customers in a next one month. If they announced like this and won't keep promise in next one month, we can call them as a scam exchange. Now, please don't make that call, not fair enough.",

Used this exchange some time ago because there are some coins that are only traded here so the opportunity to sell is only on this exchange, at least Hotbit is more responsible by announcing to its users publicly that it will stop its operations so that users can take steps to sell their coins which are only traded there or withdrawing Bitcoin or other coins that can still be sold on other exchanges, unlike FTX which looks fine but apparently has gone running away from its users' funds.",

He called scam only one thing that was IOU and now they stopping all operation then what will be given to these token holders? If you say token then there is no mainnet token live yet, if Usdt equal to their buying rate then there is no news about that.

Do you have any source of this information ?I wonder if this was true, then they would not have allowed people to get the funds back  Yes Bankrupted Title is wrong as Hotbit clear mentioned in article that they are stopping service for three reasons. Quote This decision is based on three reasons:Firstly, the deterioration of the operating conditions. After the Hotbit management team was forced to suspend operations for several weeks due to the investigation in August 2022 (https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495), the industry has experienced a series of crises, including the collapse of FTX, bank crises causing USDC off-peg incidents, resulting in continuous outflows of funds from CEX users, including Hotbit, and deteriorating cash flow.Secondly, the change in the crypto industry trend. The successive collapse of large centralized institutions has led the industry to gradually in two ways: either embrace the regulation or become more decentralized. The Hotbit team believes that centralized exchanges (CEX) are becoming increasingly cumbersome, with highly complex and interconnected businesses that are difficult to comply with, whether for compliance or decentralization, and are unlikely to meet long-term trends.and thirdly Hotbit has also suffered numerous problems, such as repeated cyber attacks and the exploitation of project defects by malicious users, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, the Hotbit team believes that the operation model of supporting a diverse range of assets is unsustainable from a risk management standpoint.

The currencies that can't be withdrawn at this time are BTC, ETH, USDT, LTC, USDC, and SHIB; you can try later in the next ten days; they gave a deadline of June 21st to withdraw so rest assured, I have seen a lot of videos of people who managed to withdraw their coins from the Hotbit platform smoothly on other platforms and wallets, what I see is that the Hotbit platform is not a scam exchange platform, but it stopped its services due to the many harsh conditions that it witnessed, you can also submit a request with your situation to their support via this [Link], and I hope that you will provide us with a screenshot of their responses to you so that we know how things will go.",
