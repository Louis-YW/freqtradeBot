  "content": "Hey guys, My wife and I have been investing in BTC since around the last ATH, so this coming halving is the first one we've experienced. As a result, we need to figure out a profit-taking strategy. I was hoping to get some input from the community here.We currently have around 1.5 BTC, and our ultimate goal is to be able to use that to help us buy a house and be able to retire at some point. Nothing too crazy. I'm hoping this bull cycle we'll be able to at least get a decent down-payment on something, then maybe over the next cycle or two be able to pay it off.Anyways, the strategy I'm considering is something like, when BTC crosses $100K CAD, (it's currently at $83K CAD) I plan on selling 0.01 BTC per week. Kind of like DCA but in reverse. Then possibly increasing that amount alongside BTC value, so if it crosses $125K, sell 0.0125 BTC per week, 0.015 per week at $150K, etc.Since it's impossible to predict exactly what will happen to BTC price over the coming bull market, I'm hoping to get a decent return over the course of the cycle without completely selling all of our BTC. Then when it inevitably flips bearish again, start DCAing back in like we have been up to this point.What do you guys think? Does that sound like a reasonable strategy? Is there anything else I need to consider?Thanks  :-)",

This reason has made many people sold their investment when they where not even matured. You guys should try not to sell all. A time will come when you will regret selling it at this price now.  Just as early adopters did and regretted later. To HODl $1.5btc is not an easy thing which you should know that many people might spent 15 to 20 year to be able accumulate such value keep HODling a little it is to early to see off. Like I said sell some and reserve some in your wallet, btc will set another ATH.",

Also whatever makes you feel comfortable to sell as long as you are bullish or earning a great profit then everything is fine. Just don't regret on any position you sell and think about you are already gain your desired profit since if you ask for more and be greedy then you might face the consequences of the action that you don't want to be in. Its great that season is in favor to holders or investors so lets take advantage and take home a good profit brought up by current good happening on the market.",

When will be a maximum time you wait to take profit and when will be the time you will exit the market no matter what price Bitcoin is at that time?If Bitcoin does not hit $100,000 but time is counting down to late of 2024 and Q2 of 2025, I will exit the market. I don't wait more than Q2 2025 to exit because it will be time for the bear to appear.",

Trust me I’m in my 3rd bitcoin cycle. What you're saying makes sense. My concern with picking a specific value and selling there is based on the experience I had when I first entered the market; I spent way too much when the price was still high. Had I been more patient and DCAd early on, I would've been able to buy more for less.The way I see it, if it does top out at $125K and I've only sold maybe 0.1 or 0.2 in that cycle, it just means I'll hold more for later. Conversely, if it tops out at $200K+ or even higher, I can ride it out for longer. I'd be kicking myself if I sell most of my BTC at $125K and then the price surges to 2x that or more.",
