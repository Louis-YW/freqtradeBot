Infected BIOS  is capable to deliver malicious payload to OS after boot no matter in what way the system was installed.Thus \"formatting  and reinstalling\"  the computer OS doesn't grantee \"that your device is 100% not having malware\". The question of \"whether it can influence the sensitive wallets  parts\" is a matter of research rather than believe. IMO.",

I had difficulties in installing other software, but Electrum is there already, so you have a good start. You have to boot from the USB, you need to enable persistent storage at every start, you have to disable network at every start and I think that you have to add electrum to persistent storage.As documentation, tails os website has a lot of useful doc/tutorial, also the blog I've linked in my previous post covers a lot, including what to do to create the bootable stick (which is imho the easiest step).",

A lot of older laptop models have WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity through modules that plug into the motherboard.  These things are usually pretty easy to get to if you pop off the access panel on the bottom.  If you can tell me the exact make and model of your laptop, I might be able to give you more specifics on how to remove that particular module.  Though if you're unsure about tackling this yourself, it wouldn't hurt to have an experienced technician help you out.  They'd know the best way to safely detach those parts without damaging anything.  Quote from: NeuroticFish on December 09, 2023, 12:56:35 PMIf this could be possible it will be less stressful than the above option but how do I get a tails USB ? Have anyone tried it before? To share the experienceYou can download Tails OS and installation instructions for USB from their official website: https://tails.net/install/download/ Be sure to verify your download before using it.I gotta say though, no software in the world can truly guarantee that your device is 100% air-gapped.  Your best bet is to just manually disable/remove the hardware if you really wanna go that route.",

Removing hardware is the only way to ensure your laptop is truly airgapped.In terms of the BIOS: You can always flash the BIOS with a clean version at the same time you will be installing your new OS.In terms of Tails: It works well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. There is no persistent storage unless you configure it, meaning that when you shutdown your computer everything (including your bitcoin wallet) will be wiped, and you will have to recover from your seed phrase back up next time you want to use your wallet. Also, the version of Electrum pre-bundled with Tails is 4.0.2. If you want to use any of the features released in newer versions since then, you'll need to download and verify the standalone appimage on a different computer and transfer it to your Tails computer (and then store it in the persistent storage so you don't have to do that every single time).",

Thanks for your help You should also plan on how are you going to transfer the unsigned/signed transaction to/from your offline laptop.After you install the new OS, and configure the way you want it, you should physically disable allports, USB, HDMI, Ethernet, SD card reader, Wifi/WWAN, etc.(Unless you carry it around 24/7 and you sleep with it, LOL).Use QR codes and laptop cameras to transfer the data between your air gapped computers.You could buy one of these QR readers that do nothing but read QR codes, this way you minimize a lot of variables. I think you can find them for cheap on Amazon, just make sure they don't have any internal memory or wireless smart crap on them and you are good. Use these to read the raw transaction that you have converted into a QR code from the air gapped laptop in order to sign in in the hot wallet laptop. This way you don't need to move the laptops awkwardly in front of each other to read the codes. Also you don't want the screen of your cold wallet laptop to be visible at any moment to the camera of a computer that is connect into the itnernet.",

But I do have an idea on how it could not be safe...Although I would need feedback on the idea. Again, I am by no means any kind of expert so this might sound dumb: If you were to use a air gapped computer, could you be vulnerable from connecting a device, like a usb stick, that you use on your gapped computer as well as on a different computer with internet connection? Would that still count as being air gapped or could that potentially be a kind of \"trojan horse\" delivery mechanism that compromises your security? In a nutshell: Could malware move sensitive data back and forth between the usb and the connected computers without you being any the wiser?",
