I see most of these results as ads basically come to think of it, a single open source wallet didn't pop up as part of the top 10 results. \"it's not only about doing your own research, it's about doing your own research in details\"",

The Internet has been seen as a dependent source of information, with people trusting the first search results as the most accurate, this leads most to mistakes. It's obvious this is one of the serious limitations of the Internet, with proper marketing, even lower quality products can find it's way to the top of responses during search",

Google search engine do gives wrong and misleading information. It has been happening for years and it is still happening while Google do not mind. The search is also an easy means some people are gotten exposed to scammers. You guys need to learn how search engines, especially Google, work. The results that we see aren't based on ratings by people or research done by specialists about the topic we are using for the search, but the results are based on SEO optimizations of those pages and websites. Have you ever heard about SEO backlinks and keywords and how websites use them to rank themselves higher in Google search results?So, it's all the game of doing SEO and getting your website and your web pages ranked high in search engine results, and that is how they generate traffic and possibly get more customers.It's true that someone who doesn't know how these searches work might think they are getting the best possible results about that thing, but that isn't always necessary because these results aren't based on best to worst, but they are based on strongest to weakest SEO optimizations.",

Since it has been established that not all of the results from Google search is accurate, the use of AI software can be a solution in this situation. What I have found about the use of AI for search queries is that unlike Google, the person can proble further and will eventually have the right information. And there are prompts that instructs AI to sift the incorrect information and to provide only the accurate and up to date information with the sources.",

I always find the discussion of “best x” should be personalized because it all depends on ourselves which ones are the “best” for us. But google doesn’t offer these explanations.
