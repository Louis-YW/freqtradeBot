Trading should not be taken as a means to earn income. Some people can use it to earn but in the process of trying, most traders lost and continue to lose money.AI or other dependence from those people are just a way for the people to earn money from you if money is requested from you, avoid.",

But if what they are saying is true only then otherwise i think they might be bluffing because I must have heard about some platform havin quantum computer to compute the data to make useful patterns out of past data so we could increase the chances of winning the trades. I might be wrong but let's hear from those have have some experience on this platform. Usage of AI is not a new thing but I don't think they have the full availability of Quantum computer instead they are just familiar with sum techniques which they might apply to increase some speed otherwise i think the same as before.",

Definitely a fishy company if you ask me.",

But honestly, this \"quantum\" wording that's being attached to projects is being used like buzz words these days.Most investors don't really care if it's all about quantum computing, AI or what. As long as they just see the words even without furtherly knowing if they're for real or what, it doesn't matter.Get to try it if you're legitimately not connected to them and let us know your experience.",

All they talk about is farming. Why should we give access to our assets to them? Does not that make the whole thing fishy? If they have the power and resources to predict good outcomes, why share with us? Because they are charging us secretly. And by staking our assets in their platform, we are giving access to our assets. That way, they can use that asset to benefit on their own. Their loss is your loss, but their profits are not your profits. You will always receive the same amount that they will give you. While you have the chance to do it on your own and keep all the profits to yourself, why let others do it? There are many CEX and DEX available for trading. Do it on your own and make the profits yours. If you lose, take that as a lesson and move forward. Use less money at the start. Use what you can afford to lose. There aren't any better options than doing it on your own. Don't trust any centralized shit.",

He is not on LinkedIn too and to be honest, their video looks like a gig bought on Fiverr. Also, they have APEX coin and its website is for sale. This website is an investment platform that lets you deposit money and as they say, then they trade with their AI on different exchanges to bring you profit.This is definitely a scam project and they use the word AI to make themselves appear cool and forward-thinking, it's definitely a lure, they have no quantum computer and no superficial AI trading bot. And it's based in London. I can say that most ponzi/scam companies are based in London, idk why but somehow it's very easy to do that in London. At the same time, London is known for many people as a financial center, this gives a false sense of positive expectations. Please don't invest your money on this website!",

As things stand, soon we will all become rich literally doing nothing, of course all thanks to AI and quantum computers - maybe today is the time to ask AI what the winning lottery numbers are and buy myself a tropical island for retirement days",

And if you are taking trading as your main source of income then it will be a completely wrong decision. But there are many people who want to use AI along with various social media to start a new business and gain profit. When starting trade with such AI it is seen that his money is lost so by using such video or AI, one can never start trading, but starting trade with own experience and knowledge can be profitable in future. If you trade with AI then it depends on others but if you learn about trading and then trade then you will be successful.",

Maybe the platform here is only using that name to look innovative.AI on the other hand is very legit and it is now being used up anywhere. Yet in terms of trading, I agree with what others have said that anyone even the experts, can't have a guaranteed income with it. If we are talking about staking, lending and the likes, then it is possible and a small return ( APY/APR ) is usually the one that is realistic or not a scam.",
