      "body": "Well, if you want your prediction to come to pass make sure your judgment/analysis is true. And you have to be a clean enough to see clearly to make that kind of true judgment... otherwise, you depend on luck or probability to win. And that would mean inconsistent achievements/wins.*Bet but don't gamble Post edited on Jan 21 , 2023 - 06:03am GMTPost before the edit can be found here: https://archive.fo/Ai1lh",

I love the string confident you do exert when influencing other gamblers to take a look on your prediction giving everyone the opportunity to win along with you.

Maybe I will consider your prediction this time. When someone do share up their bet slips and having that huge amount involved into that particular bet, then it cant really be denied that majority would be amazed on how confident and how risk taker you are on putting huge money on that particular line which not everybody could pull off.If ever this one  would be a hit then it would be ideal that this thread would turn out to be a tipster if ever he would be showing up some good record or winning rate on every bet he would makebut of course we do have current existing ones and this is why it wont really be that much needed but having some share up of their best if everyones freedom on doing so in a forum.",

      "body": "Brandon Moreno was coached by James Krause in his last fight versus Kai Kara France. Now that Krause is suspended from the UFC on insider trading allegations. I wonder if it will upset Moreno's progression in martial arts. Figueiredo is a complete animal at 125. I think the main chance for him losing is if he has a bad weight cut. As was the case for their 2nd fight where Moreno finished him.Hope you win your bet. Being able to consistently win at gambling is a good feeling. Its like owning your own money printing machine.",

Bro, you are really sure about this. I still remember your last bet and I do remember it also won. Congratulations on that. It's nice to see some confident predictions being made.Well, good luck with this one, again. Risky but worth the profits if it will win. I will tail you but I won't go too far as that kind of amount like yours. Like how I always bet, just the right money that would make me cheer for Deiveson Figueiredo. Love underdog bets, I wish it will win.For those trying to check the lines. Here it is. Figueiredo, Deiveson @2.09 - underdogMoreno, Brandon @1.89 - favoriteStake.com odds.Risky, so let's see how OP will end up with his bet tomorrow or later for another timeline. Good luck!",

Was waiting for this day to comment on this topic   , Deiveson Figueiredo lost the first two rounds and the fight is live and for Brandon Moreno to come to enemy territory he should be really prepared after all the fights they had between them and the third round is also going with Brandon Moreno as he is dominating the round.To change your title, there is two more rounds left   . Deiveson Figueiredo is beaten badly in the third round as well  .Edit: Doctor stopped the fight as Deiveson Figueiredo was beaten badly and it is time to change the topic title  .",
