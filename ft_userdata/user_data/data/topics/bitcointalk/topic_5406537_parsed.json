This article is comprehensive about it, A Billion-Dollar Crypto Gaming Startup Promised Riches and Delivered DisasterpThey created something unsustainable at beginning and reacted too late to stop the death spiral and they will have to create a very different model for their games in order to get rid of sell pressure and bring SLP, AXS back to higher price. It won't be done in short term and success or not, it will depend not only on time, general crypto market but also on their solution to fix their model.",

Let's come to the point, Already one has discussed it in detail so I won't go into that. But for now it's risky to invest in alt-coin where coin like this. But 10$ or more little amount is not a big deal.  I can't guarantee that it will 100% recover But it can be said that recovery will take a long time. So if you are going to investing for long term you can take a little amount of trade .",

Currently, the price is around 0.004037 $Really hard to determine on projects potential whether it could make out some good recovery or its already over for the said game/nft.If we do tend to look on its ATH and to its current price then we canreally say that it is really on the verge of death but surprisingly there are still people on the community who do still support it despite of earning capacity is less or not really worth anymore on someones time but if you do really trust up on the project for have to its recovery then you could always opt on accumulating since the price is way too cheap as of this moment.The only problem i do see with Axie Infinity and its coins is that it doesnt have burning mechanism which causes for its entire supply to go way beyond the heavens.",

      "body": "This topic should be moved to the Altcoin Discussion thread since we're talking about an altcoin called SLP.I'm sorry to say but I think it's kinda impossible right now for SLP to recover and may break its previous all-time high. With the declining number of players & trading volume of SLP and AXS, I can say that the hype already died. Yes the hype was real back then during the time Axie was red hot. This is what I have predicted all along. The more players who have entered the game, the lesser the rewards we get that forced the devs to keep cutting our rewards as their pool cannot be sustained for long.Now we're just treating Axie Infinity like the other traditional games which is for fun (but of course Axie NFTs, SLP and AXS as bonus perks that has the edge over the other non-NFT games in terms of ownership, custody, etc).",

Currently, the price is around 0.004037 $Do your own research mate, i haven't invested in SLP, neither will i. The market is in a bear time so maybe you should not invest in that as of now, it might be too risky. And if you decide to hold the SLP you have already, the thing is, can SLP be sustainable for the long period, or is/was it basically just all about the hype which it is currently lacking, and could your tokens continue to lose value as you hodl it.Quote from: blockman on July 16, 2022, 10:20:34 PMIf you have money to invest, take the first action on buying bitcoin and when you're satisfied with the amount you hold in btc then that might be the good time for you to reinvest in SLP or any other coins.

Currently, the price is around 0.004037 $All coins are huge dumped in this current market condition. even Bitcoin dumped around 70% from ATH. SLP is not a very good altcoin in my opinion. I have followed the behavior of this coin for a long time. And saw that it always drop this coin price and suddenly at some point huge pumped. Which is almost like gambling. So I am not too optimistic about this altcoin.",

We cant actually do much about its supply as there is no demand on the use case of slp. Once v3 is started to roll out on mainnet then possibly it could reverse its current price. They should prioritize a good revenue program to its investors and to lure more interested users. People started to have doubt when the slp is highly saturated already leading to massive dump.",

Many people have already gone away with Axie Infinity because of its declining value. I remember the time when the active players were at a million, but now, it's just in the hundred thousand. It's just a matter of time before it continues to decline. But by then, I hope they find a way to recover.There's nothing wrong in speculating about the price, as long as you can risk that amount of money.",

Currently, the price is around 0.004037 $I believe the Sky Mavis is still continuously developing Axie. They have released Axie Origins which they promised will have burning mechanisms that will eventually bring the price of SLP up. They also not have released the land gaming yet. All of these will bring the price of the tokens higher if executed perfectly. But as of now, these are all but promises. And all the remedies that they have released in the past to pull the price of its token up has failed. What can you do with your token? Well, you can bail out now and accept the loss or you can HODL. This is a waiting game. Since we are in a bear market and all cryptos are in slump, you can wait for the market to recover and see if SLP and AXS will recover with it. You also must watch closely the activities of SKY MAVIS. If they are about to release something good that could temporarily elevate the price of their tokens, you can take action on that. Take a risk or take profit when it happens.  Good luck with your investments.",
