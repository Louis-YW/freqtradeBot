If you stake coins without intermediaries, then the validator you choose cannot dispose of your coins, and even if the validator decides to leave, he will not take your coins. But stakers risk fines and slashes if the validator misbehaves. This is the order in the polkadot ecosystem, so if someone is ready to risk 100% of the coins for 10% profit per year, then he should carefully study the risks.",

      "body": "You are right to stake your MATIC tokens on the Ethereum or LIDO mainnet. I agree with this. As we know to move them from the exchange using the Ethereum network, which can be more expensive due to higher fuel costs. It may take time to recover costs through staking rewards. To submit your MATIC to Trust Wallet on the Polygon network without risk, this can be a simple and cost-effective solution. Trust Wallet is a reputable and secure wallet, so your tokens should be safe there. However, by not staking your MATIC, you are missing out on potential rewards and opportunities to contribute to network security. In my opinion, if you are not in a rush to stake your MATIC tokens and want to avoid high fuel costs, submitting them to a Trust Wallet on the Polygon network without staking can be a reasonable option. You can always decide to stake it later when you find a suitable platform or when Ethereum gas fees become more reasonable.",

I think this will allow you to store your MATIC on the Polygon network and avoid the higher fees associated with moving it to the Ethereum network.",

I have just found out about StaderLabs who offer liquid staking and accept MATIC on the Polygon Network.  Does anyone have any experience of using StaderLabs for staking purposes?",
