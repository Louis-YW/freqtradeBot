  "content": "The X-Metaverse DAO was established with the mission to gather more intelligence and resources to make the x-metaverse more sustainable. We decided to decentralize the authority to achieve open, fair and autonomous operation through smart contracts so that every DAO member of the community can provide real value contribution to the X-Metaverse ecosystem, making them the actual owners of the X-Metaverse in a meaningful way and gaining benefits from it.",
