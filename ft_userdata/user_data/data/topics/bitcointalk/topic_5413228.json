This is insane.”SHERLOC cites documents from the deposition of CFTC expert Patricia Gomersall, which shows inconsistencies in her sworn testimony, and a lack of general knowledge of the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, a previously sealed motion from Craters’ legal team for sanctions cites that “the CFTC and its attorneys prevented the court from making an informed decision and obtained relief in the form of what were crippling asset freezes against Crater and his family by blocking evidence.”“Crater provided documentation to the court that proved that not only did he not commit a crime, but that he didn’t control My Big Coin,” said SHERLOC co-founder RC Williams.“The CFTC blocked the documentation for their own gain so they could get their bellwether case and take control of the industry. Given the recent events with others in similar situations, including former President Donald Trump, we’re in very dangerous territory.”More, go to: https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/585562494/research-firm-publishes-part-one-of-u-s-vs-randall-crater-and-my-big-coin-exposewww.TheCongressionalTimes.com#CRYPTO #DOJ #CORRUPTION #BTC #ETH #XRP #Overreach #GoverementOverreach #winatallcost #LicensetoLie #Randall #RandallCrater #RandallCraterFlorida #MyBigCoin #IncidentforRandallCrater",
