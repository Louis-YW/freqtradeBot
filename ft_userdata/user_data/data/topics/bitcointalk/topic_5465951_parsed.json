There are newbies that I would say were here just to get a certain information related to bitcoin and stuffs like that and once they do they just leave off or even come by to read on some things that is why you see accounts of a two year still at newbie rank. Donâ€™t see them as lazy but as people that had different view coming here and. they got it. As for hunters it is clearly clear what they are here for and as such I wouldnâ€™t blame them either, as you are here for knowledge (which I doubt from your post history), they are here for bounties and luckily the forum provides space for everyone.

What did I do? I did watch educational videos aside from reading as well. Now I don't read that much anymore, and I'm more into watching videos. I'm only reading posts here, but when it comes to information, or knowledge, I always go to Youtube. Of course I know which videos I will watch.

Well, anybody can join into these bounty campaigns so... yeah I guess there's no solution to this one... or we don't need to solve this because it isn't a problem at first place. I agree with you. I will tell you about myself. Likewise, I also saw a video on YouTube and accidentally stumbled upon this forum. I was so excited about seeing the bounty reports and also seeing the \"beautiful\" videos on YouTube that I was hoping to get some money there as well. But all the excitement disappeared when I realized that every day a bunch of fraudulent projects are created that deceive people in one way or another. I confess that for a long time, I did not understand all those who do not participate in the bounty, watching how they write something on the forum. When I came to the forum, I did not know about the increase in rank and signature companies.When I sobered up from the Bounty Plague, the forum became interesting for me with its information.Now, I think it's not scary that newcomers come here for money. It's scary that they are in such a hurry. People should first build on the idea of a forum. Ask yourself what forums are for. This doesn't sound like a money-making site. Sincere communication should prevail here. The Internet is wide, and everyone knows how to use it. There is no need to post here using AI tools to plagiarize anything or invent non-existent stories about your Bitcoin business.Only real communication, real interest, and an honest existence give good results for newcomers and their reputation here.",

If someone comes to the forum just for the sake of bounty and is happy with it, then maybe he doesn't need any ranks?If someone does not read and study what the forum can give, then what is the point of him being here at all? Well, such users do not have new ranks, so there's nothing wrong with that. But there are also those who visit the forum for years, read, but do not write anything much, and also don't grow in ranks. And that's okay too.It is strange to consider ranks in themselves as some important goal. You can both get something valuable and interesting on the forum without any ranks, or get some ranks, but achieve less than someone who reads even without registering. It is not the ranks themselves that are valuable, but what you achieve. It seems so.",
