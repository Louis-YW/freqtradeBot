Very bad, that means lack of demand to the project. if the demand was high and the daily volume trade will be big but it will be counting only volume from the reliable exchange sites. The volume from the shit exchange sites were not reliable to be counted. Quote from: Ketesnuko on June 30, 2022, 07:58:45 AM is this the end or there is hope?.Actually depends on the result from the development. I do know that if everything were starting from the small but you can see how good the progress that already made and how many efforts that already made by the developers to increase the daily trade volume as well.",

Low volume is normal if the project is new and has just been launched. But if a project has been there for years and it still got a low volume, then you know the answer already.It's already the end of that project and it's about to be dead and for sure, it has been left behind by the developers of it and no investor is willing to invest on it anymore.",

But this time you should turn away from those coins if you are not yet invested in them and never turn back and read everything you need to avoid such traps in the crypto market nowadays. I think you may be fallen from their telegram group, who always talk about their future plans about their project but the result of the market is not showing us what they have told you. If that's the case, then it's a red flag already that you need to get away from that project as soon as possible.",

A project with good use case but still very young is now plagued with low trading volume, is this the end or there is hope?. It essentially means that the trading activity is low. To improve this, the marketing team needs to ramp up itself and start doing promotional stuff on different social media, conferences and online gatherings. Gradually there will develop a group of investors pumping and dumping the coins on a regular basis and the gradual growth of the name of the project.This is tough for a project that has already gone down and investing in it at this point would not be something I would recommend. Most altcoin projects end up dying out a painful death for it's investors as the developers abandon it and move on while investors are left with bags of junk coins.If the project is young and the use case solves a problem that actually exists, try to motivate their team and see if marketing can make a difference.",

A project with good use case but still very young is now plagued with low trading volume, is this the end or there is hope?.Daily trading volume is one of the main criteria for listing on a centralized exchange and, accordingly, its low level indicates that these coins are not of interest to investors. As a rule, a low level of trading is associated with low liquidity, which entails very high volatility, and accordingly a high risk from investing in such a coin.",

If it really has a use case then it will pull more investors and the product of that is high trading volume because of incoming high orders. So I don't understand how something with a \"good use case\" like you said is being plagued like that. Could there be another reason behind it? What's the project? Let's check it out. I bet you are one of their investors and have been waiting long enough for a pump to happen but it won't materialize yet. But we cannot tell how if we don't know what it is.",

It simply means that investors don't invest too much in the project so it wouldn't work in the long run. It will take time for them to progress. There are lots of potential projects that fail but there are also lapses and mismanagement by the developers. Nowadays, investors usually check the volume of the project to ensure that they're worth investing in.",

As long as the project is still in development, updated regularly, it is not a dead project. We're in the winter of the market if it's a new project then I think you should consider keeping them, if it's an old project you should stay away from them as much as possible, because that could be the end of it.
