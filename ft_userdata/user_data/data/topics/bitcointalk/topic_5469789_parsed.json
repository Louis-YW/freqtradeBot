If you spent even 1 second on reading my discord you'd realise Phoenix gambling is not in fact owner of this code.But since you're only interested in fast scam/profit he we are.ANYONE can go to my discord and check the update logs and see I, in fact, did do countless updates to the code base.That is something only I can provide thus giving the code for free is basically useless - You buy my support and future updates, the code itself is a bonus.Sadly a lowlife like you will never understand that.",

I'm allowed to change the code that is public and brand it as my own given the enough code was changed.The OP knew all these info prior to buying anything from me - He is still aware of it all but he will say anything just to hurt my business.First of all it's not always about 1 post or merit that a user intends why he/she try to share information on the forum. The decodx is a decent member and has been actively contributing on the forum for a long time and calling such things isn't fair at all. Well whatever you said falls into stealing of someone else's work and modifying it then claiming it as yours. That's a type of copyright theft if I'm not wrong, and selling of a code that's free is a type of scamming somehow. The public code always comes with a license and selling someone's work without their permission is illegal. And when it comes to OP, I can say that he got frustrated because someone sold him a code that's available freely on Github and that's why he created this thread and leaked the code. In fact he didn't leaked the code because the code was already freely available on Github.",
