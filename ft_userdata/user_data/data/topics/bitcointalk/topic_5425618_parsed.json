  "content": "I have been opportuned to be on the forum for a while and have learned how to earn, sell and withdraw via the Bitcoin exchange network. It was quite technically at first learning how to make withdrawal, but after applying the knowledge on more than one occasion, I can confidently make a P2p trade without assistance. I got paid for a certain job via my trust wallet, and although I have been unable to make withdrawal, I now want to withdraw the amount in my trust wallet to my binance. It has been a hand full for me and wouldn't want to risk losing my fund due to error of ignorance. What steps and how do I withdraw the funds from my trust wallet to Binance app?",

Trsutwallet is simple to use but just that it is not open source, use Electrum or Bluewallet next time if the deposit will be in bitcoin, they are open source bitcoin wallets.",

You wont lose a token if you did the process right. In terms of withdrawal, binance has p2p which you could cash out your tokens into stablecoin then into fiat. Note: KYC is needed when using the p2p feature of Binance.",

I do not think that exist on Binance, you have to use the spot trading to convert the token to any p2p coin on Binance, it does not need to be a stable coin, there are unstable coins option there too like bitcoin.KYC is mandatory on Binance, not only for p2p but for anything you are doing on Binance, you can not use Binance without KYC or verification.",

As such, the exchange is dedicated to maintaining KYC compliance. KYC not only protects the exchange, it also provides an additional layer of security to each user's account while allowing them to enjoy unrestricted use of Binance's services.Binance Imposes Mandatory KYC for All Users Amid Growing Scrutiny From Regulators WorldwideProbably you are talking about when Binance haven't made KYC to be mandatory, it is mandatory since last year, all Binance users have to verify their account with KYC documents before they can use Binance. If your brothers can still do that, that means Binance is lying, but I do not think it will be like that, ask your brother again if he can still be able to do that.",

First if your payment in trutwallet with coin BSC network like BUSD you need to buy little BSC coin for sending fees, maybe 0.0025 BSC enough as fees sending your BUSD coin. But if your trustwallet received with ERC20 coin network actually you need ETH as fees sending above $3 until $5.Better you can put your receiving address here to make easy explain about what have do you do if want sent fund from trustwallet to Binance app account.",

Note: You just need to make sure that you are sending on the correct blockchain to make your transfer safe.",

      "body": "Withdrawing from Trust Wallet to Binance is actually a fairly simple process, so you don't need to worry too much.First, you'll need to open your Trust Wallet app and ensure that you have the funds you want to transfer available in your wallet. Then, you'll want to find your Binance deposit address. You can do this by opening your Binance app, navigating to the cryptocurrency you want to deposit, and selecting the \"Deposit\" option.Once you have your Binance deposit address, return to your Trust Wallet app and select the cryptocurrency you want to transfer. From there, select the \"Send\" option and enter your Binance deposit address as the recipient. Double-check that the address is correct, as sending to the wrong address can result in permanent loss of your funds.After you've confirmed the recipient address, enter the amount of cryptocurrency you want to send and confirm the transaction. It may take a few minutes for the transaction to be processed, so don't worry if you don't see the funds in your Binance account immediately.Remember, always double-check your recipient address before sending any cryptocurrency to ensure that your funds are safe and secure.",
