  "content": "This thread is relevant to \"Bitcoin and Keynesianism\".I was watching an economist-politician's dialect, about war, money and technology[1]. He was asked of why he disapproved of bitcoin. He justified that it leads to oligarchy and makes it impossible for the state to control the money during crises and recessions. While the former is already debunked, the latter appeared to create me some interest, at least in the way he described it. He said he prefers of a digital currency that's controlled democratically from the citizens, essentially focusing on society's benefit instead of individual's. My first thought was: Sure. If the supply of that money changes based on the people's benefit, democratically, it can only help on blunting inflation and deflation, during recessions and crises.My second thought was: Isn't impossible to have the italicized part nowadays? We're being spied from nearly everywhere. Phone calls, messages, internet activity, movements, biometrics, conversation recordings etc., having our privacy invaded in most inches. Isn't utopian to try and convince people to civilize democratically under these conditions? There can't be true democracy without true privacy, and that's a fact, not an opinion.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97pUJTB8Ges, talks about bitcoin at 1:01:01. Don't know if English subs are available, though.",

Control over the money doesnt always solve recession and crisis, in fact problems can be postponed into the future with it. This is exactly how the crisis in 2008 was handled and it wasnt actually solved. There was some bailouts, but no solution. It was just postponed till now and made it worse, and we have to fix it now way into the future. You could also even argue that Bitcoin is the actually democratically controlled money.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 26, 2022, 08:55:29 PMQuote from: tadamichi on July 26, 2022, 07:05:48 PMYou could also even argue that Bitcoin is the actually democratically controlled money.I'll have to disagree: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397865.msg60144244#msg60144244I included the other posts so its easier for others to follow.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on May 16, 2022, 07:30:56 AMAs it was occasioned by Kakmakr, it's advisable to mention that democracy, which is the form of governance they describe, isn't the same as with consensus. In elections, you get to either vote for a party specifically, vote what the majority prefers, or simply leave the country. But, consensus is rather a decision you take free-willingly.Nor the number of nodes neither the number of people who're running nodes matter. All it matters is what you do. If you want to make transactions reversible, change the block subsidy, the difficulty etc., there's nothing stopping you. But, you don't change bitcoin that way. And this applies to everyone, regardless of the percentage, regardless of their economic strength, regardless of their influence. The moment the majority changes a principle, that very moment, they stop being the majority. In democracy, the BCH users would have to switch back to BTC, because as it seemed, the majority didn't want it. But, in consensus, they can have it; they can switch to BCH V2, BSV etc., if they like. They don't have to care what the others say. I actually agree with your definition and this is what is actually needed for money in my opinion. I called it democratic, because i didnt know how i should describe it otherwise, but yeah its consensus based money. But i think this is whats actually needed, everyone is open to propose ideas or implement them themselves, but they gotta get consensus for it, or they simply stay in the minority. This leads to a competition of ideas and the best one wins.For money this is desirable, because it tends to monopolize to the best one. The one that achieves a balance between individual interests and societies benefit. A money that has no users will have no worth, so it cant focus on just serving specific groups interests. And a money that doesnt serve its users will keep loosing users and thus lose value over time, so it also cant ignore individuals interests. I disagree with the author and i think individuals interests and societies interests balance each other out, you cant just serve one. In a free market the money that achieves this balance best, will get most users and thus have most value and win. In markets with legal tender government currencies, theres room for 2 currencies, soft and hard money, while the hard is the one that will be used as a store of value. And will replace the soft money as a medium of exchange, once the soft one has lost too much value. This cycle is expressed in greshams and thiers law. So to make things short the best consensus based money is actually what achieves a balance between societies and individuals interests. If it doesnt do this, it simply wont be adopted by the majority anymore. If it stops doing this it will be replaced by something that can do this better over time. I dont think its privacy what would make democratic money fail, but that it would end up with a weird mix of properties that satisfy neither of the interests. Ideas cant be proposed or implemented without approval. And you basically have a completely theoretical process where ideas need to get the most votes before theyre implemented and proven in practice. It would be opaque and not clear for most voters what the best decisions are, and not everyone is a monetary system designer or has ever thought about this, this can also backfire heavily where the group with the most votes will simply serve themselves and thus not benefit society anymore. Consenus based money allows us to simply let ideas compete in practice and it will be clear by itself which one serves everyone the best after enough time. It gives everyone their voice back, that can be lost in democracies.",

Brainwashing tactics are nowadays inevitable to succeed, because those in power know (nearly) everyone's responses. Now i got it, i agree with you. There can’t be democracy without privacy. So I’ll add some points. It also changes the behaviour of people when they know they’re being watched. This has economic and social consequences as shown in states like china and east Germany. People might conform to the government, even when they personally disagree with it, because they know they’re being watched or it could be used against them. People might also start to trust other people in society less and try to maintain a public image that conforms to the government, so they won’t share their real opinions with each other anymore. So people could start doing things they disapprove of even tho most disagree with it, simply because information isn’t shared between each other.The population is supposed to put checks on the government, but this becomes impossible without privacy.",

It is only bitcoin can remove oligarchical tendencies in the Democratic system in the whole world. The few people that are accumulating wealth from the detriment of the poor will no longer have the access to steal in the state. And I also agree with the him on the part that, the Economy of the state will be out government (the oligarchy) control, though government can still control their Wallet. In the real modern democracy right now is in the hands of the few (Oligarchy) but bitcoin will take over the world governments, democracy will be become an Utopia, which will create equal opportunities for all. That is why most countries see it from that way and ban the uses of bitcoin in their Countries. Even the definition of democracy is an opposite to the modern  government. Democracy is the government of the few not for the people.",
