By default, the router is set to a high-security firewall.So it is safe than connecting to public wifi unless there is someone who is also connected on the same router and has permission to your device then he can retrieve data from your device or without permission maybe he can able to brute force and retrieve data from your device.",

You should be safe in theory, I don't see how using your own router could cause any security breaches in this case.As long as no one can access your computer or servers via ssh, for example, I don't see what you have to worry about.If you were using a public hotspot, of course, you might be better off using a VPN, or even Tor. But on your personal router, I don't see the need.Which type of security key does your hotspot have? Is your router fairly new or very old?",

But on your personal router, I don't see the need.I think with public Wi-Fi hotspots, it's totally dangerous to use them, especially when operating a crypto wallet even with the use of the VPN. Just yesterday, I saw a video of a hacker explaining how he can hijack a victim's device by creating fake public Wi-Fi hotspots which the victim then connects to unknowingly thinking that's a public hotspot only for the device to land onto the hacker's radar.",

Because that's why I found online, I just want to make sure that me using a router is safe. I mean if you use a weak password on your private Wi-Fi, it would still be risky as hell. Public Wi-Fi is more likely to be targeted so it is obvious why you should not rely on them if you want secure internet access. On top of that you can't really modify the settings and the host might run some terrible set-ups or run them with malicious intentions.I guess you can list your router configurations or product model if you want a detailed guide on how to set it up properly (or if there is a better product for your purpose). As an alternative, you can just disable the Wi-Fi and just connect your RIG through LAN. CMIIW.",

Man-in-the-Middle attacks are actually easier to do on a public hotspot / WIFI of course.But I think that using a VPN or TOR should be enough to protect you from them, as your traffic should not be visible to the owner of the network in question. In theory, if your traffic is end-to-end encrypted, the attacker won't be able to see or modify your data. I'm not saying it's ideal, I'm just saying that with a minimum of protection, it's theoretically feasible. This is not my specialty, so if a specialist wants to correct me if I'm wrong, I'd be happy to learn more about it.",
