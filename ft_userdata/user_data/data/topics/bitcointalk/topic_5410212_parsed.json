If someone want to say Bitcoin \"ends\", then the whole world has to let go of Bitcoin. however, we must also remember that, the dream of Shiba trading 1:1 against the USD, is far from logical. because, if Bitcoin ends, then all altcoins likely dead. The reason is, there is no more trust for crypto when this happens, since the crypto currency mother has been died, there will be a really big sell-off that consumes the entire liquidation of coins/tokens on all exchanges. But, can something like this happen? Impossible, too much money to spend to end it all.",

It's the law of supply and demand as always.Maybe you are right with that because at the end of his sentence he mentioned the meme coin shiba inu but how come that shiba inu can be valued at 1 dollar a piece when the inflation peaks? He said btc will be dead the moment it happens and other cryptos will end up on the same path. But let say they won't be dead and they will still remain.The only negative effect that the inflation can cause to them is that their value will fall off drastically, more with those meme coins like shiba inu. Op forgot to add vice versa on his title. Inflation is the one that will end and not bitcoin's and when that happens, bitcoin's value will now be on its peak.",

Well, marketcaps is the basis of being realistic here and we should always aware of this. Bitcoin will rise faster than the inflation and that’s a good thing because it proves that investing really beat the inflation compare to savings account that can only give small interest. There’s a lot of bullish prediction for next coming years, it’s good to take action now.",
