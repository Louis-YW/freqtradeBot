  "content": "There is an ongoing treasure hunt for 20 BTC which I have been trying for some weeks now. I haven't seen any mention of it in this forum. There is a hidden private key in an article written by Max Keiser in Bitcoin Magazine (Salvador Issue), at least that's what he says. Has anyone been trying to solve this thing? Would anybody like to join up and try to crack it?! In the tweet where Max mentioned this there is also a picture of him holding the Salvador Issue of Bitcoin Magazine, and it reads this:Quote from: Max Keiser\"I hid a private #Bitcoin key encoded in this piece I wrote for @BitcoinMagazine. Nobody’s figured it out yet, but it’s for 20 BTC\"  [1]He also gave a clue about considering \"Mirror writing\":Quote from: Max Keiser“Mirror writing: neurological reflections on an unusual phenomenon”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117809/    [2]Here is the .pdf of the article in case anyone is interested in helping solve this!https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUozvNCTt1RMwCaN1O5TytE5fBlq1EUr/view?usp=share_linkHere are the reference links mentioned:[1] https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1632068898169450497[2] https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1632391507008278528?s=20",

Has anyone been trying to solve this thing? Would anybody like to join up and try to crack it?! I saw it advertised somewhere, I’m not even sure if I believe it. Whilst I respect Max Keiser as an uber early adopter & obviously super rich guy, he’s a bit of a grifter. He likes the sound of his own voice, he’s been saying $220,000 is in play for the last 3 or 4 years, he talks crap.I dunno if this is just a publicity stunt. A bit like his theatre with the El Salvador President.",

This way the publisher of the magazine will most probably share some of the revenue to Max Keiser.Why would someone put 20 BTC worth of treasure in a magazine and even they have done such thing then why have the announced it publicly via news that there is a hidden treasure in that magazine? That sounds like professional tactic to psychologically take advantage of those greedy fellows who will always do their best to crack such things, and unfortunately will never be able to do so.",

The source is already on the OP and it’s not necessary needed to paste the sources every time he post it on same thread which the source is already available.Even if someone reported him and moderator accidentally ban him. I’m sure his appeal will be approved easily since it’s too obvious that he is not owning the quoted statement from twitter.20BTC is too good to be true. I’m sure some random guy will able to claim it later on and turns out it’s his alt account. No matter how rich and generous he is, No one will or it’s very rare someone throw 20BTC for just a game.",

It'll only pull traffics to the article, now everyone is sharing the link on different forums and social medias. You may be right, his alt account will come shouting that he got the funds, or nobody will claim it at all. He owns the clout, so the views and responses won't be new to him anymore, but he must be finding this funny too, how everyone is more interested in a free bitcoin.",
