What would be the alternative mining software to continue to mine BTC with similar profits as before?Thanks!There won't be similar profits to the ones before Ethereum shift,however with those cards you can still use Nicehash to mine Ravencoin and get paid in Btc,it would be like 30-35% of the 100% of the amount you made daily before the shift but this is the best anyone can do now.The community is also waiting for that long successor of Ethereum which is Ethw but I haven't heard what is going on with that project so far,I know the testnet is there but I don't know nothing about the main net.",

With 10 RTX 2060 you are welcome to 1$ per day, this is crazy.the reasoning behind it is that they think they are mining the next ethereum in its early stages with low difficulty. it's a coping mechanism, after a few weeks/months of mining at a loss they will capitulate and turn off their machines, then only the ones with free power will remain.

There cant be that many people out there with free power.Apparently it is to early to come to an end result as most probably it will go even more down in the coming days when more people release that their power bill is much more expensive that the reward they get from mining ETC.I also believe that there are not that many people with free power,right now a 300 Mhs makes you 0.7 and 1 Ghsh makes you near 3 dollars daily,so 1 Ghsh to make you 90 dollars monthly is not that great and most probably the power to run a 1 Ghsh farm or rigs is much higher than 90 dollars.I believe we will see a downgrade of the network hash rate with the passing of a few more days,most probably next Monday can be a decisive day as one week from now is enough time for anyone to make better cold judgement.",
