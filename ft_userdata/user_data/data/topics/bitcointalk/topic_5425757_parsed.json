If everyone is saying crypto, you’d still be wise to be in Bitcoin… I get that this site isn’t the most crypto friendly, but that’s mostly because “crypto” became a thing so that people could take your Bitcoin from you. I’m not saying people should have no crypto exposure, but if you own more “crypto” than Bitcoin I can probably guess your net worth…",

So I guess it's nothing to do with \"not bitcoin\", or \"just crypto\" post or thread.Hopefully you will understand this. And I would suggest that you read some threads and understand everything first regarding Bitcoin and what you call Crypto in general.",

Crypto is not the same thing as Bitcoin.But in my experience, most people don't know what crypto is, nor have they ever heard of it. This is not the case with Bitcoin.Quote from: Guessti on December 04, 2022, 08:07:31 PMMods deleting ANY threads talking about this.Do you have proof of this?",

And if I'm not mistaken, this has been debated as well in many threads, depends on how you interpret it, but for me, Bitcoin is Bitcoin.Quote from: Guessti on December 04, 2022, 08:07:31 PMMods deleting ANY threads talking about this.Maybe the Mods have reason for deleting a threads, not just related to his whole Bitcoin vs Crypto semantics thingy.",
