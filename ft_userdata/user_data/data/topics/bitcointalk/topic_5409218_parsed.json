Artificially closing and reopening the economy will make a high unemployment period followed by high training costs and a longer time to get the same level of productivity;This was probably handled the best by governments imo. I didn't see any/much news on there being pharmaceuticals having to isolate on ships or at ports (these normally have the most internationally intensive operations - chips/semiconductors did take a big hit though). Quote from: mu_enrico on August 09, 2022, 08:34:37 AMLockdowns obliterating small/home businesses;This is where the UK government went really slow (and probably a lot of other places too). Most people who weren't running a formally/publicly listed company had a longer wait to be included in furlough (this was fine for a lot of people but it probably incentivised some to break lockdown rules).",

Their principles were more focused on containing the covid as well and now we are seeing monkey pox which the experts have stated that it might not be converted into a pandemic, that might can change any moment therefore loosing people would be way worse than loosing economic stability. *The Green agenda* might be needed because pollution is all time high, they are not following the wrong principals but they are definately doing the wrong execution.

It is not, the government took the best decision if we are to talk about that on covid-19. During the covid-19, the government choose to lockdown the economy, choosing between the good devil and the bad , of extreme decision that it saving life first against economic growth. The economic growth is pushed by man power and if the government didn't close the economy and allow more people to die then the economy will find it more difficult to grow. I think is a right economic decision to lockdown the economy at such times.",

China is the global factory and when the Chinese production gets disrupted, it creates shortages around the world, which leads to inflation.Yes, the massive money printing and stimulus packs created the inflation we see right now, but they actually saved the economy from a bigger depression, mass defaults and gigantic unemployment rates.Yes, the \"green industries\" have a big influence over the governments and political elites.

I know there are family planning programs, but is reducing the human population at the heart of the overall lockdown?We were knocked down because of the Lockdown where the government was not ready with anticipation, the spread of Covid at that time was misused for buying and selling drugs but don't we see the mainstream media showing pros and contracts about lockdown? Let's say the lockdown is for those who are ready, but for those who can only last a day, they don't care about the lockdown just to survive and provide for their families, they are willing to oppose this one-sided policy.Quote from: Despairo on August 09, 2022, 09:26:09 AMPrinting money isn't only used for incentivize people which doesn't work, but it's mostly for government expenditure.Are the incentives during our lockdown getting an even distribution phenomenon? channeled into the hands of the needy? maybe not, because there is always someone who wants to take part.Quote from: Despairo on August 09, 2022, 09:26:09 AMA green agenda is very important because global warning isn't a joke, if you don't care with the environmental, you will harm the earth in the long run.I agree with this agenda.",

I mean they've called it an agenda themselves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset. Recession is a meat and drink for those in power currently. After the pandemic, there's unemployment, inflation - poverty in general, which creates the need for an organized and globalized state. QuoteAccording to a May 15, 2020 WEF article, COVID-19 offers an opportunity to \"reset and reshape\" the world in a way that is more aligned with the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as climate change, inequality and poverty gained even greater urgency during the pandemic.Quote from: pooya87 on August 09, 2022, 01:14:52 PMI don't think there is any agenda it's just that they are too dumb to come up with a better solutionThey're smart, because they've made you think that way (plural).

Majority of the people are also scared during that peak so they just agree to this rule but even if they don't they will still be forced or else they will pay big for it.Anyway, the effects of the pandemic are starting to get lowered and the economy is returning back to normal again.

Are you somehow suggesting Ukraine shouldn't defend her territory but focus on covid. In my opinion, the threat to their territory is a much bigger problem to them than covid was or ever will be.",
