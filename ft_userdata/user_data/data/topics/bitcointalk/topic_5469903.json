      "body": "Yes, one of the greatest advantages of bitcoin is that it is decentralised, which is why many people trust it because no one or nation has control over it.And again, for sure, bitcoin has helped a lot of people in Nigeria so far, and it is still helping others, most especially the youth. If not for bitcoin investment, many youths now in high institutions and universities will suffer a lot, but with it, those who learn to believe and trust bitcoin are making money, while those who think that bitcoin is a scam will always stay the way they are with our financial stability.What I can just say is let us educate other friends of ours that are still seeing bitcoin in a negative way. If they are willing to join, then better if they are not, then we leave them.",

Naim be the reason why government put the ban on crypto. Because them no wan do something wey no go favour them. If to say people gree say make crypto currency dey centralized, Dem for no ban am. I been dey think of how government go allow the citizens to fully adop crypto currency for every online transaction, and to receive bitcoin in binance and Cash out from local bank. But when I reason say that time e no go dey decentralized rather centralized. And Dem go dey penetrate the Bitcoin wey dey our wallet say na tax,vat,sms charge or even maintenance fee.there making you not to have total control over your Bitcoin account just like local bank. So I come dey talk say make them no even remove the ban again because na the ban dey make us enjoy p2p transaction.Another one na how Bitcoin don provide means of income. reduce unemployment, cyber crime, scam and many more. And with time corruption go reduce drastically because if BITCOIN touch your life e no go remain the same again. I must confens say e don alleviate poverty. Apart from God the only saviour we have in this world is BITCOIN. Sometimes I ask who gave Satoshi nakamoto this idea? It can only be God.",

But with bitcoin, Â a lot have changed over time and we are beginning to see the effects of that bitcoin revolutions on the entire global economy and a lot of freedom has been given back to the people through the adoption and right usage of Bitcoin to solve all the financial needs where the traditional financial system will give limitations to such freedoms, Â this makes Bitcoin becoming the best alternative currency.",

Bitcoin do not give the government or central authority the power to have any of the two controls. But according to your post, you are referring to central authority control, like the government. But regarding economy, bitcoin is an asset and its price is controlled by demand and supply. People buying more and the coin is becoming more scarce which makes its price to increase. In short, bitcoin is an appropriative asset and that is how I see it is helping Nigerians, for people to use it to hedge against inflation.",

Make sure you know when to invest and when to trade. Bitcoin was created mainly for p2p and not for third party control. You send directly to the recipient wallet and nobody can block or obstruct the transaction and there is no monthly charges. The economic leaders might have tried their best to stop bitcoin but since there is no central control system, they could do not so they let it be. Bitcoin is the best ever for now. Because the matter the amount you have in you account, nobody can come block your account and ask you how you manage to get this money. This this happened in the aftermath of #Endsars when the Federal Government froze some of the protesters accounts and sued them to court and when they discovered that many people used bitcoin to save their money den no come fit do anything again so they just leave those people. There are plenty people that are using Â bitcoin in Nigeria but the people wey no dey use am nai plenty pass. And I believed non of those people wey dey use bitcoin e dey poor, everyone dey do well in their little ways and for those wey dey the forum sef dey do well.

Yes, I agree with this. One of them that you are referring to is wire transfer. Wire transfer can take days. There are some other ones but they are also costly just like wire transfer.

If Nigeria government force those exchanges to have offices in Nigeria, have some workers from Nigeria and regulate them like banks and using them to generate internal revenue, it would have been better.To some extent, bitcoin is helping some people involved in bitcoin trading like P2P and making money from it and contributing to the economy. If someone make money from a business (which can be bitcoin business or related), the person will buy goods more and give works to people for the people to render their services. Which means this can help in increasing production, but it is left to the government on how they make citizens produce the goods and services locally, or keeping on depending on imported products and services.",

Where you have to say yes sir before it can be done, where you have to give a bribe before it can be process, you have to pay and lobby to make things faster. However, presence of bitcoin na very transparent technology wey we go dy see wetin dy happen through, it will be visible and transparent for everyone to see.Just visualize how the central bank would be better today if they have adopted bitcoin and pay people in bitcoin, the rate of corruption in nigeria is going to drop because any money you spend and embezzle will be transparent and anyone that cannot be accounted for will be seen from the blockchain. But will bitcoin be welcome in our central bank, no.Bitcoin also has power to make people make payment without any fear and have to wait for approval, as long as it's your money, you have the private keys# you will send amount to any person without any middle person or maybe a point of failure, bitcoin doesn't fail.Aside from the other benefits, we need bitcoin because it appreciate in value, if you have ever have bitcoin when it was around $4000 during the bear market but with time, it went above previous all time high, anyone that happened to bought n that price should be in good profit. This is why we as Nigeria, need bitcoin to store our assets.",
