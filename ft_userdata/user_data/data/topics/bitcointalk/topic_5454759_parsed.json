I can't really surf the internet for all, I believe it would be easy if contributions are added.There are already popular guys like GameKyuubi the Creator of Hodling(HODL), laszro the first person to make transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and Lot's more. Would like to kick this off by talking about Wences Casares . Casares wasn't convinced of Bitcoin claims and hired security teams for $500000 to hack the bitcoin blockchain around 2010. After 6 months of having No result he gave up and became a Bitcoin evangelist, ironic that he even created a Bitcoin security firm Xapo.Contribution will be appreciated. It shouldn't be a wall of test something concise and straight forward.  Thank you",

History on BitcointalkThis topic is great for a newbie to start recognizing the history of BTC and how things have went back then and how people tackled them. I found this thread really amazing for me as i came to know about it a few months ago and i am on this forum for more than 3 years. But if you still want to gather other's opinions here on this topic then please try to continue some unique ones which are not already covered in my mentioned thread.",

Are you trying to make a list of people who contributed to the early development of bitcoin? Start with people who were there from the beginning like Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, Gavin, or Sirius. There's a number of early bitcoin developers you might be interested in, just google the phrase. The (drunk) creation of the HODL word is really not that important compared to what some developers did for bitcoin.",

I'm talking about the Legendary thread- I am pretty confident we are the new wealthy elite, gentlemen.Can you imagine how much his forecasting capability was? He was so confident, so sure about the domination of Bitcoin. He mentioned in his post that even with 10 Bitcoin, you are going to be a very wealthy man. Well, at ATH, 10 Bitcoin were worth $690000. I don't have any idea how much this sum means to well-developed countries like the USA, and Canada but here in my local, it means a lot. 90% of the total population doesn't have this amount of money. He was able to speculate the future and it happened. For me, this is the most Legendary thread in the forum. Everytime I read the thread, I feel goosebumps.",

They are not \"superhumans\", there are thousands of people who stand behind them (PR-managers, security, financial staff etc). There are no such individuals who can successfully control other people on their own. All the \"famous individuals\" are just brands created by large companies.",

He was the dude behind satoshidice and he sold it for 126k bitcoin, obviously he doesn't have it all now and spent it on a lot of startups and that's understandable, people that high usually do not stop and just retire with a mojito in their hands at Bahamas, they keep working. Still, that money is about 3.7 billion today, he must have a lot less than that, and he distributed some of that even that day because he had shareholders, but he must be pretty rich anyway. After that he kept on doing stuff, like coinapult, shapeshift, bitinstant, and some other stuff he invested. So we could consider him as one of the first successful entrepreneurs in the crypto space, he did what everyone would love to do and achieved it so early on.",
