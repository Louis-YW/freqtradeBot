Bitcoin has a total supply of 21millon of which about 90+ percent has been mined already and the remaining supply would not even been mined totally any time soon.However if the entire supply is mined, miners will now have to focus on rewards they get from confirming transactions.Also transaction fees may increase in the future when the total supply is mined but future fees is not only depent on the miners as ordinals,forks and other factors have a great role also to play in the future.",

Going forward, with bitcoin mining quantity dropping won't miners decline inordinately too affecting the bitcoin network security if one of the two is not constant ?Treat this as a harmless question.This could actually be a real problem that many people here would try to shrug off.The good thing is, the block rewards will not completely disappear until something like 2120 (quoting from memory), but they're being slashed in half around every 4 years, so unless BTC keeps appreciating in value in line with the reduced block-rewards, miners would be reliant on the fees in a not-so-distant future.The problem is, blocks can't fit that many transactions, so unless the fees are huge, the financial incentive could be much lower than it is today, which, in turn, creates a potential security threat (i.e. unused mining power being used for double-spends etc).Pushing people off the blockchain into 2nd layer solutions (Lightning Network) could solve the problem of high fees for BTC users, but it makes it even worse for the miners.This problem is definitely worth discussing, but, at the same time, I wouldn't be getting stressed too much about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get there. At the worst case scenario, with enough community support, we could change the algorithm to something else.",

      "body": "The hash rate will at some point peak, and then likely fall a bit until it reaches an equilibrium based on income from tx fees alone.This will mostly take place over the next 20 years or so, by 2044 the block reward will be less than 0.1 BTC. Today with a 6.25 BTC block reward and a price of $38k that's about $237k reward plus fees. In 20 years with a ~0.097 BTC block reward and let's say a price of $1.2 million ($1 mil to $1.5 mil is a likely price range at that point) that's about a $116k reward.So sure in dollar terms reward will likely drop by half over the next 20 years, and even more when considering inflation. But over these 20 years mining will also continue to become more efficient, both in terms of efficiency of ASIC mining devices as well as the industry continuing to find cheaper and cheaper energy prices as the market naturally settles into the most efficient places to mine, including likely a large increase in cheap renewable resources used for mining. So while the reward will drop in real value, so will the cost of mining. Also tx fees will likely be 5-10x higher by then on average, thus helping to offset some of that decrease in reward value.There's never going to be some big drop off. So it won't really cause a problem. At some point likely in the next 20 years mining hash rate will peak as Bitcoin's price stops more than doubling each halving (thus making the halving overtake price gain in terms of mining reward) and so mining margins will start becoming tighter and less efficient miners will be kicked out of the market permanently. Hash rate will likely gradually drop until it reaches an equilibrium balancing the small but still dropping mining reward, the probably slightly increasing tx fee reward, and the more efficient mining machines plus cheaper electricity used for mining.And there is zero problem with hash rate reaching a peak and then declining a bit to an equilibrium. That equilibrium hash rate will likely be higher than it is today. And even if it isn't, Bitcoin mining is so large today that the bitcoin blockchain is globally secure (as in nothing in the world can attack it) and has been for years now even when the hash rate was much much lower. At this point there is essentially no threat of a 51% attack possible. The biggest threat would be if several very large bitcoin mining operations went out of business and sold all their mining machines on the cheap and they all went into the hands of a single malevolent actor. But that isn't remotely realistic for many reasons. So even as some miners are turned off and the hash rate declines and then reaches equilibrium, this doesn't really cause any problem for Bitcoin because it is already well past having reached the level of being globally secure and the equilibrium level will certainly continue to be globally secure.And of course it mining has no effect on the amount of transactions or the cost of transaction fees (as lots of people think) so there is also no affect on the operation of bitcoin either. When hash rate starts its temporary, though likely fairly long, period of decreasing toward an equilibrium the change will be gradual over many years so the difficulty adjustment easily handles that and there won't be any exacerbated transaction congestion issues related to this.And by the time by late this century when the block reward is just about all tx fees, the mining industry will likely be running entirely off a combo of stranded already-built renewable energy with near zero cost of operation, as well as operating at most renewable energy power plants running only off excess power generated at high generation times thus being very cheap. So the vast majority of electricity cost for the mining industry by then will be extremely cheap as the market will have settled into the cheapest and most efficient places by design because those will be the only places where mining can still be done affordably. But with an entire planet of such places there will still be plenty of mining happening at a globally secure level.",

Yea the time to completely mine bitcoin which is around 2140 is very far from now but before that time I donât think there will be much significant change again. The reward will be around 0.1 come 2044 which is 20 years from now from beyond that time the reward to mine a block wouldnât be too enticing again.
