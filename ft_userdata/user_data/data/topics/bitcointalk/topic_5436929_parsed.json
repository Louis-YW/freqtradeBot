Dem talk say dem don disband all these guys but that one na big lie. One suggestion be say, just avoid any kind thing we go draw unnecessary attention to you when you dey public place. E good to vibe and the rest of them but nor go overdo because even some of all these EFCC and Ekelebe na some of your guys wey dey work with them dey call them. After dem don extort money finish, dem go give them their cut.",

And if you come to run statistics, you go get to understand say majority of people wey dey always get that stupid ideology na people wey get zero knowledge about online opportunities. And all these police/Sars people all fall into that very category of persons.So my advice to all of una my Naija brothers/sisters (most especially my P.H people) be say..1. Make una try dey dress responsibly, because there is a popular saying that the way you dress is the way you shall be address.2. Make una try to avoid clubs or bar for night, because even if you go go, abeg make eh no be always 3. Make you no too dey let people know say you get money, because even if you get, abeg no let your next door neighbour know oh, because at times na them go fit even set you up using those nonsense Sars/police men",

If your not a criminal, why you go dey hide yourself or live with fear of the force. Maybe na because I never get one on one encounter with them via crypto matter but, you should live your life just the way you want am and if your lifestyle attract wahala, you explain yourself the way you see fi out of the wahala or solve am.

Everybody dey hustle ooo including our law enforcement agents, they just want to get money at all cost and dem no care weda you commit or not, as far u just look suspicious dem don pick you up. In my own opinion the ways we fit take avoid these bad eggs na: (1) Make we dey pray to God Almighty to order our steps and to protect us from this evil men. (2) Dress properly. There's a saying that the way you are dressed, so shall you be addressed. If you dress well and look sharp as e dey help promote your image say you dey responsible, no be to dey sag anyhow. (3) Avoid flamboyant lifestyle. Man gats enjoy himself, eat your money wey u hustle for but you no go dey spend anyhow because if this men see you dem go feel say na gee u dey do even if you your hustle dey legit. Because na gee boiz dey spend anyhow because dem no suffer to get their money. (4) Always be conscious of your environment.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on January 29, 2023, 07:25:24 PMFirst go get one lawyer number wey go fit help you if you into this people their mata then try know force person too.

E good to get good contacts wey fit come through for you when situation like this arises. I remember when I been get one issue like that sometime ago. I had to call someone who intervened for me and naso the mata end.",

My suggestions to avoid these men harassment na as follows;1. Avoid some late night movements (especially in group)2. Limit the way you move around3. No too show up for exorbitant lifestyle 4. If possible get physical business or job wey you go fit tell them say you dey do.5. No associate too much with street people if you no follow6. Importantly make you first dey innocent.",

As you limit your moving around, move around at reasonable hours.

My approach, work around when people are moving and try not to dey waka when road dey empty and not busy, which includes avoid walking around during working hours if you work remotely and avoid night movements, because the Ekelebe wey jam you for night dey act differently from the one wey go jam you for day.",

Very accurate, also try dey commot eye for your body, dress in a way wey suit the environment you dey. If you dey stay where na mostly married people dey atleast get some decent senators wey you fit dey rock and e go bring some kind respect to your side. Personally I dun benefit from this and that's why I dey try get the least new wears anytime I get some extra funds wey just no dey useful. Your hairstyle na another thing to look at, believe me say nothing come out to dey dress over roughly.As a young guy nothing bad to dress youthfully at some people but majority dey very responsible. We know say even though you do all this things  e no guarantee say dem no go worry you but atleast you go bypass some kind profiling and snitches wey dey around dey find who dem go put for trouble. Most of this bursting wey this guys dey go na information dey carry dem waka so if you wan avoid falling a victim, you gas use your sense for your environment.",
