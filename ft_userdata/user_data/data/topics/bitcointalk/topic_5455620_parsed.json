      "body": "The bot has been updated!What has been added:- The algorithm for filtering trading pairs by volume has been redesigned: now, when analyzing the pair, the bot focuses on the available volume at the current moment, as well as on the real demand based on the latest transactions on the order book. This made it possible to almost completely filter out pairs with low income of a few dollars per operation.- Improved filtering of trading pairs by network compatibility.Last night there were a lot of arbitrage situations on the NTVRK coin, the spread at the peak reached 18% with average volumes up to $3000:Buy:from 0.0990 to 0.1040 | ntvrk/usdt - MexcSell:from 0.1090 to 0.1130 | ntvrk/usdt - KucoinTotal Purchase: $1350Income: $119",

      "body": "Global updates of crypto artibtrage bot are online!What has been added:- Now the bot can determine the volume available at the moment of a deal! Due to this, the high speed and consumption of work with the bot also develops the ability to detect illiquid pairs in the notifications from the bot;- Reduced delay between order book evaluation and Telegram compliance. Now it happens almost instantly. The delay is fractions of a second;- Filtering pairs by the availability of hedging (futures contract) for both selling and buying. Now the bot immediately detects the possibility of using hedging on a specific coin and exchange;- Filtering coins by the availability of margin trading (leverage) for both selling and buying coins. Now the bot immediately detected the possibility of using margin on a particular coin and exchange. Identifications take place the same formations as hedging filtering. First is always an exchange of purchase, the second - sale. The presence of only the \" | \" symbol in the notification means that the leverage is not available;- Small interface changes in the shelves with an eye for future updates.https://i.ibb.co/GQQs5y6/eng-upd.png",

      "body": "⚡️Bot update released⚡️What was changed/added:- Complete reworking of filtering algorithms in collaboration with several traders. Now high-quality filtering is available to all users, regardless of the tariff: By default, bundles are oriented towards a bank of ~1.5-2K$, allowing you to receive significantly more liquid bundles, but options for banks up to $1000 are practically eliminated (via LAN you can ask to change the filtering back for your account). This became particularly necessary in December, when volumes in such bundles began to disappear in just a couple of minutes;- Blocking coins that are not available for transfer on the huobi (htx) exchange;- The speed of the bot on weak PCs in the “Trader” and “Pro” tariffs has been significantly increased;- A beta version of automatic trading via the Api of supported exchanges is available on the “Pro” tariff;- Reworking the bot for parsing and filtering coins on the “Pro” tariff;- Other small changes.This is the last major update for this year, with plans to rework the network detection feature next year to always display accurate information about both the transfer network and fees.",
