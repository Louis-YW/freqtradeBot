With only that, it was supported by many and now has strongest network that it make more decentralized than any other cryptocurrency (alts and tokens). If you are questioning the only medium of exchange feature of bitcoin, then what else more do you want or expect bitcoin will be. There's nothing more it could be than having centralized and weak network, price/value of these are influenced by the actions of their team, short period of hype, and other \" promised use case\". Many thoughts of better alts/tokens are cheap with tx fee, well, those alts are literary has cheap value that's why the tx fee is cheap as well.Well, to be honest, i only see the fee structure and confirmation time of bitcoin is the main hindrance, but after lightning it's all better now.",

It'd just be wise of anyone to take this whole cryptography the way it is; it's been made to synchronize, just the way it is -- as a store of value, period.Hmmmm, I'd go further to say; having its place as a medium of exchange, just as FIAT would be something very deteriorating and that'll mean to be adversely the reasons for it's Creation -- in the first place. Transactions are made and verified ASAP. There's a level of trust, transparency through the BC and pseudonymity in crypto - this features make Bitcoin \"the people's choice\"Use case might appear as an 'after-thought'.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

Until when people realize that there's no one can beat Bitcoin or those decentralized platforms over the centralized ones.",

People can use it to conduct a transaction instantly in any place in the world where there is internet and because of decentralization, it allows consumers total freedom and protection from fraud. I believe the best use case that bitcoin and other digital currencies have is simply being an alternative to fiat currency. Since governments have a stranglehold on our monetary systems, cryptocurrencies can disrupt and change the way we handle wealth, money, and transactions as a whole.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is likely the same as gold but the problem it's digital and has no physical appearance. There are other things that Bitcoin uses if you don't want your money to be controlled by the government or if you don't want to put your money in centralized banks then you can have your own bank by generating a bitcoin wallet that no one controls your wallet but you.Another use is Bitcoin can be also a good asset since I said it is likely the same as gold then Bitcoin is also a good asset look at the price of Bitcoin past 2015 and today. It's volatile but the price of Bitcoin increases and it's normal to see ups and down with bitcoin due to demand and supply and it's also affected by the news. Even though the price drop these past few days I believe the price will rise again.",

      "body": "There's many use cases. Here's a few examples:Bitcoin A decentralized store of value. Some say it doesn't work because it has its bull and bear runs, but that's where the whole trick is. It's a store of value but it has moments when the market price goes down and this is the time when you shouldn't convert it to anything else. When you take a 4 years out of a bitcoin's life you'll see there were moments where it was higher and lower from the average and this lack of stability doesn't mean it can't be a store of value.Â  Freedom to move your wealth around the world from one jurisdiction to another. This is something people in China and many other countries can't do freely.A way to avoid abuse by the government like in Canada where the government was trying to curb protests by stealing the money from people's accounts and making them unable to buy food and fuel. Great if you want to donate anonymously or buy something online without your bank knowing about it.A way to avoid currency exchange fees and bank fees - great if you travel a lot and meet a lot of people. You can easily book a flight or a hotel with it.Allows you to circumvent government bans and restrictions. Some countries will not allow you to gamble and block bank transfers but having cryptocurrency can help.Gives you 24/7 access unlike banks and stock exchanges that don't work on weekends. I recommend people have some bitcoin in case of emergency. People in Ukraine who had to get away from war had problems getting cash from their banks but packing a drive with your wallet on it and accessing it once you're in a safe zone is fast and easy.Great conversation starter. Many people around you could be bitcoiners!An investment opportunity that outperforms even in bear market. If you had fiat money in 2021 in Turkey and decided to buy bitcoin at 60 thousand you made a good decision. With 80% inflation their fiat currency is down much more than bitcoin and people say its bitcoin that crashed.",

Exactly and they are completely ignoring the real motive behind setting up all these zero utility coins which is to scam you of funds and their target audience is exactly of what you are talking about.They set pump dump scheme and paid advertisements for these shitcoins and people loose funds in lore of earning which will never happen.Quote from: pixie85 on November 18, 2022, 12:18:47 AMA way to avoid abuse by the government like in Canada where the government was trying to curb protests by stealing the money from people's accounts and making them unable to buy food and fuel. Actually the correct word is restricting the bank transfers as they are under government control and you can't withdraw funds if they have blocked it but they were also freezing crypto donations in the truckers convoy strike at the borders.But in actual they are taking away your funds from you.Quote from: pixie85 on November 18, 2022, 12:18:47 AMA way to avoid currency exchange fees and bank fees - great if you travel a lot and meet a lot of people. You can easily book a flight or a hotel with it.You still have to pay the transaction fees depending on the network congestion and looking at the memepool but still you have to pay fees in each bitcoin transaction.You can book flights and hotels with it and can also pay with it but with only those merchants and service provider who accept it as payment.Quote from: pixie85 on November 18, 2022, 12:18:47 AMAllows you to circumvent government bans and restrictions. Some countries will not allow you to gamble and block bank transfers but having cryptocurrency can help.If you are gambling over regular casino then there might not be bitcoin accepted and you have to look for crypto casinos online where you can gamble but they also have area restrictions as per the government policy they have to obtain licence.But you can bypass it though VPN and play with bitcoin.Quote from: pixie85 on November 18, 2022, 12:18:47 AMGives you 24/7 access unlike banks and stock exchanges that don't work on weekends. Yes it's available all the time at ease of your hand but e-banking tx are also available 24/7 and speaking of stock exchange market then it's completely different thing if we are discussing the use case for bitcoin as it's for investment purposes.",
