There's no point to do that.(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454456.0)I quote here the answer of BitMaxz, in case the topic created in Bitcoin Discussion is deleted as it is not post in the good forum's section.Quote from: BitMaxz on May 30, 2023, 12:00:32 AMWhat do you want to achieve why you would like to edit nonce range?I'm not expert on this unit but have you check the guide from kano.is check the link below under chip frequencies it talks about nonce.- https://kano.is/gekko.phpSo I think you are trying to overclock the unit? Try the config from this post below- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5423227.msg61534077#msg61534077Quote from: Cancan25 on May 29, 2023, 11:37:12 PMHello, I a newbie to bitcoin mining. I am using gekko r909 pod and the software provided with it. How do I edit nonce range in this version? I didn't get how to give commands. Can anyone please explain me!Can you please explain and give more details about what you are trying to achieve ? There is no need to \"edit nonce range\" to use a R909. The link provided by BitMaxz (https://kano.is/gekko.php) will give you all the necessary things IMO, but if you want to do something experimental, please explain it to us, in order to be helped.",
