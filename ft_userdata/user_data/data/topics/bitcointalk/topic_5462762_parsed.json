  "content": "Hello everyone I'm new here though and didn't know I'd be posting this soon. We have so much rules here I'm still going through then I had a question that crossed my mind although I'm pretty sure my answers already exist I'd ask again not needing reply but if you want to reply I'm grateful anywaysQuestion intended: \"what is bitcoin halving? what is the historical impact on bitcoin since inception and what could be the predicted impact of the next halving?\"But I decided to make use of the search button because this forum has been in existence since 2009 (correct me if I'm wrong I scrolled through the post where I saw it I didn't bother to click for more I just saw it say it has been since 2009 and it's one of the first online...). On searching for the words \"Bitcoin halving\" and \"halving\" I got a 5 page response to my search and average of response to each  was over 90 replies with varying responses and links to back up their response to Bitcoin halving and so what crossed my mind was to go through a few and I'm sure I'd get answers.But again it dawned on me that there could be a repetition of question (similar questions) although the construction mat be different time to time and this could even make things more complex for readers so it's better we search for what we intend to ask before going about asking and most times our answers are already available when we searchI do not have much features to support my description but I'm sure you can navigateWhere's the search button? You may ask...*The top right hand corner of your homepage is the search button click on it and type what you want to know about or would have asked questions about *You'll be directly moved to the google search button option or forum search button option*It's nicer to use the forum search button option since google is little bit 'fuzzy' (in their words)*You again type into the search button your intended question or what you're looking for to learn about*You have options below the search to order or decide how you want your search to come in you can choose any preferable one ...you can still go ahead to search without choosing you'll get many related response that have been made as regards your search*You can click on any of the replies and read more about them to know understand what you want to learn or get answers to your intended questionI am sure that if this is done and questions still exist it will be questions that have not been asked or part of which the replies so far have not really answered...this out question becomes very important and relevant encouraging learning by others too.I'm sure you understand my point so far.Thanks to @Zaguru12 he dropped this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5276341.0The above link simplifies my post Just discovered that even there's already replies to search so I could have as well searched search... funny right!. Thanks man!So much to know in here. Thank you all for your positive replies so far.(I guess as a newbie I should be silent and wait for \"years\" or \"months\" before posting because all I see is people digging up into timing of my registration it's laughable because your thoughts are a reflection of your behavior even to others...yeah I have lots of tips off about the forum before registering and most of my logins I've gone as far as viewing many post and I thought it needful to add this but alright I'd be quiet so as not to be ridiculed ) but it's unfair how pot calls kettle black!",

Most at times people are too lazy to do that or just trying to fish out merit through it. Or even they don’t know how use the forum search button properly since it seems a bit confusing using. Here is a thread on how use that though. Another way of effectively using it is through direct goggle search and adding the Bitcointalk.org name next to your search just like Quotestreamz Bitcointalk.org",

Typically common one. But thats what it is here on forum since we are living with the discussion and signature campaigns are definitely attached to it.Ive been here a long time and also observed things. Seen some members that arent for the signature and some also does literally do only for signature. Using search function is much easier but since newbies are prone to posting they could easily ask these questions anyway until they figured out the effectivity of that button. Its fine though since even when Im newbie I only used frequently that when I am already at higher rank.",

Of course it can't be avoided as long as there are newcomers (beginners) who come to this forum. We have to admit it and your OP is a smart newbie having quickly grasped the function of the search button on forums. And in fact there are more beginners who don't immediately realize the function of the search button, so they innocently ask things that have been asked a lot before on this forum. And this is the task for members who have been here for a long time to help beginners in answering the questions they ask. Even though it's just a repeated question, the simple step we can take is to provide a link to the same thread that already has an answer in it.",

But you mate, here broke all those rules and made something unique. heheWe all are learner here even if you would check the last post i made is about Factoids about which i didn't knew before and never intend to search about it before because i don't give shit to knew about it, i thought the moderators of this platform has some set of those statements or factoid, that we read below some posts for example these oneshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462772.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462777.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462762.0 --> this is yours.Point being made here is, search button do resolve most of the problems or questions we are having but i think there is nothing that bad in asking again even though most of the members don't like it. Before some seniors starts to bash me please let me complete my thoughts first. which are, i think if newbies or new comers will not start to make some posts about topics already discussed here before how people like me would come to know that these things also exists like the one about Factoids. TBH, i think when a question is asked repeatedly  we come to get a reminder (for those who already knew) or a new set of information (for those who did not knew about that question or term being used in the question).",

Since we are here in the Beginners section of the forum I would not like to leave this statement as it is, otherwise, newcomers could read this and accept it as a God-given law. Until now it was actually like this that each Halving has also initiated the bullrun that took place about 6 to 12 months later. However, one cannot and must not conclude from the past to the future, i.e. it may well be that this is already no longer the case in for the Halving-event in 2024 ... or in one of the later following Halvings - and yes, I know that there is some evidence here in terms of market economics why Halvings trigger the bullrun, but I would still never rely on this. Until now, it was also considered an iron rule that a low of a subsequent cycle never falls below the all-time high of the last cycle. This rule was also broken in this cycle when BTC was below 16k in November last year.So: Just because one event followed another several times in the past (Halving -> Bullrun) doesn't mean that it will happen again in the future ... and this should certainly not be a reason for an investment decision.",
