I don't think they really started 11 years ago.It's very possible they bought the aged domain, so now they have some history. it doesn't have to be a mandatory sign for anything, good or risky side of the business.personally, I don't know anything about them, I may have seen their website somewhere, but not enough to have a clear opinion about them.I wouldn't use them or recommend them, but as far as I can see, something is happening there. They are highly ranked on CoinGecko as \"Derivative Exchanges Ranked by Open Interest & Trade Volume\". https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/derivativesAlso, the web stats of their website says quite solid traffic sounds based on Taiwan. also, most of the traffic comes from those countries Taiwan, Korea, China, and Japan...Again, this is not my recommendation for using this exchange, just a short analysis of data from the internet.",

On checking their exchange telegram page it shows a screen that they are stopping operations.Tried contacting support but no response yet. Is there any admin for BTCC exchange here or can someone guide in the right direction?And also the responses you should see for clarity the representative of the BTCC exchange.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on May 18, 2019, 10:07:21 AMTheir representative here hasn't been active since November 2018. Their social media hasn't been active since January either.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=552507Elsewhere I also saw a new thread about 2022. Topic: BitcoinCopy ($BTCC) ICO - Bitcointalk Announcement, unfortunately also unclear information.Instead, you should consider not using the BTCC exchange, it seems dismal to trade on the BTCC exchange.",

You've been lately on a witchhunt that is starting to become a bit too much!Seriously, is Wikipedia good enough for you guys?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTCC_(company)",

BTTC is a future derivatives exchange, not a spot exchange.I seriously can't believe what I'm defending here since I was one of the biggest haters of the former OKChina (now BTTC) and the gang like Huobi but just because the average Joe isn't using it it doesn't mean there is no usage. How many topics and how many users of CME you've seen a round? Does this make them irrelevant?If you're looking to trade BTC against Shiba of course BTTC is not the choice, if you want to push your luck and do a 150x leverage, yeah, 150x!!! then there are very few choices that have been around and still have some kind of reputation comparable to BTTC.Quote from: TraPole on February 01, 2023, 06:00:56 AMim binance user but would like to open an account on 2-3 more exchanges for hodl and paymentsIf you're looking for a hold, then you don't need an exchange at all, you need a cold wallet, storing your coins on an exchange is a big no!If you look for simple buy/sell options or sending coins to some partners then BTTC is not the best choice at all, as I said it's for pure mad leverage trading if you're not into this stick with the big spot exchanges!",
