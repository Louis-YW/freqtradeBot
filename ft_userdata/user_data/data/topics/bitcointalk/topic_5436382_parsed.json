Did the other play take steroids before the first point to make him swing over 300 points? From -222 to +105?Someone please tell me I am wrong here.Have you multi accounts? If you have not multi-account then on this post you are saying you have been blocked and nowhere you have been told that your account has been removed from the block. In this case, how you are telling me you have a VIP account and now you have to fill in 00.02%",

He showed me his screenshot yesterday about reaching 13.91% goal (diamond 4 progress), hence I took the risk and gave the loan. However he denies to show a new screenshot today about the 0.02% left to reach the bonus. I dont know if we should trust him again (until he repays what is due).",

If he could show you proof last day then s/he would be able to show the proof today to take a loan from you. OP's account is blocked and now there is no way to reach this target. Before allowing more funds please think twice about why not send you the proof of the 0.002% target.Quote from: Edwardard on January 24, 2023, 03:12:32 AMI dont know if we should trust him again (until he repays what is due).If you visit the lending board you will not see any newbie receiving this type of fund, though there are hundreds of requests.",

I have a migraine.I don’t know what showing you the percentage changes. Update you tomorrow\"Now Im afraid that he gambled with my loaned amount and lost it all and wants money again to gamble back. Also, some member told me that it takes millions to wager to reach a goal of +0.09%. Im loosing hope. Thats why maybe he is not showing me screenshot again.But atleast he is still replying actively and also gave his phone number, so maybe theres a slight chance.",

I got it wrong and he needed 135000 is wager for 0.09%. Anyway the behaviour is strange. Also it would be good to see a message from the stake support that states he gets amount x for every 14%. @ Shasan : He is only blocked from chat support I guess, not from the site. He will still be able to contact his VIP host as this is via telegram.Anyway, strange story and I hope Ed gets the promised repayment!",
