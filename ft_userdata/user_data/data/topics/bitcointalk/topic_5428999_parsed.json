It looks decent as like a ATM card & I was considering to buy one but this doesn't make any sense anymore now. What inspired them to bring such a wallet? I was considering just because it looks decent. I didn't know that it's same as of a paper wallet.",

      "body": "One simple thing that I haven’t been able to find after browsing around for a bit, is \"what happens\" when you send a partial balance from the bitcoin address provided in the Ballet Wallet. Specifically, I’m querying about the change addresses.In order to send you go through the associated app and all that, but the question is what address is used as the change address?Wallets generally use new addresses as a change address, but if the app were to do so, the device physical card would be partially pointless from thereon, as it would no longer be the means to access the bitcoins tied to the change address. I therefore tend to assume that the send address is used as the change address by the app.Edit: self-answered:Quote from: DdmrDdmr on December 15, 2022, 06:54:23 PM<...> In order to send you go through the associated app and all that, but the question is what address is used as the change address?Quote<…> The Ballet Crypto app is set up in a way where your SegWit address is used as the change address after sending out bitcoins. <…>See: https://blog.ballet.com/2021/08/25/why-are-there-two-bitcoin-addresses/",

This is a good option if you are new to cryptos you don't know how to create a paper wallet, because making a paper wallet is very risky because you may be lost your funds if you technically don't know. But --it is not recommended because you are not the one who generates the private key, it may expose to anyone else. If you know how to create a paper wallet, just do it yourself instead.",

Their reputation is the only guarantee. If a trusted and convincing user tells one day that his funds have disappeared while not sharing the key with anyone, their reputation will be destroyed.",

I don't recommend other people to buy from them creating your own cold wallet is much safier than buying it from someone. You can create or buy something like a crypto steel/metal seed backup or keystone crypto seed wallet to store your seed or private keys which are safe depending on how you generate your wallet.",
