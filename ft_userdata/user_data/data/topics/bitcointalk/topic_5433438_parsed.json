If not then check this one out it works. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HXU1PGC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1I use this very model and have found that each stick performs just a bit differently and you should plan to tune them as such.Make sure you set them somewhere in between 3.25A and up to 4.15A depending on the stick at full speed. If you go over 4.15A in my case the sticks fall flat on their face. Again this has just been my experience although others may vary. Also make sure you are supplying cooling to the sticks if you are cranking them up. They do not run well if they aren't getting a good airflow.I use this fan https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XN24GY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1 blowing over top of the entire rig as well as one of these on each stick https://bitcoinmerch.com/products/bitcoin-merch-gekkoscience-newpac-usb-fan-upgrade.",
