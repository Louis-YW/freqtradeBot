This is still a good news though, you just need to have more research though before adopting, just to be sure that your money can be safe. For a country to stay against the sanctions, it is a good choice. The usage is limited and it serves to be something as the digital form of banking. For the government it will be really good, because everything can be kept in their control. Even with fiat this isn't possible. A positive approach for a cause. Lets see what change crypto Rial making within the country.",

( Iran Officially Approves Use Of Crypto For Imports).And not just in the middle east. it turns out that Russia has also approved the use of crypto for cross-border payments.

CBDCs are centralized, and at the same time most stablecoins are centralized as well anyway.

Of course people have difficulties trusting government and the financial institutions for a long time because of the way the state affairs are being handle. Fiat is compulsory for every citizen of a country to have in other to be able to transact successfully even though people don't trust it, but in the case of this digital currency, it will be more of an optional thing since there is a legal tender.The problem with inflation is all over the world and not only affecting a particular country, and the solution does not lie in the hands of a single country either, even if the government of Iran want to fix the issue with inflation, they will not achieve much since this is a global issue. The reason behind the launch of a digital currency is to support the economy, perhaps it can give closure on how to solve economic problem, the potential of blockchain is unlimited if applied properly.",

Bitcoin is recognized as a currency and is officially used for foreign trades. Bitcoin mining is recognized and has been done done in Iran for the past couple of years as a regulated and legitimate business. People trade bitcoin freely since there is no laws against it.And yet bitcoin is not yet completely regulated as a currency for domestic use and I don't think it is going to happen either.Quote from: Leviathan.007 on September 23, 2022, 08:11:27 AMpeople won't trust any type of currency that is related to their governmentwhich is same as the traditional fiat rialYou already contradicted yourself. It's not about trust, inflation or anything like that either. People of any country use their own national currency regardless of its form (physical, digital or crypto).BTW it's already available  for use through 2 banks and some people are using it to purchase goods in this testing phase.Quote from: Leviathan.007 on September 23, 2022, 08:11:27 AMthe Iranian central bank is launching the digital rial(It's not crypto rial)It is called \"رمزریال\" and \"رمز\" is the equivalent of \"crypto\" in Farsi so it is Crypto-Rial.Quote from: Bitstar_coin on September 23, 2022, 08:35:39 AMThe problem with inflation is all over the world and not only affecting a particular country,Actually Iran's inflation is different since it has been high for a long time and existed before this recent global one. But also difference in the sense that over the past year it has significantly decreased, even more so during the past couple of months. In fact Iranian Rial went up about 17% against US dollar as dollar has been tanking hard over the past 6 months which contributed more to decreasing Iran's inflation.",

Not a joke but the information might be incorrect or misleading because you said it wasn't related to crypto but anyway not only in Iran where the inflation rates are high but this issue is felt globally.There must be people that will try to use the newly issued currency because it's related to their government. They will assume that it's more trusted than any other currencies out there but if all what they what is to hodl then that's a different story anymore. Government owned currencies are I think different from cryptos. They don't have a limited supply so they won't work well in terms of hodling/investing but they can function well in terms of payment use.",
