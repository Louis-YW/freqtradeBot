Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 13, 2023, 10:12:34 PMIf not, suppose I send out a transaction that's time-locked to 1 day/month/year/decade into the future. it may worth mentioning that nodes reject any transaction with a locktime into the future. If you have a transaction with a locktime into the future, you have to wait until its locktime and after that you will be able to broadcast it.

To what degree of certainty will my transaction be eventually be included in a block?Your transaction is basically guaranteed to never be included in a block if all you did was broadcast it before the locktime was reached.Nodes do not accept or relay transactions which cannot be included in the next block. If you broadcast a transaction with a future locktime, basically all nodes would drop it. Besides that, nodes will also evict transactions that have been unconfirmed for too long (typically 2 weeks as that is the default in Bitcoin Core). If you had a transaction with a timelock greater than 2 weeks in the future, and it was somehow accepted into some node's mempool, it would be dropped before the timelock was reached.",
