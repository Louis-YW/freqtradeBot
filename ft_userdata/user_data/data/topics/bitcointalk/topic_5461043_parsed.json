I checked your website and it says 3% fees for BTC mining, is just the average, in fact, a few other well-established pools charge 2.5% for PPS+/FPPS, so in regards to fees you are not doing much better than the average.Also, with only 1365.27 PH/s, you get on average a block every 3 days, so how do your daily payouts happen? how much are your reserves? what happens when your luck hits 500% and you can't find a block for 2 weeks or so?",

If RBF is not an option and the amount you sent is somewhat big, you would have to use a service like \"BTC Transaction Accelerator\" offered by Viabtc, those services are way too overpriced and not worth it for small transactions, the current fees for high priority is 29 sats/Vbyte, it's above the \"usual\", if yours is 2-3 sats and you are not in a rush, just wait a few more days, probably around the weekend.",
