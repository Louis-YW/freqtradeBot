Looks suspicious to me, looks like a combination of MLM and Ponzi Scheme QuoteInvite subordinates to recharge 100 USDT and above for the first time, you will get 8 USDT reward, the reward is automatically issued by the system.Invite your subordinates to register, your subordinates will get 3 USDT reward, the reward is automatically issued by the system.The last platform I encountered with this feature was the Mavrodi system it's a donation-based system where you get a portion of your inviter investment this platform deserves to be in the scam section, it's deceptive there's no usage by that will add value to the community, you have to warn your contact on the dangers of investing in this kind of platform, yes its addictive to invite people because of the reward but once no more people coming in those that are late in investing will eventually lose their money.",

It's definitely a pyramid scheme in the disguise of crypto currency business. I would suggest to stay out of such program available in the crypto market. Anytime you see some platforms asking money to join and get rewards for bringing in new people, is definitely a pyramid scheme and needs to be avoided.",

Any news about it?Also, there is \"Team\" and \"Agent\". No Privacy Policy and ToS/TnC in sight. This is an outright scam. Without a single doubt, this kind of model is unsustainable. The website design seems specifically made only for mobile phones, well this surely might indicate something.With that in mind, I strongly suggest you refrain from interacting or even using this site.",

I didn't check the site itself but I tried looking for feedbacks or assessment. And the first that came out is from ScamAdviser and it says the site might be a scam. It has a low review of this cosetek platform. But based on your short description of how this site functions, it seems it has the common characteristics of a classic Ponzi scheme.",

Now, since this is a new project we should always look at it with suspicions especially that it is soliciting investors or buyers of its coins. While I appreciate a program that pays entrants to promote the same to their friends and family, the scheme can be a red flag in itself or maybe can be branded as just another pyramid scheme to suck people's money into the program with promised benefits...and then suddenly it will be gone to heaven or dead six under the ground. Now, am not saying that everything I am posting here can be true but we can never be too careful most especially that now the interest of the public with cryptocurrency is slowly soaring with the news of the coming halving and bull run of Bitcoin in 2024.",

Even if your fears turn out to be in vain, do not worry, this is not the first project and not the last, so you will still have many chances to invest in a decent project.",

Yeah and it's almost always what you think it is trust your gut.  Anytime you have to pay and get other people to paying to get some sort of pay out is exactly just that a pyramid scheme.  First rule of crypto never pay for anything you don't know that works.  You said it yourself you don't know how it works but you have to pay.  Steer clear.",
