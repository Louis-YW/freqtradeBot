I hope it is bitcointalk forum and not another platform.2- You have specify (make it clear) more details in your offer, including the payment methods that you accept and the maximum amount that you can sell in each agreement in accordance with each payment method. More important than this is to specify the method of selecting the escrow and determining who will pay his fees. Not publishing these details in public and postponing discussion about them in private on Telegram makes the whole offer suspicious.3- You are not posting in the appropriate board. There is another whole section dedicated to currency exchange, it's called \"Currency Exchange\" You can move the topic to that board using the \"Move\" command that appears (for you as OP) at the bottom left of this page. You can also leave it as it is and the moderators will move it.",
