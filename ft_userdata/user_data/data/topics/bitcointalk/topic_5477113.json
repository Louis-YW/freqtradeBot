So like this now, the data wey the exchange dey get naim dem dey take package these country adoption rate. But wattin dey shock me pass na be say that information wey  dem give there fit nor dey correct,l. Because na only for exchange Dem fit extract data, how about some person wey dey use nor wallet wey nor require any personal information, and na only dem wey register the wallet naim know their password.I believe say many of those foreigners dey use normal segwit wallet so for Dem to get their details, to publish am go dey very hard. Anyway before making deposit for most wallet apps, some apps nor dey allow direct buying of crypto unless say dem use exchange take buy am, then try to send am go their wallet. I still leave the floor very open for our superiors them, abeg make una shock mouth.",

      "body": "If na individually we wan assess am, Nigeria dey among the top countries with the highest adoption of the Bitcoin technology. In fact, if we go list out top 5 countries wey dey quickly adopt the Bitcoin and wey don already adopt the Bitcoin by population, Nigeria fit carry number 1 sef for Africa because of our huge population and how rapid it is spreading through to the nooks and crannies of the country is superb for a comment. Within communities, and cities in the country.Before now, the only way you can hear about Bitcoin is in school campuses from students that come from the other geopolitical zones, especially the south but will rarely hear about it from an indigenous person of the state unless of course you can't take out an handful of them that already have exposure. But now, Bitcoin is in the lips of almost all the young people and indigenes of the state.If na government, na where we still dey lag behind be that because our central government never gree untop that adoption of Bitcoin up till now. My thoughts were as we transition in government from the Buhari administration to Tinubu's administration, we would experience a little change in the adoption of Bitcoin but up till this moment we never get better response regarding this. I sha believe say, we never also gather enough muscles to show the government reasons why the adoption of the Bitcoin technology will reduce our over dependency in the forex or at least create another path for the government.On my own little efforts, I dey try engage my new state government on the introduction of the Bitcoin education into our school curriculum, and that na the scope wey I been think say e go work since we no come out direct say we want make the state government adopt Bitcoin for any public use yet. Reason why I think am like this na him be say, I want make the new government start to they familiarize with the Bitcoin or better still have an understanding of the Bitcoin without mixing it up with the wrong and negative public perception on it.I also want them to look at the proposal as another mark of achievement for their new administration, so before they become frustrated with the whole system of government, which is likely to happen at some point, we have scaled through with the proposal.Hence, my efforts to meet with the SSG (Secretary to the State Government), Niger State of Nigeria through my delegation on Tuesday.",

Me I no think so. If them say make everybody stop to dey use non costudial wallet or decentralized exchange otherwise known as DEX, na there I go know truly the country wey get the highest crypto adoption. Because most people dey use 1 CEX account dey do multiple transaction because dey want to be anonymous. For example 5 to 6 people fit get electron wallet or trust wallet, and Dem no want reveal their identity through kyc, dem fit tdey transfer there coin from DEX to CEX and binance go count all those transaction as 1 person. If not our country wey you see so for even pass El salvador wey you dey talk.

Wetting really dey important na to use Bitcoin information become successful but planning how to invest for future porpos. Bitcoin don dip small from $44k to $41.1 na avenue to still accumulate because e go still go up again.

And true that Bitcoin is still in between in Nigeria it is not legal and it is not illegal but people are still accepting it, you can compare the numbers of people that have invested then and now.",

Now in my measurement from here, Port Harcourt has the highest population or number in the forum and it will follow by Lagos and Abuja the others will follow then Bayelsa will take last stand. And internationally measurement of Chainalysis on The 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index: Central & Southern Asia Are Leading the Way in Grassroots Crypto Adoption gives the leading countries of cryptocurrency and not even El Salvador which the Op mentioned.

We no fit use internationally exchanges to determine which state get the highest cryptocurrency adoption but the use of location cryptocurrency related service can give us that information. We get some crypto platforms wey dey offer services for this country and dem fit give us updates on which states dem dey get the most customers pass but from my own little experience without anything backing it but just observation, I go talk say na Lagos first then followed by port Harcourt. The forum isn't a good source to verify which state has the most cryptocurrency or Bitcoin adoption because for say person dey here no mean say him dun adoption cryptocurrency or Bitcoin and they use am. E get people self wey dey here and then no even know anything for Bitcoin. There funds dey go exchange direct and them dey exchange to Naira ASAP. Event no be also a good way to monitor as audiences can be bought, some people wey dey attend no know anything about the industry but wan learn so you can't call those people adopters yet beside na state wey get population and dey peaceful go come out go all those events then as some states aren't safe for those types of gathering.",
