What trading bot you are describing here?Maybe he/she do talks about those already set-up bots that could be seen neither on exchange platform or something that we can see ex. gunbot  but in overall which newbies do really have that kind of impression and believe that these things could really make them money passively on which they would really be just simply running it and then wait for profits.  @OP, trading bots are for automation of your trades on which this could really be bringing out that convenience specially if you do love on executing your own methods and analysis on certain price conditions without needing to have to look at your monitor most of the times. To save yourself from this then this is where trading bots do sets in, it do really bring outs that convenience specially if you do really know on how to make use of it. Its not something that could assure out money making thingswhich i do highly believe that this is where newbies do mostly believe on.",

But because I do not use bots to trade, that does not mean I do not know about it. As milewilda has said already, trading bots are used to automate trading process, in a way you do not have to be monitoring the screen all the time. You can also use it in buying more coins at a specific time or when the asset you are buying has decreased to certain price.All the automated orders used in future market is enough for me. I can DCA manually. I have not seen a reason to use a bot. But if you are interested, there are some trading bots on OKX. You can try some out and see how they work. You can also build your own trading bot.Using bots does joty mean you are a good trader. It does not also mean you can not still open a position and lose, but it can make trading process to be easier.",

Also if you are thinking of trading with bots in a short time frame its highly possible you are making a mistake.",

Trading bots is only reliant on the user and you can't expect to work alone without command, and if you don't have knowledge in trading, therefore, never expect that it will work effectively but fail. I'd rather suggest you not to use bots if you are still learning trading as it won't bring you to success instead, work on yourself and carry the risk alone. As long as you have ample time to trade, you can be a great trader like others but if you rely on bots, I don't think so.",

The only cons that they have is that its not cheap, and you have to find a good BOT to trust with.",

Sometimes they are and other times they don't, there's no reliability in using them.I don't use bots but I have read reviews and what some friends have said about trading with it and most of the challenges mentioned above are exactly what it is. I have had some friends complained of bots after making some profit, the next day they lose money than the previous profit made and eating into the capital. The challenge that bot also have is that you also need to monitor it from time to time but maybe not like manual trading. This is contrary to people's believe that it is not monitored but if you don't after a while some bots may do reverse trading.",

But if you have more time to watch every trades you do then I guess its just a waste of money for availing that trading bots. But if you mean just like what other say that it provide profit since someone offering you that you can gain a passive income if you invest with the bots they set then as always that is a scam.",

They will \"almost\" perfectly execute a given command once the triggering point happens in the market. There are also features where bots will automatically execute the best possible move at any given market behavior or signals since we know traders do have different strategies at different trends.Personally, I'm not using a trading bot but saw it before on a close friend of mine who has been a trading enthusiast for several years now. Although he's expertise is more on trading stocks, the idea should be the same if applied to crypto-trading.",

But users can benefit a lot by using it but only people who have good knowledge about it can earn money. Achieving profit using such bot trading strategies requires good knowledge and good intentions. If you are not knowledgeable about the trending then you will never profit from trading like this but fail. If you want to profit from trading then never take such decisions, rather take good advice so that you don't get ted by bots. You should never rely on trading by bots as you will never be successful. So you always take the advice of a wise and successful trader so you can profit and make money by trading.",

Most of the bots are used to automate your trading strategy, meaning you don't need to check your chart from time to time to see an entry, it is doing the process for you. However, there are bots that you can purchase online that already have a strategy on them. This is where most of the traders got scammed, or even tried them out, but it is not working for them.It is not really recommended to have a trading bot if you are new and just learning trading because you won't understand it. It is better to do the traditional one because you still don't have any trading strategies to apply to the bot.",

No one sells bots giving constant profits.Selling profitable bots does not make sense. Better invest your money in adopting your own strategy.
