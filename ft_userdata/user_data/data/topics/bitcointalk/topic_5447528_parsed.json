  "content": "Recovering exhaust heat from ASICs can add additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners. As mining becomes more competitive, this becomes increasingly important.Carnot Efficiency is the theoretical maximum % of the energy that can be recovered from a heat source.Current ASICs exhaust heat at a much lower temperature when compared to Steam Power or Internal Combustion engines. This limits the Carnot efficiency & usefulness of exhaust heat. Is anyone building ASIC miners with a hotter exhaust temp & better heat recovery potential?-Aviral",

Running them cooler is the goal. You can use the exhaust heat now for heating rooms and such, but to generate enough to do something else does not work with this kind of equipment.Not to mention, it adds complexity and expense.-Dave",

Even the minuscule amount of energy that 'leaks out' as data over the LAN becomes heat.100% of the power feeding a miner is turned into heat. Even the energy transferred to the air by the fans increasing the air pressure so it moves also slightly raises it temperature.The energy feeding any device cannot just disappear. Even when used to cause motion or whatever, at the end of the chain it eventually it becomes heat.As for the OP's equation - that deals with the amount of usable work energy that can be recovered from the energy put in. 'Usable' being defined as being able to produce work be it powering a pump, moving a vehicle, etc. or generating electricity so the recovered energy can be used elsewhere. A miner does not do that. It just sucks in energy and uses it to power circuitry for the calculations & runs other sundry things like the fans. Since aside from running the fans no physical effort is created all the input energy consumed is directly transformed into heat",

Actually spondollies did 120c if IIRC.But that is not superheated steam it would be more or less slightly overheated steam at best.So pretend you do that what good is 100-110c hot water/liquid?  Is the benefit of having a hotter liquid (105c) outweigh the better power use at 80c for a mining chip?editI did come up with this idea slow cooked brisket.  you can cook brisket at 210 f to 225 f. 10 to 14 hours it is very good.So liquid cool the chips and you build a heat pump to radiator  oven setup that is on view you slow cook the best brisket possible.Of course it would need to be tons of brisket if you have a big farm you need a bigger scale than this one",

In the case of mining chips it is very hot compared to other kinds of chips - the only others designed for high temperature applications are for automotive & aerospace uses. Back to miners, the old Spondollies are a perfect example of that. Their chips were designed to run at such a high temp because the miner form factor dictated a 2U high rack mount which meant cooling issues. They worked quite well BUT very often needed a pre-heat from an external source (a hair dryer) before they would even start...That narrow temp constraint is still true today. It's why most miners start with a minute or 2 of high power operation to get them warmed up then restart to begin applying the configured speed & Vcore parameters. The other way would be like how Kano's drivers for Sidehacks Compac's does it: They force the miner to start at a fixed low speed and ramp up in steps with each having to satisfy performance checks before going higher to finally reach configured speed giving the chips the needed pre-heat levels.On cooking, remember for medium rare beef target temp is 140F (60C) so using a hot-side fluid temp of around the 70-80C temp chips want to run at put through a secondary heat exchanger loop to suvee meats would be quite doable...",

A lot of desalination plants are set up next to industrial facilities to utilize waste heat.Something for California to consider.But they won'tYes, but remember desalination requires the water to boil, so you are still probably going to still have to add some more energy to get the water that hot.And, side note, most modern desalinization plants use filters instead. Back to this.Getting miners to run hotter would start to limit a lot of things.Right now, you can repurpose older data centers for mining and when you are done still use them as regular data centers.Or you can put a bunch of miners in a large enough warehouse so long as you can cool them.And so on.If you start setting them up where they REQUIRE all this extra cooling because of running at such high temperatures, you are going to be forcing people into only specific builds for the equipment.That could kill a lot of business plans, since the question would be asked, what do we do with the building after....-Dave",

There are some silicon formulations in fabs that can be run over 100c continually, and here it gets interesting because you can use distilled water to cool the ASICs directly and actually boil the water, steam is a much more useful wast heat.

I just think doing all of this to do something with the waste heat other then general heat the office / home / whatever is going to be more difficult then it's really worth. More plumbing, more things to go wrong and so on. A fan either works or does not and it's quick and simple to replace. -Dave",
