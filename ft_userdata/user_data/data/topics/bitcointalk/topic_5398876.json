It's a shame since Bitcoin was long hailed to be a safe-haven asset like Gold.Most crypto don't rise and should never rise because they're scams, or full of bugs, or both.So let's just turn to bitcoin. And bitcoin price does rise, but it does it in waves. As said, zoom out. A pretty good comparison for Bitcoin may be to compare the price every 4 years. You'll see them rise.Inflation is also just a number you don't feel clearly in the same way for everything. Bread price may have went over the roof and meat price may not feel the inflation yet. It's just an example, it doesn't have to be accurate (I'm almost sure it isn't). But inflation makes electricity more expensive and - sooner or later - that has to become visible in the price, else certain miners will have to unplug their gears.Also, never forget that gold is overrated, since it's not so scarce and we don't even know for sure how scarce it is in the universe (I don't think that it's easy to count how many suns have exploded since the big bang, and that's what creates gold).And.. just look at the charts, gold is falling lately: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/",

As you look closer, Bitcoin in 2017 is last quarter of the year it was nearly 20k, now inflation hits hard and it is around 30k USD. If you compare them in terms of purchasing power, the difference is not too far and what you can buy with those money you will only have a little bit of now. I was wondering also why is it like this, did bitcoin really is the future that most of us are awaiting for? I guess it should be at the price of a hundred dollars or more at this moment but it ain't giving us hope as we see it.",

Low trading volume makes it easier to break down natural market mechanic barriers to price manipulation. This makes it easy to get in. Jack up the price of an asset. And get out with a good profit. While it is harder to achieve this with assets like bitcoin that trade in higher volume. It is still an achievable goal for big institutional investors who trade in the highest volumes.As bitcoin has become more available to large institutional investors, its price trends have come to mirror the stock market. Traders with the most liquidity are trading bitcoin as if it were a stock, rather than an inflation protected asset. That is the primary reason behind our current trends.",

Thirdly, bitcoin react to the happening in the economy. It doesn't just rise and fall at will. It is me and you that will push bitcoin to $100,000. Either there is more adoption of bitcoin or me and you will be ready to buy about x3 of what we own currently to push bitcoin higher than it's ATH.Finally, when there is inflation, we tend to care much of what we will eat and survive. It is he that has fed well that will think about investment. So, if the economy is fine bitcoin will flourish along side. Everything is interdependent.",

I have a feeling that a lot of what we're seeing in the markets, i.e., crashes/corrections/you-name-it, has more to do with interest rates rising and the fact that asset prices had risen to sky-high levels over the past 10+ years and those kinds of trends never continue forever.  Prices had to come down to earth eventually.The Russia/Ukraine conflict probably has something to do with it as well.  Oh, as far as gold not being able to break $1900, I'd say that sounds about right to me.  I'm not even sure why it's worth as much as it is these days, but what I've noticed is that investors don't seem to be flocking to precious metals when economic conditions become uncertain or unstable--at least not as much as they used to.If I had to give a glib answer to the question posed in the thread title, I'd ask if you remember what bitcoin was selling for when the COVID pandemic hit (which seems like only yesterday).  If you use that as a point of reference, you'd probably be happy with bitcoin at $30k.",

The more Bitcoin becomes more \"mainstream\", with more and more mainstream investors coming in that are more learned about the legacy financial system, then I believe Bitcoin will be more correlated with mainstream markets than we have witnessed before. It's simply part of the evolution of a technology being accepted by society, like the internet, the telephone, or air travel. But will that stop Bitcoin from its price discovery to six digits?

It's a shame since Bitcoin was long hailed to be a safe-haven asset like Gold. Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Well, the answer is pretty simple.For any assets to rise you don't need inflation or deflation, you need something else, and that's ....ta dam!!!! Money!You need people to buy more bitcoin with more $ than the ones willing to sell for $ and on top of that you need to take care of a certain 30 million, a daily problem in blocks mined.  Now, totally contrarian to the popular belief, when do people like to invest and risk money? When their job is secure, they have cheap food and rent and transportation, no crisis insight, or when they face unemployment, they spend half of their wage on basic necessities, they are afraid they might not afford food or even the rent when they are concern with the rising cost of raising a kid?So, despite nearly everyone thinking we need a new ww3, economic crisis, famine, plague or other to see BTC rise to a new ATH, once you don't need a few million to do so but trillions, you need people with money and with no concern of losing that money at all, not a scared middle and lower class that throws 5$ a month on some altcoin.Quote from: Abiky on May 17, 2022, 11:02:08 AMThat sucks.

This way, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot serve as an alternative to the current financial system.Why not? Why would you expect bitcoin to go against this trend, just because it's an alternative?A bicycle is an alternative to a car but it still has round wheels and you drive it on a street and you get fined for not having a light or a helmet!Bitcoin is based on trust, the trust of being only 21 million, the trust of knowing there won't be more printed, the trust of knowing those are your coins, but at the same time, trust can be shattered, and this is what's happening now, some believe the value should be lower and their numbers offset the ones that think the opposite.It's the perfect free market based on what people think and not what somebody else decided for them!But not everybody likes a free market when it's going down!",

Crypto is inherently tied to FIAT and what's going on with the economy, it's not in its own bubble. In times of economic distress (inflation, food shortages, war, overblown housing prices et.) people tend to buckle down, and that means not investing in anything. And BTC is not even close to being a safe haven since it's volatility and its low utilisation in the real world is definitely something that will turn away people who want to escape the harsh economic situations. Nor is gold or anything for that matter. What most people are worried about is how they will pay their bills and food, and BTC can't really help with that (that much). So to sum it up, crypto rises when regular people start investing, but when the economic situation worsens, those people tend to stay on the sidelines and what crypto is left with are investors who have money for investing and are not worried about it having to be a solution for a specific economic problem they have. And as we see, those people are not enough.",
