  "content": "Alert! Breaking news on LeGaulois TV: Bitcoiners kill Bitcoin, and governments are happyYou complain about banks, traditional finance and its capitalism, but you make the same mistakes with the Bitcoin industry. It's time to stop the hypocrisy.Companies are not in Bitcoin for its ideology but because there is a business to be done on Bitcoin's ass. Sometimes, they apply the same system as Bill Gates by creating foundations and pretending that it's to help whatever. Some entertain you on Twitter, quit worshiping people like Binance's CEO, it's getting ridiculous.How many scandals like FTX do you need? Satoshi can't be alive anymore, he must have had a heart attack when he saw what Bitcoin has become compared to the original idea.whatever, Bitcoin is far to be what it was years ago when I started to use it. And it will stay like this: very few true bitcoiners, and bitcoiners only here for the money.Many of you have been telling people here how laws are a good thing because they help the adoption of Bitcoin, or it helps companies to have a business with a framework.Many of you comment on the FTX scandal, or repeat here and there how CEXs are so bad to use, but your previous comments clearly show that you use CEXs too. Are you trolling us?People should start to boycot CEXs.I know you all want to buy your shitcoins but fuck that! Look at coinmarketcap, it will become a dictionnary. 99.9% of the altcoins are stupid stuff to brainwash you.Don't say there aren't solution to avoid the CEXs, generally it's because you're too lazy to look around. It will ecome a place with a few big companies influencing the whole industry. Oh my bad... it's already the situation...I remember a conference in wich the lady said: \"In your life, if you don't have an answer to a question, follow the money\"Believe me it works with so many things IRL, especially when it's not related to money. One of the best advice I got in my life.I trully see 2 mentalities with Bitcoin and it's sad when we know what it was supposed to be.What about the governments so?Well, we know, they can't really kill Bitcoin etc, and they know it too! What a better solution than using the CEXs and others. And that's what they're doing. Using the trojan method. Laws, taxes, international regulation, ecology ...Are you blind?",

Bitcoin will survive anyways. It survived the largest exchange shutdown i.e. Mtgox in the past, and the ftx meltdown also had not much effect, (since it recovered back to 18k+$ twice but the american markets and fed's tightning policy isnt helping otherwise we would have pumped too far by now already).Quote from: LeGaulois on December 20, 2022, 12:39:23 AMPeople should start to boycot CEXs.Cexes are still having a lot higher volume compared to dexes. Average ppl wont leave cexes since they are just used to it (as they are with other social media platforms logging in with email and password). They think taking care of own private keys is more tough work than remembering a small password of the cex they are trading on.",

Because Bitcoin is not CEX, Bitcoin is not DEX, Bitcoin is not altcoin or cryptocurrency. People want to assimilate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency but as a point of fact, they are not the same, but very different.After Terra, Celcius, Voyager, Three Arrows Capital, FTX collapses, people are very fearful about CEX and they withdrawn a lot of bitcoins from CEX but they will deposit their bitcoins back in future. They want CEX and forget the advice \"Not your keys, not your coins\"Since November, people withdrawn a lot from centralized exchanges and Daily Exchange Net Flows are very negative.https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/flows/daily-net-exchange-flows",

They simply cannot leave the convenience they perceive they receive by having their coins at exchanges, and if anything this is going to get worse, new generations are used to have everything easily accessible to them and anything that is slightly more difficult is simply disregarded as too complex, so when given the choice between using an exchange and keeping their coins in self-custody the majority will choose the former over the latter.",

Centralized exchanges bring more efficiency to the market, and therefore a faster price discovery for Bitcoin. It's simply the truth. BUT we should not move far away from the path of encouraging the use of decentralized networks like BISQ, and asking for the return of face-to-face in LocalBitcoin-like services, or encourage it to be used more in BISQ. I believe we should develop standard safety guidelines for face-to-face trading.",

When adoption grows all categories grow not just one. And the \"true bitcoiners\" are the silent type while the gamblers are the most loud so when their numbers grow and see see the internet filled with their cries about price rise and falls it may look like everyone has become a profit hungry gambler.So even if we see CEXs are growing in popularity and collapse like FTX, that doesn't necessarily mean anything has changed about bitcoin or bitcoiners.Quote from: LeGaulois on December 20, 2022, 12:39:23 AMMany of you have been telling people here how laws are a good thing because they help the adoption of Bitcoin, or it helps companies to have a business with a framework.I've been thinking about this a lot recently mostly because this last week I saw someone literary put a hit out on some people with their full address and information for 5 bitcoin. All on Twitter!So if laws are bad, regulations are bad, etc. then what is the solution to things like this? How are we supposed to deal with criminals, terrorists, money launderers, etc. who are abusing the same privacy that we so much crave for their own illicit activities?",

Thank you for reminding us that Bitcoin was mainly designed for P2P transactions and not through centralized platforms. It is also true that the advantages of using DEX greatly outweighs that of CEX. But there are still many problems that needs to be surmounted in order to promote the use of DEX. Centralized platforms are more popular than its opposite because these exchange companies spend money on advertisement that one can comfortably insinuate that they are one of the major creators of Bitcoin awareness in many countries. Most people became aware of the currency called Bitcoin because of these exchanges. I have never seen any decentralized platform advertising Bitcoin in my area but many exchanges carryout this task. Just like fiat and Bitcoin, Centralized exchanges should be allowed to operate side by side with their decentralized counterpart. People should be allowed to freely choose the one they want to use because they have peculiar reasons for their choice. People using CEX should not be viewed as traitors or hypocrites because you might not know their intentions. Someone might have a financial emergency and these exchanges would be the best platform to convert Bitcoin to fiat. I am sure in the nearest future there would be better alternative to these exchanges and people would gladly dump their services.",

We don't need to use KYC or whatsoever things that will show our true identity unlike these CEXs nowadays. That's right we need to push the use of DCEXs, especially after what happened with FTX and others. now is the time to prove to them that we don't need to be locked in by the government to use their totally controlled exchanges rather we have always our own options to trade on our own with or without their help.",

To new investors it is easier to learn. But this doesn't translate to leaving your heavy funds on it. People that do that are either earning through some of features there or one way or the other. If we could get DEX making it easier to learn and having some future trading futures we could do well it that. But overall CEX'S are just cunning to have funds on",
