  "content": "The educational system now resembles more of a cycle, where knowledge is being recycled in the minds of the younger generation. When we examine certain aspects of this sector, we realize that we are essentially being taught the same things repeatedly. Some of these concepts are quite important, especially when we choose a career path at an early stage, while others are not necessarily meaningful.At times, I ponder, why do we even go to school?. Is it just to gain knowledge or to achieve financial success in the end?. Well, it appears to be both. If our ultimate goal is to secure a good job or a stable source of income, then why aren't we taught certain financial matters at various stages, such as investment, money management, and effective saving methods?. Sadly, many individuals today earn significant incomes but lack a solid financial foundation.Old scheme It's interesting to note that the current evolution of Bitcoin and its technology is gradually rendering banks and financial institutions outdated. The failures of banks and financial institutions have been revealed, as many now see Bitcoin and its technology as a new form of money, a good saving and investment plan, and also a way to manage money.Unfortunately, our schools still teach the young about banks and financial institutions, denying them the truth about real world happenings. Additionally, history has become a core subject even for those who want to study courses far outside it. They continue to teach these young ones about those who have ruled and stolen money from their nation, rather than implementing a financial subject (like Bitcoin) that would enable them to build their future at an early stage.Please don't think that I condemn any subject in any way, but you would certainly understand my point of view if you were once taught certain unnecessary subjects and ended up becoming something else. Knowledge, they say, is never wasted, but there are certain knowledge that are not important. Bitcoin as a core subject Bitcoin itself is very broad, comprising its network, technology, and even financial aspects, which gives it more credibility as a subject. Teaching Bitcoin as a core subject at a certain stage opens the eyes of the young and enables them to make good financial decisions at an early age.Due to it's complexity, basics of Bitcoin should be make good focused on, such as:  Buying and selling  Sending and receiving  How to store them in a wallet  Basic introduction to bitcoin investment, etc As students begin to show interest in pursuing further studies, the need to delve deeper becomes vital. It's important to note that making Bitcoin a core subject aims to enable young people to make early financial decisions, allowing them to determine whether they want to invest in the future of currency (Bitcoin) or continue to rely on traditional fiat currencies. Teaching Bitcoin as a core subject would solidify the evolution of new money (Bitcoin) without leaving room for questions or debates about its adoption.Is there any hindrance to this idea?Ideas like this might sound good to some while not the same to others. Certainly, I think the government might be the number one hindrance to such ideas, as they would keep feeding the minds of every generation with corrupted banks and financial institutions, making every generation believe that only banks and financial institutions are the places worth leaving our money.In addition, when every generation keeps using fiat currency, it would be very easy for financial institutions to print excessive money for their own selfish interests. So I think those in power might be a significant setback we might face in many countries.Note: core subjects are not mandatory subjects.Warning - This is not financial advice, but rather a suggestion aimed at helping the next generation understand the new form of money and also make an early financial decisions for themselves.Question - Do you think Bitcoin should be made a core subject in our schools?",

Maybe some type of crypto currency developer class can be taught at some school which teaches programming but it won’t be taught at the main level.They teach a lot of useless stuff at school that you never really need to know in the first place. In my opinion they should teach money management because young people have no idea how credit system works. Straight out of college they get into huge debt that they are forced to pay for decades after. This would do more good in my opinion than teaching about crypto currency to most people who wouldn’t want to be involved in it anyways.",

That's for the best because that way, you're going to see more than just bitcoin, who knows, some of those kids might even get interested in other STEM topics aside from bitcoin. The goal of having bitcoin in the curriculum is for the people to be curious about it anyway so I think that making it as a subject that has bitcoin as the only focus seems like in bad taste in my opinion.",

It's not the right time to discuss this. There are sti many countries that haven't legalised the crypto currency in their respective domains. They are not allowing people to invest in it because of the high ratio of risk that is being involved.There are almost 2 billion Muslims and scholars are still not satisfied that either it is permissible to invest in crypto or not. So until and unless these issues are catered I don't think so it'll be worthwhile to discuss this \"crypto as a subject\".",

When we examine certain aspects of this sector, we realize that we are essentially being taught the same things repeatedly. Some of these concepts are quite important, especially when we choose a career path at an early stage, while others are not necessarily meaningful.The educational curriculum is dynamic. In countries with a functional education system, the content of the curriculum is reviewed based on current realities. New topics are added while irrelevant ones are removed from the document. In my country the curriculum is reviewed every five years, therefore I don't think students are taught obsolete topics.QuoteAt times, I ponder, why do we even go to school?.

Sadly, many individuals today earn significant incomes but lack a solid financial foundation.Savings, investment and how to effectively use your income are taught in schools under different subjects. But the problem is that emphasis are not placed on them. However, you don't expect the school to teach you everything, it is the responsibility of school graduates to seek for more knowledge.QuoteOld scheme It's interesting to note that the current evolution of Bitcoin and its technology is gradually rendering banks and financial institutions outdated. The failures of banks and financial institutions have been revealed, as many now see Bitcoin and its technology as a new form of money, a good saving and investment plan, and also a way to manage money.I don't think Bitcoin was designed to replace banks. Banks have some important role to play in the financial system. Regardless of the advantages of using Bitcoin, many people will still prefer using fiat. Bitcoin will always be an alternative to fiat.QuoteUnfortunately, our schools still teach the young about banks and financial institutions, denying them the truth about real world happenings. Additionally, history has become a core subject even for those who want to study courses far outside it. They continue to teach these young ones about those who have ruled and stolen money from their nation, rather than implementing a financial subject (like Bitcoin) that would enable them to build their future at an early stage.Children need to keep learning about banks and the current world financial system because these institutions are still operational. Maybe they will stop learning about banks when we no longer have any banks around. Students need to learn about the history of their nation to enable them to learn lessons from the past. History lesson is not just only about past leaders and some politicians should be emulated because they did very well. However, most politicians who stole money didn't end well. QuoteQuestion - Do you think Bitcoin should be made a core subject in our schools?Children in primary schools are already been exposed to Bitcoin when money is been taught. As they move to high school Blockchain technology is exposed to them and Bitcoin is discussed. Some universities offer courses on cryptocurrencies. I think financial education should become a core course while Bitcoin education should be included as an avenue to invest.",

Everything is much simpler and this is what it looks like depending on the country.Any school has a training program drawn up and certified by a higher authority (in fact, government bodies). Therefore, changing the school curriculum is possible only with their consent. Given the non-acceptance and denial of bitcoin by government, adding (formal) training on the basics of using bitcoin is unlikely. I believe this will require going through 9 circles of bureaucratic hell.On the other hand, why do you need school to learn the basics about bitcoin?

I am going in to give them hope, that scamming isn't the only way, the country is in a mess, to be honest, fathers and mothers did all they could to send their children to school and they lost a leg doing so, but when the kids are through with school they can't even buy the parents a walking stick, it is ridiculous. Still, I don't encourage hurting another human being for a living, it is wrong, so it is better to give them hope, crypto has changed the lives of many in my country, but some people still believe that there is nothing out there that can save them than to scam people.",

When you say core subject it means it is a course that is taught to all students no matter the age or whatever they are pursuing.I don't think it is completely necessary to make a whole subject about Bitcoin itself. I don't think all kids would be able to understand all the complexities of bitcoin let alone be interested. I have no problem about teaching Bitcoin to students but having a whole separate subject just for itself might be too much. Instead I think Bitcoin or crypto can be part of stem sector as it has something to do with mathematics and technology.",

Let children grow up before introducing them to things that they wouldn't be using at that age, teaching them about Bitcoin wouldn't make much sense because when they grow up, if they have any interest in such things, they can always learn about them, but at school level, they are supposed to be learning things that they are going to need in the near future.",
