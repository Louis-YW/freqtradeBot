(in this case, https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/bitcoin-23.0.tar.gz)I see all these tutorials that teach people how to build the source are using the git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin method which builds im assuming the most recent changes, so you get a version 23.0 followed by some alphanumeric string. Why use this and not just build the official release? Isn't this a more conservative way keep yourself updated?",

Isn't this a more conservative way keep yourself updated?I think it's a case of doing it how they're used to doing it with other/most software. It's likely that broken parts of the code will be commented out/not compiled for most software that's expected to be downloaded a lot this way but it isn't the best way to do it and there is probably a greater chance of getting bugs too.",

Usually tag x = release x, that way you are (almost) sure that final product will be the same as released binary.For example for the latest version you look for that state: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v23.0The same zipped sources which you see under /releases/ have the same content you find using tags.",

If you download both the signature, the public key(s) and the source code from GitHub, it's easier for an attacker, or from GitHub itself, to screw you. On the other hand, if you do the former, the attacker needs to compromise both sites at the same time.",

There used to be an issue with how the tarball generated with the Github release and it resulted in the autogenerated tarball not being deterministic. It is fixed however, I think the warning (or advisory, I would say) is just in case the autogenerated tarball isn't reproducible. Checked it again and it works fine.",
