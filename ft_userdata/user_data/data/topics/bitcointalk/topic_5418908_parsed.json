Elon has been creating another hype for the doge coin. Elon is making meme token becomes crazy again. I hope that there will be no more new era for meme token caused by most of these tokens being created by scammers. The main point is elon's having relationship with doge coin. that guy is always creating a tweet that makes people think he is a god of meme token.",

      "body": "People are getting drawn into a financial disaster. Elon Musk is hyping the Doge market but the fact is, Doge will never be accepted as a payment method in Twitter. Cryptocurrency is largely not legal in multiple jurisdiction where Twitter operates. So in some countries he may be able to activate Doge payment but in majority of the markets he will face regulatory roadblock. People who knows when to pull out, will make some money out of this hype. But that's not going to last longer.",
