In particular, we like to ensure our investors that claims about “Rug Pull” mentioned in some reports are not true at all. We are now fully working on the matter, and committed to protecting our investors. We will provide you with further updates as soon as it’s available.Meanwhile it seems they have deleted their Linkedin and YT profiles  Seems like we might have a small chain effect in SK since another lending platform has paused withdrawalshttps://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-bitcoin-lending-platform-delio-pauses-withdrawalsQuoteFounded in 2018, Delio reportedly holds an estimated $1 billion in Bitcoin , $200 million in Ether and approximately $8.1 billion in altcoins, data from its website revealed. Should I add the not your keys, not your coins stop chasing 25% APY offers line? Not that people learn or are even willing to!",

They take your money and make hugely risky investments, loans, or bets. They take almost all the profits for themselves, and when it inevitably goes to shit it is the users who are left with nothing with the CEO and buddies all walk away with millions in the bank.Look at FTX, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, etc. Same story every time.",

However, it seems that they have considerable popularity, especially in Korea. The website is ranked there at #29,083 place. 250-350k visits a month is not an insignificant number.What is most striking to me is some kind of cloud mining that they offer (I am very sceptical of this type of business).

In general, if we were talking about fiat, just by the percentage alone we would know it was a scam. As the crypto world has had much higher returns, higher percentages did not scream scam in the beginning but we should use the same criteria: anyone who pretends to guarantee you a return of more than 10% per year, is either trying to scam you or does not know what he is doing.And if we take into account that by lending Bitcoin you lose control of it, we will come to the conclusion that it is never worth doing it for a supposedly small extra % of profitability.",
