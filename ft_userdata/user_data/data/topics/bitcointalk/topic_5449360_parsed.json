The other address of the coin you're storing.Could be, there has some case you are trying to spending using the address you're using for watching not using the address of your coin it's being stored. That's why, you can't spend the balance, because the address watching are there is no coin at all but you're trying to spend.And the error show up (Balance it's exceeding from the amount)",

Its quite impossible to exceed or have inconsistencies on your staking amount unless ryzaadit says is right like you are using something just to watch the value or its inside the staking platform.Quote from: paramind22 on April 18, 2023, 11:04:22 PMI have around 800K and cannot send any now.It's the BiblePay coin. Maybe its a honeypot? Or a rug pull removed liquidity token? The name sounds sketchy and shitcoin so maintain a due diligence if using tokens like this.",

      "body": "It seems the coin is a fork of DASH, so this may be relevant.According to https://www.dash.org/forum/index.php?threads/amount-exceeds-balance-msg-when-sufficient-dash-is-present.48206/, Make sure the blockchain is synchronized. And try to use coin control.If it still does not work, the amount you are trying to send maybe does exceed the balance you have. Quote from: https://www.dash.org/forum/index.php?threads/sending-my-dash-to-another-wallet-says-i-exceeded-balance.49702/post-220249If you are trying to send out a privatesend transaction, you have two options :Option 1 : lower your number of rounds to mix (which will give you lower privacy, but could give some of your input amounts enough rounds now to get your 10.4 Dash out)Option 2 : Raise your number of rounds to mix with one extra round (hopefully this will now include all necessary input amounts, so you can get your 10.4 Dash out)Another relevant similar issue can be seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APeo9UKk-BM. On the video it shown about transparent and private balances, since it is forked, your coin might also have a different term in regard to the transaction type.",

Apart from the forum that this project has itself, you can also join their discord community here. Wouldn't it be better if you asked people who are also in the same scope as you? Well, I hope your problem is quickly resolved, mate.",
