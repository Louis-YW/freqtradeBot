But ordinarily with such terms, unless those who have crypto on their PayPal already and don't have anything to do with it, that will easily be the idea for those who want to try out some kind of new payment system, if not the terms, requirements, and fees are not much different from normal fiat payments either with bank transfer or cash deposit.",

Cryptocurrency is not banned in my country but in the province where I live, I don't think there are lots of people who knows crypto and even my cousin knows that I earn money in crypto but he still doesn't want to learn at all. The reason he is not good with English when you can learn it online.",

That’s still a government service which means they preferred centralized way of approach even with involvement of crypto.It’s also a waste spending your crypto just to pay your driver license since you don’t have any benefits using crypto as payment while converting fiat to crypto charge you expensive fees.",

Taxes are not bad but huge taxes which are just a result of manipulation is bad.Paypal does not provide a non-custodial service I think. So even if someone pays their bill in bitcoin through PayPal it will still remain in PayPal hot wallet unless one party wants to make a withdrawal. Using their service to pay in Bitcoin can be dangerous as well. They will control all of their customer funds so a large portion of the funds can be used to manipulate the market as well.How do you know they want to put huge taxes? Legalization is not a bad thing if they don't have any bad instincts. Legalization will bring more people into the crypto space and they will try to use it as long as they need to live under a government. No one wants hassle in the first place.",

This signifies clearly that they are promoting the use of PayPal while removing their tax on citizens usage and also PayPal will also tax you for that.

These institutions or sectors are always that getting in line with government rules and regulations on which it would really be that normal that they would be sticking on something that traditional or centralized.
