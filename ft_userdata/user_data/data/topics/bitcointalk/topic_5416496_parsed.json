And it made not very ballanced groups. In some groups there is 2 big teams playing like B or C, and there is some groups without any big teams like G and I.As I understand, Germany will play friendlies during international windows.",

Croatia and Wales are tough rivals, and next to them, there is Latvia, which is always on the opposite side. Armenia, where we have problems politically is another opponent. In this group, Türkiye can be 1st or 3rd. Only two teams from the group will participate in the tournament. My guess is that Croatia and Türkiye will come out, but Wales has a good chance too. Wales will go into restructuring, after the World Cup Bale no longer plays. That might be a problem for them.It should be an embarrassment for Türkiye to even draw from Pot 4, but the arrival of Armenia, the weakest team from Pot 3, made us ignore it. We are not in the World Cup. It's a must to advance from this group and participate in Euro 2024.",

England got relegated after finishing last in their group. What about that? France finished at the 3rd place in Group 1. Germany was at the same position in Group 3. Now I don't know whether this is something specific to the UEFA Nations League, or it will repeat with the Euro Cup as well. BTW, Turkey is in the same group as Croatia, Wales, Armenia and Latvia. Maybe this time they will lose to Armenia?",

Poland and Czech Republic are almost certain to qualify, as the other three teams are not very strong contenders (Moldova, Faroe Islands and Albania). I am not forgetting the victory by Faroe Islands against Turkey. But we can't expect such a small nation to perform consistently against top UEFA teams (Faroe Islands is a country with total population of less than 50,000). In Group H, Denmark and Finland may qualify. But Slovenia and Northern Ireland are also strong contenders. And finally for Group I,  the battle for second position is going to be triangular, between Romania, Israel and Kosovo.",

So it should be in theory but Poland had a lot of difficulties to win against Albania in Albania in the world cup qualifiers and Albania was not in a good performance,now the players have really stepped up their game and maybe we can see some surprises in here.Although I think it will be an easy group for Poland and Czech Republic as they are really much stronger than the other teams here but hey as you said Faroe Island won against Turkey so anything can happen as the ball is round as they say.Most probably this group is going to be an interesting one for the outsiders.The fact that two teams out of 5 qualifies makes it even harder for the teams.",

Well, I really don't think that CR7 will leave Portugal so quickly, he has a commitment to his son, who will be trying hard to be able to play with his dad, he is just asking him to hold on a little longer to make his dream come true It would be spectacular to see father and son in the same team, I think that if something like this happens, here CR7 shows that he is not only a good father, but that he can make any dream come true, just because of the force of will that has for his son CR7 will be able to hold his Euro and will also be able to play with his son, I think this would be something great and an example to the whole world.Quote from: Sithara007 on November 02, 2022, 04:15:21 AMQuote from: Strongkored on October 22, 2022, 05:30:01 AM~~~~His dominance in the Portugal team is very obvious and this should be the focus of the coach to be able to cover the gap when he is no longer playing.~~~~There is an article here regarding the future of Portugal after the retirement of Ronaldo:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11312473/World-Cup-Portugal-cope-Cristiano-Ronaldo.htmlMost of the people here won't be able to remember the time when he made his debut (2003, when he replaced Luis Figo for the match against Kazakhstan).

Well, one thing is for sure, not only Portugal but several teams must look for their replacement generation, for me one of them is the same son of CR7, which is something that is noticeable, since he asked him to hold on a little longer to see if I can play alongside him in the Portugal national team, it is something that they both bring, possibly they can make it a reality, as a fan, as a father, I would like to see that, I would like my son to follow in my footsteps and to be able to work with him too in the future.This is something that perhaps every father would like to do, and fulfill, it would be a source of pride, and in football if it is possible and if the son meets expectations, why not?",
