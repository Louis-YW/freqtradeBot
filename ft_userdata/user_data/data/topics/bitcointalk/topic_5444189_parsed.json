Of course, Bitcoin doesn't cease processing transactions all over the world. It doesn't rest. It doesn't have a holiday and can't be shut down. Coinbase, of course, is the opposite.I also think it's wise to promote Bitcoin not only by presenting Bitcoin and its revolutionary features but also by making people realize the kind of system they are currently in, particularly emphasizing that they deserve better. The ad is kind of enlightening, showing the why of Bitcoin. Some might find no reason to get into Bitcoin without being presented with how rotten the fiat system is. But in countries like Lebanon, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and many others, even China with its funny CBDC that has an expiry date, they're the best promoters of Bitcoin.",

They are really focus on social advertisement these days, i mean on Facebook every short videos, and even on YouTube, they will put on an app that uses cryptocurrency, they are not directly putting bitcoin, and just saying crypto because of the backlash in the past for bitcoin because they are being use by scammers and bad guys on their scheme, so the approach is pretty much good approach as a commercial strategy.They also show how bad the system is but, not in a very big way that will hurt the current system, what really a big advantage is crypto is that it will not take 3-5 days just to clear your money, and that might be the best pitch by coinbase that will make other bank customers eyes pop, and try how will it help, people transfer money without any hassle like in the videos that, they are stress because, the money is needed but take more time, people this days want's faster transaction, because of the fast phase, we are in.",

Exposing the problems of conventional banking will positively affect the crypto industry. Coinbase wants to attract more customers to its platform with this advert which might make them carry out business transactions on its platform. Some of these customers might also later discover the imperfections of a centralized platform like Coinbase and move to embrace decentralized wallets. People need to be aware of these parasites called banks and that's what this advert is trying to depict. The conventional banking system is gradually drowning people slowly and most people lack the knowledge of available alternatives.",

It is generally known that today's payment technology leaves a lot to be desired and the biggest obstacle with Bitcoin is that it is possible to make payments without a third party. because with Bitcoin you can fully control your finances.However for online merchants it may be a different story as it means they have to charge their customers more to cover their transaction costs. These are all problems that can be solved with blockchain-based solutions, which of course include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let the free market decide...",

If you have not watched it then you can view it here.  Interestingly, the advertisement was great and it seems like coinbase is talking about cryptocurrency not directly about bitcoin but still talking about shady things like fees, transactions, atm, banks, etc. which is I think a great move introducing a new system like cryptocurrency avoiding this kind of things would probably attract a lot of users to buy cryptocurrency.It could still introduce a lot of users into cryptocurrency at least even though most of us hate coinbase and doesn't really recommend coinbase because it's still a centralized exchange, but the ads could be better if they could somehow show a glimpse of the bitcoin logo there or maybe any cryptocurrency. This was probably one of the best ads of coinbase, hopefully, coinbase could start something that could support their users when it comes to decentralization, the fact it is a centralized exchange just completely discourages a lot of users as well as high fees.",

They can use it as daily payment method that has mostly no financial gain purpose.",
