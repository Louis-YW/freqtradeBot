      "body": "OP, Stompix is not against someone making a scam accusation report but rather after the basis for making the report, you just provided us a twitter link probably and assume that the required way of filing a scam accusation report, you need to learn how to do this the appropriate ways and this begins with your clear explanation of the issues on ground, proving them with enough evidence with references, i will suggest you go back to learn on how to report a scam because most of the things you guys brought here are not even scam related issues.",

You are creating multiple accounts, posting about the same useless scam accusation over and over again. Even when you are advised, you instead take offense and insult the advisor.",

This forum is for ordinary people who prefer privacy and when you are talking about describing a person as a fraud who will require a judicial investigation, without a good lawyer and his charges are clear and in violation of local laws in Helsinki, Finland, I do not expect that you will win this case or at least move public opinion with you.Creating more accounts and trying to revive them every once in a while will not help you with anything, you are wasting your time and people will start ignoring your posts, so tell us how we can help you and accurately describe why you think CTO of Localbitcoins is a scammer?",
