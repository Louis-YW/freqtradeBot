But then everyone is free to write or respond, but it should worth it.After creating censoring foul words , I learnt many things from old members of this forum, especially LoyceV (you shared external links for me), philipma1957, Rikafip and lots more. I understood the uniqueness of this forum as it concerns freedom. I ignorantly requested to be deprived the freedom I should enjoy. In the same manner I feel that hundreds of other users are ignorantly requesting theymos to retrieve the freedom we enjoy at large in the forum.Let me discuss this in the following sub headings; Altcoin wallets child board suggestionSomeone created a topic suggesting that a sub board for the above be created. The suggestion is actually one of those that might not be considered. But then, I read where other forum members told the OP that \"Here is bitcointalk, if he desires such a board he should create an altcoin forum and establish the board\". This is discriminatory or rather telling theymos that he was wrong to create the altcoin section. I learnt that Ethereum project started from this forum. If altcoins are as bad as projected, why do we have the boards in this forum?You came to this forum to earn This is another phrase that is used against newcomers. Did anyone join this forum to recreate the forum? You will see someone wearing high paying signature and yet will frustrate a newcomer trying to rank up because they perceived the newcomer came for money. Maybe theymos will have to deactivate signature campaign let's see how many people will remain active here genuinely. Merit fishing You will see someone with thousands of merits accusing another person with 5 merits of merit fishing. I mean there is a merit system, it should not be a crime if anyone makes posts to earn merits in order to rank up, whether they fish for it, hunt it or the merits locate them (which is very rare.)Bounty huntingBounty hunters are treated as menace in the forum. Once you are known as a bounty person, you will be treated as an anti-bitcointalk. But the bounty section is in this forum.

If not for the money, why did they join campaigns?QuoteMerit fishing You will see someone with thousands of merits accusing another person with 5 merits of merit fishing. I mean there is a merit system, it should not be a crime if anyone makes posts to earn merits in order to rank up, whether they fish for it, hunt it or the merits locate them (which is very rare.)You can't compare this entirely, and note that merit farming is bad, it encourages low-quality posting and cheating. It's also obvious that those with thousands of merits are doing far better in the quality of their posts, especially on the general board. But the issues happening in local boards are the reasons why I can't entirely disagree with you.QuoteBounty huntingBounty hunters are treated as menace in the forum. Once you are known as a bounty person, you will be treated as an anti-bitcointalk. But the bounty section is in this forum.

You will know that it's a desperate approach and they often have links and affiliates that could propagate and distribute fake information and scams. They are not so honourable if I must say. More so, their activity/task is outside the forum.Personally, I don't discriminate if they write well, but try to investigate, these bounty hunters don't post quality. Fast earning is in their minds, and often write low-quality posts. If not, their posts would naturally attract merits even if it's little.",

Not only price. Then, what other factors did you have in mind when you said this: \"Besides I can be correct to say that bitcoin was once a shit coin, when it was worth many figures less than a cent.\"No, you can't be correct in saying that because nobody in their right mind called Bitcoin that. The term \"shitcoin\" was first used by member ribuck back in 2010, when he perfectly predicted what would happen in the following years:Quote from: ribuck on November 08, 2010, 04:23:48 PMQuote from: gavinandresen on November 08, 2010, 03:59:24 PM...it would have to be better in some way other than just \"I started the new chain, so I've got a lot of the easy-to-generate-at-the-beginning-coins.\"You say that now, but if bitcoin really takes off I can see lots of get-rich-quick imitators coming on the scene: gitcoin, nitcoin, witcoin, titcoin, shitcoin... Some of them are sure to attract users with promises like \"Why use bitcoin, where you can only generate 50 bitcoins every few months? Use shitcoin instead, and you'll get 51 shitcoins every 2 minutes\".Of course the cheap imitators will disappear as quickly as those 1990s \"internet currencies\" like flooz and beenz, but lots of people will get burned along the way.From that point on, the term \"shitcoin\" was a synonym used for all the clones and copycats of Bitcoin, with no real purpose, that followed.Quote from: Zoomic on September 13, 2023, 11:24:25 AMI am not defending altcoins but I am saying that altcoin promoters or lovers shouldn't be segregated. Why not? Even those altcoin lovers (God forgive me for saying this) have the right to speak their mind, and they do have their own space on this forum. The Altcoins section is there mainly because all altcoins are basically spin-offs of Bitcoin, so they're connected to Bitcoin and blockchain tech in some way. But let's be real, that doesn't mean the altcoins talk is super crucial for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.",

      "body": "OP, you might have noticed that I talk shit about bounty hunters and sig campaign spammers and the like, but understand two thing:1) I have signatures and avatars on ignore, so unless I check a member's profile manually I have no idea if they're participating in a bounty or campaign.  The shit-talking I do is based on years of prior experience with people who are incentivized to post on bitcointalk.  Let me ask you, have you been on any other forum and seen a new member create a thread asking how they can rank up or make good posts?  I seriously doubt it, and if you say you have I'd like to see the evidence.  Many older members did not come here so that they could get paid to post, even if they're doing so now.  If someone came here due to their curiosity about, or passion for, bitcoin then why wouldn't they want to get some extra BTC for what they'd be doing already?  That's true of a lot of old-timers.2) It is without question the members who participate in bounties or bitcoin-paying sig campaigns that aren't selective about who they accept that are responsible for most of the garbage posts here, and it's the reason why Bitcoin Discussion (which should be the best section here) is infested with low-quality posts.  Campaigns and bounties primarily pay for posts in English, but this is a global forum and for many members English is probably not even their second language.  So what happens?  People who can't write English to save their lives come here to try to earn a living by writing the most insipid nonsense ever written in the history of discussion forums (except for the ones that still allow \"+1\", \"great post\", and the like).Wonder why the merit system was introduced in the first place?  Go back to December 2017 in Meta, and you'll probably find that there were a bunch of threads about forum post quality.  It had been a major issue for years prior, but it hit its boiling point right before Theymos dropped the merit system on us in Jan. 2018.  And let me tell you, senior members were not a big part of the problem unless those accounts had been bought or hacked.Don't get discouraged if you see a lot of shit-talking, though.  Any new member can establish themselves if they really want to, and I've seen that time and time again.  But I wish it wasn't as rare a case as it is for that to happen.  Most newbies are just here because they heard they could earn money online.",

If altcoins are as bad as projected, why do we have the boards in this forum?<big snip>This is about freedom, let us allow everyone to enjoy this freedom at the confine of the forum rules and regulations.Some altcoins belong and are absolutely needed for crypto to continue.The vast majority are terrible garbage and do not belong.I am more inclusive of Pow coins than I am of Pos coins.I like the bitcointalk has an alt coin section and have posted hundreds of photos (now dead due to Imgur) I am particularly fond of Scrypt and the LTC/Doge merged mining L7 machine  built by bitmain.Some disagree with me and want all BTC and purity of it and it alone.I tend to think of them as exclusionist's and let them be as much as I can.This does not mean I like the 1000's of altcoins that do exist. But I do recogonize some altcoins are decent.https://coinmarketcap.comlists a lot of coins. last I looked over 9000 coins.   9129Liquidity Money9130SOLANA 2.09131POWERare the last three on their list on page 92 I am sure under 200 of these coins have worth",

To be honest, what you just said is a load of rubbish. At the time it was considered to ban signature campaigns or disable signatures but to stop the spam problem in the forum where you had a lot of people writing rubbish to rank up and earn money.As theymos is smarter than that, he came up with the idea of the merit system, which reduced the spam problem a lot because before it was introduced people would rank up simply by seniority, and many would just do it by writing rubbish one-liners in mega-threads and stuff like that.

What you call genuineness I'll explain it to you: if theymos ends with the signature campaigns today, tomorrow traffic would be reduced so much that you wouldn't even recognise the forum. I've seen other forums die but for other reasons, and that's when you go there and you think about replying to a thread but you see that in most of them the last reply was a few days or even weeks ago. On the other hand that would be giving away traffic to other forums, where the genuineness you are talking about would go, and if this forum is mainly to preserve Satoshi's writings I think it is better if it remains an active forum than if it looks like a tomb or a desert.",
