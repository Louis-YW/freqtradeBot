Trump is a politician and he is also a businessman by heart. So these kind of people do not have any permanent likes or dislikes. They usually try to capture the flow of the people. If Trump understands that supporting Bitcoin could increase the percentage of votes he is going to get, he might do something positive about it. But I would say not to keep high hopes. Things can change in a blink of an eye. I don't see Trump doing much for Bitcoin but being a businessman, he may decide to build a Bitcoin/crypto reserve in US like everything else. But that won't be a great news for the common investors like us. Too much of government and corporate money could ruin Bitcoin entirely. yes, we will see increased adoptions and decreased regulatory actions, but at large, it may not benefit the retail investors. A lot to unfold!",

This would be a bold move, signaling a significant endorsement of Bitcoin from a major political figure.Have you everly known the secret of the politicians or what the rings in their mind?Okay let me brief how they does and the words that are so common in their leaps.. A politician would sit to analyzed the world trending or like a state/country trending and to what they are lacking and used it a political strategies to win the people's heart towards that area. I could remembered 8-10 years ago in our country during a political campaign where they said of giving our country a 24/7 power supply, and whatever, people thought the candidate is the best but when finally being elected as President of the country we really saw the opposite instead it went to worst till date and off course we knows all their strategic movement and what they can do. Naturally Donald Trump sudden movement toward bitcoin is nothing that one can't sink in their heart because he is using bitcoin and cryptocurrency to gain the heart of youth especially he knows the world trending that that is \"Digitalization\" he doesn't mind using this to gain attention of 80 percent of world attention to vote for him.QuoteIs Trump About to Make Bitcoin the US’s Secret Weapon?I don't think this is possible or likely to happened so soon.",

He has worked out the maths and understands that the proportion of Americans that are pro Bitcoin are on the increase, he needs their votes to become president. So it's probably nothing personal for him to support Bitcoin at this time and get what he wants, their VOTES, what happens if their votes gets him into the white house again is what we'll wait to see. People change and perhaps Trump, has seen that Bitcoin has come to stay, maybe he'll support it with favorable regulations if he wins the presidency.",

As we said bitcoin should be completely segregated from centralized exchanges because it makes bitcoin more centralized, but do we have any solution for that? Or like when ETFs enter the market and many people don't like this, they constantly protest but do they have any solutions to stop or change that? We have virtually no solutions to these problems and we should instead learn to adapt. Most people have only one concern: they want the market to go up, bitcoin to go up, and they understand that celebrities and politicians can do that. Do you think they will stop before reaching their goal? The crypto industry is severely divided politically and electorally in the US, but we will have no way to stop it because self-interest comes first.",

I understand that it's about accumulating Bitcoin, but how much Bitcoin and under which conditions?

Especially in America, where Bitcoin is no longer something strange to hear about. Trump's first campaign still denied the existence of Bitcoin but his journey after leaving office discovered the great power in bitcoin which made Trump open his eyes and make the voice of the Bitcoin community an addition to the election. Despite the way Trump leverages the voice of the Bitcoin community for his campaign, I think he's managed to attract attention so far. But remember, politics is still politics and the ending is always bitter. It has become a rule in politics, even though Trump was elected president and supports bitcoin, in government decisions are taken democratically and involve the agreement of many pro and non-pro bitcoin parties.",

I am not saying that he can't do anything good for it, of course he could be doing something that will be loved by bitcoiners, just not that radical, that seems too far off. I mean the 30% miner tax alone is a big deal, if he says he will get rid of it and make USA miners powerful again, then he would get a lot of votes and a lot of love anyway.And he can even make it politically motivated move too, right now there are too many Chinese miners who are doing it, and not care about the pollution or energy consumption, if we start to tax our miners then we are going to be left behind and people of USA will buy the coins Chinese mined. That is literally all he has to say, if he says helping the miners means winning another war against the Chinese, then everyone at republican side will support him no questions asked.However, making bitcoin reserve would not be easy, that is putting even more fire to what is happening to dollar.
