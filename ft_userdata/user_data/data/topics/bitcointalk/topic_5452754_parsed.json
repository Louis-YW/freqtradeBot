  "content": "This is an abstract kind of question so I am directing it in a separate thread so that it doesn't distract from the mammoth task @joker_josue and @TryNinja are undertaking to preserve legacy images that had been uploaded to third party websites and used on the Forum.If I've missed any threads, please let me know.TalkImg.com - Image hosting for BitcoinTalk[Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images[Script] Fix broken Imgur images forum-wide (client only)Known alts of anyone: User generated (Mk I - 2015 to 2016)[User Generated] - Known alts of anyone  (Mk II - 2016 - 2017)Known Alts of any-one - A User Generated List Mk III (2017 - 2022)Known Alts of any-one - A User Generated List Mk IV (2022 - ongoing)[BPIP] Bitcointalk Public Information Project [Back in Action]A week ago, joker_josue created a thread to announce their TALKimg.com website - the aim of which is to enable users to upload images that will be still viewed many years/permanently into the future.Inspired by their work, TryNinja has created a script to port legacy images hosted by third party websites onto the TALKimg.com website thus preserving them.I've had a look through my own threads that I have created (~60 in all) and found at least a dozen were locked that contained images that I would like preserved and so I have unlocked them whilst I am in the process of porting the images from one hosting site to another.  I've unlocked all of my threads whilst I am carrying this out and will then re-lock them once I am done.This got me to thinking.  In the case of the other contributors to the Known Alts threads that I *can't* unlock?The BPIP.org website offers a script which in part enables users to copy text that is contained within locked threads:QuoteIf a dummy UID were created by @theymos , posts from any locked threads could be quoted, posted to a thread in an obscure part of the forum (e.g. \"archive\" so as to avoid anyone seeing the post and replying), the images are ported and the post \"edited\" (or not) then the post is deleted thereby not skewering anyone's posts counts.  Once the locked thread's legacy images have been ported to the talkimg.com hosting site, a PM is generated requesting the links be changed to the updated links which I imagine could also be done automatically via a dedicated UID that receives the notification and has admin privileges to unlock, modify, then lock the threads again.I'm sure there are other threads whose images need preserving, so this would enable those threads to be freshened up but still remain locked.Admins already have the ability to merge (or split) posts of others, so it is not like a bot couldn't just sweep said threads (or indeed the entire forum) in the background.Thanks for reading / replying.",

      "body": "With the urgency by not just joker_josue and TryNinja to port legacy images off of third party servers before they are removed, others such as @LoyceV are also downloading en-masse the entire archive of legacy images either to talkimg.com or other unspecified backup sites.The question then is how do they propose to update the links to those images they have spent the last ten or so days methodically downloading to make available for others?  Scripts can only have so much reach - especially if the images are removed by the host site.From recollection, posts can be edited in the back end via the SQL databases without there being any indication on a thread page.  The same is true for the handful of trust-feedbacks that have been removed through intervention that I am aware of where e.g. DOXing has occurred, so it is not beyond the realm of possibility that an admin/mod could intervene via unlock, edit, lock.My thoughts above would be more along the lines of a request is made to have a relevant but locked thread's image's links updated to talkimg.com - more than likely they would unlock the thread, run the code and then re-lock the thread.  In my model, even without the thread being unlocked *anyone* with the code could run it on a locked thread with the \"report\" being sent to a bot-UID that would upon receipt of the relevant information (perhaps an accompanying token to ensure no malicious intervention were occurring) run it's own code to then unlock, update the links and then re-lock the thread.Locked threads from (in my own case, the Known Alts threads) to the Pumpkin Carving competitions are viewed by others - some threads are locked, some aren't.  But, you're not going to get each and every person coming back online years later to update their threads.  Hopefully my suggestion gets some traction and is acted upon.",

From my perspective, if I happen to disappear from this forum or something happens to the content of my posts in a time where I'm no longer here and assuming that the images posted by myself end up broken, then the whole message within my reply/post will be lost in translation for anyone who reads them. In that case I wouldn't mind if someone edited my post and replaced the image to its original posting state in a way to preserve my chain of ideas. While I totally understand the privacy side, I can't be the only one that gets frustrated whenever a particular image attached to a reply is no longer visible and the user specifically uses it to sustain his/her post.",
