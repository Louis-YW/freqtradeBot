  "content": "That's right, let's all share all our parlay or bet builder here. It doesn't matter what sport it is. Basketball, Volleyball, Football, NFL, Tennis, Darts, UFC, Boxing, etc... As long as it's a parlay or a bet builder you can share it even if it's combined in different sports. That includes electronic sports and games too.No singles, please. 2 games/player props minimum. Same day games are also better and hours before the first game starts so we will have time to copy it. Purpose: Giving a chance to others to tail your picks.How: It could be text base, SS, or the ticket itself if your bookies have the option to share your ticket.Examples:Cleveland Cavaliers - Milwaukee Bucks - Over 214.5New York Knicks - Toronto Raptors - Over 214.5Philadelphia 76ers - Detroit Pistons - Over 222.5Total - 5.51Example 2:https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A56624290&modal=betExample 3: Just a print screen of your parlay.Sorry if I am more focused on NBA parlay, I just love that game. But I do make parlay in one card of UFC and boxing if the events are intriguing.What's the difference? You could share a combined parlay from different sports if you want to. Betbuilder will be shared later as it's not available yet. I think bookies are still trying to conclude the players available before they add it.Los Angeles Clippers vs Charlotte HornetsKawhi Leonard Over 28.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds; LaMelo Ball Over 30.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds; Kelly Oubre Jr. Over 25.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds@3.25",
