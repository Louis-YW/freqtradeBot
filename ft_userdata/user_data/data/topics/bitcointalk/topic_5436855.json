So if you followed that addy it woulve came from DOgg andgone back to DOGG.    As for the BTC that I swept from all these cards that were still funded....thats another story as they have gone to a paper wallet.  Nice listed oh bearded one!  You might wanna add that thousands in premiums were also lost due to theft DOGG perpetrated!   Thats the hidden loss that  many are not aware of unless they understood the market for these cards.   Thanks again for making it![moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

I would not assume he is 100% broke, he gotta have some assets left, property to live in, stuff like that.Also, I agree with BitcoinGirl. Even if he was completely broke, what kind of message would this community be sending if you all start let people to get away with stuff like this, even though the alleged scammer is fully doxxed?Best case scenario he still have some stuff and a french judge will force some garnishment to happen.How much would cost to prosecute someone in France?
