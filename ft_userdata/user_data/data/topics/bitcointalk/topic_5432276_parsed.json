Just because you don't want to hear about it it's happening. And that insanity happens right on my backdoor. Naturally Russia doesn't want that we would talk about it, they even put people to prison because they called it as a war. And that should be enough of reason for people to keep talking about the war crimes that are currently happening. The fact that you try to silence others because you are tired of it, doesn't mean anything in any scale. It just shows lack of empathy from your part.",

I don't live in 2 countries that are at war, but what I'm going through, like high commodity prices, energy crisis, and economic crisis that I'm going through is partly caused by war. I'm following all the war news because I want this to end and don't want to think that our generation will see World War 3. That's really terrible every time I think about it.OP, one more thing, Nato is not as pacifist as you think, the head of NATO is the one who caused this war.",

This comes after the research laboratories’ existence was exposed under the Trump presidency. “The Pentagon is actively working to transfer its unfinished research projects to the countries in Central Asia and Eastern Europe,” Igor Kirillov claimed during a briefing over the Christmas weekend.In addition, he says, the Biden regime has been increasing its cooperation with Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Kenya, and other countries in Africa as well as the Indo-Pacific, with “the US Department of Defense being most interested in countries that already possess laboratories with a high level of bio?ontainment,” he added.According to Kirillov, information about illegal American-backed labs in Ukraine was given to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons conference, which met in Geneva between Nov. 28 and Dec. 16.The information included “documentary evidence that work with components of biological weapons and studies of pathogens of especially dangerous and economically significant infections had been carried out on the territory of Ukraine with financial, scientific, technical and personnel support of the U.S.,” he said.RT.com noted further: ...",
