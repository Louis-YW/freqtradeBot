  "content": "Hello everyone!I'm a newbie here and just got into the physical game this past year.I've been scouring the collectibles board since joining here and have seen some amazing stuff!One thing that caught my eye was the Mantis Bitcoin Poker 2020 9-chip set. Minerjones had one for auction a few weeks back for reference if anyone is unsure what I'm talking about. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414228.0I am an avid poker fan/player and am really hoping I can get my hands on a set.If anyone has one they'd like to sell or have information pointing me in the direction of a set, I would greatly appreciate it!Thanks in advance everyone, I am excited to be here learning and discovering!stackinsats777",
