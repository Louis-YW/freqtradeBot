  "content": "We're only a month away from Adopting Bitcoin â€“ the event which takes place in San Salvador, the capital city of the first country which accepted to use BTC as a national currency.Though I'm no fan of top-down adoption and didn't join Bitcoin to deal with governments, I support the event for a very simple reason: I know that, at one point, the government is going to change and the legal tender status of BTC is rather fragile. But I want normal everyday people to be prepared for the inevitable changes and learn more about how to protect themselves against wealth confiscation and the money printer.So I've recorded an interview with Kemal and Noor, two of the co-organizers of the Adopting Bitcoin event. If you're planning to visit El Salvador next month, you're definitely going to find this interesting.The recording is available on Spotify https://open.spotify.com/episode/073uyo6G9jSF9sCEJ5gcoU?si=HYl_zmbMTgujLfyYKjMxpQ, Apple Podcasts https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bitcoin-takeover-podcast/id1451766883?i=1000581615885, and every major podcast streaming service.

It is not easy as they are a small nation and the first nation makes Bitcoin legal tender.They have to build things together with learning from reality, practice and adjust their plans. It is never easy but if they succeed (that I believe), they will achieve something very sweet. If Bitcoin won't die, El Salvador have many reasons to succeed with their massive plans for Bitcoin. But their President has to be very carefully and should not bet the all national budget into Bitcoin. He needs to have Plan B to avoid liquidation and national debt collapse.",

Controlling exchanges are way easier and I think most governments will go this route so they don't have to risk their capital and use companies to do it instead. The 'small' part is also their benefit compared to other countries because it will be easier to manage if a crisis happens. Other countries usually don't have that 'luxury'.",

And yes, this is actually a very good interview am gaining a lot of insights from it...thanks for sharing. Thank you for listening! I also believe that adoption should happen at a grassroots level and should be voluntary, as opposed to having a government authority step in and tell you what to do. At the same time, I respect the efforts of the people who created Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte, of the educators who put together the \"Mi Primer Bitcoin\" classes, and everyone who tries to make the most of it. Something that I've had to accept is that purely ideological models rarely apply in real life. And sometimes you can either wait for your ideal to emerge, or else try to model the reality around you with the skills that you have and hopefully turn it into something which more closely resembles your own idea.I still believe that the best action that governments can take in relation to Bitcoin adoption is to ignore it, so people naturally discover BTC and prepare for the collapse of the fiat system. But what makes me more sympathetic about El Salvador is that they never used force against people who don't accept BTC yet. So the efforts are still bottom-up, trying to educate every merchant and service provider to use a wallet and understand why self-custody matters. This is also the reason why I'm going there next month: I'll launch a Spanish translation of my magazine and tell everyone that it's open source so they can read, print, modify, distribute, and even sell without asking for my permission. It's something that they can use in their journey and I'm happy to help.",
