  "content": "Did anyone watch the latest documentary about Ross Ulbricht? It can be found on Youtube (or at this secondary link) and it was created by the Free Ross organization.I'm asking because I noticed some interesting allegations, besides all the injustice made during the trial. The injustice made towards Ross is well known (I think) by most of the people knowing details about the case; many of them were detailed also by xtraelv in his very interesting topic.However, some unknown (at least for me) details were exposed in this documentary. Some are very unrealistic (such as the suspicion about Mark Karpelès being Satoshi, which I find as being actually a delusion, but nobody knows the truth), but some raise questions though... Besides, the film details the idea of Karpelès being also DPR, not just Satoshi.For example, at the beginning of the documentary (between 0:04 and 09:22), is stated that first mention of SR was made here, by the user silkroad, inside the topic Silk Road: anonymous marketplace. Feedback requested  (which is correct). Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the first investigator of SR (who never mentioned how he found out abour SR's existence), found out that the site mentioned in the topic (silkroadmarket.org) was only a surface web platform which was informing the users about how to use Tor and how to access the real SR on Deep Web. Der-Yeghiayan found that silkroadmarket.org was registered with XTA.net, a domain server owned by a company of Mark Karpelès named Mutum Sigillum. As you already know, Karpelès is the ex-owner of the defunct Mt. Gox. At this point started the suspicion that DPR (the new owner of SR, after Ross handed him the site) is the same person with the owner of Mt. Gox.By that time, according to Ross' statements, he was no longer the owner of SR. He declared that he was overwhelmed and, after finding a guy who helped him a lot with the site, he agreed to pass him the ownership. This guy's nickname was DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts) and he is (was) suspected to be Karpelès.From here, things become even more interesting: Karpelès bought Mt. Gox about same time when SR was launched. In the documentary is raised the suspicion that Karpelès may be Satoshi (which I doubt) and that he would have all the reasons in the world for opening SR, as he would place there the BTC earned through Mt. Gox and vice-versa. Besides the interesting coincidences, there is also an absurd allegation - that Karpelès was also the owner of BitcoinTalk, information given to Der-Yeghiayan by a secret informant, who previously was hired by Karpelès. This idea appeared after another coincidence noted in the film, as it follows: the SMF platform, used for BitcoinTalk site, was used also for the discussions forum hosted on SR. Besides, due to the rarity of SMF being used in forums, the fact that it was used on both BitcoinTalk and SR raised investigator's suspicion, determining him to consider even more that there is a same owner for both, meaning that Karpelès could be Satoshi.Example of similarities UI-wise between the sites:Coming back to Ross and to how the investigation started (32:00 - 34:46): it is stated that the govern used a \"parallel construction\" in order to frame him and to make him look like the real DPR. To be more specific, an IRS agent (Gary Alford) found on BitcoinTalk a post containing Ross's email, which was written before the thread found by Der-Yeghiayan (mentioned above). Practically, Der-Yeghiayan found the topic Silk Road: anonymous marketplace. Feedback requested , which was posted on March 1st, 2011 by the username silkroad, while Alford stated he found a post made by the user altoid on January 29th, 2011 (without specifying the name of the topic). The documentary says that Der-Yeghiayan couldn't have found this post during his investigation because it didn't exist. Alford claimed he found the respective post being quoted by another forum user in a discussion about SR (I could not find this post, although I searched it). Afterwards, Alford mentioned a real post of altoid, from October 11th, 2011 (which I found to be IT pro needed for venture backed bitcoin startup), where an email was stated: \"rossulbricht at gmail dot com\". And from here, the govern was led to suspect Ross being behind SR.However, claims the documentary, this information could be planted by Karpelès (the alleged owner of BitcoinTalk) or by any other user with high level of access. Besides, the way that Alford found the respective email is compared with \"finding a needle in a haystack the size of the Internet\" (which I totally agree). With other words, from all the people trying to find information about SR owner, Alford only managed to find this email address. From here started the idea that the information was planted. Because if someone with high access would have made the respective post in the name of Ross then handed the information to Alford, everything looks more realistic.The entire documentary is very interesting, but, however, its first 35 minutes are the ones raising the questions detailed in current topic. Could Karpelès be Satoshi and also DPR? Another aspect, not mentioned in the documentary, but known inside the forum, is that Karpelès also performed an audit over BitcoinTalk. Maybe this aspect would have raised even more suspicion in the documentary.Quote from: theymos on October 07, 2013, 05:18:33 AMI believe that this is how the attack was done: After the 2011 hack of the forum, the attacker inserted some backdoors. These were removed by Mark Karpelès in his post-hack code audit, but a short time later, the attacker used the password hashes he obtained from the database in order to take control of an admin account and insert the backdoors back in.In the end, I want to mention that I found very interesting the entire film, which brings new details about Ross's case, about the unbelievable way the judge treated him or about the sabotages that some secret agencies / agents performed towards other agencies / agents. I recommend everybody to watch it, it's a must see documentary!Translations (in chronological order):Română: Cazul Silk Road: povestea adevărată nespusă.

      "body": "Any other TLDRs? I couldn't handle the narrator's lack of popshield. Being grabbed by FBI agents with the SR admin page open and responding live to a fella outside on a bench is just about convincing enough to me. Beyond that there's so much murkiness and weirdness I wonder whether any definitive story will ever emerge. Were there multiple DPRs? Was there more law enforcement weirdness? Quite possible. The nature of what he created and the desire for government revenge no doubt means aspects of his trial were screwed before he started. I can't see them ever letting the slightest chink of light through from the off. My view is that he's 100% guilty and a penis. He deserves to be jailed. He most certainly doesn't deserve to be jailed for an entire lifetime. And since the trial seems so warped he should be free anyway. Had he been directly hooking up drug makers with drug consumers that would be cool, but he was smoothing the way for all the blood money in the middle. SR removed some street level violence. It did nothing to address the horror in the manufacturing and transportation. As for Karpeles, he comes across as stupid, dishonest and lazy. And his every other action points towards the same conclusion. DPR was none of those things. Several million times so for Satoshi.",

Yet another surprise:Afterwards I tried to search the documentary on Google: still nothing. Apparently, the material is not present anymore on any website; or, at least, it's not accesible to public anymore. I searched using many keywords, including \"Railroaded\", this being the term used for the initial presentation of the material.Now I'm asking: why did the Youtube user restrict the access to the film? Furthermore: why can't the documentary be found anymore on any other website? Even more importat: why was it eliminated even from the website of Free Ross foundation? If, for some reason, the websites hosting the material could choose to restrict public access to it (although it seems hard to believe that all those websites took this decision), still the question remains: why doesn't it appear anymore even on the site of the organization meant to support Ross?Were all these websites pressured or threatened by agencies?Maybe none of these questions will ever be answered.However, if anyone manages to find the documentary online, please share it here as well.",

If you'd watch the video you'll find out some details which you never knew. Among others, he was caught while running SR because DPR was asking for his help in that period, with various requests. It is also possible that DPR did that on purpose, for framing Ross. Excepting that, Police force did not follow the legal procedure after taking his laptop (details which can be also found inside the documentary), thus they could tamper the evidence before the trial. For acting like that, this evidence should have not even been taken into consideration during the trial, as it became irrelevant evidence from law point of view, yet it was taken into consideration.Quote from: franky1 on February 14, 2023, 08:48:30 PMbut if the guy wants to try to shift blame. he is a bit late to that defenceThe aspects from above, together with many others, were contested by Ross in all possible Courts, including the Supreme Court of Justice, where he highlighted the fact that he was not given the chance for a fair trial. Yet all his attempts failed. Now it's late for defense indeed, but this does not mean he did not try to defend himself when the time was right. Many witness have been denied in court while others were accepted, although they were not supposed to. Same happened with the evidence provided. Please watch the video then come back to this thread.In the end, we have one man behind bard for two life sentences (plus 40 additional years) -- like someone could actually fulfill such a sentence!!! -- for a crime without victims. For running a website! A man at his first offense!Besides, how can it be explained that all other dark market owners which were caught after Ross were also released from jail, while this man is sentenced for life?!?",
