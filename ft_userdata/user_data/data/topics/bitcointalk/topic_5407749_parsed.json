  "content": "I previously owned a test jig for the S9 and it worked for the Antminer S9 and some 17 series hash boards. But recently it has rested. I want to buy a new jig and I want to be able to use it on the S19. No suitable ones have been found so far. I was wondering what do you use to test 19 series hash board?",

I did notice this test fixture from ZEUS before, but I only saw its introduction picture was no marked S19, so it was ignored at the time.Quote from: BitMaxz on July 27, 2022, 02:00:50 PMAntminer universal chip fixture test fixture.Entering from this link, I see that S19 is mentioned in the introduction.

Does touch screen model mean \"2022 new version Antminer test fixture with touch screen\"? Why is it mess? I'm thinking of buying the generic or this new version, can you speak more clear? I want to know. thanks.",

I fixed mine with a generic S17 board from them. The convenience of portability is negated by the quirks. It’s just a mess but it is completely functional. The one pro I will add about this machine is it has a dedicated board inside that takes ATX power and runs pt2 test fans.",
