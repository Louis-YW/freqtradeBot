      "body": "Mollars Token: Moving Towards Full Decentralization - https://x.com/mollarstoken/status/1804700364412719506In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Mollars Token is making waves (you would say no, but yes, we have nearly 130 daily organic visits on http://mollars.com) with its commitment to full decentralization. This journey isn't just about technology; it's about empowering a community to take control and shape the future of their investment. We're thrilled to share significant updates based on community feedback, showcasing our dedication to a decentralized and robust ecosystem.Token Burn and Supply AdjustmentResponding to community concerns about the large supply in the Reward Program and #CEX wallets, we have decided to burn 700,000 #Mollars from the reward wallet ( worth 195 000$). This strategic move reduces the circulating supply and aims to enhance the token's value and stability. Decreasing the supply creates scarcity, positively impacting the token's price and attracting more investors.Burn Txid: http://etherscan.io/tx/0x85c119308fd6f1382a9513ff4aa11fd28f551ea196b2ac264341edfecb79cd2dSuccessful Listings and AuditsWe are proud to announce that Mollars Token has been successfully listed on major exchanges such as Lbank, Uniswap, and Bitmart. These listings mark significant milestones in our growth, increasing our token's visibility and accessibility. Additionally, we have completed a thorough audit of our smart contract. This audit ensures that our contract is secure and reliable, providing peace of mind to our holders as we move towards renouncing the contract and transitioning control to the community.Audit: https://www.cyberscope.io/audits/mollarsRenouncing the ContractRenouncing the Mollars Token contract is a bold step towards true decentralization. This process involves relinquishing control over the contract, placing it entirely in the hands of the community. While this transition marks a new chapter, a team of professionals will remain available to support and ensure smooth operations. This move underscores our commitment to decentralization, where the power and decision-making lie with the community.Contract Renounced #Ethereum Txid: http://etherscan.io/tx/0x772c9fbbd058fc5d754255ce7f89a62616f3450145db03dd7b224a38c7ae1e8eCommitment to No Founders Holding TokensTrue to our promise, no founders hold Mollars Tokens. We have allocated 300,000 tokens for CEX activities and vested the remaining tokens on unicrypt until September. The same approach applies to the reward wallet, with 300,000 tokens retained and the rest vested until September. This strategic vesting plan is in preparation for the launch of our decentralized exchange, http://Mollars.cc. By eliminating founder holdings, we aim to align our interests with our community's, fostering trust and transparency.Cex Wallet: mollars-cex.ethRewards Wallet: mollars-rewards.ethTXID: http://etherscan.io/token/0x385d65Ed9241E415cFC689C3e0BCf5aB2f0505c2?a=0xdba68f07d1b7ca219f78ae8582c213d975c25cafUnicrypt: https://app.uncx.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0x385d65Ed9241E415cFC689C3e0BCf5aB2f0505c2Targeting MEXC for the Next ListingWhile our efforts to list on XT have not yet materialized, we are setting our sights on MEXC for the next CEX listing. Achieving this goal requires hard work and motivation from the community. We aim for a 5 million market cap, enabling us to get listed on MEXC with a Kickstarter campaign to boost our visibility even further, if possible. This is a call to action for our community: let's unite and work together to make Mollars soar. Complaining is not an option anymore; it's time to take action together!",
