You borrow with % crypto from those who have crypto.You need USD? Well you borrow the USD Stablecoins off course you get with lower % If you borrow with collateral with BTC.No wonder why TETHER USDT recently started using BTC to backing up valuation of currency.The future look like the USDC and USDT will share the Market and role of reserve currency status.",

But, the point to notice here is Russia recovered because it has Natural resources and fertile land I am not sure about the geography of America can they depend on their slaves to rely on natural resources such as agriculture or Minerals the answers seem No very clear. America is an industrial country and this is where they can generate future resources for them.One more thing people think WW3 is on the way haha I think we are living in WW3 and moreover, we are at the end of the Initial phase next to it it's gonna be more and more critical.

Like, the debt is really huge, and there is only one means that their government has been using to repay loans but has not been able to keep up In the past few years, they have accumulated a lot of debt and I wonder if there is a crisis in the country's currency, the value of their money will really not be worth anything because even the level of inflation in that country is so high. So, I think that even in that country and other countries, many people are already aware of what is happening to the economic system and know that it might even get worse, but the question is, what is the government doing to help the situation? I believe if it happens, there's no one who wouldn't be affected. Even those government officials in charge.",

At first I thought it was probably your keypad not making the alphabet but, that seem not to be the case as, the alphabet \"A\" has been produced severally in your piece. Perhaps some auto correct shit but, you could look into it. Like, I've attached that to you already.You have a point in your observations of the big guys having to transfer some of there wealth to dump in gold. Can't say I've made same observations but, its got to mean something like you've anticipated. Although, I don't think gold is the best store of wealth or valued commodity out there. As a crypto enthusiast, I'll go for the asset which remains far above centralized systems and that is bitcoin, perhaps I'll diversify with gold but, chiefly bitcoin.",

I'm sure many folks have already taken precautions in case a recession actually occurs. There's nothing wrong with being prepared because recessions can catch people off guard, and those without preparations can crumble like dust.But as of now, news and discussions about a recession are fading away. The recovery since COVID has been faster than the public's panic about a recession (in my country). What I can do for now is build an emergency fund to feel more secure, whether a recession happens or not.",

While in Pakistan they were in debts, while going after all the terrorists wars they have also been in debts notwithstanding all the humanitarian aids they deliver to other countries of the world. In fact debts have been known with US government since it was created, it is the highest indebted country of the world. From what I gathered from my  research , it only cleared her debt during President Andrew Jackson in 1835-1836.
