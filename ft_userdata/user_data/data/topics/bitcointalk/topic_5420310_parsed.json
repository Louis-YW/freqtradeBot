I will open the bidding at 0.0150BTCFrom what I can tell this is a 8.125 board based on the photo and the board specifications circled here: Please correct me if I'm wrong MJ. As a side note, these clearly come in different colors. I am not sure if they correspond to deck size, but I have an 8.125 in green and this seems to be the same size in yellow, so ?. The photos on the website show an 8.25 in red/maroon. I have not confirmed with Martin regarding all possible colors/sizes, this auction is obviously yellow, and I have green, hm. . . . . I am curious if anyone has seen other deck colors.   Great item, very cool to see one up for auction. Geo",
