People are very well use to metamask extension.And to add with this development, I believe the fall of FTX also contributes to this increase.People are capitalizing the fact that the rival binance is in good position right now. And TWT is backed by binance company, so no wonder people are somehow pumping it. Just be careful buying now, because it may go down after everything settles in.Though the chance to further increase is there because binance is one of the reputable and top crypto-exchanges, and they are still expanding.",

Trust wallet is an open source as pet them, that could be the safest option for now, and personally I prefer this one as well.",

CZ was also making some awareness if another exchange site potentially goes down too. That makes so many people are withdraw theirs assets on the exchange site and then try to keep it in the wallet like TWT.

But if we really think deeply about it on what happen on FTX we should trust easily those exchange even how trusted they are since what happen to them might happen to binance or other big exchange to. So even if TWT pump we can't conclude that there are good happening or we can fully trust them with our funds so better store our money on wallets which we hold the private key and always believe on saying which always reminded here that \"Not your keys not your coins\" to make ourselves aware about those things that might compromise us.",

There are so many non custodial wallets to use and Trust wallet is only one of options for users.Metamask, Myethewallet, SafePal, C98 wallets are all non-custodial wallets and people don't have to bind themselves with Trust wallet.Moreover, they should practice to import wallet seeds from one wallet to another (like from Trust wallet to Metamask for example). I would like to use non custodial wallet that does not use their own special seeds because I will be in trouble if wanting to import seed to other wallet.Exchanges come and go, disappear. Seed is here with us forever but if only one wallet is compatible with that seed and if that wallet is no longer working, you will lose your crypto.",

Which, it's indeed safe to put crypto assets if we're willing to hold them for a long time and they should only be put in a non-custodial wallet, I just don't know if I understand it correctly.Because of these events, it just goes to show that putting a large amount of money into well-known exchanges is not 100% safe even if it is like Binance or others.",

The size of pumps should not be your measure for the quality of wallet/other services.I never used trust wallet, somehow I am skeptical because of what is discussed on that thread. I am already have metamask for the supported altcoin wallet, and electrum for BTC, I don't think there is a need for me to use trustwallet.About the current price, I do not think the collapse of FTX has something to do with the price surge.  Remember the fund inside FTX is somehow frozen so there is no way users of FTX will move their fund to trustwallet.  What more contribute to the pump I think is the support of Binance but either way I believe this is just a short pump that will be followed by huge dump.  So better get out while still in profit. and do not get FOMOed.",
