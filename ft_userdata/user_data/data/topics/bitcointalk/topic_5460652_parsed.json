Buy solar.I agree with you on that,¬† I got a solar system installed in my home since the last winter and I can assure you that I have not been off light since then,¬† I generate enough power from the sun that can power my entire house with a smart inverter fridge,¬† although we have a stable power supply but not up to 20 hours a day so with my solar system have a basic alternative that power my house for the remaining hours that electricity will be off. For anyone in the remote working and cryptocurrency activities within Nigeria, you need to have an alternative power supply that can power your device for a long duration of time if electricity is gone,¬† and generators are not the best alternatives right now,¬† solar has proven to be better since the cost of fueling and servicing is off from solar.",

For instance, it suggests avoiding harsh braking, but considering the presence of bad roads and reckless drivers, this may be a challenge that we'll have to cope with for a considerable time",

Buy solar.It is a nice advice on how to reduce fuel cost but from my own point,it is better to convert your car cabreator to gas as gas is cheaper compare to petrol. Solar should be used in houses and stores that is a good idea because solar energy replenishes and Nigeria is a good country for solar energy because of the abundant sunlight No need of spending too much if you can afford solar,there is a solar that can pump water. The earlier the better because fuel price fit reach 1k soon",

Buy solar.One does not need to be told to do fuel economization before he applied wisdom to how he consume fuel for daily use, there are alternatives means to use of premium motor spirit if we can device out some new ways and techniques and use them, there's use of biogas, solar system, renewable energy source, wind energy and many more ways which we can use to lessen the dependency on petroleum fuel consumption for daily use.",

Some persons are beginning to look for other alternatives like using cooking gas to power their generators and I heard it's better than the petrol.
