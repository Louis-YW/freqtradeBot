  "content": "Having gone through the Bitcoin Whitepaper myself as recommend by krakenfx . It's amazing to discovered that there's no single mentioned of the word Exchange and Blockchain,  which prompt some questions into my mind, nevertheless the word Bitcoin was also mentioned twice as note via https://www.linkedin.com/posts/krakenfx_have-you-read-the-bitcoin-white-paper-activity-6991919047869161472-ctmt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android , And with me confirming it specifically. Ever since I came across this whitepaper, I keep thinking of the following questions• Is this a new Era for Bitcoin upgrade, beyond Blockchain implementation• Is this the end of BlockChain era• Is there a new technology coming soon• What's this new evolution all about• How come no exchange was mentioned• What are your important take, from this new Whitepaper• And as noted by krakenfx what is money.",

But for what it is worth, [stock] exchanges was mentioned in the whitepaper.There is no new whitepaper.- Jay -",

      "body": "Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on October 29, 2022, 10:01:58 AM• Is there a new technology coming soon There was one called 'the tangle' that was introduced by the IOTA altcoin. But I can't remember the last time I heard any mention of either one. Ever since Bitcoin came out, all the altcoins that succeeded it promised to deliver more modern tech that would solve the scalability problems and allow that new currency to be cheap, secure, but also achieve quick transaction finality. As you are surely aware, it's Bitcoin that still sits at the top and it will be on the throne in the future as well.  I would have to do some research on the tangle to be able to explain it properly. But from what I remember, they never considered themselves to be a blockchain, meaning a record that begins with 0 and increases by one every time a new block is found. The tangle is like a spider's web intended to be a better store of records than the blockchain. No idea if this tech found any real-life application anywhere.",
