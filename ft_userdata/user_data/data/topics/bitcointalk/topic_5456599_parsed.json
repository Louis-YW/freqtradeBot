But at this point, AI is trying to prove itself to be independently functional void of human interference and this assumption is what will lead to the fail of AI development in the shortest time,  because AI is gradually losing it popularity.",

Some AI start-ups are: Open AI, Frame AI, Jasper, Drafter AI, Smartly.ai.What do you think, are we experiencing an AI startup boom like the dot-com bubble? And do you think that 85% of them will fail within 3 years? I think there's basis as to why this is the case. For one, the AI industry is not only infantile to the point where not a single one of these companies have made a relatively perfect form of artificial intelligence, and I doubt this would happen within our lifetimes but this apparent immaturity of the industry makes all of these companies try out stuff that would linger to the public. Think of it as the smartphone era with all the wacky features that old phones used to have like projectors and even infrared cameras, but with AI and for the most niche use-case. Besides that, AI uses so much computational power it's astonishingly stupid. Like the power it takes to just run ChatGPT takes its creators millions of dollars per week (correct me if I'm wrong) just to make sure everything is neat and working. And since startups solely rely on pooled funding and I guess crowdfunding as well, you better believe they couldn't and wouldn't be able to deliver what they promise, which obviously leads to their downfall.",

Well, I have been looking at the other industries startup market and seen that many have closed down already and when the market is too saturated for these AI/tech startups, for sure that many of them will have to close down because of how crowded the market is. 3 year span of time I think is already enough and we'll see that many of these will either continue and try to survive or will flourish and then the others to decide to close down. One thing is for sure with technology, these that are currently seeing to be amazed with their development. If they don't do better in the upcoming years, they may be obsolete and a newer tech will come.",

Keep in mind that they specifically talk about AI start-ups, not the AI industry itself. If they define it that way then yeah, most of the start-ups will fail.

You can see how some meme coins explode without having any different use case, for example, I believe the same thing will happen in the AI market.

As soon as the hype of those huge marketing influences dies down, you will see those projects drop drastically because they lack everything it takes to be in those positions. Let's take a good look at some NFT projects back then and where they are right now, as well as a few meme tokens like you have mentioned.",

AI really requires a huge budget in the long run, and if that start-up company does not have a huge budget over time, they will go bankrupt.

If they're not profitable enough to secure more investment, then they go under. End goal for a lot of these businesses is to be bought out by a larger tech firm or license out the technology.

The competitions is just so fierce that I don't even know what brand would I prefer, lol.
