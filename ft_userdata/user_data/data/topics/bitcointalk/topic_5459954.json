Freebitco  They are one of the oldest and are still rewarding users, but the reward is very small. There's a difference between faucets and cloud mining, freebitco.in offers free BTC to enable users test their gambling system and if you're lucky enough you might be able to multiply it till it gets to the minimum withdrawal amount.",

If it was this simple to mine BTC, BlackRock would be the dumbest investor ever purchasing that many rigs instead of buying used smartphones and using them as miners. Less energy usage, smaller investment, same profit? Doesn’t it sound.. too good to be true?",

If it were before, as of some years ago, there was this Telegram bot that was paying users some Satoshi just to complete some tasks like watching ads, following social media pages, liking some videos, and commenting on them etc. It was working very fine then but was really time-wasting and a waste of data subscription, but in a month you could still get like $5 worth of Bitcoin, and before then you might have wasted data of about $10, which never balanced with the stress.OP, the only way to earn Bitcoin is to invest in it.",
