All of your trades are failures, and if you continue doing that you'll soon empty up your account without any warnings. I recommend you to learn trading, and only place orders when you are sure that the trade will be in your favor. If you continue posting such signals then your followers will be bankrupted in short amount of time. The trading isn't an easy thing, it's even more riskier than gambling with higher leverages.The crypto-market is highly volatile, and those altcoins are very volatile, especially Lina, that thing can pump more than 10% in minutes sometimes and the ones who short such coins with high leverages will get liquidated in no time. I have done a testing on that coins by shorting it a proper strategy and have earned enough profits with just 2x leverage. I must say that I have faced some liquidations because of the volatility of that  Lina coin and I won't recommend anyone to trade such coins that have very high volatility rates.The Lina is currently trading at 0.0182$, and I'm sure if the pump continues then the coin will easily cross the 0.019$ price range. Although, I'm not sharing a signal but a simple prediction and I won't claim that my prediction is going to be right, but by reading the charts of the coin I can surely say that the coin might cross 0.019$ range and it might leave the level of 0.0195$ range behind if the pump continues with such volatility. That's why it's always better to be on safe side rather than blindly shorting a coin with such volatility levels.",

If I were you I would seek for more skills than just toiling around with which you know to be short time trading, because I don't really think advance trader would adhere to what you just posted here other than newbies just like you. I have to come to conclusions that if someone strictly follows you guidelines his or her account may not last long to get drain which I know isn't a good starting point as a trader.It's 08:20 UK London time i short Lina/usdt now Entry now tp target: 0.01680$ Today better to short becouse no LONG wicks danger of btc dom so much.Here is the result of your this shorting:Oh my friend for God's sake stop the trading thing, you'll lose everything. All of your trades are failures, and if you continue doing that you'll soon empty up your account without any warnings. I recommend you to learn trading, and only place orders when you are sure that the trade will be in your favor. If you continue posting such signals then your followers will be bankrupted in short amount of time. The trading isn't an easy thing, it's even more riskier than gambling with higher leverages.The crypto-market is highly volatile, and those altcoins are very volatile, especially Lina, that thing can pump more than 10% in minutes sometimes and the ones who short such coins with high leverages will get liquidated in no time. I have done a testing on that coins by shorting it a proper strategy and have earned enough profits with just 2x leverage. I must say that I have faced some liquidations because of the volatility of that  Lina coin and I won't recommend anyone to trade such coins that have very high volatility rates.The Lina is currently trading at 0.0182$, and I'm sure if the pump continues then the coin will easily cross the 0.019$ price range. Although, I'm not sharing a signal but a simple prediction and I won't claim that my prediction is going to be right, but by reading the charts of the coin I can surely say that the coin might cross 0.019$ range and it might leave the level of 0.0195$ range behind if the pump continues with such volatility. That's why it's always better to be on safe side rather than blindly shorting a coin with such volatility levels.I don't agree with you the highest could be 0.01850$ price range not 0.019$ And indeed i dont stop trading in few days my account is in good profit why should i stop ? My 8 to 12 hour price target for LINA will be today 0.015$ im full short on LINA.",

Btw why must it be Lina/usdt is there no other well known coin that are more reliable to trade?What i noticed is that is very common for anyone to come post whatever they thought of.",

My 8 to 12 hour price target for LINA will be today 0.015$ im full short on LINA.Why you don't agree with me? Even the chart is agreeing with me but why you don't?I requested you to stop trading if you don't want to lose everything. If you don't stop such kind of trades, you will cause more damage then good to yourself and others who follow your signals. I'm pretty sure that you need to learn crypto trading and that's why I recommended you to learn it before investing any money into it. If you are really profiting from trading than kindly show us a visual proof so we can verify that. However, if we observe your 3 predictions then all of those went wrong, and a good trader will never be wrong 3 times Consecutively.Quote from: Adbitco on May 29, 2023, 08:20:52 AMAnd you think a good trader will enter those options he or she provided?Just as I said earlier, is only a newbie trader like op could enter those trade which I think is not a good advise for a genius to adhered. Btw why must it be Lina/usdt is there no other well known coin that are more reliable to trade?What i noticed is that is very common for anyone to come post whatever they thought of.No, I don't think that any good trader will ever copy trade someone else. Because a good trader speculates the market and analyzes everything before placing any trades. However, there are so many newbie traders on this forum who might follow such signals, and for that reason I posted my feedback regarding his signals. I think he doesn't know the volatility of the market very well and blindly give such signals when he see a coin pumping a little bit by the exchange bots. @OP, I'm in no way against you, but my friend your own signals have shown that your predictions are wrong and the ones who follow your signals can face huge losses. In the world of crypto trading, it's always advisable to learn the market and its volatility, and once you know it well then make up a strong strategy, and a proper plan, and after that place any trades. That way losses can be minimum and your account won't get liquidated.",

Im expecting tomo to fall to 1$ price lowest. You are free to share trading entry positions with any extreme settings, but 20-30x leverage is actually not very attractive to most traders here, it's too mentally draining.Quote from: Shortmaster on May 28, 2023, 11:39:45 PM-snip-I have binance pics of my futures trades results where to post them ?

But I can say that, some traders should avoid futures trading if they are not good at making analysis and also not able enough to adjust leverage.",
