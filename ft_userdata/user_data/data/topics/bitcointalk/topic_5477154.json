We have noticed such trends in the past and bitcoin price still bounced back so i see no reason why we should panic sell during such downturn. Patience is virtue so we should learn to control our emotions when bitcoin is going down because it will always pay off and also understand that the price will not always go up so we should always expect a downturn.",

However, Bitcoin's resurgence is a sign of its durability, not chance. All humans react emotionally to market changes. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Those crypto millionaires? In addition to investing, they mastered holding. Checking prices daily may feel useful, but it's a problem. Real deal? The long game is about stability when everything else is uncertain.",

Bitcoin investment on the long term base is only sweat if you have a good source of income, for someone who come from a bad economic country, even if they manage to spare a certain amount, their mind will always be on the investment, simply because they can't afford to lose the money they are risking. It's really no good to start investing without having money or good source of income to watch everyday goes by with easy on the mind, the more money you make the better of an investor you will be.",

Bitcoin investment is not a type of investment that can make you an instant millionaire in a day. It is possible, I know it is. However, it's not as easy as most people think. Investing in Bitcoin requires more patience, if you can endure being patient until the right time and when the bull run comes, what you endure will bring you a profit that you never expected.",

This is why I don't see any reason why people will think that business is a get quick rich scheme. Bitcoin investment is one of the best investment that if you can have plans of investing in a long term, you will definitely make profit as long as you are not carried away by your emotion with the price fluctuations. DCA is the easiest method to invest in bitcoin over a long period of time because you will be using little amount like 10% or 5% to buy regularly.",

For example, investing in real estate requires an average of 20 years, and investing in stocks is not possible for everyone. Access to it also requires some knowledge and relationships to know the optimal investment other than Bitcoin, which everyone can invest in.",

When in a bearish market what should you do buy more or just watch it, when the market starts bullish how to take the right profit, do you speed take profits because the price goes up a little directly sell even though in bitcoin the potential for a big increase is always there.Never think of shitcoin as a long-term it will get worse and it is difficult to guess the price even more skeptical of shitcoin, the only one think of bitcoin as a long-term investment with your patience.",

Almost all those crypto millionaires out there got there by holding on to their investments for the long haul, riding the waves of market growth.Think about it: if you're constantly jumping in and out of the market based on every little price fluctuation, you're basically playing a losing game. It's like trying to catch a falling knife – you're bound to get hurt.But by being patient and disciplined, you'll be able to see through the short-term noise and focus on the bigger picture. This will allow you to spot those good investment opportunities that might otherwise slip past you. After all, the crypto market is full of potential projects, but not all of them are created equal.By taking the time to do your research and carefully evaluate each project before committing your hard-earned money, you'll be much more likely to end up on the winning side.

I believe those are the ones who didn't see how Bitcoin moved over the years. They are just newbies who are just starting to invest in Bitcoin. For sure, those who saw how Bitcoin moved over the years will not sell their holdings at a loss unless they urgently need that capital, but if they don't then they are the ones who are into profit right now. Anyway, those who made mistakes by selling at a loss will learn their lesson, and will not do it again.

I mean I'm not making any decision just because one of my coins went up huge. Currently, Cardano is up 50% already since last week, but still, I'm not selling it because it reached as high as $3 on the last bull run, so I might sell it near that price or even above if possible.",

I knew someone who bought bitcoin. Immediately after buying bitcoin, bitcoin started to dump, and after a few weeks, bitcoin didn't bounce back, so he decided to sell. A few days after selling, bitcoin bounced back to the price at which he bought it, and even more. I advised him to keep on holding then and not to sell, but he didn't listen. Actually,  he was a newbie, which I didn't blame him for, but he learned his lesson because he sold his bitcoin at a loss.

If you can't hold, then you might not be making much profit from bitcoin or even be selling at a loss. Most people that I notice who are finding it difficult to hold are those who depend on only bitcoin or invest everything in bitcoin without having anything left. If you are investing in bitcoin, then it's better to have other sources of income so that you won't depend on your bitcoin holdings. If you don't have other sources of income, then you will have to rely on bitcoin for survival, and if you invest everything you have in bitcoin, then you will have to sell some of your bitcoin in case there is an emergency and you need some funds.",
