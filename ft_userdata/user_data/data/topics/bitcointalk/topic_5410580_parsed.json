      "body": "Well this sounds like a global economic control where you will only get poorer and the so-called whales still have a lot of money whenever the market responds negatively. I think anything can happen at any time and mainstream media plays a role in supplying people to get caught up. Let alone the war that rages on, the black market even takes part.What if crypto whales specifically controlled all market movements? decentralization in general is getting narrower now, and are we going to see or follow the whales little by little? No one knowsThey move through the dark night, and announce prices at sunrise when you just wake up.",

Your local community may not. How to cope with rising violence, crime and theft. All of which usually occur in eras of economic recession and high inflation? Do you allocate a percentage of your income towards defense, personal protection and surveillance? How do you defend your family if guns are illegal in your country? Do you buy a taser, crossbow, machete or samurai sword? Do you try to move closer to where extended family resides for better protection and defense? Maybe move to more sparsely populated rural areas where crime might be less frequent?Focusing solely on money is a somewhat centralized approach. Does this mean you do not subscribe to diversification investment strategies or decentralized finance? Could it also be worthwhile to move to another country or region of the world that is better suited towards coping with these types of crisis. If so where would you go?",

You can't do anything, no matter how much you try to get out of this vicious circle, you stay in it.U focus on money and wealth becouse during times like this too much bs going on to take your focus away from the Money.Any many things are fake anyways with good acting and things like that.Without all this bs you not be distracted and when u not distracted u make better decisions.If u make good decisions with money...then u dont lose and its bad becouse u must lose in order to feeed those who dont work and never will work",
