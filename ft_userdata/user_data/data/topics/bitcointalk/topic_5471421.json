  "content": "As I have said in my previous post here, Malicious Red Alert apps, now scammers are using the war between the Israel and Hamas to create fake websites asking for humanitarian aid in Gaza. And it was reported that there are fake sites already mimicking the real one like this fake Twitter account:Code:https://twitter.com/gazareliefaidIf you look closely at this account, at the right side is the website that they are promoting.

What the people need now cannot be bought with money. Firstly the bombing needs to stop and there should be freedom of movement products. I don't think any goods can be smuggled in to Gaza.

One needs to be careful not to send money to some set of criminals who are lavishly living in hotels meanwhile the victims of the war are suffering from lack. Verifying these websites is important.",
