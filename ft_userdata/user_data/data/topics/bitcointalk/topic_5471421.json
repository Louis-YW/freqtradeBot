  "content": "As I have said in my previous post here, Malicious Red Alert apps, now scammers are using the war between the Israel and Hamas to create fake websites asking for humanitarian aid in Gaza. And it was reported that there are fake sites already mimicking the real one like this fake Twitter account:Code:https://twitter.com/gazareliefaidIf you look closely at this account, at the right side is the website that they are promoting.

Some even launched cryptocurrency token whereby anyone who buys into the ICO will be supporting the people of Ukraine. A lot of people actually fell for them before they realized it was all scam.

Don't even be surprised that even among the higher ranks of both sides, the war is just business and the victims are mere necessary sacrifice for a good business.

The latter often have some cause they're fighting for, but scammers are just exploiting the situation.The OP's effort is a great way to raise awareness in the community. I'm pretty sure that those who aren't newcomers to the market have seen these kind of scams many times before and won't fall victim to them.

What the people need now cannot be bought with money. Firstly the bombing needs to stop and there should be freedom of movement products. I don't think any goods can be smuggled in to Gaza. Maybe the funds would be used after the total blockage is over. Quote from: Upgrade00 on October 24, 2023, 05:46:28 AMThis is not a new low at all.

Deaths and destruction mean nothing to people and they see it as a major source of revenue. One needs to be careful not to send money to some set of criminals who are lavishly living in hotels meanwhile the victims of the war are suffering from lack. Verifying these websites is important.",

The Palestinians needs aid and support as they have been displaced from their various houses without shelter and food. If these scammers begin to scam donators who are willing to donate to the internally displaced persons at  Palestine and they find out others who are willing to donate would hold back their funds for the fear of being scammed as the funds would not get to the people who needs it. I like the fact that you have exposed them and their fake website so that people would be aware. Is there anyway you can make it go viral so that it would be in popular circulation that the world would see it and avoid sending any dime to that wallet address. I believe members here already seen it and would do the necessary to make sure these scammers do not have their ways.",

The scammer demanded for a ransom and kept threatening the little boy to pay up or he's going to post the nudes online. The lil fella couldn't bear it anymore and he committed suicide.

I have seen even bad people prosper while good people die.  Those who start wars as business are live far from the war zones with their families while innocent people face annihilation.  In some countries, big thieves and criminals are celebrated because they throw money around while small thieves are punished and burnt alive sometimes. So, it makes me wonder what karma really is and if it is selective. Even those who spread misinformation during the pandemic for economic gains,  including health practitioners that collected money to lie about deaths and test results, most of them are living large while many people died from their wickedness... karma might still be waiting for them to enjoying their money small before striking  We just have to be careful so we don't be in a situation of waiting for karma for help or justice.",
