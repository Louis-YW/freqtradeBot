      "body": "Well the very first dice game was actually on chain. It wasnâ€™t on Ethereum but it was on Bitcoin blockchain. The hash was used as the result so you knew it was provably fair. This was when fees were crazy cheap. I think the base fee was like 1000 sats but Bitcoin was maybe $50 back then so this was an ultra low fee.Then it eventually had a website because the fees increased and you could bet faster with a user interface. So this is nothing new but playing from a centralized UI just seems better for most players.",

I have no idea how it works actually I lost my comprehension with all they are saying. What I understand is that users are just going to bet fan cards. I think they mean users to stake BTB or BFF tokens which you get Fan cards. But these BTB and BFF will be on exchanges. It ask me to sign up using google account when I tried to login. Isnt this supposedly decentralised?",

What do you think? Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/better-for-fansTo be honest, I've seen this type of project before like a betting website, a gamified project.But all of them didn't find any success. The tracker on the coinmarketcap isn't even listed yet and its data of its market isn't viewable yet. It may click for a moment or two.However, its sustainability and the number of users do matters in the long run.",

There are lots of people who are still become beta testers for that platform. I will prefer to take it rather than better fan. The only problem is blockchain betting rarely get success in the crypto. It's caused by most of people prefer to use reputable sites that already exist.",

If you read the comments in the message section on the CMC platform, it is indeed a lure to enter. yes. it's back to each individual logging in or not in the end though the concept offered to the user is interesting and clear.",

What do you think? Just reading about the description on CMC makes me want to stay away from this token.They keep using the word \"betting\" and then they also claim it's not gambling. They want to call it \"predict to earn\" instead which I think is pure BS. I'm guessing nobody is going to lose anything if they make the wrong prediction but the question is where will the rewards come from? I bet it will come from thin air - minted in advance tokens. They entice the people to buy by offering a higher betting limit but what happens next if nobody wants that?I think this is one of those too good to be true projects.",
