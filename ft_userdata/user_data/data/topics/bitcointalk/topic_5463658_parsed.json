If it was so great then they would be using it instead of trying to get other people to use it (and pay).",

How do we know if that is reliable, or if there is a pattern to begin with? Their claim that the algorithm can predict the future hash is also quite unbelievable. I'll wait until some miners try using it and see how exactly it work. You're right, it sounds just full of bullshit for now.",
