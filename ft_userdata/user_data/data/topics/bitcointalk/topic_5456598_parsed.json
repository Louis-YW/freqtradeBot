And what P2P platforms are you using in Nigeria ?How will the government tax non-kyc cryptos?Just like what Charles-Tim said, bitcoin isn’t banned in Nigeria just that the government doesn’t approve of it is usage and any one that uses it is doing so on his or her own risk. There are many top exchanges that Offers P2P some like Binance, Kucoin, Remitano and OKX. We also have the local exchanges that actually Luno, Roqqu and Quidax. Only KuCoin exists as both decentralized and centralized due to KYC requirements. You can withdraw funds although limited to certain amount without undergoing KYC but I doubt it works for direct P2P transactions. It will be hard to tax non-KYC exchanges because most do hardly have a physical work place in a country to attract tax.",

It's just that there are a lot of press articles that give bad information, so I might as well go to the source to find out what's really true. for example, I thought btc was banned in Nigeria. Well, you wrote it's not really forbidden, but you can't buy it on a CEX with a CB. If you buy btc to a friend and a policeman comes, you don't go to jail, do you ?",

The highest Cryptocurrencies enthusiast in the whole Africa continent. Add it to what my colleague has said, 9ja government didn't ban BTC but stopped Commencial Banks to stop participating in any Cryptocurrency transaction and the banks obeyed the policy. So the bitcoinners use the p2p plus exchanges to carry out their transactions.The E-naira that the government created for it citizens to use is redundant. In fact in my locality I have not see one person use the E-naira for any transaction or even mention it, I Have not heard. The E-naira is not working in the country. Quote from: Becassine on June 16, 2023, 09:47:28 PMVery interesting. And what P2P platforms are you using in Nigeria ?How will the government tax non-kyc cryptos?Yes very well. Personally, I have used the p2p to buy and sell, it is just a regular thing for me. Well the government tax base on the territorial operation. If you are operating within the ampit ot the geographical  area of Nigeria them they will tax to avoid illogical activities allegations.",

People used bitcoin to sponsor the protest so after the protest Nigeria government was looking for the source. Of funding the protest program and they found out the mo ey was gotten from bitcoin so at the late first quarter of the year 2020 the federal government asked all the commecial banks to stop exchange bitcoin so the bitcoin users in the country use p2p for their transfer. The E-naira is dieing like this, nobody is using. Since when they created I have not seen anyone using to make a transfer even the so call backs is not using it.",

The CBDC has other objectives than the well-being of its citizens, so what are these real objectives?",

Banks which supposed use the E-naira to encourage the citizens to use the app are not using it so everything is just redundant. Every country has their aim on the CBDC so what the Caribbean thought of creating it might be different from the other countries plan. I think Nigerian CBDC was created for cashless economy which could not work out because the large number of people were not using the app see people didn't know the app and don't know how to use. So the project became an abandoned project for now. But it might resurrect again with this new government.",
