Having said that I personally prefer to see a new winner in this edition, maybe Bongs or Afghanistan against a big team. Pipe dream but i want to see it happening for an epic meltdown.",

Moreover, Afghanistan's opening pair is more reliable than Bangladesh's opening pair. For now, I cannot say anything about the match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan. However, some of Sri Lanka's batsmen and bowlers will not be in the squad due to injuries especially W. Hasaranga is likely to be out of the Asia Cup so the balance of the team will not be maintained due to the absence of one of their key players. This time it will be very difficult for Sri Lanka to pass the group stage in the Asia Cup.",

Because there is no way to say that any of the three teams here have performed consistently well. But Sri Lanka is a better team than Bangladesh and Afghanistan. I am most confused about Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Who can qualify from these two teams in Super Four? Bangladesh team's chance is slightly higher if we calculated  normally. However, it will be difficult for the Bangladesh team to maintain their position if Afghanistan is on fire.",

I haven't witnessed them playing ever since I heard Nepal has an international cricket team. I hope they deliver what they are expected to do.

Group A consists of India, Pakistan and Nepal, although in this case, Nepal's matches with India and Pakistan will be a truly uneven match. However, Nepal will not be able to compete with India and Pakistan in the 50-over innings as Nepali batsmen will feel helpless against the Indian and Pakistani bowling departments. Moreover, the Nepalese batsmen will not be able to withstand the bowling action of Pakistan's Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Harish Rauf.  On the other hand, Indian bowlers are also equal and Nepal is weak to them too, so I don't see any chance of Nepal winning the Asia Cup.",

Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka have always dominated the Asia Cup but even if Sri Lanka is not likely to do well in the 2023 Asia Cup, Pakistan and India have the potential to do well and Bangladesh can do well. Either Pakistan India or Bangladesh is going to win the title of the Asia Cup 2023 tournament. Just before the Asia Cup, Pakistan beat Afghanistan 3-0 in the ODI series and are at the top of the ODI rankings. Such an achievement will undoubtedly help boost Pakistan's confidence ahead of the start of the tournament.",

So from Group A, these two teams, India and Pakistan, will advance to the Super Four. Because I am not expecting a good performance from Nepal in the 50 over game. In Group B, Bangladesh is ahead of three teams in the ODI format, so Bangladesh can make it to the Super Four. Between these two teams, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, Sri Lanka is the better team. Because even though Afghanistan has a good bowling line-up, the batting line is a bit weak. So Bangladesh and Sri Lanka from Group B these two teams can reach the Super Four. It is not possible to say which team will make it to the finals without watching a few matches. However, these two teams, India and Pakistan, are ahead of all teams for the finals.",

India vs Pakistan matches are the focus of everyone's interest because these two teams never face each other except in major tournaments. India and Pakistan are two of the most competitive teams in cricket, so it is natural that people will be interested in watching the matches of these two teams. I think the match that is going to be played between India and Pakistan on September 2 will be watched by the maximum number of people. In major tournaments, broadcast channels earn maximum revenue only through India and Pakistan matches, so if India and Pakistan matches are abandoned for any reason, the broadcast channels may suffer losses.",

I have watched Pakistan's recent ODI series performances against Afghanistan and New Zealand. They played well. Pakistan won the series 4-1 against New Zealand and 3-0 against Afghanistan. Almost every batsman in the team is capable of batting well now. Pakistan's dependence on Babar Azam and Rizwan has reduced a lot. This is why Pakistan's performance is stable now.Quote from: Sithara007 on August 29, 2023, 02:26:20 AMThe problem with India is that despite having some of the best players, they never win major tournaments.

Yes what you say is 100% true because I have seen India perform very well in group stage but when they come from group stage to get knockout then the best batsmen of the team play badly and finally they can't make knockout stage confirmed. Over the past few years, India have seen such poor performances in the T20 World Cup, ICC ODI World Cup, and Asia Cups. But even though Pakistan played poorly in the group stage, they performed well in the knockout stage and have a record of winning the championship. In this year's Asia Cup, I hold India as a favorite, but if they have no problems in the group stage, how well they can perform in the knockout phase is just a matter of time.",

A lot of foreign players (especially those from countries such as Australia, England, South Africa and West Indies) have been a regular fixture of the Indian Premier League, ever since it was launched in 2008. As a result, foreign players are comfortable with Indian conditions, while the Indian players don't have that advantage while playing in SENA nations.",
