Una don see where em land? Scam project.Before Nigeria local board was created, we have discussed about zugacoin before on our local thread and it was seen as scam and it continued to depreciate, even during bull run. All-time-high, $287677Present price, $0.05152Which means if I have ₦1 million during its ATH, I would be left with ₦0.179 by nowNot worth going for such coin, but not only zugacoin but many other altcoins are like that. I do not think we should specify if the coin is created by a Nigerian or not, there are many other coins and tokens that are created by people that are not from Nigeria at all that are shit coins. There are over 22100 cryptocurrencies that are existing, they are too many, we should expect many of them to be shit coins. That is why it is better to go for bitcoin which do not fail like altcoins. There were even many altcoins that did not reach all-time-high in the last bull run. There were even exit scam projects, beside pump and dump projects like zugacoin.",

I've never heard of it or seen it mentioned anywhere in the forum, but it could have been discussed in the altcoin section, which I'm not familiar with. One thing these altcoins have in common is that they are only in the market for a short period of time and obviously after their self interest before disappearing into thin air. Only a few altcoins remain in the market out of thousands. I don't like them in general, so I don't waste my time investing in them.",

It is such projects that is the reason behind federal government launching the CBDC and placing some form of ban on crypto currency use within and around the nation.I dont really encourage anyone to invest in such project without proper licenses or background.",

So no matter how you try to convince me to invest in some altcoin I will never,despite what people are making out from it.altcoins are not always reliable no matter how  strong you think team is, they don't always have future promises. So the best way is to stay away from altcoins because it always hard to get their project true colour.A lot have happened at the past especially that Luna project which have gain many investors thinking the project have gain strong community, but at last it turn to a  scam project. Let just avoid altcoins and if we can't avoid it at all please let invest only small amount of money that may not weak our body after any bad happen.",
