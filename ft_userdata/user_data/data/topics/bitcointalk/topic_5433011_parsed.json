It seems mind of silly something u got to ask what's in minds of our leaders instead of pointless things let's focus on the bigger things.Im interested about oil Market i really don't care about chips and china want LET the china take tawain who really cares ? Do i care who Will produce things for me what i need for everyday life ? Not really .Important things are oil and food and electricity anything else are not Even that big oil is important becouse everything use oil and Also electricity.What i see is this too much panic over china invade tawain Twain is too far first of all and If i see on the tv news china invade tawain i turn Different channel it's not My business or neither my family business at all Im in Western country i heard about tawain first time this country Even existing in the world.So i dont think media should mention about china invade tawain at all it's not so much interesting info for public.And Also tawain is more close to china then USA so If anything then tawain got more to do with china then USA.Why USA waste time about this tawain ? USA got a lot markets in hand all ready like oil food and military what else they need more ?",

Some nations had to receive millions of Ukrainian refugees. You are suspecting that they wouldn't response or support Taiwan if China invades her because the former is far from Europe.QuoteBut tawain IS not close to anything main Areas its just middle of sea and what's the point for USA china to fight over tawain ? It seems mind of silly something u got to ask what's in minds of our leaders instead of pointless things let's focus on the bigger things.There are various reason why the US and NATO should be concerned about China invading Taiwan. Every nation should enjoy its sovereignty and territorial integrity. No nation has the right to invade another nation and somebody must enforce this rule. If NATO and the US keep quite one day Russia or China might conquer the entire Europe or Asia.QuoteIm interested about oil Market i really don't care about chips and china want LET the china take tawain who really cares ?

An instability in Taiwan would affect all the sectors of the world. The world is higher interrelated and interdependent. I never knew that the war in Ukraine will affect the price of gas, crude, electricity, fuel, bread, in fact everything would increase.",

So, maybe there isn't much of a problem over there. Or are they depending on the US too much?How Long Is Compulsory Military Service?https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/how-long-compulsory-military-serviceTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen announced early last week that conscription will include more intense training so that the country is better equipped should China invade. Conscripts will also receive a higher monthly stipend, increasing from NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), which is roughly akin to minimum wage. In a poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December, 73 percent of respondents supported the move.Fewer than 30 countries worldwide still require whole age cohorts to complete military service. But, as Statista's Anna Fleck details below, among those that do, four months is a relatively short period of time. Taiwan had originally stipulated two years of service, however this was gradually cut down to four months as of 2013, with the intention of relying more heavily on volunteer forces instead.As Statista's chart shows, North Korea stands at the other end of the spectrum in terms of duration, although media reports vary. The Guardian reported 10 years for men and 7 for women as of 2015, while the Indian Express puts the figures closer to 8 years for men and 5 for women. According to media reports, those in the elite class are usually able to avoid conscription....",

U.S. has an interest in ensuring the semiconductor supply and that also effects Europe. Of course the U.S. has been the only country supporting war efforts in Ukraine, Europe has done little to nothing. So I'm sure if China did pull the trigger and finally invade Taiwan, then I'm sure we'd see a replication of current events with the U.S. taking all the action and financial burden (by action I don't mean military intervention.)",

These developments come in light of the escalation of tension between the two parties against the backdrop of a meeting between the President of Taiwan and the Speaker of the US House of Representatives. Chinese television stated that the maneuvers that started yesterday, Saturday, and will end tomorrow, Monday, aim to practice surrounding the island and create a deterrent force in anticipation of any possible military emergency. Many took this as a serious warning (threat) of collusion between the separatist forces seeking Taiwan independence and the outside powers mainly represented by the United States. While the president of Taiwan condemned what she called \"China's authoritarian expansionism,\" stressing that Taiwan will continue to work with the United States and other countries to defend democracy and freedom, as she put it. At the same time, the United States called on Beijing to show restraint.What do you think?",
