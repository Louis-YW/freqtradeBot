      "body": "Hi,I think if you want to attract developers attention, you should improve the quality of your images in opening post.When it comes to your work and professionalism, you should definitely make better research about projects you work for. It looks like you've run two campaigns so far and both turned out to be a scam, but you didn't even explain that to the participants, you just blocked the threads.In the future, you should take better care of bounty hunters and secure their rewards in escrow.Good luck!",
