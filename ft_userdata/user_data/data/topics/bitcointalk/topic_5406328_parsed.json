  "content": "Alik BakhshiAfter Putin  \"In a time of universal lies to speak the truth    is extremism\"                             J. Orwell        There are undeniable truths known from the vast historical experience of Human civilization: - The future is always based on the past. - development is not conceivable without changes, and there are reasons for all changes.    In this regard, as history shows, every empire comes to an end. The Persian and Roman empires seemed to be eternal, but they also disappeared, like all subsequent ones, and the reason for this was primarily internal social problems. The time has come for the end of the Russian Empire as well; by the end of the 20th century, the patchwork empire partially collapsed into 14 states without any external influence due to the large number of neglected internal serious problems created by the erroneous ideology of Communism combined with authoritarianism. The defeat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War clearly demonstrated the viciousness of the communist ideology and the corresponding economic system. Blaming the West for the collapse of the USSR, which Putin is trying to instill into the Russian people, is groundless and naive. I want to note a very important detail - unlike all previous formations, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, communism was introduced by coercion and was of an experimental nature. That is, at first an ideology was created, and then under this ideology they tried to build a new social system, which ended in complete collapse. In general, any human intervention in Nature, and humanity is a part of Nature, always subsequently turned out to be a mistake. In this regard, the strong-willed decision of the Russian Young Democrats to establish Democracy in Russia ended in failure.    Yes, the need for a transition to democratic principles was evident, however, the Russian people, due to their mentality and having no experience of living in freedom, turned out to be helpless like an elephant on ice. Democracy is a good thing, but not all peoples are able to use democratic values ​​to the same extent. (1) We must also take into account the imperial worldview of the Russian people, which excludes the normal functioning of democratic laws. Empire and Democracy are incompatible things.(2) It seems that Putin, whose patriotism is over the top, understood this well, and therefore called the state system of Russia sovereign democracy, that is, democracy for the sovereign, in other words, a monarchy, which is most suitable for the empire. (3)   The Fuhrer of the Russian spill, who imagined himself a great historian, whose scientific delights I decided to use, in the article “Jews and Russians are one people” (4), headed for the restoration of the Russian Empire within the borders of the USSR, ignoring such a historical fact that every empire has his end, and began with the capture of Ukraine. The Kremlin strategist clearly did not expect a collective reaction from the West, however belated, to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The transfer of modern weapons to the Ukrainian army, combined with economic sanctions, will certainly not only stop the aggressor, but also inflict a defeat that is like death for Putin. The Russian Fuhrer and his clique cannot avoid an international tribunal for crimes, of which quite a few have accumulated over 30 years in the Kremlin. The emerging military situation is reminiscent of the circumstances of the defeat of the Russian army in the Crimean War of 1853-1856, when, due to technical backwardness in armament, Russia surrendered Sevastopol and admitted defeat to a coalition of England, France and Turkey. Since then, for some reason, the surrender of the main naval base of Sevastopol by the Russians has been considered a military feat of Russian weapons. By the way, in honor of this victory in Paris, one of the streets was named Sevastopol Boulevard.     Putin's Russia is reminiscent of the situation of a drowning in a bog, when every gesture only brings inevitable death closer, and this time there is hardly a wise guy holding out a saving hand. If in the 90s the West, having made a mistake, economically helped Russia to rise, today, after the defeat of Russia, no help will save the empire, which will crumble like a house of cards.      In the article “When the donkey dies” (5), back in 2005, I predicted the end of the Russian Empire. The empire will shrink to its original borders and its first president after Putin will be the first president of Muscovy. (6)1.

And those are two big differences. The opponent wants to blame the Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Kazakhs and other colonial peoples for the evil that the Russians brought to the land of Afghanistan and started with a diversion by attacking the courtyard of the President of Afghanistan and killing him and his family. And now he is looking for guilt for the evil done in the Azerbaijanis.It is good that today Azerbaijan is not part of the Russian Empire, otherwise it would accuse the Azerbaijanis of attacking Ukraine.",

What really drives them to do this? Is it their excessive intelligence or their blind eyes to see the truth of things? Afghanistan has not emerged from the cycle of violence since the invasion of the Soviet Union. This is really sad.",
