Just import the seed phrase on another device, generate another Electrum wallet using the app and send your coins to an address or addresses of the new wallet that you just created. Although you used a password, but as your device is with another person, do not think it is safe but consider it not safe any longer is the safest thought.",

But as Charles-Tim already said, restore the wallet in a different device, send the coins there from the wallet. Don't underestimate anyone and risk your money.My laptop once broke and I had to take it to the store to repair. I was telling them that you will need to do everything in front of me because I have sensitive date there. They smiled and then they opened it, gave me the hard drive.

I offered them one I knew would boot if the system worked but they said they'd be able to test individual components were receiving power anyway while the bios was running.If you can remove the drive yourself it's normally the best way to do things (especially if it's not an apple device as most others make drives very easy to remove - it's normally either the first or second compartment you open - aside from the battery and sometimes ram).",

There are file recover software that would easily recover deleted files, being newly deleted makes it far easy to recover, because of that, my mind will not be at rest.Edit:Or better to use an app that can permanently delete files on computer if MaxOS got a reputed one.",

They don't really need it if it's a display problem.Question is, how much money are we talking about here? You used the term \"hot storage\". That makes me think you aren't the average bitcoin newbie, and you might even have multiple ways in which you store your crypto. An Electrum hot wallet is one of them, others might be a proper cold storage or hardware wallets. If the amount is pocket change for you, remove the disk and don't think too much about it. Just say you had work documents on there and you needed to connect the disk to another computer to resume your work. They don't need to know the hard drive is missing because there is anything related to money or crypto on it.",
