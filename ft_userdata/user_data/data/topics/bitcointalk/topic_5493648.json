No one can predict that.  Because the bitcoin halving is an event that can absolutely be predicted to occur every 4 years, no matter what. Every 4 years the supply of bitcoin gets cut in half - and simple economics tells us when the supply of a desirable asset is cut in half, the price of it will naturally go up.Historically that has held true for bitcoin. The fundamentals of bitcoin are stronger than ever as long as the devs don't do something stupid like adding smart contracts or some other nonsense features to the protocol. Bitcoin doesn't need to be anything else but a super simple and ultra-secure store of value. It's simplicity is what makes bitcoin incredibly secure. Unlike ethereum and all the other garbage altcoins out there bitcoin has institutional grade security the same used by the big banks but with the added benefit of decentralization. The best way to destroy bitcoin is to add complexity to it which will introduce attack vectors and result in weakening its security. Then no one will want to invest in it anymore except the same idiots who buy memecoins and NFTs because that is what bitcoin will become if you try to turn it into Ethereum or Solana.",

Yes bitcoin will be doubled in price but remember that it is volatile so it’s not always gonna have high value.

This is what has been emboldening them and warrants the high fees payable in every Bitcoin transaction. Miners should not just complain, they've earned enough Bitcoin in years and the price of Bitcoin will always be an encouragement for them as this is an investment that will never fail. The price has been skyrocketing and has turned some of them into millionaires in USD. This is as they continue to earn BTC in hundreds of millions of dollars yearly with both their hook and crook ideas of manipulating the Mempool to get it congested so that they gain more money in that process through fee hikesCan you see the insane fees currently in the Mempool? It was worse shortly after halving and these guys continue to feast out of innocent people who do not have a choice but to use Bitcoin for transactions. Over time, I believe something has to be done about this, the activities and excesses of miners are too overbearing. Had it been that Satoshi did not leave the system as he/they did, it wouldn't have been like this where they've turned the entire blockchain into a full-time business in a monopolistic way.",

It can be high or low depends on time and how Bitcoin users choose to use their fee rates for transactions and demand on Bitcoin mempools.Bitcoin price does not x2 for each past Bitcoin halvings. It increases with higher ROI than x2 but nothing to be sure it will be higher than x2 in this halving and future halvings.Glassnode has a weekly report months ago about Ordinals' effects on Bitcoin transaction fee and income of Bitcoin miners.Inscriptions, Mempools and MinersHalving is only an event and between two Bitcoin blocks, before and after a halving block. Between two halvings, there are 210,000 blocks and time is about 4 years. Many things can happen during 4 years for Bitcoin adoption, mempools, demand and transaction fees.",

No. That is not how Bitcoin mining works.  Having more miners does not directly make transaction fees go up or down.  Bitcoin has this difficulty adjustment that keeps new blocks coming at the same pace no matter how many people are mining.  So even if there is way more miners, Bitcoin just gets harder to mine.  The number of miners doesnt do much to fees.  Fees have more to do with how congested the network is and how bad people want their transactions to go through quick.  More miners might make Bitcoin network a little more secure perhaps, but they do not drive fees.  Its about demand and congestion, not miner counts.",

Let's say it this way;Early miners were getting 50 BTC but the value of 1 BTC was less than a cent. If an early miner didn't convert the BTC to fiat or a stable coin till now, infact they don't even need to be mining anymore. So, the value of bitcoin appreciates over time, but there's no guarantee that past BTC is not used and the present halved reward is matching the present economic situation including power.",

But when you have more miners to soak up the demand then prices will stabilize and make it affordable to use again. More miners doesn’t mean that the blocks will be mined faster, only an increased hashrate power is needed to mine the block faster and even this is usually controlled by the regular difficulty adjustment to maintain the block mining average time to be around 10 minutes; which is the default average time. The only thing an increased number of miners do is to promote decentralization. Fewer miners might be a bit centralized as they can easily agree to even censor some certain transactions. Should Bitcoin transactions congestion continues the thing that could again ease the problem is an increase in block size limits, this will allow more transactions to be soaked into a single block than before. But still their problems greatly associated with increasing in block size is the security of the network, it will become less secure than it was before",

If you look at the current situation, you will see the network is super busy with nonsensical things like Oridinals/BRC20 tokens. That's why people are forced to pay higher transaction fees.

With the reduction of mining rewards, the process of mining Bitcoins becomes less and less profitable for the smaller miners, so they leave the mining industry and only the \"big boys\" remain. Having higher BTC price doesn't necessarily mean that the transaction fees will be higher. Two weeks ago, the Bitcoin price was around sixty five thousand dollars and the average fee on the blockchain was less than 3 euro. The quantity of transactions is what determines the Bitcoin price, so the mass adoption of BTC could lead to bigger amount of transactions. Off-chain solutions like the Lighting Network failed to gain mass adoption, while useless on-chain features like ordinals and runes helped for congesting the BTC blockchain.",
