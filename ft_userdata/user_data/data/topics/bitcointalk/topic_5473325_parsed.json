If the post was edited at that point, after the first 5 minutes, the changes will show up on the edit history. That’s it.If you edit a post 10 times, or edit a post after 1 day, 7 days, … there is no way for me (and my bot) to know since keeping track of every change is impossible.Tryninja would have to have a hell of a lot of computing power to check all the bitcointalk posts all the time.",

That topic is too good to be deleted by the autor. The information therein is superb. I mean, what must have prompted the deletion of the thread? Could it be because the thread was not pinned by theymos or something relating to that.Something extraordinary must have happened. I do not believe that anyone could put such an effort to create that kind of topic and out of vexation deletes everything. This shouldn't be accepted.

In the above case the OP erased his post because he might have thought that it isn't needed anymore.

Ratimov behavior these days is worrying and not appropriate. That is one of his self-moderated thread, I will not be surprised if he deletes all posts on the thread as has been doing to people recently.I have also observed that, like in the recent case in which he deleted his replies, another member's post got merged as one, and after asking, that member has to face some difficulty too. Of course, merging reduced the number of posts to 1, which is also a loss in terms of signature count.I hope his account is not being used by any other person, because this behaviour is really worrying as he is an asset to this bitcointalk community as he came up with a lot of good topics and compilations of different topics like his encyclopaedia topic, etc.And you are right, it is not an error as the OP can change the title whenever he is making the reply under a post. Even the member can change the title of the post other than the OP's one, but in this case, the post is the original one, so it can only be changed by the OP, so I don't know what the reasoning behind it is. Maybe he doesn't like the title and wants to change it.",
