Norway, we still were able to secure good fixed price contracts before the prices soared later in 2022. True, thats the reason i mustered courage to create an account here.

I highly doubt he is telling the truth, 2 cents per kWh is most likely a lie, with all due respect I'd be very cautious.As for your S19 pro, it will be pretty hard to find that model, most models that are floating for sale nowadays are S19j pro which is pretty much the same anyway, I don't sell Antminers but I think the price for S19j pro delivered to the TX including tax would be in the $2000 range, if you can't find any reliable source, reach out to me I'll try to recommend someone trusted.",

Thank you. It's just hard to justify in my mind to liquidate for $1500/ea when I consider how much I paid for them.  And then all the other economic factors.... will my electric cost ever drop? Will btc rise enough to make mining profitable for me again, or rise enough to sell for more? Should I double down and buy more at this lower cost in the event btc goes to 60k again. Not hurting for cash right now, so no emergency. Decisions, decisions.",
