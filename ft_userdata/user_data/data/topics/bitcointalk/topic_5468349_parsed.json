  "content": "Hello mates, Gambling is an habit that is taken very seriously by some gambler here in my country and not only mine if I can sure because the wanting nature to actually win is what keeps them driving and continue with the act despite having major losses, for some gambler stories of people winning is what keeps them afloat and makes them feel they too can do. The sad truth about this whole gambling stuff for me well I don't know for other but with the little experience I have gotten is that no one can be too certain and can be too safe or cautious when it comes to gambling and this is proven here in a betslip I won recently that just got me thinking of how i never even intended to forecast the odds or whatsoever, I just actually just FLEXED IT and the game came through for me which was fun because I played it for fun. So sometimes don't think just flex it and let luck do it part friends.",

Same for me though, when I used small bets with great odds, most of the time it will hit. But me thinking if I made a significant bet.But yeah, sometimes you need to show it to others if you won big. Maybe it's the psychology of gamblers as well, to let his friends or buddy and screenshot his winning and flex it to them.  . It's not a competition though amongst friends, but just to have some fun in your side with that huge odds that you able to win.",

It's luck on your side, but I don't know how much $ is at stake.I have also experienced this with a capital bet of $5 the total odds are @40 unexpectedly that the multi bet won perfectly with the team I chose without any analysis can win but the opposite is when with serious capital bets say the capital is large.With a capital of $20 multi bets with odds of 10 are still very difficult to win, sometimes I think whether this is luck or just guessing, but it doesn't feel right if sports betting doesn't compare other statistics.",

Seeing on the screenshot that i thought it was really that purely in USD but i havent noticed or just simply missed out that there was \"N\" beside it which its do signifies other currencywhich it resulted into those numbers above which 2 cents to 20 bucks? Its not really that bad at all.",

Because you have to remember that of the many people placing bets, you are one of the people who get the luck, so make the most of your winnings and don't spend the profits from the winnings you get and then return them in further betting or gambling in the hope that you will get more wins. bigger than before. because sometimes a win in gambling can destroy a person's belief that gambling is about fun, which in the end a person is only focused on continuing to win in every bet they make.",

Most of my games are parley and I know this is actually the hardest type of bet but I don't gamble with serious intentions I just flex it and feel maybe luck will shine on me .",

Yeah winning is what makes a gambler to continue gambling, even if you lose 7 and win 2,  that 2 you won will be like a motivation for you to continue because there is always hope for bigger and better wins.  Gambling shouldn't be an habit that should be taken very seriously like you said, it could be addictive if it's too habitual, and that's not healthy for a gambler, gambling should be done for fun and leisure times because it's a game of luck.",

That's why if we are gaining some house advantages, I think that's still reasonable to flex them so that other people will realize that gambling is not just all about losses but there are exciting winnings as well. But still, we should play the games with caution. Gambling is still unpredictable, we don't know if we will lose or win every time we decide to play.",

      "body": "Congratulations on the victory, I believe many people have already heard this, but it's worth repeating this again: sports betting has nothing to do with luck, it depends on statistics and data analysis from the past and present. In this more specific case, you analyzed each team and chose the teams and markets with the highest probability of success, you did not choose those teams at random and then rely on luck. you spent a lot of time analyzing the games, you spent a lot of time looking at the news about each of those teams you chose, and we both know that it's not easy to look for news about a team when they're not famous teams from the big leaguesSometimes there is only information about the h2h and also information about the teams' last games, but there is not much news about the physical condition of each player and when the squad that the team will start in the game comes out, the person is left without knowing the potential of each player in the squad, so it is not easy to bet on small league teams and even when we bet on big team games, we still need to make very detailed analyzes about the games in order to have good results.Another thing I will say that may sound strange is that this is my opinion, in this case where you made a bet with odds of 100.00, you should have placed 10$ or less, but having placed less than 1$ becomes frustrating later of the person hitting an odd of 100 and the amount won being very little. I keep saying that the difficulty level of multibet bets is high and that's why when we win, it has to be worth it. the money earned must be a great value that compensates for the sacrifice. Of course, you shouldn't bet money you can't afford to lose.",

While the results may vary (though you'd naturally enjoy if you win ofc), the process itself is straightforward since there are only so many of them and you can basically guarantee that you can do all of them. I've had some random wins in the past where I just randomly chose between two teams I absolutely have no idea about (since they were new on the official scene), and it was still fun. I rarely flex though cause I'd much rather tell the story about the tournament itself than my bet. Anw congrats on the win!",

The game is fast paced and we keep on wagering feeling ourselves lucky. Even if luck had favoured and you're unlucky, then the bet is gonna be a losing one. For this what can be done, we should have the luck and the same can be kept in favour with our emotional control.Just an example to state the lack of emotional control. I've received 0.0026BTC payment last week and just started my wager on Dice with 0.0001BTC. To my luck I was able to make it to 0.0058BTC within a minute. How this wagering happened is unknown, because I just kept wagering above and below. Some point I should've stopped it, but went for the bet value increase and drained the balance. How it happened, because I don't have control over my wager. If not I could've stopped when I've turned on the profit.",
