Having a Bitcoin recoverable will make the transaction not on chain since real Bitcoin doesn’t support replay on transactions.But the idea of smart wallet is cool on Bitcoin because it helps non coder user to do a function which you can only done through code.",

Also, you made a wallet and named it Vault. These two words have different word meanings.\"determine who\", if you know who is spending, that basically destroys the whole concept of anonymity in the Bitcoin blockchain. When to spend, like how do you know when I have an urge to buy something and pay with Bitcoin? Not a great way to launch it.",

However, I agree with many comments, privacy itself is what matters when you have bitcoin, and that is why anti-encryption security is one of the options that most look for in a good wallet, in addition to not having requirements that violate the anonymity of each user, if what is intended with this innovation is to obtain information from people in order to help them better manage their bitcoin, they would be trying to become banks, something that no cryptocurrency expert would want, because according to what I understood they would even control personal assets contradicting the purpose for which bitcoin was made.",

That project has a review campaign in running by royse777 where people will test out the capabilities of that platform and will report issues and provide suggestions if any. That platform allows emergency contact features, multi sig confirmation via some known member of your family or using your second device. I loved that project and i am happy to see the competition because so far i came to know about that project only. Once there will be more projects the competition will be high and the error and omission will be no more as one will try to overtake others to earn the trust of people.",

Even that thing that I'm saying is a breach of privacy with just the addition of data obscurity. If I'm being honest, when things like these are being developed, I always ask myself if the previous iteration has a critical flaw that needs to be addressed but if there's nothing then I tend to not like the upgrade since most of the time it's just an additional feature which just makes things more complicated.",
