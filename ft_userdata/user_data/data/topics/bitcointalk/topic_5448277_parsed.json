  "content": "This is just a very quick advice from me to my fellow newbies that are joining the forum, I received a message recently on telegram which the member told me he saw my posts on the forum, the person was advertising to me if am going to purchase a Bitcointalk account, I was surprise because I was shocked seeing that kind of message, after few conversation i immediately deleted and blocked the accounts, I made a mistake of deleting our chat I will have posted our conversation here. I know it’s discouraged to purchase a forum account, which am sure some newbies that are really desperate to rank up might endup going for things like that, if you are in the forum, just keep on making meaningful contributions and am sure you are going to get your merit and rank up, you don’t have to buy account because you want to rank up. If you purchase a account here, sooner or later in the future you will be exposed and your account will be tagged, it’s better you start building your account from the scratch, keep on making positive impact on the forum and am very sure you are going to get your merits and rank up. I know the seller will want to brainwash newbies just to purchase account from him, he will want to prove to them that they are safe after purchasing the account but don’t be deceived, immediately you pay him and he hands over the account details to you, even if the account is tagged that same day that’s non of his business. Also some of them will collect money from you, they won’t  give you any account details and you will never hear from them again. I will say it once again, newbies should avoid buying of forum account.",

It's also possible that seller did crime with that bitcointalk account in the past. When you are going to buy the account, you can fall in a trap.There are a lot of motives behind buying an account but it's pretty much easier to rank up here.",

If you want to use a quick way to get in, you will definitely be caught. You can't maintain the same old account holders' posting patterns, and you don't have the same knowledge as the old user. It will just cost you money and waste of time, time that the person could have actually used to build up his own account.",

Look at their behavior they blocked you and deleted the account meaning he is trying to offer an account that we do not know if he actually has an account. Most of the offers who sell forum accounts out there are scam be careful or even if they do have an account I'm sure the post history is AI-generated so you won't be able to use the account on signature campaign because most campaign manager don't accept AI generated content.",

Probably that had an account farm back in the days when merits were airdropped and now have a bunch of high ranking accounts with no value on the forum. Or they could be trying to swindle you by either selling a tagged account or recycling the same account; sell it to one person, recover it and sell again.On the buyer's end; buying an account shows you're desperate to join some sort of paid campaign, a bought account would struggle to be accepted into those, and you end up trying to sell that to someone else at a later time.",

      "body": "Op thank you for these excellent tips for us newbies, even if I've never considered purchasing a forum account because I know it will likely result in unpleasant things being said about the seller and you won't be able to contact them again.Due to the fact that the person who sold the account still has access to its details, they may attempt to defraud you. How can a new user ever consider purchasing a forum account when there are numerous ways to increase one's bitcointalk.org account, including participating in all forum activities, submitting useful information, and more. And any new user who believes they are purchasing a forum account on their own may not be too knowledgeable about the forum as they purchased an account with a high rank without thinking to review the forum's rules and regulations.Much thanks.",

The purchased account will be tagged immediate renders that account useless, this shows how lazy and useless such person is to the forum who can't even strive on their own to build their account on with pure contribution to the platform show him or she is not qualify to be here. Beside i don't think merits is ever the issues currently because some users have volunteered to be merits anyone with a quality post so why then involving their selves with a purchased account.",

Buying an account is a dumb thing to do, I really don’t think newbies are the ones who patronize account sellers, the perpetrators of this crime are usually bounty hunters who have been here for long and want a high rank account to participate in signature campaigns. It’s easy to identify bought accounts, thanks to bpip.org we can see when the account woke up, password/email change. These changes are not enough to red tag an account but it’s enough to start investigations and sooner or later the account will be caught.",

Or they could be trying to swindle you by either selling a tagged account or recycling the same account; sell it to one person, recover it and sell again.Most of the sold accounts are from old era. It's because that back in 2015, forum database was hacked and most people haven't yet changed their password since then although theymos asked everyone to change their password. Those who didn't change, have lost their account access. That's the most usual source of bitcointalk account from my experience in the forum.",
