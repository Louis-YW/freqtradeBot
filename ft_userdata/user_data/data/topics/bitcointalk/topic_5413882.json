Thanks to MoparMiningLLC for the pictures There were 100 notes in the lot I received, not sure if more were producedThey are dated \"2020\"The paper weighs 2.35~ grams and does not appear to have any watermarks.The \"paper\" is more of a light card-stock. Hope this helps with some of your questions",

As I've said before, this was a little test project I've made with my friend (the maker of the notes) for the first DiY Bitcoin banknotes. There were only 100 made. Originally, the notes were intended to be orange but they were made as yellow just to commemorate 10 years of Bitcoin's existence (from 2009 to 2019). The maker is known as Fowler Electronics on Etsy. He has his own site for crypto banknotes called \"The Crypto Bill\" which can be accessed here: https://thecryptobill.com/ \"Etsy: https://www.etsy.com/shop/FowlerElectronicsWebsite: https://thecryptobill.com/",
