Are you simply talking about a wallet recovery service?If so, if that's what you want to do, there's only one trusted player in this business, it's Dave's recovery service. (You can get a link for it here, so that you can be sure it is the authentic link and not a phony phishing copy of it.)In general, you should ignore any person that attempts to offer \"help\" for wallet recovery as those are mostly scammers.",

Just be sure that there are no wallets left on your bitcoin address that your wallet has generated and throw it in the first rubbish bin you'll see in the street.",

(search their options)In that case, they can try to bruteforce your password without getting access to the actual wallet file.",

Even if you refer to recycling hardware parts, there is nothing stopping them from trying to recover your seeds, unless you watch their process 24/7 I guess.Quote from: dexterto0 on October 31, 2023, 11:00:30 AMIsn't it so that if these are really large funds they will say that it is impossible, and then leave the case for 1 year and then recover it by themselves?That can happen, but the original owner would also realize it. They can definitely say the owner probably stores their seeds somewhere and somebody else accesses them, but I doubt their reputation won't be fine after that. Most scammers probably don't care about it though.",

Otherwise the second sentence would make little sense in this context! Sending hashes is a very good idea, the only question is whether the recovery service would accept it. Classically, they collect a fee on the coins in the wallet, for example 20%: Source@OPThe bottom line is that you actually have nothing to lose and in the best case you get access to your coins again. If you turn to a service that has a good reputation, then your situation can at least not get any worse.",
