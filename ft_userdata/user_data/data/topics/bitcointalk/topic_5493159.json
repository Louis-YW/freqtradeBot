The year had bitcoin going from high price to low price but it was still relatively low compared to now.Even though that protagonist started paying attention to bitcoin when it had already hit a hundred dollars, that’s still better than finding bitcoin when it’s worth a whole house (at least in my country)",

      "body": "Too many regret stories related to bitcoin have been discussed and you can search for them on this forum instead of creating a new topic. I don't know how you missed out on bitcoins before, but I know you will continue to regret it even more if you don't own any bitcoins now. Additionally, having regrets and spending time reminiscing about the past will not help you get back the bitcoins you sold or lost. So use that time to collect as many bitcoins as possible, find ways to correct past mistakes, and don't let those regrets repeat themselves 10 years from now.",

There have been many stories of regret and each one of us regret when we didn't invest in Bitcoin.I found about Bitcoin in 2016 when its price was below $700 but I wasn't sure about it and that's why I didn't invested any money in it. I used it for trading, but I was not sure about holding and that's why I regret that if I had invested around $45k to $60k in Bitcoin back then, now I would most probably a millionaire.But, I'm still thankful that I found about this gem in 2016, and today I don't have any financial issues only because of Bitcoin. Our regrets can be converted in our happiness when we start doing things right from the current moment and forget about the past.",

Cases of people from that time who kept their bitcoins in hodl until today must be very rare, because if you buy something for 0.10 and that something is worth 10 thousand dollars, it is very difficult not to want to sell.",

Of course not. Many did not buy Bitcoin until after 2013, and everyone who owned Bitcoin before that mined it. Therefore, if you had mined Bitcoin for free, then selling it at a price of 1-10 dollars will be good.I sold some Bitcoin at a price of $4,000 and today its price is more than $70,000. It may be $700,000 after several years, and we will see some people saying that if the price of Bitcoin was $70,000, I would have put all my wealth in Bitcoin.",

But the truth remains that people don believe in hype or what people predict about the future until the see the results before they can believe. As at them no one would have believe that someday bitcoin would be this expensive untill now. I. Equally not happy not having enough stash of Bitcoin in my wallet because I was not informed and even if I was I form, I was a college student who depends on parents, I wouldn't have even invested on it because bitcoin is along time journey which I am not that patient to wait then, compeard to now.",

Before then people knew only fiat, so investing in something strange will be highly unlikely. It will take people who understand blockchain technology and also willing to take risks. Many people carelessly lost their keys, while some sold before the price increased and many more stories. I don't have any regrets about my adventure in the crypto industry because it is still at its infant stage and still holds diverse opportunities. We cannot shape the past but we can take advantage of today's opportunity and plan for the future. We do not just listen or hear about these regretful stories but gain lessons which will help us make the right decisions.",

Sometimes too I do check the wallets I used when I started and most times I end up not feeling good about it when I compare how much Bitcoin have passed through the wallet. I have also been scammed a couple of times as well due to greed and quest for quick profits. These are the regrets I have had so far.",

And because of this negligence they did not hold the bitcoins carefully thus there are many people who lost their bitcoins. Now those people who are looking at the current state of Bitcoin have nothing to do but regret. I didn't buy bitcoins at the beginning of science but later bought them in the bull market of 2017 but didn't hold onto them and I still regret them a lot.",
