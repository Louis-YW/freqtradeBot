      "body": "I tried a bunch of trading strategies, indicators, but then I came to realize that It depends on one's trading style. I don't do harmonic patterns, Elliott Waves etc. I mostly rely on price action, support and resistance levels and maybe have a look at a few simple indicators (RSI, MACD)Sometimes I trade low cap, volatile coins, most of the methods listed above are mostly suitable for High Market cap coins like Bitcoin and maybe ETH. It's hard to use them to analyze some low cap coins, for reasons you obviously know about.I am trying to learn pine script so that i can be able to script strategies and back test them. I think the most important aspect of trading that's ignored most is risk management. You can have a very good strategy that wins 90% of the trades, but if your risk management is poor. You can blow off your account in a single trade, especially with trading derivatives with a high leverage.",

At the end, as a trader that want to be focused, you have to look for a strategy that you can understand and believe that no strategy is 100% if you are making profit then stick out with it and be better on it. I'm of the same view with you, using support and resistance work better then addition of few more indicators like RSI and MA helps to make the chart clearer.",

Based on experience, what you believe is the best might not be agreeably best for others, so it's always personal. However, it was difficult to choose between price action and Elliot wave, they are good, and more are to be mentioned like Fibonacci and trendline trading, they are all good in my experience.And if a trader does better, they will have to combine at least two strategies together for better results.",

      "body": "What kind of trading strategies are you familiar with right now? What kind of accuracy or efficiency are you looking for? I don't think there is any 90% or even 80% trading strategy that will net you profit without doing any adaptation. Some traders that I know use Bollinger bands, RSI, and just RMA, while some of them exclusively use Elliot wave theory to trade. The difference between their usage is on time-frame. Since you're looking for day trading, I think those tools are more than enough. CMIIW.I'd suggest you use the strategy you're familiar with the most and adapt to market changes and stick with your risk management as mentioned above. As far as I can see, most traders are looking for bots nowadays to help with consistency and backtesting strategy. Some of them are free and you can modify them on your own, but keep in mind it won't magically increase your profits.",

I've found out that it was not necessary to have multiple strategies because it only confused us but rather keep at least 2-3 and master them. It was not we are looking for perfection or 100% accuracy as it never exists in real life but what we need is a strategy that would help us to earn even just small amounts. Many traders had lose their money because they never know what strategy they use and much more difficult if you use too many strategies, you will never find which one is more applicable in the market.",

I use this trading method in long term overview on the trend if there’s already indecision happened. But I never thought using it on short term period because the cycle on short term is not that accurate or not too often to form. A simple Bollinger Bands combined with patterns is still the best on day trading because the price always reacts perfectly on BB channel especially if there’s a clear trend for the day.",

Usually when there is massive liquidations in same area, there is a great probability ill reverse in that area. Its the age old \"Price always hits my stop and reverses\". The trick is to get in with the smaller stop loss possible and hold as long as possible.  This works better during the non-NY sessions because that session is usually just correlated with stocks. If stocks pump so will crypto and same for vice versa.Usually works best during Asia and London session and sometimes after NY lunch.",

Now tell me, you still need to struggle to enhance your knowledge? In my opinion, it is just waste of time, instead you may spend your time in other things and get paid for your time and invest in bitcoin with what you have got for daytrading.I am not supporting the people who are rising with trends of bitcoin market. I have seen people who have sold their bitcoins around $45k levels in 2021 March/April but some of them got FOMO and bought back when bitcoin was testing above $60k levels and must be holding now in loss. But, people who hold without any short term or long term trading plans, must be having better ROI than anyone else.",

In terms of the trading strategy that works accurately, What can work for me may not work for you, the best way to go about this is to study the market behavior and apply different methods to see the one that works for you , and how consistent the strategy is using historical data and back testing the strategy.",

Bitcoin often remains in a channel for a while and you can make some money by selling at the top of the channel and buying at the bottom. This doesn't give you a lot of profit as the bear market channel for bitcoin was only $300 apart so by trading 1 bitcoin you were able to make about $300 every week. For me it was too risky to hold $20000 on exchange just to make 1000 a month which is why I don't trade anymore.",

Trading is about guessing but it's always better to guess in an educated matter. If you do not then you are more of a gambler already and not a trader anymore.Yeah I guess what I was saying is I don't use a specific strategy. I just use my intuition which has been built up over numerous years of being in crypto and trading for a lot of that. I trust my instinct that has been educated with years of experience over some technical trading strategy.It's not about gambling versus trading. It's all trading. Nobody here is gambling. Gambling is something very different. But if you just follow some technical trading indicator and don't base your trades off your own instinct and experience you're just blindly following a rule even though as you say there is no guaranteed pattern, meaning rules don't apply.The one thing I've noticed over the years from all the technical indicators and watching people draw lines on charts and everything is that in the end its always \"it'll either do this...or it won't\". Haha. Which isn't any better than just guessing. I can see trading strategies being useful for the inexperienced though, because it might at least keep the inexperienced trader from just randomly buying without any reason at all.In the end all that matters is if the trading strategy is successful. At this point I tend to be very successful at trading based on instinct, whereas a few years ago I was still not very successful. I doubt I could be more successful at trading if I used any defined technical strategy because that wouldn't allow me to use my experience to trade well and instead I'd just be blindly following technical charts.",
