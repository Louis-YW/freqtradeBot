  "content": "Those who use stakes know that a weekly bonus is given according to the amount of your bet.I've been betting on stake.com for about 2 years. and my level is platinum . Because of my level, even if I bet $5 at the lowest, they place an average of $5 each week. The higher the bet volume you create, the more you get of course. but even if I bet 5 dollars until now, I always got at least 5 dollars weekly bonus. We always get the bonus via the link they post on telegram. Anyway, let's get to the point.For the first time, my weekly bonus link didn't work.When I called customer service they always lingered. Last week I made an average of 10 dollars bet. They gave a 6 dollar bonus. My bet amount this week was 600 dollars on average. but my bonus amount this week is only 4 dollars!!!! And I did not get it via the weekly bonus link. they sent it to my safe without using the bonus link. They tried to trick me with 4 dollars because they couldn't find a solution to the bonus link not working or not to bother with it. However, they should have given me a bonus of at least 20 dollars on a 600 dollar bet. I know well the bonus amount given according to the bet amount. Because I've been betting here for 2 years and I'm getting a bonus every week.When I ask customer service about this issue, they are not helpful at all and just ignore it. customer service cheatedThe reason why I open this topic is that so many big bookies can't find a solution to the bonus link that doesn't work and they give the lowest weekly bonus amount to close my mouth.The essence of the subject is water. I bet 10 dollars last week and they gave a 6 dollar bonus. I bet 600 dollars this week, they gave a 4 dollar bonus ... they didn't give me my right. The reason why I bet here is that they are a rich betting office in terms of bonuses...when I asked them about it;Last week, a $6 bonus for a $10 bet, and a $4 bonus to a $600 wager this week, how is it possible? You can't pay 4 dollars and close my mouth because the bonus link doesn't work. When I ask the customer service about this, they run away like a cowardly chicken, they definitely do not answer my question.",

I hope someone from stake could explain this further in case OP is misunderstanding something about how much weekly bonus he should get based on his weekly average wager.",

I'm not very familiar with the detailed computation of stakes' VIP weekly bonus but I guess that the amount of bonus you get is determined by the percentage on the house edge of your bets.Maybe you played this week on games that has low house edge so does it affected your bonus. You can wait for more replies, maybe someone here as a better insights and explanation about that.",

BonusStake, at its sole discretion, might offer from time to time, a number of Bonuses and Promotions. For example, The Million Dollar Race, the 50 Billionth Bet Bonanza, Coupons, Reloads, and Rakeback.Each of the Bonuses and Promotions has its own set of terms and conditions and individual requirements if any. By activating a Bonus or Promotion, You confirm that You also agree to the applicable terms and conditions.Once forfeited or de-activated, the Bonus will no longer be available to You (and cannot be re-activated at any time thereafter). The amount of any Bonus Funds that have already been credited to your Stake Account Balance will remain available to You.Stake reserves the right to remove bonus from all inactive accounts or accounts that are identified as âbonus abusersâ.Stake reserves the right to cancel all bonuses that have not been claimed within the claiming period or 60 days, the shorter of the two.Stake reserves the right to cancel any bonus at its sole description.in their TOS it is clear that the bonus is just something in good faith and each person has their bonus amount, I for example even if I bet more than 5$ per day, I only have 0.10$ bonus per week, but I don't complain This is because I see bonuses as something they give only in good faith.",

It sounds you are trying to silence a real complaint from a customer of your casino on the forum.Bonuses are mainly used by casinos to attract people (look my signature if you don't believe me), because everyone look at that when they choose a casino and take that into account before deciding to spend their money there. It's not just \"free money\" given in good faith, the casinos expect a ROI by doing that. Then if a casino finally doesn't send the promised bonus, it's dishonest and shady.
