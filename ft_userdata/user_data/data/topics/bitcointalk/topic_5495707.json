Even though, the inscriptions inscribed before fork seem valid after fork. It would divide the community and in the case of Bitcoin reduce it's security. Hardfork arises as a result of an alteration of a pre existing rule that causes a rejection from the existing egg Rule. It is a scenario where the blockchain split in two and this two blockchain starts working independently. Hardfork is still an altcoin and wouldn't stop those dealing with Runes to stop congesting the system of Bitcoin Because whatever the hard fork creates would never be bitcoin and this ordinals are leveraging on Bitcoin security. Hardfork would help nothing except creating another altcoin. Nobofu",

      "body": "Eventough a hardfork is always a strain on the community, i have to say that a hardfork solving this mempool flood would be interesting. I'd defenately think solving the mempool congestion with those inscription thingies would be a better cause than the last \"big\" hardfork (BCH).If such a fork would exist, i'd think it would have a reasonable chance of getting adopted by the majority (depending on how many of the core dev's were willing to switch to said fork). If enough users adopt the fork, miners would eventually switch since big adoption usually means an OK FIAT value, and eventough the block reward is getting lower, money could still be made mining the \"new\" fork. Personally, i think it would be great being able to make a transaction that doesn't need 200 sats/vbyte to have a decent chance of getting confirmed in the next couple of blocks... I'd also think it would be a good idear if the nodes didn't have to fill their disks with nonsense data when they store the blocks.And censorship? What censorship? Those inscription thingies could still exist in the \"old\" chain. If they want to keep filling blocks with their data, they can do so, just not on the \"new\" chain... If somebody wants a chain to store even more ridiculous stuff, they can make their own fork, and if they gain some adoption, they have a network and they can store whatever they want... I don't see creating a hardfork to see if it gains adoption as censoring.I'm not saying it's a good idear per sé, i'm not saying i would blindly follow such a fork, i'm just saying that such a fork would probably have more merit than BCH, and eventough BCH did not gain the biggest part of the community, it does still exist.",

By that time the reward+fee would not be worth the same amount of money as 3.125BTC is worth today at $60k.Sadly this to me is the reality we are facing right now, before the security of bitcoin network network was the aim of the community or developers right now it’s all about the how to make the miners more happy about getting more incentives. Although the reward for mining a block is reducing, but wouldn’t that at least take more years to complete be worthless with the potential that bitcoin price will grow in demand and subsequently more price of there is more adoption (high fees will certainly decrease that). My only security concern about removing this inscriptions is that wouldn’t that at least affect our decentralization where nodes can every day make changes to the network even those that wouldn’t suit the community. But if there is no security risk then nothing much to worry about.",
