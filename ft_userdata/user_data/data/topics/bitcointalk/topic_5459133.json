In May, he denied having any investments but guess what now? This little act tells a lot about his character and if he can be like a switch at this stage, what might happen if he becomes President. The way I see it, he's like every other politician who will take every opportunity to win the heart of the public and if Bitcoin's the way, he'd use it. Won't be surprised if I get to hear later on that he is strongly against it. After all, Gary Gensler was pro Bitcoin before he suddenly jumped ship.",

He has always made positive remarks about Bitcoin, which is refreshing to hear coming from a member of the Democrat party that has oftentimes been outright hostile towards Bitcoin. Elizabeth Warren is perhaps the most famous anti-Bitcoin politician. She loves using the \"Bitcoin is only used by criminals\" cliche. Kennedy on the other hand has promised to protect bitcoiners' rights to hold and use BTC.Biden is extremely unpopular even within his party, so it's a perfect time for a challenger like Kennedy. It'll be extremely difficult for him to win the nomination due to the mainstream media and the pro-establishment Democrats doing everything possible to discredit him.",

Is his support for Bitcoin based on his financial interests or does he truly believe in decentralized finance?Its reasonable to say Kennedy is protecting his vested interests. Though harsh, his criticism of Biden's administration is valid. The government's cautious stance to crypto is justified. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and misused.However, Kennedy's support for Bitcoin could sway public opinion. Im worried but optimistic. His participation may spark discussions about bitcoin legislation and its financial effects.",

I want to believe he is one of us, but him being a politician with an agenda, it's hard not to be a cynic. I would probably believe Robert Kennedy if he was deeply tied financially with Bitcoin like Chad Saylor. Haha.",

In addition, if I'm not mistaken, before Biden, only one US president was of the Roman Catholic faith, and that was JFK, who bothered them so much that they ended up liquidating him.If it is true that the Democrats have so far only three candidates, somehow it does not seem to me that Biden has a chance for a second term, and frankly, I have never even heard of Marianne Williamson. However, no matter who the next US president is, it somehow does not seem to me that we can expect any big changes when it comes to Bitcoin - because politicians change, but politics is more or less the same.",

They are all aware of the benefits of bitcoin, but because they are unable to use its regulation to their advantage, they will continue to hinder its adoption and drive many more individuals who are unaware of bitcoin away from it. Even today, renowned government employees who work in banking sectors have bitcoin holdings but will not declare them to the public due to the consequences; they spread news but do not follow the news. It’s just a two way choice for people, they can either join bitcoin secretly and be financially responsible for their holdings, or they can blindly accept the government's advice not to hold/save money in bitcoin, which the governments themselves do.",
