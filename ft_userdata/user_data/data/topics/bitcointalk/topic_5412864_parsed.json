I've got a not so important concern about the theme, I think it's better if it's automatically changing the theme of the page upon choosing light or classic without the need to reload. It's not that of a big concern but that's what the other casinos have when that feature is being chosen. Needless to say, as you posted here recently, as I'm looking at the # of active players, you already have 141. That's already a lot.",
