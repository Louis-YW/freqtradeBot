  "content": "EL Salvador has set an example for other economically unstable countries to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. What a day for the global Bitcoin community and those who believe in it. What pisses me off is that none of the mainstream media that printed or posted or telecasted negative implications of Bitcoin being a legal tender have not posted any news of this achievement.Media outlets like Yahoo, Bloomberg, and many more had said last year that El Salvador will default on their $800m sovereign debt because they adopted Bitcoin. I am aware of how these biased and banks sponsored content/media work. What I am unhappy and frustrated with are those people who read last year's news would still believe that Bitcoin is a failure.We need a mechanism to stop this nonsense from mainstream media. We as a community should come up with an idea to counter the mainstream media and I think an official channel of Bitcointalk which is also active should be on Youtube or on other social media as a start. I know there have been discussions in the past about the same but when so many members on this forum are making good money with the signature campaigns a little bit of donation for this cause will help the community in the long term.",

The forum provides answers to people's questions, give recent information about cryptocurrency, and direct investors towards the right investment; what kind of project to avoid. You are only misinterpreting what content is about. Some YouTubers gets their research from this forum, which is the function of written contents. It's how videos are created. That doesn't mean, you can't create a channel and cover updates coming from this forum there. But, suggesting a YouTube channel for the forum is like saying the forum is not doing enough work using this medium. Most threads rank on Google first page and that's enough publicity for people who seek for help. However, it's always good to use other mediums, but I've not seen a forum with a YouTube channel, blogs do. We can only use what we have to get results. No much difference between the main stream media and this forum in terms of crypto. Many people understands that the truth can be found here and that most times the main media get manipulated. What matters is the fact that the content on this forum is more than enough and ranks easily on Google like the mainstream media.",

Well, it's like going with a wooden gun at the most powerful tank or shooting a fighter plane with a slingshot. In addition, it is not that there are no initiatives to debunk some lies such as to denounce Faketoshi or to dispel the myth that Bitcoin is dangerous for the environment, but one should be realistic with the set goals.If the forum decided to do something about your idea, then donations would not even be necessary considering that the forum has enough resources to finance such a project.",

What about having a social media mouthpiece that can enable us as a community to counter those lies and constant FUD? We can use any centralized platform like YT, Twitter, or Reddit and there are many here who can volunteer as MODS for free.It is 2023 and we need a social media weapon to counter those who have been preaching negative and irrelevant shit about Bitcoin. Even most governments have their mouthpiece either on Twitter or Instagram. We need a social media branch to counter these shitholes that are constantly trying to pollute our financial independence.If Bitcointalk cannot be on social media then we should get a child board that can help us individual YT or any social media influencer/enthusiast, who talk as well as counter negative information. As a community, I am sure we will view, share and subscribe to those handles and spread positive news",

However, the one's that we'd actually want to make an impression on unfortunately will rely on their mainstream new's which are sometimes even funded by public funds or the government. We can't really compete against that no matter the budget. If someone is sick enough of their current money system, they'll find an alternative. We just need to make sure the process of getting into Bitcoin isn't cumbersome enough to prevent them from progressing. Bitcoin is still quite complex to understand, whereas fiat you don't necessarily need to understand the whole system to use it. Bitcoin has, made some good steps over the years though to becoming a little more simple to use. Still, not quite there yet though.
