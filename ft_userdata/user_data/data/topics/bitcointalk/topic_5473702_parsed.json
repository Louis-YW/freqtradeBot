Any other details to pay attention?1. You do not need to know where the trade is made but focus on the PnL and other necessary information. From what I think, it would be from Huobi (HTX). 2. The mark price is well stated distinctly and it is $5.3393. He used 50530 USDT to trade. The margin is 10x which is 505300 USDT.  If you convert the 505300 USDT to Dot, it is 97524 DOT when he opened the position.4. It is the percentage of his gain or loss compared to the total margin used. If it is positive, it makes gain. If it is negative, it means loss. 5. Estimate liquidation price is the price his money used to open position will be exhausted and he will lose all if the price go against the direction of the position opened. After he lost all, no position opened again.6.  It is the margin used. Assuming you have $100. If you use 10x margin, you will have $1000 to trade. There are two types which are isolated and cross margin. In isolated, the money remaining in your future trading account will not be deducted if you are losing. It means you can not transfer more money to increased the liquidation price. Some traders prefer it while opening many positions. Cross margin means if your money used to open position is decreasing, it will also be decreasing from your future trading account. If the price is getting close to liquidation price, you can transfer money to your future trading account to increase the liquidation price so that your money will not be liquidated at the initial price.You will need to use small amount of money to try this and experience what that I am taking about. 7. Trade with like $2 to learn.",

Any other details to pay attention?Thanks. @Oshondy cover most of the answer but I’m wondering if you are inquiring the general information about the Mark Price and Margin itself so I’m happy to help.Mark Price is the current price of the token he is currently trading. This is the basis for the computation of the Unrealized PnL shown on the screenshot. Unrealized PnL = Mark Price multiply to the total tokens he is holding.Margin is the total capital he is using for that specific trade. On his screenshot it’s his original margin multiply by the leverage he use for that trade.",

Using big fund as a collateral for your cross margin account and your margin position look safely but it is safe only in normal conditions.If assets in your big fund have serious problems like Terra token (LUNA, UST) or FTX exchange token (FTT), I am sure your big fund will become small fund and your collateral will become small enough to cause you a forced liquidation by exchange.Honestly Margin is always risky and don't think with a big fund, you can be safe with Margin.",

The OP seems to want to learn what he's actually looking at, and it happens that he doesn't know yet. It's a screenshot of futures trading.. it's perfectly normal for newcomers to want to understand the key points when starting futures trading. And usually, people who learn on their own won't be influenced by affiliates or invitations to do something extreme.I see a lot of potential in the OP, so it doesn't seem like a big issue to ask for details about that screenshot.A little attention for trading with leverage is that the risks increase. It's true that you can easily make +20% using 20x leverage and a 1% price increase, but remember, it cuts both ways. If the price goes down, it's also multiplied by x20. So never play with leveraged trading without considering the risks because many assets get liquidated on Binance.https://t.me/BinanceLiquidations << see on telegram to see how many people have suffered losses due to Binance Futures Liquidation in leveraged trading.",

Any other details to pay attention?1. This could have been made in any exchanges. But this kind of looks like Kucoin. Not entirely sure because this could also be any other platform. 2. The mark Price is like an average between the last traded price and the current market price. 3. The margin is borrowing money from the platform and then using it to make a bigger trade keeping your own money on the line.4. Risk- 9.89%, shows how much possibilities your trade has of losing. If the market is in your favor then the risk will below and if it's against you then the risk will be high. For example people say, there's a 50% chance for you to win. Or there's a 90% chance that you will lose. Based on your opening price, if the market moves in your favor, then the risk will be less and if the market moves against you the risk will be higher. 5. \"Est. Liq. Price\" is when your trade closes automatically. 6. \"Cross 10x\" is using 10 times your money for a trade.7. You are on your own mate. Just keep learning and don't overdo it. Get a hold on to your emotions. Don't let it out. Don't make decisions when there is no need to make one. That's all.",

What is Cross 10x means?7. Any other details to pay attention?There are two types which are isolated and cross margin. In isolated, the money remaining in your future trading account will not be deducted if you are losing. It means you can not transfer more money to increased the liquidation price. Some traders prefer it while opening many positions. Cross margin means if your money used to open position is decreasing, it will also be decreasing from your future trading account. If the price is getting close to liquidation price, you can transfer money to your future trading account to increase the liquidation price so that your money will not be liquidated at the initial price.You will need to use small amount of money to try this and experience what that I am taking about. OP, it should also be emphasized that newbies who want to trade with leverage should use Isolated Margin if you're going to trade more than one contract/asset, especially if the leverage is high like that screenshot. You don't want the paper-loss of one to take the profit of the other. You want them separated. Plus it's probably better to accept a small loss and close the trade, but that's for a different topic.",
