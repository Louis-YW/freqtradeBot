  "content": "Intro:: My first post here is a scam accusation against Duelbits. I don't feel great about it but I appreciate all the feedback and support from everyone here.After reading up on similar cases here and now going on 7+ days of waiting for my withdrawal, I thought it'd be helpful to open a topic here. What happened:: I created an account on Duelbits to play baccarat and little bit of bj. Day 1: deposted $6494.04 and withdrew $9,468.50. After a break, I deposted $9,228.06 and withdrew $12,700 and $208.13Day 2: deposited $12,690.07 and requested to withdrawal $16,654.00Under withdrawal transaction, where it should show transaction ID, shows as \"processing\" for 7 days. Live chat hasn't provided any ETA and they've been giving me vague answers while telling me to continue practicing my patience. literally.I asked them whats causing the delay and they said their compliance team needs to check my account. So far, no updates on that.I asked them if there were any others waiting on their withdrawals, they said no.I offered to provide KYC info to assist and speed the process, they said they don't need at the moment. My account isn't locked but my balance is sitting at 0. I play with a very basic martingale strategy and play by the book. Other than playing well and quickly making these transactions, I can't imagine why any of my bets would be flagged.",

      "body": "Seems like your stay with Duelbits was very successful and profitable so far and that seems to have raised some concerns. Congratulations on your wins!The good thing is that your account isn't locked. You still have access to it. Martingale strategies will lose you money long-term and casinos know that, so they shouldn't be outlawed.   This is the ANN thread of Duelbits. Their forum account has been inactive since September, and I don't know if someone else has taken over the monitoring of in-thread discussions. Nevertheless, I would suggest you write a post there as well pointing them to this scam accusation thread. Take some screenshots of your deposits/withdrawals (no need to show the addresses) to confirm that those coins went in and out of your account. At the moment you are being investigated for something. No scam has yet happened. Try to stay calm and let's see what will happen next.",

I'm not sure this will help very well. because he is not part of the team but does have contacts with the team regarding the campaign.but before PM Hhampuz, I guess the OP should prepare some proof that hasn't been attached. proof of deposit or withdrawal transfer will help. as well as proof of conversation with support.",

Hhampuz does chip in to help and things have worked out positively, that's why he's a great campaign manager.",

But I don't think things like this are surprising because actually some issues regarding withdrawals have been experienced by gamblers other than you even though it's not at the same casino.I hope you can still be patient to wait for a response from the team about your problem, sometimes it takes time and a little more patience. But I also hope someone who represents their brand [the team or whoever] will come to this thread to clarify.Apart from live chat, have you also contacted the support team such as their official account on the forum or email?",

Hhampuz is just the campaign manager and he has no obligation to involve in such cases. Hhampuz doesn't and shouldn't get involved in solving a case like this because if he isn't working for the casino and its security/integrity department (whatever you want to call it), he can't possible know why a player's withdrawal is delayed. But, he might be able to directly contact people in more senior positions in the casino. Like those he negotiated with when it was arranged that he would manage their campaign, or those responsible for filling the campaign wallet with coins.

Casino's are not meant to be a mixer. All casinos or exchanges could be considered mixers in a way. I am not going to go into the privacy aspect of that mixing though. You deposit one UTXO at an exchange, make a trade or two, and withdraw something else. Casinos have rollover requirements. For example, If you deposit a certain amount of crypto, you need to wager them at least once and maybe respecting a minimum odds requirement before you can withdraw again. If those requirements are met, the player has fulfilled the conditions to be able to withdraw his money. If a casino doesn't like that, they should change their rules and require a 5x or 10x rollover requirement and see what that will do to their business.",
