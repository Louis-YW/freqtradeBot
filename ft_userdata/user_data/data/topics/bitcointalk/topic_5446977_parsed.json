What are your thoughts about this?BRICS wants to develop their own currency because they really think that it is time for them to be free from the dominance of the US dollar, in my opinion it has nothing to do with BTC or to manipulate the crypto market, because their main goal is to destroy the dominance of the USD. You can read about it in this article https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-talks-up-prospects-of-brics-countries-developing-new-currency",

To be honest there's no problem to Bitcoin because Bitcoin price isn't pegged with any currency and it's can't be manipulated.",

Certainly it would have been nicer if they had agreed to use Bitcoin instead of creating a new currency, but unfortunately that didn't happen. If a new currency is actually created, it will tend to target the US Dollar and Euro in order to weaken these two currencies. As the BRICS countries want to back their new currency with gold and other rare-earth elements, it could become a strong currency.

Those who know the difference between Bitcoin and any other centralized currency will certainly not suddenly sell Bitcoin to invest in something backed by countries like China or Russia, especially if we consider the fact that these two countries are currently doing. Strong currencies are created over decades, they do not appear overnight and create some kind of instant dominance in the world. The US, EU, UK, Australia, Japan, Canada and many other countries will certainly not accept this currency, and we are talking about the richest countries in the world.

I really don't see the relevance of your conclusion.In view of the fact that the BRICS bloc will change some economic terms when we will no longer see petrodollar dependence, I see that the dollar is gradually showing a gradual loss of position in the general economy. Not sure what the impact will be on the crypto market but what I see here is that countries that don't want to be dependent on the US are proving that they are capable of self-responsibility in the face of the impositions so far.",

Because if they think it as a strong currency like you said. I think certainly there will be some people currently holding dollars or euros who might move their money to the new currency. But I don't think people are withdrawing their money from Bitcoin to invest in the new currency. I see the new currency of the BRICS countries more as a competition for dollars and euros, but not for Bitcoin. Of course I could be wrong about that, but that's how I think about it at the moment. In addition, we first have to wait and see whether and when the new currency will actually come out and how strong it will really be. Maybe the new currency won't be as strong as I'm currently assuming.",

And on the wave of hysterical cries of losers \"LET'S REJECT THE DOLLAR\", China supported their cries  BUT very specifically:- China redeemed Russia's dollar gold reserves for yuan- China is buying up gold and DOLLARS in their gold reserves.- China has filled the market of transactions within the BRICS with the yuan, and made it the main currency of mutual settlements.China is reviving its \"empire\" on the backs of not the smartest \"friends\". Someone saves it, China, the economy, someone becomes just a depressive raw material appendage.So I recommend considering this not as a \"victory on the dollar\", but as a victory over common sense Reason? Very simple - soon these countries, except of course China - will get rid of the dollar. But in the technological age and the age of the world's financial institutions, they will not be able to live without the dollar. And they will already be completely dependent on the yuan and China. Who always acts only for his own benefit.",

Bitcoin is something very magical to us, but to them it is nothing, Bitcoin is not yet a rare asset that they have to fight for. As far as I know, the BRICS alliance has been established for a long time, but recently, four Central Asian countries have joined. This union was formed to find a way to create a new currency and reduce dependence on USD and Euro. Things are just getting started, they have a long way to go to pull the USD down.",

They are also in talks with Saudi Arabia and Iran with this one. They don't want to use the dollar anymore (for pretty obvious reasons), and TBH, I've heard this news last year already. I'm pretty sure if this happens, it's the China who will become on top, and the currency they will use? It's the Yuan.

Even the huge institutions can't completely manipulate Bitcoin, then you are connecting them with Bitcoin? It's all politics here, and no crypto is involved, and that includes Bitcoin. At least don't connect what's happening right now with Bitcoin because after all, they can't manipulate Bitcoin because they aren't the one who created it.",

So I doubt it will create any effect on bitcoin whatsoever. And remember that Bitcoin is a decentralized Cryptocurrency. So nothing like this which is centralized and controlled by government will compare to Bitcoin. The new currency will only be used to make transactions amongst themselves.

Their prime target would be the USA, the U.S. dollar, and the western world in general.

Anyways that would be far more centralised and thus it will have it own pros and cons and our bitcoin would prosper the way it did throughout 10-12 years. It may happen that the BRICS project would turn out to be failure in long run since bitcoin is bitcoin and itâs user base has different niche with it.",
