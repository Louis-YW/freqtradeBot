The solo miner went home with the 3.125 BTC block reward and an extra 0.032 BTC from transaction fees. This is a major win for the solo miner considering that Bitcoin mining difficulty has gone as high as 112.15T, making it very difficult to compete with large mining pools with immense computational power.",

Network hashrate significant drop can help solo miners but not too much because solo miners have very small hashrates compare to Bitcoin network hashrate. Like a Hashrate migration out of China mainland did not help solo miners finding more Bitcoin blocks than before.In bear market, there are times of Mining capitulation but after that a new bull market comes, and many new miners join hence Bitcoin network hashrates and difficulty continue considerable increases.https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/hash-ribbons/",

I believe there are also at least 2 BitAxe's in the mix that were running between 400GHs-4THs. All blocks can be searched for on -ck's pool thread here.
