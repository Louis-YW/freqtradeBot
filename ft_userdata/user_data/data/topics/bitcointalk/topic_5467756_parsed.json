I never see country where the government agencies are as dead as Nigeria. We have DPR wey never seal any filling station unless them wan collect money no be say them wan change anything.

I later come realise say other stations wey Dy sell #700/litre Dy give more quantity than dem to know true metre na to compare the volume for their pump because each price get en volume wey engo load for you( e go Dy display for the pump).But I come realise say as the NNPC station get about 6 pumps dem adjust those front ones for cheating( 1 is less than 1 litre) come Dy use normal metre for the other 3 pumps wey Dy back. So dem Dy always use the front pumps sell. I witness one day wey the inspection team come for inspection. Dem carry dem go the back pumps wey b normal metre for sample collection.

We don dey hear about all these things since we be small pikin until now wey we don dey grow up. And we don come sabi say government don dey used to they make promises and dem go dey fail for their promises. If we go mention the promises wey government don make wey dem no fulfill, e go be like say we dey pour water inside basket. E mean say we no go ever finish to talk about dem until today.I fit give example with the last government of Muhammadu Buhari administration wey promise say fuel pump price go reduce to below 100 Naira. We no see am. In fact, dem even increase am to over 200 Naira during him regime. Dem still promise other things like say we go get constant electricity. We never see am for once. Dem still promise during their regime say Port Harcourt refinery go start production for December 2016. Na 2024 we dey now, and that promise never happen for the past president administration. Now, we dey under new government again. Dem don promise say fuel prices go be very small, wey every average Nigerian fit go to fuel station buy fuel without stress. Dat one no happen. In fact, e dey stress-free but fuel price don skyrocket to over 695 Naira for some places, even reach 700 or 800 Naira depending on the location wey you dey. All these na promises wey dem make and dem never fulfill.The fear wey dey for my mind anytime we dey talk about these pressing issues na say, if government continue like this, e go just dey give people impression say government no fit dey trusted. And many people don already lose hope for anything wey concern government. So now, dem just dey live for themselves, no dey bother about other people promises, and just dey do their own thing. The reason why you go see good people wen enter government turn to bad people na because of corruption and people wen dey use government power to oppress the masses.The problem wey Nigeria dey face today na systemic issue. E dey for the system of government, no be the people per say, but of course, na the people form the system. And na why the system don already dey designed like dat, say na either you join dem or you leave, because you no get power to make choice for yourself. Else, them go just remove you from that position.So now, na this time wey we need leaders wey dey at the top to begin make holistic change for our attitudes, make dem make strict laws and principles wey everybody go gree follow. Whether you be government official or you dey hold high position for government, you suppose obey the rule of law. If you commit any crime or anything, government go use their power against you. But if everybody wey dey up there dey feel say dem dey above the law, e go always be issue with people or top government officials wey go dey undermine the rule of law.The change suppose really start with our leaders, and not with us per say, even though we also get our own bad contribution wey we dey do to the current failing institution of government. Our leaders suppose lead by example.",
