Just be original and stay organic; don't present other people's work like yours (plagiarism).

It also explains the type of posts or threads that are accepted in each board, that will help you reduce the stress of having to click through several threads to learn it yourself. And just as the post above mine stated, don’t ever plagiarise. Even if you want to share just a single sentence make sure you add the source don’t play smart here as it will cost you your account.

Focus on the board that tackle the topic that interests you because looking on all the available board will reall overwhelm you with different topic and discussion that you don’t have an idea.Go to your local board and ask for someone help on your specific question so that you will feel comfortable on discussion or go to Beginers & Help board and read tutorials and guides in there.  Determine what you really like and focus on that area first before you explore the forum.",

So maybe much better for you is to focus on what caught your interest since from such thing you can slowly learn how to use this forum together with getting knowledge plus earnings on opportunities available here. For now just focus to read those topics or discussion then try to learn from it since for sure those informations you can read here is so useful because you can get more better idea on certain topics tackled by people.",

However, it's okay to get confused within the first week of your introduction to this new environment, because as time goes on, you are likely to get used to it and learn new things just as you just learned how to create a thread and post. For me, I call \"bitcointalk\" an encyclopedia of all any individual needs to know about Bitcoin, as it covers all aspects of Bitcoin (i.e. history of Bitcoin, learning of Bitcoin & discussion of Bitcoin-related topics), together with the ability to connect you with like-minded Bitcoin enthusiast all around the world.",

All you have to understand about this forum is that it is a cryptocurrency-related discussion forum where you can share your opinions and learn from other people's topics.The best thing I like about this platform is that the content is so original and unique, which means there is no plagiarism. You could also share your insights about something, and if you do not understand anything in anyone's topic, you could ask them by making a reply. Or you could ask about that thing by making another topic, but it is not advised.Other than these learning things, we could also make some money on this forum, as there are many bounty, faucet, review, and signature companies, and by joining them, you could make some money too.

That's why you don't need to rush to start posting because you need to learn how the forum works. If you are new in the Bitcoin space, you need to dedicate more time to learning about the coin so that you can make quality contributions to the forum. The forum has so much information that's why it has the search sections for you to get all the information you need. The forum has different boards that will interests you, visit those boards and ensure you read the rules. You can find the rules at the top of each board. If you put much effort, within a short time your knowledge about bitcoin and forum will improve. Welcome mate.",

He is not that dumb. Well, still, you really make your point, and I was also going to suggest to the OP that he should use the search option, but the hurdle is that sometimes one does not know what he or she should search for in the search bar.Instead, they just type what is actually coming to their mind, and those things might not help them.The only advice I have for the OP is to first make up your mindset, e.g., why are you here, what do you want to search for, and what topic do you want to learn about?Many people just have the wrong mindset about this platform, like thinking it is a freelancing platform to make money. Let me correct or assure you that this is a forum just like any other forum, but this one is related to BTC and ATLs, and many other types of things are discussed here.You should learn the basics of BTC and ALTs first, how transactions are made, what exactly is blockchain, and how you can do that. You have to engage in many of the topics you see here. You should visit the following websites:Bitcoin Discussions:Beginners and HelpTrading DiscussionsEconomicsMetaetc. These threads will teach you enough, but if you are a technical person, there are many other sections available in the first Board of BTC discussion that you could join.\"",

Others have told you want you can do and just follow their instructions. And also ask questions like this when you are confused. Read more to understand other people posts and manage to make comments on them and from there you can be learning gradually to master the forum. It is a gradual process because it is a vast forum.And another thing you have to do is to focus on one Board or more board you are familiar. If you don't know anything about bitcoin but you can discuss things like political then you can go there https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=34.0 and discuss political things there and if it is Economic then there https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0 and if you don't know any of the above mentioned boards then you can go to your local board for proper discussion and from there, you ask questions and later you can come out to the public boards when you have understand many things in the local board.",

Have you ever used Reddit, for example? It is kinda like that. You pick a board on the main page that interests you (the names are usually self-explanatory), then you check out the latest topics and dive into whatever catches your eye. If you are not interested in a topic, just go back and pick another.  If you are looking for something specific, you can use the built-in search tool or, as already suggested, give Google a shot. When you find a topic you wanna chime in on or ask about, hit up Reply or Quote. That is pretty much it - you will pick up the rest as you go. Don't hesitate to ask if there is anything you are still unsure about.",
