I believe it is the sport bet that is most common among people, including virtual sport betting too. The matches that I like to gamble most on is football, including the in-play and also virtual footballs predictions.",

MMA isn't really popular because most people think UFC is MMA or MMA is UFC  even though there are many other MMA promotions too e.g. KSW, PFL, Bellator etc. Sometime I bet on Formula1 and MotoGP for fun, it's really unexpected to predict the winner.",

In fact, I doubt anyone here even recognizes that word other than Americans.I would gladly bet on any sport as long as I get good odds and understand a minimum amount about that sport and the history of the players involved. You do not need to be a genius to research a players past history of wins/losses. Thats universal for any sport.As far as to your question of specifically which sport which is not listed here that I would love to bet on:Asian martial art/other fighting styles which are not that prominent in western society. Sumo, for example.  In Japan, Sumo is a big thing and gets bet on all the time.",

I am aware that I did not add Tennis, MMA and Boxing as my question is about those sports that are not being discussed here but you do bet on it either occasionally or on a regular basis.Boxing I guess would be next to your list, which is for sure on the preference of most gamblers here. Not surprising because boxing utself as a sport is already popular, while in this industry, match ups are as well thrilling especially for enthusiasts out there. Other sports I guess are formula racing, and if esports would count. Well basically, gamblers are choosing based on what sports are they familiar and enjoying with. This is also why I prefer sportsbetting than with other gambling games simply because entertainment would be always there. You'd also lose which is part of the activity itself but atleast, you'd enjoy the experience more, than just relying on your luck and eyeing for winning bet alone.",

But I once tried betting on a chess match but was just a test. Apart from the list, it's Boxing that is very much easier to be dragged.",

Great game, lively and supportive fans.Aside from football betting, I occasionally bet on UFC whenever my African brothers - Francis Ngannou, Kamaru Usman and Israel Adesanya have a fight. Sadly, I lost my last bet when Kamaru Usman fought Leon Edwards. I am not giving up. I am gearing up to bet again on Israel Adesanya next fight.",
