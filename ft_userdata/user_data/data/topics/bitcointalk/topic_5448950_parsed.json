  "content": "I was looking for a DEX to make purchase without getting caught by the government. Ultimately it is not possible as every INR to crypto and vice versa will attract tax. I know you can hide it but that won't stay for long. While trying to find a way i stumbled upon a website called Koinly. After going through every link I found one that suited my requirement. The link was on  Crypto Tax India: Ultimate Guide 2023, as i continued reading it i was able to find that not all crypto earnings needs to be in the 30% tax slab. I noticed that many of you on this forum have been a participant of signature bounty. I found that you guys might not fall on that slab. The paragraph that says that I am pasting it below. Code:However, the 30% tax won’t always apply as sometimes the ITD will view you as having income instead. In these instances, you’ll pay tax at your Individual Tax Rate on receipt. This includes:Gifting crypto - if you're the recipient of the gift (refer to the gift section for more details).Mining coins (refer to the mining section for more details).Getting paid in crypto.Staking rewards.Airdrops.I think we need more clarification on this subject. If anyone here has that knowledge then please do share your expertise. Thank. P.S: Please ignore my typo and sentence mistake.",

      "body": "The article is indeed correct. After going through several discussions and talking with various experts, I'm finally certain about the language of Section 115BBH. It only deals with the trading income. If you are earning crypto from any other activity, it doesn't come under the ambit of Section 115BBH. However, such other activities give rise to two taxable events. Let's take an example to make it more clear:One of the items in the table above is 'Getting paid in crypto' which includes campaign payment on the forum. Suppose a participant receives $100 weekly in BTC but doesn't immediately sells it. Finally, he sells his annual income after 50 weeks which should be $5000 in BTC but due to the fluctuation in the prices of BTC, it stands at $7000. It is clear that $5K out of $7K is an earning from the campaign but $2K is the profit from speculation. Hence, $5000 at USDT/INR rate on the date of sale will be taxed as per normal taxable rates whereas $2000 at USDT/INR rate will be taxable at 30% under section 115BBH.",

Looking at the signature that you are wearing I am assuming that we will now here from you more often. Haha, thanks for the welcome! Bitcointalk has been always my first love in crypto and indeed it's a pleasure to contribute on the forum and let me assure you that the campaigns aren't something that induce me to be more active on the forum. That's why I always look to join campaigns with no minimum post so I don't just write posts for the sake of reaching minimum condition.  Quote from: pakhitheboss on April 16, 2023, 02:14:01 AMThis why it is better to use a local exchange than a P2P service platform as on a  local exchange TDS deduction is done instantly when you do a trade.

It is always better to use the standard mediums and avoid any possibility of compliance mistake. The prominent Indian Exchanges have properly implemented TDS structure and better to use those if the amount isn't big.

The other thing that I understood is that for filling the form you would need a CA or a tax consultant. The form for me is not personally still not clear. Last date of submission is 31st of July. The ITR form takes into consideration many things. The things like multiple house properties, capital gains and/or business income have implications on the choice of ITR. So like you said, it's always best to consult a CA or a tax consultant before filing the income tax return.Quote from: pawanjain on April 16, 2023, 04:30:53 PMQuote from: webtricks on April 15, 2023, 06:17:54 PM~~1% TDS will be applicable on the total $7000.

Yes, both incomes will be taxed as per the normal tax slabs but remember, don't directly add the campaign earnings to your salary from the full time job. Both will be shown under separate heads.",

You are also correct that it is wise to talk to a professional rather than to use an app or website. The reason why some might choose an app over a professional is because of the service fees. Many Indians are using these apps to earn and spend their earnings on themselves or their families. They might not be able to afford the repeated fees of hiring a CA or somebody else. I understand they will use a third-party app. I also understand that the exchanges providing these services are approved by the government. I do not think that they would manipulate or scam those who desperately need their assistance.",

For the financial year 2022-23 and assessment year 2023-24, you will need to declare your cryptocurrency taxes using any of these two forms. 1. ITR-22. ITR-3As per my understanding ITR-2 form should be used to report capital gains. Basically Earning from trading, holding and then selling. The ITR-3 form is for reporting taxes from business income. As per my understanding this is the form that you need to show your earning from Signature campaign or Bounty campaign. Do remember if you had waited for the price of your earning to increase and then you sold it. It will fall under captial gain. First use these platforms like Koinly or Taxnode to determine whether your earning falls under capital gain. Then contact a financial advisor for further clarification on how to declare your income. The best time to declare your income is after 25th of June and before 25th of July. The last date of submission is 31st of July this year.",
