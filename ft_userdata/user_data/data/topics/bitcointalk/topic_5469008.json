And it is a fact that vast majorify of people would have more bitcoin if they just hold what they have, instead of trying to increase it by trading. To be a successful trader you need years of practice and a lot of money spent and that's not something that an average trader is willing to do. Instead, they try trading for few months, lose money and probably never come back so why even start at the first place?Quote from: Emmanuelex on October 03, 2023, 09:59:06 AMBitcoin is for everyone, and no one should be left behind.What trading has to do with it?",

Trading isn't something a beginner should just decide to jump into, even crypto oldies lose money with  trading it is advisable for beginners to stay away from trading and focus more on bitcoin investment, it's easier for beginners to learn about crypto wallet and how to keep their bitcoin safe from scammers and hackers.But trading is on another Level, beginners will need a lot of time and patience to learn trading and trading is more like gambling, they will have to place a bet on predictions that the market will go up or down and if you are wrong your money is gone so it is not suitable for a beginner to start trading unless they devoted their time to learn about trading first. Stop mixing things up, Bitcoin investment isn't trading, and it's safer to buy and hold Bitcoin than to engage in trading, there is money to be made in trading but they need a lot of training first, it's not that easy to good at reading charts.",

However, I would like to emphasize on \"learning and putting in the work.\" When someone asks generic questions like \"How do I start?\" on an online forum, it can seem like they're trying to find shortcuts instead of going through the learning process organically.

Yes that's a very precise fact buddy, knowledge is very important if you want to jump into this investment world because only that will help you achieve real profits. I understand there is a pretty big opportunity in bitcoin in terms of profit and that means at least you have to have pretty good knowledge or at least understand about the cycles that are in it. Maybe I will say stupid to people who are very obsessed with the profits that exist in bitcoin but they do not have any knowledge at all and do not want to learn to build a good plan, how can you come for a profit but do not bring any fishing rod to get it.  We must understand that bitcoin does not always provide any guarantee for profit, and that means in addition to profit, you are also very likely to experience losses there, the way is as you say keep learning to get broader knowledge, and in addition to knowledge you must also have good self-control there so that even if you experience losses you will remain fine and not end up with emotions that can clearly bring you to a worse end.Yes there may be some members on the forum who give advice but that advice is like discouraging those newbies who just came with strong intentions, honestly I don't agree with the statement that \"bitcoin is not for beginners\", it's very arrogant. For those who say that anyway before they finally understand about everything in the world of investment like bitcoin they come from someone who doesn't even know anything, and I say initially they are also beginners like those who just came, but the difference is maybe they came first so their knowledge is wider. Their intentions may be good, namely to educate but maybe the way they do it is not right and it seems like telling those who have just come to retreat.That's right, here we must really be able to understand what exactly is meant, don't easily misunderstand and it's better to take the positives and discard the negatives.",

As far as I know, there are many categories of trading here in the Bitcoin industry, one of which is derivatives, futures, margin, perpetual, and leverage trading. These are really not newbies who don't know anything because it really needs those who know trading.But in spot trading, you can start even if you don't know anything, as long as you just start with small amounts of capital so that it won't hurt your pocket right away.
