  "content": "I became worried and found it difficult to answer after my friend asked me scary and ridiculous questions about Bitcoin ownership.he asked. If friends, new acquaintances, or other people find out that you have a sizable amount of Bitcoin, and you don't tell them. Then you are kidnapped with several people covering their faces, with the aim of getting your wallet address with the risk that if you don't give it you will be killed.And another reason, you have given your wallet address to members you trust, such as family members or your wife and children.And I want to know, what are you going to do.Aren't you going to give the bad guy your wallet address, and you let him get killed. However, your Bitcoins remain safe because you have given your wallet address to someone you trust.Or you will give it away because you still want to live, and you don't have any more Bitcoins.And it was just a casual conversation with a friend of mine who both owns Bitcoin, and I was just wondering what other people's answers to this dreaded question made me want to create a thread.",

It is prevention.If you already did stupid things opposite than above recommendations, you have to prepare a small wallet to gove it to bad guys when serious situation comes. Because you will be able to use that wallet, to save yourself.Even if you give them that wallet, nothing to be sure that they will free you. So let's return to first recommendation as prevention to be attacked. You will be smarter if you keep personal actitivies in secret.",

      "body": "Now, let us not get things confused here. You gave out your wallet address to your family and the people you trust, and anyone with the address can view what the wallet holds and cannot move out of what is inside. So aside from you, do any of your family members you trust have access to the wallet? If the person appears not to be found any day, can your family access the wallet with your phrase? Then again, in a situation like this, you never can tell if you give out this wallet if they will still let you leave or treat you as trash after they get what they want. One thing is to ask for it, and the other is for them to keep their own side of the deal, so you have to take the risk involved here in order not to lose it all at once. If there is some sort of guarantee that if you give out that wallet access to them, you will be set free, then the best thing will be for you to do that, as your safety and life matter more than that bitcoin. If you are alive and in good health, you can always acquire more.",

If you live in a country where there are too many criminals, then as a wealthy person, this is the problem you need to solve first. Obviously, sooner or later you will be a target and if the juridical system isn't functioning, then your wealth will get stolen from you. Let's say you don't have any bitcoins but you have lots of FIAT in your bank account. These same people may still kidnap you, put a gun on your head and tell you to send the money to an overseas account. Once the transaction is complete, it will be over.Getting rich is a hard task, the harder task is staying rich.",

Also for the seed phrase been protected by the passphrase it also useless in cases like this because if a wrong wallet is recovered by the kidnappers then you’re in danger again. Passphrase and multi sig wallet are just protection against phishing attempts and not attacks like kidnapping. As to OP it will be stupid to give them wrong information at that condition, we actually accumulate bitcoin or other material stuffs just to live a comfortable life why protect those things with our life’s at risk",

Think of it like carrying a bullseye on your back. Keeping your financial life private is not about secrecy or shame; it's about minimizing unnecessary risk.While your example uses Bitcoin, the principle applies to any valuable asset. Flaunting wealth, regardless of its source, can be a magnet for trouble. It's like wearing a flashy necklace in a dark alley – it makes you a target. True wealth, in all its forms, often thrives best in the quiet, away from prying eyes.Ultimately, the choice of how much to reveal about your financial life is a personal one.

And your assets will be safe only when you don't share your assets (bitcoins) with everyone. Not only digital assets (Bitcoin), but earthly assets also need to be protected. Of course, those who have bad intentions sit there, hoping for such tempting news, and attack when they see the opportunity. That's why you have to take responsibility for your wealth management in all circumstances.
