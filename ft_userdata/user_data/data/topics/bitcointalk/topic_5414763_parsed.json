The software use internet connection and is closed source.2. Only organizer (who also create the software) can unlock the wallet and share the reward.3. The one who give wallet.dat to organizer could give fake wallet.",

For example, less upper case/caps lock and explaining why people can trust your service.Im promtion manager....I not try you trust,, because I not trust anyone  But, you can join now for ex, and bee part of search 7 chars passwords FOR 253 WALLETS  AND AFTER BE PART OF SEARCH 12000 BTC. YES, IF YOU NOT INTERESTED IN 0.01% drom 12000 BTC I CANT HELP YOU, BUT, IF YOU NORMAL  JOIN AND WORK, AND GET YOUR FOR EX MINIMUM OF TOTAL PIE SIZE.Everyone in this thread of the forum understands perfectly well that the project is unique and very interesting. Join us and let's make a profit together.

Join to us, and lets go....This is more profitable then single person brute force. Yes, for ex I know how to divide 120 pub to 95 with 3670016 pubkey in result. But 95 bit, single person bruteforce this is not profitable and very very very hard !!!.Seen in team chat! The terms of participation:25% - Received by the partner (whose hash is in the table)5% - Organizers70% - is divided among all participants in % of ranges covered.For example, you searched for 3 days and stopped.The password was picked up in 3-6 months from a wallet of 500 BTC.The sum of 70% of the find of 350 BTC is divided by the number of combinations passed.You will be paid % for your completed segment(you get pay for 3 days if you 3 days from 3-6 months).The more combinations you have completed, the higher your %Make sure your address is in the table.In a collective search, everyone wins.Enough coins for everyone.Join to  us righ now and start making noney from bruteforce - https://github.com/phrutis/LostWallets",
