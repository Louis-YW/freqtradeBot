  "content": "I think it is without a doubt the biggest scandal of this year 2022. At least at High stakes Poker tables.This type of cheating is linked to the scandal at least in used technology since things are even mentioned like that the chair vibrated or that it had a ring that received pulsations.This news has 2 phases, the first time I saw it for me nothing to comment beyond bluff catched that looked very bad, but it came out very well ... he survived with great luck.The way Robbi played the hand is not, let's say, the best way, for the level that we know he should have... Well,  before knowing what has been said this week, the soup. I just thought that her  Call (turn) was very strange, in fact she herself admits that she got confused and that's why she called, among several things she says.Let's see what happened here:Garrett (SB):Robbi (BB):PreFlop: SB Raised  $3000 Robbi calls (BB)Flop:Turn:And here the crux of the matter Garrett thinks about it for just a few seconds and goes Allin, that is, he puts $130,000 in the center of the table,  Robbi do a call of $110,000 to see the river.Here the profit percentages of 53% vs 47% are misleading for novices, and we should not get dizzy with these values, the hand here is Fold, first of all let us remember that these percentages are determined because we know what each has player, with a J4o in this situation the call does not exist, is very bad call, now, otherwise if the player check, and she decides to go Allin it would make sense in the idea that she wants to steal the pot.it turns out that the Casino where that hand was played put out this statement:Hustler Casino Live Cheating Scandal Takes Bizarre Twist as Employee Steals $15k from Robbie Lewhttps://highstakesdb.com/news/high-stakes-reports/hustler-casino-live-cheating-scandal-takes-bizarre-twist-as-employee-steals-15k-from-robbie-lewWhat do you think ?

      "body": "With all the allegations being thrown at her, I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and that she just called his bluff, but god damn, going all in with J and 4 in your hand, with that flop and turn is ridiculous. I understand why garret would have that reaction.I can't wait what they'll find in their investigation regarding the cheating allegations. at the moment they haven't released any update on that right?as for Sagbigsal(the employee), the dude is a low life, I am surprised that Robbi did not file charges against him. seeing some more articles regarding the topic, it seems that the police still haven't found Sagbigsal.",

      "body": "It is possible to cheat even if the game is televised.  It only needs an accomplice so that the cheat won't be noticeable.  There is also an incident (not a poker game) in a tv program hosting a game show caught cheating.  The cheat was accidentally discovered when one of their staff commit an error while opening a covered box.  The story together with the video link of the incident can be seen here[1].  This is just to support the notion that cheat can happen even if the event is televised live.[1] https://www.mykiru.ph/2007/08/wowowee-scandal-complete-story.html",

Once a cheater, most probably, in all games you will really find good timing to cheat, regardless if the game is televised or not. Because that is already running in your mind, so you find some means to make it happen. However, if he or she is a responsible player, the that player will always do the right thing, the one that will not ruin his/her own reputation in gambling. After all, cheating is a choice, it can be totally stopped if you chose to continue it for more chances of winning illegally.",

      "body": "sorry for bumping this thread but I suddenly remembered it and got curious if there was an update regarding it, and there is. what I am going to write is basically the summary of the article if you want to read the full story here's the link [1] [2]. bryan sagbisal article [1]HSPP hired investigators to audit their facilities, all their equipment, videos, etc... after the investigation has been done, they concluded that they didn't find any conclusive evidence that robbi jade lew cheated on the J and 4 hand or any other hand that was played that night.as for Bryan Sagbisal(the dealer who stole $15k), he has been charged by the police with grand theft and a warrant to arrest him has been issued. anyway, what really caught my attention regarding the article about him is that Sagbisal mentioned that “We’re gonna be following you if you don’t leave now. So you better leave before I follow you wherever you’re going.”. that statement could be just a way to scare off the reporter or he is actually working with someone.",

      "body": "In the past, there has been some messing around with players connecting somewhere with someone who could watch the tournaments on TV or the internet. And especially because of the table camera, which showed each hand what the cards were. At some point they stopped doing that. You can never make it completely watertight, loopholes will always remain in it and today's technology is also so advanced that those possibilities are there. you might still think to remove the cameras completely and not show the cards of the players. And having to show a delay on hand doesn't seem like a bad idea either. 2 minutes delay eg.",

Some people are saying that some Lotto games are using this to cheat the lotto draws that are done. OP, thank you for posting this.... it was a very interesting article to read... and as a side note... those boobs would have been a major distraction for me, I would miss most of those games.",
