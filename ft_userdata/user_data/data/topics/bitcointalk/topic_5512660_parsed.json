I hold more Bitcoin than somepeople and there are others who own more than me.Its guite something that the spot ETF's have already been able to accumulate almost1,000,000 Bitcoin. As demand increases so too will their holding. Its kind of inevitablethat they could/will become the biggest holders of Bitcoin. Question then arises as to what happens if they hold 50% of the total supply?",

There's no proof in on-chain if they've accumulated these numbers.Depending on how the industry develops I'd expect some sort of Proof of Reserves procedure to become standard after a while, similar to what CEXes have already begun doing. Technically it shouldn't be an issue and I believe legally they are obliged to have outstanding shares reflected 1:1 in their Bitcoin reserves.I'm not saying to trust ETFs, just saying that they can and should be held accountable to avoid any bookkeeping shenanigans in the future.Quote from: aoluain on October 10, 2024, 09:15:42 AMQuestion then arises as to what happens if they hold 50% of the total supply?Regulatory capture. There's a non-zero chance that attempts will be made to make self-custody coins less attractive than ETF shares by pushing self-custody ever more into a legal grey area.",

Even though we know it's impossible since the max cap is 21 Million, but they can create fake news if they've accumulated most of Bitcoin. There's no proof in on-chain if they've accumulated these numbers. that would be a funny joke because Bitcoin Cap is not even up to 21 Million in supply So even if they do get all the Bitcoin in the world including lost and not yet mined they can never have more or even up-to 21 million Bitcoin. The Pros is that Bitcoin becomes more legitimate in the eyes of the public and Would kinda reduce the psychological impact of satoshi having up-to 1 million BTC (doubt it's up-to) to some individuals who fear it's movement.But it still wouldn't change anything since CEX are holding more than Satoshi did. The Cons Would be it would get more expensive to get a Bitcoin in the future for new entrants if they do continue to accumulate more Price centralization, in the sense that they could manipulate price and any news of them selling would affect the market in a short term.Quote from: _act_ on October 10, 2024, 08:15:37 AMIt only means more adoption and better tomorrow.

Increased institutional interest might add a good deal of legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin, and maybe lead the prices to go up due to the increased demand, especially from institution.But I believe many people including me has this same concern, if most of Bitcoin were held by institution, then that creates centralization of control over something that is supposed to be decentralized, hence making Bitcoin no different from any other traditional financial asset. This may impede Bitcoin's functionality as a means of exchange in peer-to-peer transactions because, if major holders decide to sell, this may increase volatility. I think those centralized threat can be reduced if the community the retail holder of Bitcoin want to hold as much as Bitcoin as they can.",

Satoshi have not moved the coins in the wallets that we can directly link to him so those Bitcoin have no significant impact on the market and the Bitcoin ecosystem in general. So, until those coins are moved, the market will treat them as if they were burnt so irrespective of the quantity of Bitcoin held by another whale, Satoshi's holding will not impact the market in any single way rather the market will always respond to the forces of demand and supply as it does now. I know there have been several rumors about the identity of Satoshi which I don't know if that would lead to anything. Whatever happens, until the coins in those wallets are moved, nothing changes.",

Yes more adoption but at what cost? Bitcoin price will definitely increase but the price to pay could be very high, and the worst case scenario is that Bitcoin will become centralized with the majority of Bitcoin supply in their hands. This issue has been discussed and warned about a lot since the first days of bitcoin ETF approval, and that's also why some of us are against ETFs and Wall Street's involvement in the market. But at the end of the day, there is nothing we can do to stop them from interfering in the market because bitcoin is a free market and for everyone. The only thing we can do is adapt to the market situation because there will be no better solution for us.",
