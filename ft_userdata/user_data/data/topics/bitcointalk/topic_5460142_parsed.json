The way those days increase notices me,  one of the ways to secure yourself also is to have a true caller on your phone that way true caller will tell if the caller is a scammer or not because na the way I dey take know them now be that no,  my through caller go tell me if the person na scammer,  spammer etc and that is cool with me.",
