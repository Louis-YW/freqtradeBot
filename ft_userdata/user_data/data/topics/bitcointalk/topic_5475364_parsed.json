Apart from your hardware wallet itself, once something else ask for your recovery seed it's a scam, not even your hardware wallet official website should ask you that.",

You are only going to be scared if you're the type of guy that downloads randomly from unofficial websites of the wallets that you use. Google Playstore, Microsoft store and even the Apple app store can be used by these scammers/hackers. That's why as someone who uses the wallets that we trust, you need to download it directly from their official website than trusting these applications stores.",

Seem like the best course of action since these come from opensource project. Android is based on Linux and Apple however is a close source but they have the responsibility since it's their platform and they allow devs to work on their proprietary devices.",

Google allows every project owners to upload their app in the play store in order to make so much money and they care less about the safety of the people downloading these apps. Google play would have been one of the safest place to download applications according to the status of Google. I understand they want to make as much money as possible and remain in business, but they should not upload clone or similar apps. There should be a mechanism to detect similar apps and not list them of not from the same company.Quote from: adultcrypto on November 24, 2023, 05:28:18 PMWhat then is your suggestion on safe way to download apps? Download from the website as many has said. When you are eventually redirected from the website to the play store, you don't have to panic only if you are sure you logged into the original website.",

I was thinking that all apps in the Playstore are first checked by play protect team and then only save apps are allowed because we say above every app that it is protected by play protects. I generally check number of download, rating and review before downloading any app. Official app are download more than 100k many times and review more than 10k however downloading from official site is more secured. We have to get paly store, Apple store downloading link from the official site so that we didn't face any scam attempt.",

Anyone can develop and upload applications in Play Store and it is pretty simple but the app will be available for download only if it's approved by the Play Store reviewing team to be honest the reviewing unit is not 100% secure and most of the time the uploaded application after it receives too many reports about the app or if it violates the google privacy policies.And we can't blame them either, because on average 4K apps get listed every day on the play store so imagine how many applications they will receive, so the responsibility is in our hands and as you said by looking at the number of downloads and reading the reviews from users will give an idea about the app.",

When I got for the Internet Download Manager or the same type of software like I can say the Video Editing Type of Software which always requires some product keys and even some of them have to be required the patch option which are going to patch inside the folder of your pc or laptop you are using. Then the person who have created this type of file he just carried the data from the computer and hack the wallets etc. in all over the computer.

None of these fake apps have a mark that shows it is a fake app and you don't expect the scammers to indicate that the app is for scamming. There is no way the stores will allow scam apps to be uploaded if they are aware of it. Many apps were taken down by stores when they later discovered that those apps are not trustworthy and harmful to users. I know it's possible for them to fish out the real and fake apps from developers but since they are not doing it automatically, we can play our path by reporting suspicious apps and give a negative review so people can be aware. It's our own responsibility to visit the official website of the wallet in order to download their app.Quote from: Hamza2424 on November 24, 2023, 05:52:49 PMMost of us unknowingly install every required app on our devices without realizing the consequences and this is what cant be even avoided better to take out all of the financial crypto apps on a separate setup (Dedicated Device). This is the best thing we can do.This will actually help in such situation but the problem here is how many people can afford to buy extra device specially for crypto apps? Only few but it's better to sacrifice and be safe than to cry later over the lose of assets. To make things worse, most of these apps we request to have permission to almost every aspect of your device.",

That is why these developers go in there and register with them and start positing those apps, and the reason is that this specific store where we found those apps is making a mistake sometimes, which is that they need to study what the developer is about to bring in to the App Store, but unfortunately they failed to do so, so I believe this is the only way for these stores to limit scam apps in their store.Quote from: adultcrypto on November 24, 2023, 05:28:18 PMWhat then is your suggestion on safe way to download apps? I don’t think there is anything we can do about it. If you are talking about how we can limit these scam apps, it cannot be possible because we don’t know the developers of these apps. So to me, the only thing we can do is download what we know or know people are using, and they haven’t complained about it before. We should avoid downloading any new app we see in the store; we should download an app that is well known by people or has been used by many people.",

Google App Store is pretty relax on their requirements to be approved and to be displayed in the app store, that's why this kind of stuff happens. You're correct about checking the developer, that's a big red flag if you can't see their face or they don't have a portfolio to back up their app development history, most of the time these developers have a lot of previous works if they are a legitimate developer and if they are an individual then you can probably find them in LinkedIn or GitHub.",
