A lot of ico projects started bringing in about $20 million around that time, if they made anywhere near that and had belief in their project, they could really make something quite cool out of it.I just doubt they will... I think axie is going to end up going down as another shitcoin but there's probably a good incentive for the developers to make something more and build on it. They did a lot of damage deciding to give less slp to users and completely tanked that token too which probably hurt their reputation quite a bit (I think they should have upped the axs spend on breading instead and I'm not sure why they didn't).Edit: looks like they raised $153 million at the start of 2021, I wonder what that was spent on.",

I remember EOS, I thought they will be successful in this market. The fees are cheap and I really thought they had a chance here.With Axie, I believe, the hacking incident was the beginning of their problems.They were enjoying the popularity as P2E gaming platform and suddenly a multi-million dollar hack happened. Definitely, this hacking incident affected their platform. They only recovered about $30M from $600M+ stolen crypto with the help of US Government.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/08/us-government-recovers-30m-from-crypto-game-axie-infinity-hack/Can they regain their popularity and still be the top p2e gaming platform?This is hard to determine, so if you're a player, better secure your initial investments. At least get your initial funds by selling some of your coins.",

A lot still stay playing axie but those stays are surely those who are into gaming and those who are already roi their money from it. Those who losses a lot of money are probably gone and quit. Cant blame them as the token price tank huge and anyone can not have same energy to continue with cause getting back their money becoming far from reality.I might not say it will not recover but with the current tokenomics. I think its better to invest on other to regain their loss.",

I'm just waiting for it to have a comeback but if there's none, that's okay and considered now a huge loss for me. That's how it goes, what comes around, goes around and the same goes for Axie Infinity, they're still making a lot of players active and that's a good sign that a comeback might happen. But as I've said, if things didn't go from what my plan is, then that's okay and I'm already adjusted from that happening.",

The trend is gone but that doesn't mean that the game and project itself are dead. It's still ongoing and still has active players inside the game. But as we know, it's not the active players that are making the market and moving it but the speculators, traders, and investors. And they're different from the gamers that are also part of its ecosystem and economy.",

We cannot say it will not happen again since if they are consistent to do more updates it will happen.And its just many people now cannot afford to spend more on it because they are worried about its future and like me as I said I will not put any more there anymore since I don't want to hope again for another time.",

As long as the development goes, the game will be played no matter what. Developers just need to remain positive despite not being in the hype right now.But as far as their utility token SLP goes, don't expect that this token will still reach its ATH. Not with the game hype, but traders are the big reason why SLP experienced a sudden hype. Maybe AXS is still good as part of our portfolio.If you really have an interest in the game, just enjoy playing without expecting profit in return the same as how everyone plays their desired game with no P2E features nor earning part.",

If it was like a pump and dump style of a game then yes because the owners won't plan to continue improving the game but they will just leave once they got their quota. For a play to earn games that aren't like that but have an ambition only to become the best. Not only the early investors can earn on them but even the late joiners can also get a benefit on them because they won't stop on doing ways in order to attract more people in their game.Some games do also have a scholarship program like the late axie. We can always apply on it if we are afraid of risking our own money in the game. If axie can create a new game then that's a good news for those who are still hodling their token. Maybe this can help its price rise.",

I remember the day when my friend bought three axies for 3k USD and this time it's only worth $6 for all three axies which is proving if axie infinity didn't have good future. Axie monthly active players are also going down so hard https://activeplayer.io/axie-infinity/ I guess this caused by ROI become a very long for the new players and they are not interested anymore to own axies and then play the game. I guess if majority of active players are also bots that used to grinding owned by a few people. The price of land is also going down like a rock goes to the ground.",
