There is a password log thread shared by theymos where you can check either your password has been changed or not, source, you can check the source for further guidance and i personally checked the password log with your username and found only one entry with your username which is here.According to timestamp, as you said, before making this post you changed your password and the time difference between this post and the password change is only 3 to 4 minutes so i am confirmed that log is yours and as there is no other password change log then i can tell you, your password has not been changed i think you have forgot it or maybe you didn't realize that, sometimes this happens, but dyor too from your side as do no rely on my reply only.",

They got access to your account and did not change your email, it means they don't want to take ownership of the account.But it is risky someone making posts with your account. The person might use your account to spread malware or plagerise, and you know the consequences. You will lose your account. That will be a big challenge to you because you will first have to appeal for ban and then prove ownership of the account. Since you still have access to the account, I think you should rather create a new email, change the email of the account and reset your password before you will be totally compromised.",

What was the error you saw when you entered the password, incorrect or any other? As everyone says no trace of password change and I doubt any hack attempt made because if they do they usually don't let you to have the old email which can be used to reset the password anytime when you want.I think you have been using the forum in always logged in, but remember when you logout the account from one device it logout from every device where the account is currently logged in, so don't forget to manage your passwords wisely.",

Are you copy-pasting your password and how complicated is your password if you follow the right security in creating your password, then it is a combination of small letters, big letters, special characters, spaces, and numbers and because of this, you may have mistyped some of the letters because your keyboard could be malfunctioning.This was my case when I cannot log in.But if you think that this is not the case then you are right in changing your password, if there's an intrusion you are lucky that the email was not changed.But do an investigation if you think that there's an intrusion.",

This cannot be a hacking attempt because somebody attempting to hack your account would not be so stupid as to not change the email and password. My Facebook account was previously hacked, and the hacker made no mistake in changing the Email address, which is how I lost the account. It's possible you forgot your password or mistyped it; this happens to me all the time, especially when I'm in my beast typing mode and typing as quickly as I can. No need to worry, I don't believe it's a hack attempt. simply be extra cautious with your passwords and how you keep them, or better yet, change your email address to be secure.  Just as a member previously advised, you shouldn't save your password on any browser because anything that is online is accessible to anyone.",
