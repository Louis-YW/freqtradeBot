Invest at the appropriate time like this and wait until you see high profit. Bitcoin in long term will increase in value.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on May 26, 2023, 04:07:38 PMYou are not too late to join the community, but talking about Bitcoin you are already late since you missed the period when a pack of pizza costs 10,000BTC and when you can buy hundreds of Bitcoin with just a dollar.Now bitcoin is quite expensive and to have multiple Units of Bitcoin you need a huge amount of capital to own such an amount in Bitcoin.Bitcoin can still go 10 times higher in the next 5 years. It is never too late to invest. Bitcoin would one day reach $500000. All that is needed is time and patience.",

I guess some of us are actually looking for the new coin that can rise the same as BTC's rise. Unfortunately, there is nothing like BTC. A regular person who has no funds to invest will just have to keep DCAing until you get that rare 1BTC. You still get financial freedom. As long as you keep earning, you're not too late because 0.005 BTC today may just save your life in the next 10 years.",

There are many people who still do not know about bitcoins, and others that have heard about bitcoins but have still decided not to believe because of some reasons of theirs. You are not too late @OP, you are still in time to be a beneficiairy of the halving coming soon. Very importantly @OP, you need to know be prepared and open to learning as quickly as possible because there are many things that you need to know.

It is not too early this moment but it is still at the early stage considering the fact that it will take till 2140 before it is mined completely, so the potential for it to grow or increase in price more than it has grown is still realistic.

Tomorrow might be too late to invest, invest now you if have the funds. Bitcoin still a lot of potentials.",

I think there is not a specific time for bitcoin investment but instead you can get participated any time whenever you think that its right time and you have a specific amount of money for investment.Bitcoin investment needs your patience because there is no any way that can make you rich in a single day but you have to wait more and work with patience for the success. You can make investment now but you will have to wait for certain years to attain fruitful results because hoping for getting quick money can be dangerous sometimes.",

Imagine if you would have entered at top of 69k you would be crying right now and cursing bitcoin for taking away your hard earned savings. This point is still better to enter because price has the capacity to go north in coming future, no one knows when but we all know for sure it will go.",

The bus is always available to take you to wherever you want to go. It is not too late for you and you will need to learn for you to understand where you are going. The road might look very confusing but you will need to focus tlso that you can benefits from the market. I recommend you to always prepare yourself to learn new things about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. This will make you to see through and be prepared for it. You can get financial freedom if you know what you are doing. Although benefiting more from the market is all about investing because this is the only way you can get financial freedom. The market is big enough for us to achieve whatsoever thing we have in mind.",

And you shouldn't be pressured to join it too because the road to financial freedom is long. There are no short cuts. Bitcoin will not let you get rich quick but if you stick with it long enough you will definitely not regret it. Some users have dropped some very vital points that you should take note of and do not be shy to ask any questions if you would. For the years that I have been with bitcoin the three ways I know to financial freedom with it are through- Bitcoin investment: You bitcoin some bitcoins and hold it for a long period of time hoping that as the price appreciates you'd make some profits from it.- Bitcoin trading: Trading is buying and selling of goods and services for profit. So it is here that you buy and sell bitcoin to make profit. To make profit, you buy low and sell high. That the basic principle- Bitcoin mining: This involves the use of special sophisticated computers to solve mathematical problems that earns you bitcoin as a reward. As a beginner, assuming you are, bitcoin investment is the easiest entry point.",

The thing is, now that you have realized the opportunity that you have missed in the past and the opportunity is still active and presenting itself to you, what will you do with it?If you have the money now, don't be discouraged by the current price, thinking the price is ever too high for you to put in your money. If you want to use the high price to discourage yourself, go back and check the price of its all-time high, which is $60k+, which is really high compared to the current price now.So you can just start where ever you meet the price, and that's if you are ready financially. Otherwise, you should check up on yourself very well, and if you see that you are ready, then you can buy some and store them in your preferred open source wallet.",

But you should also know that, bitcoin investing is not about first come first serve despite the fact that early investors have been getting huge returns so far. You can start planning an investment now while bitcoin is still losing 60% of its value since ATH 2021, so start wisely and learn what could potentially cost you.",

I mean what do you mean with \"financial freedom\"? Do mean getting rich or do you mean being totally in control of your funds?
