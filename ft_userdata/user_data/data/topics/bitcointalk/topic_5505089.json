Majority people in my country play these games to earn money and solve their problems while just a minor group play it to earn and buy bitcoins. If altcoins, and shitcoins, and NFTs didn't have any impact on Bitcoin, I wouldn't be too worried about Telegram games. By the way I see these Telegram games like  fad, they are here now and most people are crazy about them. After a while, it will come down and something better or with a higher incentive will take over.",

I am not sure those games are safe, and I don't believe they have any significant impact on the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just fairly popular and known at this point, and it occasionally makes the news because of certain events (like the SEC approval of ETFs in January). As of late, the main reason Bitcoin is getting media attention is the upcoming US presidential elections and how Trump became a pro-Bitcoin candidate.",

There really is no direct link on how altcoins have helped bitcoin improve lately. Rather it's the other way round. If you observe the era of the launch of altcoins via telegram was during the halving of Bitcoin. This is to say that to a large extent, bitcoin controls all other altcoins indirectly.Take for example when Germany moved a huge amount of bitcoin in addition to some other speculations at that time , the price drop in bitcoin also contributed to the drop of most altcoins. Infact many launch dates were postponed.Bitcoin is simply the OG of the crypto space and not the other way round.",

But all we know is that those telegram gamers are just their to claim their free tokens and airdrops. Most of them don't even know that what they are claiming is called airdrop. You hear them saying that they are mining some cryptocurrency on their mobile devices, which is totally wrong. They are not the type to think of investing In other major coins like Bitcoins all they want to do is to claim the free tokens and make quick money. So no, it might not have any impact on Bitcoin. The only good thing is that In some countries where cryptocurrency isn't widely spread or know, the advent of these tap games have brought about a little awareness.",

It has no influence in the short term in my opinion, seeing from what is on Telegram indeed, tap-tap games and so on give a lot of attention to ordinary people in knowing the crypto industry, but if some of them study crypto itself it will definitely give them the opportunity to understand bitcoin even if they don't get into the technology but they will learn how bitcoin will provide benefits for someone as a long-term investment tool. There will be a lot of natural selection, this will be subjective to people who want to learn or not about this industry, but in conclusion in my view, the size of the long-term dala  This will affect the adoption of bitcoin in the future, because everyone will understand why bitcoin is very valuable and very safe as a long-term investment.",

Those who play the game may not be Bitcoin investors and may not want to become Bitcoin investors because they only want to take advantage of any game that can still be profitable for themselves. So I think it will not have a significant impact on Bitcoin because the game via telegram is usually given in the form of altcoin, not directly Bitcoin, although after the altcoin is sold the results can be used to buy Bitcoin. But if those who play the game still don't know Bitcoin, of course they won't immediately buy Bitcoin and become Bitcoin investors for the future.",

It actually feels no because if there are no competition in the development of more Cryptocurrencies, the number of Bitcoin adoptors would not have been so appreciated as it is today. Reason why is because of we consider reputabilities and potential values, Bitcoin has always been a lead for crypto users which glances Bitcoin more attractive in the crypto industry aftermath there had been much shitcoins and highly volatile other cryptocurrencies which their users feels regret about after investing their funds in due to sudden lost of the coins values while Bitcoin has always maintained substantial values.So, if the telegram games is most dominance of speculations other cryptocurrencies in the society, to me it creates more paths by which the Altcoin telegram game participants who might be beginners are likely to know the origin of the coin and without mentioning the name of Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, then the advent telegram coins has no place of origin.However, as the speculations of those coins games erupts, so the awareness of Bitcoin is also captioned.While being aware that beginners are most attracted into the Crypto industry based on speculations, their utmost expectations about a desired coin to invest on is usually Bitcoin even though they landed on Investing on the Altcoins, they lather recall to invest on Bitcoin after possibilities to make their differences.So, there is no burden that the chances of the telegram crytop games is potential to negatively affect Bitcoin instead the speculations goes along creating Bitcoin awareness.",

Bitcoin and altcoins belong to different ecosystems and Telegram is one of altcoin ecosystems.Altcoins are sensitive to die when cryptocurrency market is no longer bullish and their so-called technical revolutions can become nothing in bear market. This fact about atlcoins has been proven by the past three bear markets. It will continue to be true in future bear market in next market cycles.You can love Telegram, use it, and love games built on Telegram but don't try to compare it with Bitcoin as they certainly are lower quality than Bitcoin.

Yes P2E games has brought a lot of attention and new users to Telegram but that does not reflect bitcoin adoption growth rate. This is because P2E games has nothing to do with bitcoin. And people who are interested in tapping their screens to “earn” probably are in the tax bracket that cannot afford to buy bitcoin. P2E games are more popular in third world countries where the poverty rate is higher than other countries. It is my opinion that people who seriously play these games are doing so because they believe it is their key to wealth. And because NotCoin was a success, it is now easy for people to be convinced that the games can make them rich. Many of the P2E games out there are scams.",

The majority of them just come up with these attractive packages that promise to make people rich.

They are simply telling people that they can earn for the crypto industry just by playing games, and I am sure many of them will be disappointed. I think only a few of those who dare to research more about crypto will be able to discover that Bitcoin is the most dependable crypto investment.",

Mostly rather than Bitcoin, these P2E games employ their own coins. They also tend to be more concerned with short gains than with the kind of long-term investment Bitcoin offers. To be honest, at best the security of doing crypto transactions on a messaging app seems dubious.Therefore, even if these games are clearly bringing a new audience to crypto, this does not always translate into them starting significant Bitcoin investments. And the effects on Bitcoin's price are probably going to be minimal without significant investment. We have to approach this realistically, people.",
