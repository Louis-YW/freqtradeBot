  "content": "Good day,I don’t understand one thing about dydx.Everything is shown in USD on dydx.But is it real USD or is that USDC that have been converted to USDI need this information urgently as I have to do my tax return soon.I just don’t know if I can use the USD values ​​on dydx directly to calculate, or if I have to see the USD as USDC first and then have to change it to real USDSo:What happens if the USDC falls from 1$ to 0.5$ ?Example 1: ( dydx shows me USD / 1 USD = 2 USDC )Portfolio Value = 1.000$ so this will be 2.000USDCPosition Size = 3.000$ so this will be 6.000USDCFee = 100$ so this will be 200USDCUnrealized P&L = 6.000$ so this will be 12.000USDCRealized P&L = 150$ so this will be 300USDCExample 2: ( dydx shows me USDC as USD value / 1 USD = 1 USDC = 0,5 USD )Portfolio Value = 1.000$ so this will be 1.000USDC ( 500$ )Position Size = 3.000$ so this will be 3.000USDC ( 1.500$ )Fee = 100$ so this will be 100USDC ( 50$ )Unrealized P&L = 6.000$ so this will be 6.000USDC ( 3.000$ )Realized P&L = 150$ so this will be 150USDC ( 75$ )",
