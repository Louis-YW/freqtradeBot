After that, I copied the address from the text file and paste in the electrum recipient section for sending BTC. But it says \"Failed to parse text\". What does that exactly mean and why this happens? I had the exact address on the clipboard if I'm correct as later I had checked them manually.",

This happens when the application can not decode the given string which in your case is a bitcoin address[1]. So the possible scenarios is that when it calls is_b58_address method[2] it returns false. The reasons could be invalid checksum, invalid base58 characters, invalid data length, etc.Have you checked the same address in a block explorer to see if it is valid?[1] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/e5f21fb7b59a9206f903b4daa1054afc2f05a3b2/electrum/gui/kivy/uix/screens.py#L200-L203[2] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/e5f21fb7b59a9206f903b4daa1054afc2f05a3b2/electrum/bitcoin.py#L740",

I think I'm missing something here. For example, look at this address- 3AvG5ZHsgHkdeFadmKqkWoym87nkvRWWHYThe bold character is in small letter in the original address which I wanted to send fund. When I tried with capital letter, it returned me the above error. While changing this into small letter was okay and I was able to send. I don't know if I have sent in the wrong address or not. Lol.

I forgot it only applied on bech32, don't know for sure about the other one though.But according to https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98498/are-bitcoin-addresses-case-sensitive:Quote from: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98498/are-bitcoin-addresses-case-sensitive    base58 encoded addresses (1... and 3...) are case sensitive - however, getting the casing wrong will result in a checksum error, and a well designed wallet will not let you send a transaction to an incorrectly entered address    bech32 addresses like the one involved here are case insensitive but, as pointed out by Murch, must be entirely uppercase or lowercase - a compliant wallet should reject a mixed case bech32 address.",

You are making me confused whether I have sent BTC in the right address or not because I can't check the address one by one character.Kidding, the address was okay.
