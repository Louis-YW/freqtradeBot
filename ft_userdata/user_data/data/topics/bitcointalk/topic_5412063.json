  "content": "As we may have known, bull market is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable. A bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value (https://www.investopedia.com/insights/digging-deeper-bull-and-bear-markets/)I was learning how to trade the forex market back in 2019 while I used a broker called IQ option to practice in the demo section, after 2 months I felt I have learnt enough so I decided to put-in real money, so I invested $150 and after two weeks time I earned about $400. Later in 3 weeks time I lost all my earnings including my capital. I tried a different broker called Binary trade, funded the account with $200 and within a month and 2 weeks, I made about $1300, opted out because of series of losses and i starting a business.later around last year (2021) I studied the future trading option on the binance exchange, and around November during the Bull\" market, I was enter Â future trading on the binance exchange with BTC/USDT. I invested $1000 and I was able to make $2800, some might say it was a little profit ðŸ˜¹ but what matters was that there was $1800 profit added onto my capital. (I took advantage over the bull market).Â Â this year (2022) in the month of May, Â I invested $500 on Binance future trading and traded Luna/usdt and could make $1400. I took advantage of the market volatility.crypto future trading enables traders take advantage over bear or bull market and they could be earning profits (either big or small).Â apart from the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there more Altcoins to trade on binance future that can yield profit.Things to Note: Â Â 1. Always apply your stop loss and take profit optionÂ 2. Do not trade with emotionsÂ 3. Have a good source for signal or information about the crypto your trading. Â 4. It good to know that your asset can be liquidated when the leverage is high resulting to total loss of funds.Â When trading futures assets, one must be prepared to encounter losses as well as profit but it's advice to stay clear if you can't manage your risk.",

Which is why I prefer regular trading; a pump is risky too but it can give you more profit than futures with less risk and it is easier to get in an out of it while the pump is taking place.",

Do not trade with emotions1 & 2 are a regular MUST for those who want to be profitable traders. Sometimes we want to argue the significance of SL and think it's not that necessary because we're scared of encountering losses. Only if we knew that loss is a part of the game. Without loss, every Tom Dick and Harry will call themselves traders. So, SL helps separate the boys from the men. No matter how clever anyone wants to think of themselves, they shouldn't neglect SL. It gives rest of mind, knowing your loss won't surpass where you want it if things went wrong.",

Iâ€™m just using cross margin with low leverage on all my trade and just use 10% to 20% of my capital so that my position will be safe when the result is the opposite of my prediction. Iâ€™ve been liquidated many times in the past using isolated margin without stop loss so I try the cross margin to trade safely and take advantage my high margin for my trade. I just set stop loss at 50% loss just in case shit happened but I always trade along the trend.Take note that you don't even need to use leverage to short downtrends. Sure, without leverage potential profit are a lot less, but you're going to get liquidated A LOT less â€” which is such a significant thing because you could be right about a general trend but get liquidated anyway due to bad entry.",

PLUS the volatility that you're \"taking advantage\", and trading is actually caused by? They are caused by the emotions of the other traders in the market who are also trying to take advantage of the volatiltiy and who are trading against you.",

So that you will minimize your losses while there is a bear market. It is tougher to predict and guess the market, yet you can make money on a volatile market but it does not guarantee that you will always consistently gain profit on it. Another factor could depend on your mood, if you are not in the mood don't push yourself in trading, you will not focus on it, it will always have a barrier when making a good decision.",

It's good to have your specific capital for futures that only means to me that you are a responsible trader. Well in number 3, what do you mean good source of Signal? because personally I don't suggest any signal group and it's better if you do your own analysis and find that signal on your own. Trading is not easy, it will take a lot of time before you become good on that and honestly not all those who started trading become successful here, simply because they are still lack of discipline.",

The solution might be, I have not tried it, I stopped active daily/swing trading before I had the chance, is make a trading system that makes you know before hand, when to buy and how much to buy, and when to close the trade, and pre-program it in your exchange's trading site through the use of the different types of orders.",
