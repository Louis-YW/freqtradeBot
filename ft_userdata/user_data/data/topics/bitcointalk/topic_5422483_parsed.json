People like me who are not super fans of football are even attracted to watch the games because everyone is talking about it.",

The only sport where fans from around the world get together to support their countries is the world cup. A fan's greatest thrill is to visit the host nation and cheer for their home team. Additionally, it offers them the chance to socialize with others from around the globe. Some people seize the chance for a holiday, while others do so for business. It's good to see players from other tribes and religions come together for a game in a nation other than their own.",

What makes it so incredibly popular ?Apart from the glamour and excitement of football matches, people go to the World Cup for several reasons. Tourist see it as a big privilege to visit most host nations and other neighboring states. During this period most host nations reduce the entry requirement of their countries because they are expecting more people. Also the World Cup period bring together many people from different culture. Tourist find this time very interesting because they would meet people from other lands or country. Businessmen and companies also cease this opportunity to meet clients and advertise their goods and services. Some companies can also use this chance to carryout feasibility studies of the host and its neighboring countries so as to identify business opportunities.",

Its  advantages of encouraging trade relationship between nations, added to the fact that it a sport wherein the participants socialize thereby fostering unity and creating bonds, makes it one of the best games in the sports history. The world cup unlike other tournaments hosted is like the grand occasion or top tier of football. Only top players are ever granted the privilege to participate and make their name seared in the pages of history. Here careers are made and rising stars are discovered. Careers can also be destroyed if these players or fans dare to contravene the laws guiding such a huge tournament. The worst is to be banned for misconduct, and it can happen to both an individual and even a nation in whole.",

The other reasons are some what it connects with the people and it involves every player from both the team to win the game unless other games need special physique to excel and ofcourse the agression among the players on the field connects and separate the audience so its one of the popular sport.",

That morons can actually get upset over their teams losing. BTW I am still pissed off that the Mets lost to San Diego. So whenever I think about them I switch my mind to German and Argentina fans that I know are suffering.I think all non fans of any sport that is big do this.So When the World Cup comes along if they are like me they will watch hoping for a big favorite to lose.I think same for Olympics.

Japan winning Germany might be a surprise to you or to many football fans but beating Spain absolutely proved Japan's rapid and solid growth. Now Germany has lost all and gone back home, Japan and Spain are going to the next level of competition. There will be more surprises that strike more fans. We'll see.",

Footbal is indeed more than a sports game and brings more social and economic benefits to countries and fans. Another factor that could have made this happen is the consistency of hosting the World Cup. It has been the most watched sports event in history and through 92 years, it has accumulated an enormous fame and impact to the world. Nothing else is as global and influential as the World Cup. Look forward to more exciting matches to come. Cheers !",
