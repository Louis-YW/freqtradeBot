      "body": "I think this implies people below the ceo are doing too much work. If that stops it'll probably go back to what the average is elsewhere. Perhaps there's also a chance that things like referral/franchise schemes coupled with automation has meant there are fewer people needed to manage everything but this is a quirk specific to countries like the US that are more likely to have companies that serve the world and weak unions because they can hire internationally. It could also be an issue with anti monopoly laws not working the way they do in other countries too - which I think is a big one for the US. If Microsoft, Google and Amazon were founded in the UK, they'd have been split into a lot of smaller subsidieries and I think the US stock market would probably be more stable from that. I think the data gets exaggerated a bit by focusing on specific CEOs so it's very hard to compare how this works out internationally (average ceo salary in the US looks to be 10x the UK's for example but I'm not confident on either of those figures as the US was quoted at $800k which doesn't match your 165:1).",
