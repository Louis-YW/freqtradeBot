      "body": "Lol, it's another style of scamming. It's clear that he is triggered KYC from any platform and now he is trying to take it from other people. But yeah I think he is not much professional in this field , He should not ask about the KYC document at the very beginning of the discussion . Btw I know some things are very difficult for the Freelancers, I saw somewhere that sometimes fake clients sent phishing docs links with malware. Basically, most of the freelancers are very awaiting for the job, sometimes they click the link without doing a deep investigation, or they don't want to take much time to make the deal. That's why they try to do anything that clients ask. we need to be aware if we want to keep ourselves secure ourself in the virtual world.",

      "body": "Wow, I have never come across something like this before. It is quite impressive how resourceful scammers are becoming. I would definitely recommend reporting this to Freelancer.com customer service, as it goes against their rules and guidelines.By the way, I noticed you previously mentioned sending a copy of your ID card to him. In my opinion, it is best to avoid sending personal information to anyone, even if they seem trustworthy, as there are many potential risks and negative consequences that could result from doing so.",

That is against most of those platforms' TOC, and could get you suspended, and you should only KYC for the freelancing platforms, not clients!I have passed the info on this thread to WOLF.BET team, hopefully they can identify this user.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing it with us. KYC has recently become very popular on the decentralized launchpad. As a result, everyone is looking for an easy way to scam and skip. They obtain a KYC certificate from a third party by supplying a government-issued identity card and other documents. According to my investigation, there is even a KYC seller. That is, they collect data from us and send it to launchpads or wherever it is needed. Just be cautious when someone inquires about your personal information and documents.",

      "body": "Lately it’s been so common to see someone is trying to buy documents for KYC as casinos requirement to open or verify account, the problem is people are ready to sell their identities without knowing the actual risks of doing or the damage they may cause for the casino. I’m not sure why there’s a high demand for these kind of verifications while they can use their own documents is it to skip region restriction?Quote from: shasan on January 14, 2023, 12:42:13 PM is trying to take self-holding id/passport and also today's date.It’s so obvious he is trying to get your documents for the casino KYC for himself or to sell them for someone else, it’s a bit tricky how he did manipulate things by pretending to post a job offer, hopefully wolf.bet will identify this user and give him a permanent ban, but casinos really should change their KYC verification method such as doing it on video call instead of uploading documents knowing how easy someone can buy other person’s documents",

Since Freelancer has profile views and previous work samples, it's nothing but foolish to attempt this type of thing. I hope @shasan is know the way to catch the scammer. So thanks for alerting mate.",

Hack of troubles they plan just to get documents to be used for verification.  These are the kind of guys that also launder thru the casino right? They need the account to be verified since Wolfbet will also ask. If wolfbet will be alerted, they will tighten thier verification process and probably ask for videos. Damn worse for people withdrawing huge amount.",

Hack of troubles they plan just to get documents to be used for verification.  This is simple, as Sujonali already wrote.His client is a gambler of Wolf.bet casino. The casino asked him for a KYC.But, he cannot do the KYC because either he violated some rules or he may be from a banned country.Instead of submitting his own identity. He wants to raise someone else's Docs to verify his wolf.bet casino account. Thanks, shasan. Please stay away from them.",
