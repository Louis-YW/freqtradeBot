Such ads are usually created by people who want to buy video cards very cheaply, well below the market price. There are a lot of offers on the market, because the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 video cards are the most unprofitable. Look at the statistics.https://whattomine.com/gpus",

With eBay I would say its pretty safe because your purchase is guaranteed. eBay support always sides with the buyer. I had people buy many GPUs and ASICs and I had to take them back for made up reasons.Only issue with a new seller is that they might not do the best job of maybe packaging it up or shipping it correctly, or they can take their time going to the post office. However they won't scam you. No point in sellers ripping off buyers on ebay anymore. So if its a great deal, cheaper than most other sellers I would say go for it.",
