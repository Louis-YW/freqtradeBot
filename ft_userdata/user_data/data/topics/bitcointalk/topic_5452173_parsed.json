So therefore, i would advise that you show us proof of transaction to claim you made deposited to your casino wallet, your winnings on the casino and other possible evidence to back your claims otherwise you would not be taken serious here. Lastly, i would advise you to always do proper research on casino before engaging with them so as to avoid any unforeseen event such as this one in the nearest future. There are lots of casino well known with good reputation here you can as well do our research and findings abut them and do with any as it pleases you.",

Right now, I cannot say if their reason for closing your account is a correct course of action or not because I do not know their side of the story.At the very least they should return your deposit but the lesson for you and everyone else to learn here is you must read terms and conditions when you sign up to any casino or gaming website and you must be prepared to still not have your funds released even after you send your KYC.

How could they do such a thing to their new member, blocking and taking his funds away and not granting him access to his dashboard. It is very absurd indeed. I think this is a lesson to be learnt by OP. Next time you will have to do some research and conducting due diligence before getting engaged with casinos. If you had checked trust pilot review then you would have had a little clue about the exchange but it is unfortunate that you did not do all these but was quick to get onboard and making deposit.This is a lesson learnt and I believe next time you will have to go the right thing before trying to register on any of the casinos.Do well to present all the necessary evidence as requested so that some forum members can take it up from there on your behalf.",

      "body": "Well from your perspective yes on the surface it is wrong but we have no idea what they will say in their defence. If they open an account here and post about it we can ask them for their version of events.If what you stated earlier is true, maybe they are thinking if they returned your deposit they are sending out the wrong signal to members they suspect of trying to scam them. I am not saying what they did is right or wrong, all I am saying is we should hear from them. Personally, I would at least return the deposit and close the account but many of these online casinos are like the wild west they do whatever they want.Quote from: leduythanh96 on May 10, 2023, 11:52:56 AMit's absurd to take all the player's deposit and winnings and give a ridiculous nonsense excuse",
