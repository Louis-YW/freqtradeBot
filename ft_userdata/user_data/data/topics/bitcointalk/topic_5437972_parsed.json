Try to read a lot of books, watch some English tutorials, and see your improvements once in a while.. No one will help you but yourself. One of the ways to improve writing is through consistently writing short articles and that vehicle has helped improve the writing skills of members of this forum. Op's writing is not that difficult to understand, however it's not an article, but a little post that people can easily read and understand. You've got the best advise for him to improve his writing skills, but if he often writes in the forum, given time, he'll be a better writer. Unless he wants to learn use of English, parts of speech, use of words etc he can move to English tutorials on Youtube or join English forums. On the other side, Like others, suggested, I think OP needs to avoid thinking about fast paced method to rank up, It's better to study the forum and understand it before moving ahead to ranking up. Furthermore, quality writing is the only tool for reaching top ranks, as you can't do anything else on the forum without sharing it through threads. Reasonable question effects good responses and such a thing like good questioning can help rank up OP's account in the forum. Generally, OP avoid fake news!",

Nothing special I think. Writing and replying steady will make active and you can attract merit to your post because non active accounts will lack merit when people don't see it for reading. Don't focus on merit always but do your best to be active.Quote from: Belarge on February 03, 2023, 09:05:50 PMBecause I'm not really a good writer If you don't write good you write the way you are able but try passing reasonable message to reader.

I think you should take sometime off posting since you're finding it difficult to post anything right now you should probably just dedicate two or three weeks to learn more about the forum and also watch closely how others make their post and if you're also interested in ranking up and gaining merits then you should also observe those that get plenty of them maybe you could get an idea of how to go about your posting habit and also to figure out what it is that you're missing that's preventing you from achieving what it is that you really want.
