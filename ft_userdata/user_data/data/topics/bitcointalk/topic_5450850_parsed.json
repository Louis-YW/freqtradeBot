      "body": "\"Mr. Roo Ready to Rock The Cosmos \"Material: WoodTools: Special tools for wood carvingType: Relief Carving + PaintingSize: 68x55 cmDuration: 15 dayFinally able to enliven the Roobet Art Contest this time. At first it was a bit confused about the concept that was contested this time, but trying to ask and find references created the \"Rock The Cosmos Carving\" Concept. Each Art Contest has its own challenges, trying to carve with a space theme and this is a first for me, quite difficult but finally finished with a touch of color that makes the carving more alive. The size is bigger than the previous carving, to show the space in my carving with several planets, meteors and stars.Regardstaufik123    Full Album Carving Processhttps://postimg.cc/gallery/z5FLCtMRoobet Username: taufik123bech32 BTC address: bc1qcqf82ys3afxx04ga89rgew7hhn75e0hz6cnxcu",
