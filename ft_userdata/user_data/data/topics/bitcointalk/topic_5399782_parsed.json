      "body": "One thing that is important to point out is that the bitcoin you're storing in a hot wallet like your Bitcoin Core one shouldn't have more than a small amount. This is because it's basically not as secure as the bitcoin you're storing in a cold wallet.I don't see the point in having multiple cold storage wallets, but it doesn't hurt as long as you keep them secure. If the amount you're storing is very large you might consider having multiple signatures for a single cold storage wallet to increase security though.",

For example, if you've verified the binaries of Electrum on a freshly installed open-source OS, on a machine that you've removed things like WiFi antennas, then you're fine. Turn off the lights, close the curtains, generate your seed phrase, write it down on a paper, copy the master public key, and you're safe.I don't use Bitcoin Core as a wallet. There's no reason. Stick with Electrum that's lightweight and don't make things more complicated than they already are.",

Splitting into many wallets have a risk e.g. forgot where you stored, especially you're divide/spread some seeds in some hidden places.If you want better security, make sure you have another cellphone, where the one doesn't have any Bitcoin stuffs for your daily usage.",

      "body": "Yes it's better to store your crypto coins in multiple wallets than having everything in one wallet. In my opinion the security risk is too high when using only one wallet. It also depends on the size of your wallet, if you only hold a few hundred USD worth of cryptos than it might be easier to just use one. But once your wallet grows I would recommend to split into different wallet. For me I have one mobile wallet which I use for small transactions, everything less than 100 USD. And then I have one paper and one hardware wallet for long term storage. It's a little bit more work to organise multiple wallets, but like this if anything happens to your wallet you atleast don't lose everything.",

I just keep seed phrases and passwords far from devices like PC, laptop or tablet computer. You should worry more though, because some others are certainly trying to find a way to steal what you have. It makes no sense to keep your passwords and seeds as far away as possible from the device you are using, especially if you have not protected them well. Storing backups in different locations makes sense, but only if those locations are secure - otherwise you only increase the risk of someone finding them, accidentally or intentionally.",

      "body": "It is a very wise approach to never keep all your coins in one wallet; you should split them between different wallet implementations and also between different private keys to avoid completely or at least minimize your accidental losses and planned attacks on you. However, splitting the coins usually involves creating and storing dozens of backup files, which most people don't like to do or have no idea how to do properly. If we assume that a wallet is something you have direct access to with the keys you control, you will have five ways to split your coins: 1) between mathematically unrelated keypairs (each keypair is an independent wallet); 2) between mathematically unrelated seed phrases (each seed is an independent wallet); 3) between different passphrases (each combination of seed+passphrase results in an independent wallet https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki); 4) between mathematically related keypairs (all keys are derived from a single seed https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki); 5) between mathematically related seed phrases (one seed creates many seeds https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawiki). The last two options require a minimum number of backups while providing access to thousands of wallets.",

Maybe because I was too careful in dealing with other people and was vigilant to links. What I think is that we don't need to split our funds just to add security, it all matters how we handle our seeds, keys/password. In fact, I used a non-custodial wallet that is available in our country and still doing it well. I use 2FA just to add security and I think it was enough.",

The scams related with ledger and trezor are because of the malicious script from the unofficial retails, so you should bought from the official store/retails. The problem about ledger is leaked of the customer information, while trezor it's still a rumor.You can create your own hardware wallet, but it's not that easy and most people can't do the correct way. That's why it's more convenience to use trustworthy and popular centralized hardware wallet e.g. trezor or ledger.[1] https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core/blob/master/docs/hardware.md[2] https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware[3] https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite[4] https://github.com/LedgerHQ",
