But early holders of Bitcoin not only lost their keys because they were not stored, they made the sale early because at that time Bitcoin was still worthless.And a big transaction made with Bitcoin is the purchase of pizza with 10,000 BTC. If the initial holder could hold back until now, then he would have become very rich with Bitcoin, but in fact they have sold early. And those who lost the key or those who have died and did not pass on the Seed Phrase to others.The address with a lot of Bitcoin will only become a graveyard of Bitcoins that will no longer be able to move. So there is less and fewer Bitcoin supply available in the market.",

Although there are some people who are good at first adopting a new technology and becoming early adopters of that technology while watching to see how things unfold about that technology, that was the case with bitcoin. Some were skeptical about it; some watched it from afar. While some just tried it to see how it went, although people never believed that it would be this important and sold off at the early beginning, while some lost their phrase just as the previous reply stated, and some holders are already late without passing their keys to their loved ones, these lost bitcoins would actually make the available bitcoin more scarce and valuable. And in time to come, the price would be higher than it is now, and the adoption rate would be very high enough to trigger a global and massive integration of bitcoin into the government system all over the world.",

Becasue here in Blockchain all the transactions are processed with the public and private keys, so what needs to be secured is the seed/master key. That's also a proven fact that many people lost their key access and now the wallets are dead, At the same time some crazy people are trying to buy old data files in the black market to somehow crack big treasures. I haven't heard of any such successful attempt.According to the estimation currently, there's a 6M Bitcoin supply suspected under the dead wallets, how-much-bitcoin-is-lost-forever. TBH i think there a massive amount which is still accessible.",

Only a few people believe that Bitcoin's value will increase in the future. Others felt it was a joke but I don't blame them because the project was new and unconventional. Everybody was used to fiat money so it was very difficult to believe that virtual or digital currency would become a legal tender. Those who lost their password or seed phrase will live to regret their actions and it is a lesson to all of us to always keep our assets safe regardless of their worth currently.

I cannot verify the reliability of other coins but I am sure that Bitcoin is worth hodling. The coin has proved over the years to be dependable. I cannot vouch for other coins because many worthless coins are developed every day.  There is a report that claimed that close to 1,700 and 2,500 have failed and ultimately disappeared from the crypto market. So you have to be careful of the coins you keep because they might be worth nothing in a few months or years.",

I remember reading a  of one guy that wanted to dig up a piece of land to find his hardware wallet containing 150m worth of bitcoins. This is just one out of many. There are others who had bitcoins in websites and have either forgotten the passwords or the name of the website. Truth is people place value on things that have value and back then bitcoin wasn’t this valuable. Now that it is, everyone is scrambling for a price of it. Quote from: sotelorene on November 23, 2023, 07:05:33 PMHowever,  what am saying in essence is that whatsoever coin you have or you are mining please keep it safe and don't forget your password very important because you can't and will never recover the password.  I believed within a short time most of these coin will have a great value,  a value that one of it will change your story.

However, there is still time though to accumulate, it might not be as huge as what we plan because everyone is late or the timing is bad, but you need to be very positive and look for the long term, at least 5 years will be good to see and gauge if you really make it here.Of course, you need conscious effort to accomplished it, like slowly accumulating and then holding and protecting all your assets be it bitcoin or any other altcoin if you are into it. So don't be discourage, and just look at bitcoin, one year ago we are at our lowest low, but check the price right now, we have gain more than 100%.And I think investors in the last couple of years are getting smart and knows how to safely secure their private keys or mnemonic phrase.",

I understand what you're trying to say, but let me bite on this statement about most people who knew about Bitcoin back then. The truth is that we keep forgetting to factor in the strong possibility that even if you bought Bitcoin back then, you would have likely sold it long before now. Someone who bought at let us say $30, even at $ 1,000 will sell off. So these people we calculate to be early birds, they most likely don't have Bitcoin anymore. Even the guy who sold the most expensive pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins, he lkely has an empty wallet for a really long now.Coming back to your topic, Bitcoin has taught us a lesson, and I believe that record has served as motivation for many people, and the decision to hodl is now even stronger.",

I guess there are many people or holders of bitcoin who, in the past, forgot about their wallet or lost their seed phrase, which is important for them to access their wallets, but that's their fault and also their biggest regret. It's just that they are the few who missed the biggest opportunity, or, let's say, bitcoin was in their hands but slipped. Well, it can't be helped.They still have a chance to invest in bitcoin, and I think they do. Also, that's why there are a lot of bitcoins circulating in the market, or liquity; those are the bitcoins we considered locked or forever lost. For example, like what I've mentioned about forgotten wallets that contain bitcoins or hard drives that have bitcoin, there are a lot of stories regarding this scenario.

It always hard to tell what will happen in future about Bitcoin price and that why we are been advised by some people in crypto industry that should invest what will can afford to lose. Even now, we assume that it is possible that we actually know how the Bitcoin price will increase. A lot will have accumulated some huge numbers of Bitcoin, but because nobody can actually tell what will happen to the price of Bitcoin, they are investing what they can only afford to lose. Despite this,  there is little hope that Bitcoin may continue gain value due to its history of halving that backs it up.many people that have lost their wallet passwords at past.

Yes, you have provided sound advice, but the truth is that I will only suggest buying Bitcoin and not any other cryptocurrency because a lot of them pump and dump and end up being worthless forever.I still won't advise anyone to invest in altcoins with the belief that they would increase in value after they dump. but it is a good idea to keep any wallet you have with any kind of coin properly because it may be possible can rise again, but probably of many altcoins to again is very low expect Bitcoin.
