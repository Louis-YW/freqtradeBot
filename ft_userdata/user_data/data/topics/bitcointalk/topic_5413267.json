  "content": "OK I decided to try my hand again at leverage tradingThe plan was to watch the market and when I see it making a move in one direction go in with high leverage for a small move with no stop lossThis went well 1st week and was up 30% but then went down hill fast The issue I have is not so much bad calls but getting scaredI will go in with 10-20x leverage and see my money drop like a stone be down 20% and exit only to see it climb back up and hit the TP or climb higherThis has happened three times now.One issue I have other than getting scared is to do with time restraints I am trying to find a trade quickly and not giving it enough time also aping in and usual sh*t I am trying to come up with a strategy that works as close to 100% as possible and have found one on BTC/USDT with an average of 95% success rate. Other pairs are also high 80s to mid 90s I have stopped trading for a bit and am doing more tests and paper trading Is there a way to make this work or do others mainly trade with leverage how do you handle stop loss and take profit",

      "body": "Indicators can fail, which makes it not possible. Going for 10 to 20x leverage is high. You need stop loss for it. And that should only be used for scalping. If you do not want to use stop lose, it is still risk. Assuming you like to go on 5x leverage which would be he highest that would be good for this. You can start trading with 1x and be happy with the very little gain if it continues to work. If you are losing and the indications are indicating your direction would soon be favoured, then you can just go 2x. If it fails, then go for 5x which should be the highest leverage you should use. As you increase the leverage, the price you opened position will draw closer to the recent price of the coin you are using to trade. And this strategy can go beyond scalping to day trading if your first analysis failed.I have used several altcoins to trade before, altcoins can turn an expert trader to a poor trader. I will advice you to use bitcoin.",

It could be a poor position sizing, or it could also mean that you are trading your PnL and not your technicals, or maybe a plain emotional hurdle called FOMO.When I say poor position sizing, you are maybe entering a trade that's too large keeping your eyes glued on your PnL because you are just simply uncomfortable seeing your money getting rekt. Trading your PnL and not your technical on the other hand means that you exit based on the +/- percentage you see and not on your charts or the data points you have created.Both of these issues are related to mindset or your psychological behaviour and the best solution you could come up with is experience and discipline.",

Use money that you can gamble with for it. There are possibilities that success is possible, but also the means many traders funds are getting liquidated. Taking for example, bitcoin at $20000. Using 50x leverage. Liquidation price for long position would be $19600Liquidation price for short sition would $20400Not yet including the trading fee. I have traded like this before, but I consider it very high risk and liquidation is possible at anytime.",

Leverage trading is not easy, and increasing the leverage doesn't guarantee any profit, think if you can handle the risk before you proceed, there's a little margin on that and you might get liquidated easily.",

It is only your self-comfort and self-deception. The problem is the absolute lack of risk management and a perfectly polished strategy. At the moment, your trading is no better than slots in one-armed bandit. You will never come up with anything with such risks, because it is almost impossible to use it in long-term trading. Well, you can trade with such risks for a couple of days or weeks, and then what? And then the inevitable drain of the deposit and losses. This is a 100% guaranteed final for all margin traders using 2 or 3 digit leverage.The fact that you use tests and paper trading is good. I myself once went through this. This approach is very helpful in identifying certain patterns in your trading and focusing around them. I can say for sure that sooner or later you will come to the conclusion that trading with x1.5 - x1.8 leverage will be more or less comfortable. The sooner you come to realize this, the more time and money you will save.You wouldnt really realize these things if you wont able to experience for yourself and whenever you do touch those leverage then sooner or later you would be finding out whether it would really be just fine for you tohandle up such risk or not.Its true that this isnt particularly talking about fear or timing.You would able to find out on what are the things will mainly affect you along the way.Its not really that suggestable on dealing up with higher leverage if your capability or knowledge/skills arent enough on handling such trading method or field.",

This must be hard to explain because everyone is so worried about the risks.High leverage for high risk too, but it also allows you to get high returns. Take the middle way, do it with small funds and for the amount you can afford to lose, it will give you a sense of security, especially when expectations do not match reality.",

Even as a professional the use of high leverage will be very high risk.

I don't know why people insist on these strategies. Surely it is because they follow youtubers who give them \"strategies\" like this to get rich quickly, but they do not tell them that the faster the \"strategy\" is used, the higher the risk of bankruptcy increases, until it approaches 100% as you increase the leverage and use it longer.Keep in mind that in trading you are competing against high frequency algorithms run by Hedge Funds, who have a lot of capital to move the market and who are emotionally neutral, they only make mathematical decisions.In all the time I have been in the forums and interested in economics and finance, I have not yet seen anyone show evidence of winning consistently in the medium term (not even long term) with these systems.",
