It is difficult to attract attention to the project and to develop it during the fall of the market and not all the projects will be able to survive.Only the best projects will be able to survive during the fall of the market, that are really necessary for people and in demand.",

Our team has each more than a decade working for portfolio companies of tier-1 global funds and have experienced ups and downs in the market. From the investor´s perspective, during red markets you will find good risk-adjusted opportunities. It is very is to invest, specially in altcoins when the market is passing through a uptrend but then you won´t be paying good risk-adjusted returns nor good sharpe ratios. Imagine how easy was to buy crypto during the 2nd semester of 2017 or mid 2021 but then once the pick is reached, investors lose their capital and go away.In summary, solid projects with experienced teams will always prevail. Through hard times like today companies will, of course, find hard time to raise and will need to face valuations reductions. Therefore, we do believe that is right time to launch this project as we will find the best scenario to negoatiate with the Companies that will raise through our platform, that´s good for investors. From the marketing point of view, we partnered with two leading crypto marketing agencies to start promoting our project: Blockma[Suspicious link removed]o and CTM (Crypto Market Traffic), Coinboud is also under negotiation. Pls should you want to get deep on any other topic, let us know. Hard work pays off, let´s shape the way people invest their capital !",

Hard work pays off, let´s shape the way people invest their capital !I understand that a falling market is a time of opportunity and the biggest fortunes are always made in a falling market, because you can buy promising tokens at a very attractive price. But not all projects will be able to survive during a falling market.What are you doing to survive in a falling market?",
