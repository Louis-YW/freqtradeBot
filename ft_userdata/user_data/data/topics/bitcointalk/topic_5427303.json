  "content": "Hey ya'll, I'm looking to snag up a small amount of BTC USB miners. Preferably something like the newer gekkoscience sticks. Willing to pay via what ever method makes most sense to you. Really only looking for 1-5 of them depending on price. Will be using them for a hobby project and not really willing to pay ebay prices for them at the moment. I don't mind a bit of mark up but when you can buy used apollo boxes for 300-400 and get 3-4TH it doesn't make sense to pay 200+ for .25 TH. Must be willing to use Escrow if we haven't done a deal before or if you have low/no rep. Feel free to shoot me a DM or reply here directly.Thanks,Jambo",
