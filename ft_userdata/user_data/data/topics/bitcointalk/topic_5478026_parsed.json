Something of decent quality - no big black spots on brass coins. Willing to pay fair but not \"pry it from your hands\" price. Your coin, you set the price. I'm not afraid to be patient if this inquiry is not fruitful. I have a few 1 BTC Casascius coins that I’d let go for the right price. If I’m setting the price it would be 1.35 BTC for the latest brass Casascius coin, but of course there’s always room to negotiate.  Any idea what you’re willing to pay for the right specimen? I’d also require payment up front. Good luck with your hunt. They’re out there.",
