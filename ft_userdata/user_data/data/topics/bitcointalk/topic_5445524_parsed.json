      "body": "So you want people to join a project that they are no knowledge of. They would be disappointed when they learn it's really not a game-changing project. We've seen enough promises from a team introducing some project that turns out a scam in the end.I wouldn't be surprised about thousand of projects coming out these days hyping up because banks are collapsing and predictions of the soon supercycle.Â  But they are just riding the pump of the bull market.",
