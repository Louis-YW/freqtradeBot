She asked me to get all of his private data from it and sell it. I have found a \"bitcoin\" folder there and a text file in it. It says little to nothing to me except a few text lines like \"@32capital letters and numbers@\" and a B64 string. I will not give the exact figures as due to the risk of losing all of it. I am not sure if there are any bitcoins there, but if someone could help me to figure out what could the 32 characters, separated by @@ mean and how can be associated with this B64 I would be glad to share with whatever I find there.",

To get all the private key data is not from the folder file, but from aplication, bitcoin core wallet.If that PC doesn't have Bitcoin core wallet yet, you may install from: https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and run it. You can disable network actifity on core wallet, if still catch the blockchain. Then go to console, and write \"dumpprivkey\", that maybe have password you have to pass it before.Quote from: Zipp_1199 on October 31, 2023, 01:33:31 PMI have found a \"bitcoin\" folder there and a text file in it.Have you seen the wallets folder there?, I assume that text file is json setting file of wallet, not as key like your guess.",

If you are not familiar with python you can also use bitaddress.org to convert that string into WIF format.",

Don't force her to tell you the private keys, Only just for the information if they are missing bitcoins ?Quote from: OmegaStarScream on October 31, 2023, 01:54:37 PMAlso, regarding your 32-character string. Could you show us a few characters from it? It could possibly be either a Bitcoin address or a blockchain.info wallet ID (which I believe should have 36 characters if you include the 4 dashes).Yes, but there were no @ sign in those addresses or did he replaced the --dashes with @ signÂ  Yeah, if the OP can provide a few characters it may be helpful in guessing if this was a private key or something else but i really doubt that it is anything related to private Key.",

I really doubt that he could do some advanced encryption as he was not a computer geek. Wow, if it's from 2012 and there really ARE still Bitcoin stored back from that date, it could be worth a lot. Given last modified 2013 it could also be mostly sold at the first massive surge back then.I will not be able to help much in recovering it (but you will most likely find the right folks here or in the tech section). Just wanted to say BE SUPER CAUTIOUS with whom you share any information with. Never share your private info or any of the data stored in said files with anyone and most importantly don't fall for people trying to take the convo to telegram or similar other platforms.All the best with the recovery.",

Did he never talk to you about it or mentioned that he purchased or received BTC at some point in this life?What about his wife? Ask her if she knows if he owned any bitcoins. Perhaps he did at one point in the past but he sold it all to get money he needed for other expenditures. I think that most people with significant crypto wealth get their partners involved and explain to them how to access the coins if it comes to the worst.",
