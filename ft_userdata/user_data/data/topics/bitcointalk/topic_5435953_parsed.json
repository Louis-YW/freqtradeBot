  "content": "MetaPlanetary is a decentralized platform that aims to create a new decentralized metaverse, striking a balance between the traditional financial systems with their many hindrances and the native crypto solutions that typically lack necessary KYC and AML measurements. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless and transparent ecosystem that allows users to interact and transact in a new digital world. By investing in the MetaPlanetary token sale, you can be part of the revolution of decentralized governance and finance.One of the key features of MetaPlanetary is the use of digital identities represented by Soul Bound Tokens (SBT). SBTs are issued and bound to unique blockchain accounts or wallets associated with specific individuals. This allows for secure and private transactions, as well as providing a way for users to express and present themselves in new ways, enabling new forms of interaction. The SBT also serves as a bridge between the metaverse and the physical world, allowing users to bring their real-world identities into the metaverse.Our platform also provides a mechanism for an individual to obtain a Consolidated ID (CID), which amalgamates all of his/her existing Web 2.0-based IDs. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manage multiple IDs from different platforms, making it easier to navigate and use the Metaverse. This also allows for a more streamlined experience, as users no longer have to keep track of multiple usernames and passwords across different platforms.MetaPlanetary also offers a currency auto-conversion functionality that allows users to pay for services and to all merchants using our native currency. This eliminates the need for users to hold multiple different types of digital currencies, making it more convenient for them to use our platform. The auto-conversion feature also eliminates the need for users to constantly check the exchange rates of different currencies, making it easier for them to transact within the metaverse.In addition to the above features, MetaPlanetary also has an Omni Bridge that connects all platforms together seamlessly. This allows for easy integration with other platforms and services, making it possible for users to access and use a wide range of features and services within the Metaverse. The Omni Bridge allows for interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to access a wider range of services and applications.To ensure the security and stability of our platform, we have also implemented a decentralized governance structure, which is facilitated by our own token, MetaPlanetary (MPY). MPY is used to govern the platform and make decisions on its development, ensuring that the community has a say in its direction. This decentralized governance model ensures that the platform is always responsive to the needs of the community, and that it is always in line with the latest technological advancements.MetaPlanetary also utilizes Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchain to power its smart contracts, which are EVM-compatible, this allows for merge between legacy systems with the smart contracts incorporating decentralized finance business logic. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions and also allows for the platform to be easily integrated with other decentralized finance protocols.In conclusion, MetaPlanetary is a revolutionary platform that aims to reshape the future of the digital world. By investing in the MetaPlanetary token sale, you can be a part of the revolution of decentralized governance and finance. Join us on our journey to create a new decentralized metaverse.Web: https://metaplanetary.io/KYC: : https://github.com/Vital-block/Project-KYC-Verification/blob/99e29b320ff49634f21da125ecf8874a4ddb6525/METAPLANETARY%20KYC%20CERTIFICATE.pdfAUDIT:Â  https://github.com/Vital-block/Smart-Contract-Audit/blob/458f6fd127da06ddcb0e21b28081c0af6cdf1ed2/Metaplanetary%20Full%20Audit%20Report.pdf",
