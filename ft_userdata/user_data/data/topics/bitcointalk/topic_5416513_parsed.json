Just use a trustworthy gambling site and never bother yourself about regulation. Only what would be regulated are pertaining to restriction of under 18s and other illegal age for gambling, taken gamblng adverts away from public in places children can be exposed to it, money laundering and other things like that and nothing much more.",

This is inevitable but crypto casino and crypto user needs to adapt to survive on strict implementation of law by regulators. I remember this is also an issue on exchange but right now KYC is already accepted by users that want to trade and use exchange since it's already a mandatory requirements on most of the big exchange before user can trade.Imo, gamblers on crypto become interested in crypto casino because of its convenience and not mainly due to privacy. Casino business will just continue even with KYC since gamblers have no choice or else they will come back on physical casino.",

Most importantly avoid playing in unlicensed casinos that way you protect your funds and identity.",

Casinos will likely run less promotions as they will have a smaller budget. The good thing most likely will be that government involvement might make the consumer feel safer(depending on the government) and feel a casino isn't rigged.",

The regulation will remove the confusion if playing and operating is illegal or not. Also, I think a casino is already regulated if they have a gambling license, from your example, Roobet has license which means it is being regulated. The only difference is that, there is no regulation yet for crypto.Crypto regulation also means tax can be implemented, cutting your winnings and casino profits.",

Depends!We do see that majority of crypto casino nowadays does have licenses which does simply imply or means that they are really following some rules or regulation which they would really be implying out those rulesalso into their terms and conditions which users should really be looking out.Any effects? If a casino would be sticking out on implementing strict KYC rules or requirement thenyou would definitely seeing the number of users who do love anonymity would really be staying away on a certain site.We do have sites today that doesnt ask out for any verification or personal info which you could still play anytime you do want.",

I think it is possible that regulation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem by some centralized powers and governments could affect casinos eventually, specially by the restrictions of what payment methods casinos would be allowed to implement or keep. Casinos could try to move their base of operations to other lands where regulations are not to hard against them,that would probably mean to lose an user base in countries like USA or Europe which are supposedly to most likely to enforce new and harsher rules.Even though regulation could become an obstacle for gambling projects, there will be alternatives the people behind these may take to continue operating.",

They are already regulated and having a license is the proof for that. Though they may get that license easily but we are talking about good gambling site here and they also have the KYC so I think they are already complying with the regulators. Regulations can affect gambling projects, this may pressure them to implement KYC as much as possible and since many gamblers still don’t want KYC, tendency are they will look for the alternatives.",

Definitely these centralized casinos will be forced to implement KYC for anti-money laundering.  They also need to have a license acknowledged by the government they want to setup their service.  Aside from that, I don't see any difference from what we are experiencing atm. Having the government regulate gambling casino somehow bring more trust to the platform.  Having licenses means the people behind the gambling casino company owner is known.  This somehow prevents a gambling casino from scamming its player and disputes can be brought to court.",

I think it's on their mitigation plan to abide on those regulations so that they can secure their business in the future too. They are a huge gambling platform and for sure they know that regulations is the future too in terms for longevity. I think if they are licensed then they are also regulated.",
