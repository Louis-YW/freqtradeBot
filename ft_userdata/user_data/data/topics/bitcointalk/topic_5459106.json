  "content": "This discussion pops up in my brain when I joined this discussionNowadays, if I am not wrong, in cryptocurrency communities, people are more favorite to use the term halving than halvening. However, I know both terms have been using many years. It is not about what is right, what is wrong. Technical terms are created by human and we can change it.Today, in this topic, let's dig into the past, to explore history of these terms: halving and halvening.I present here based on my Search results with the Bitcointalk search tool. I was not in Bitcointalk in 2011 or earlier so my information can be inaccurate so if you find such inaccuracy, please correct it. I much appreciate your help.HalvingThe term 'halving' is used in 2011, on 2nd July.Quote from: Binford 6100 on July 02, 2011, 03:53:15 PMyou send N coins to meI send N/2 back to you.simple as that.no catches, no strings attached.you know upfront how much you'll looseand I promise to keep having a good life.if it goes well, I will change the ration keep/returnfrom 1:1 maybe up to 5:95but you'll always loose your bitcoinsin this schema. at least I'm honest and do not promise doubling or so.When I search with 'halve', it was used one month earlier than 'halving', on 5th June 2011.Quote from: NetTecture on June 05, 2011, 10:28:36 AMHow do you incorporate this into your business model?I jsut figured out it will be quite disrubpive - cashflows will at least half overnight.Note this is not against the concept oflowering payouts, but halving it every 210.000 blocks means that between quite some time you have a VERY big change. It may have been better to put the change smaller into smaller increments that follow the same curve (for example 90% every x blocks - forgive me, not in the mood to try that out mathematically now).This way miners get a hugh hit in bitcoins generated, and with a more stable value in cashflows. Running this as a business means it does not look good on balance sheet HalveningThe 'halvening' term in Bitcointalk is used about one year later, in 2012.Quote from: conspirosphere.tk on August 11, 2012, 09:03:42 PMOn the other hand, lower prices are increasing the yield: at current price YABMC is paying >3% weekly. At that rate, getting back the whole capital invested as dividends in a few months, before the halvening, while ASICS are still a pie in the sky, does not seems so unlikely to me.Some articles about those terms but they don't have information about those term origins.Terminology. The oldest topic in Bitcointalk about terminology only lists 'halving'Coinbase articleHalving (Coinmarketcap Glossary)Bitcoin Halving (Investopedia)Bitcoin Glossary of Terms (Bitcoinmagazine)What is the halvening",

If the divided part isn't disappeared, then we can call it halve IMO.But I'd like to see a better term than halving because halving is too general. It's like holding, but in cryptocurrency we're use hodling term.",

This is same with hodling and other slang term on crypto. I think most important thing is that we understand what’s gonna happened after halving/halvening/halfing/halfckening. But Halving is the most popular term to use here since I experience 2 halving during 2016 and 2020. Halvening is just use on the social media lately.",

Halving might be slightly incorrect for the picky language purists, but I don't care (halving in the sense of creating two halfs of something while Bitcoin's halving cuts off half of block subsidy into nothing).Yeah Halving is the most recognized one according to Oxford Dictionary and also correct since it states that it is a direct reduction by half which is the idea behind the bitcoin halving. But the other one also is correct because it can be used in some old English sentences according to Middle English compendium, it means dividing into two, which is the same.But then just like how the whole hodling came about it is even suggested to call it Halfing in respect to Hal Fin.",
