I wish to know about their profit. But I can not do that now. But definitely know that it is a scam. If you want to mine, it is not easy. You have to calculate the electricity the miners you want to use will consume over certain period of time, buying the miner, other mining equipments and joining a mining pool. If you can not mine yourself, do not mine, do not join any cloud mining site.Avoid.",

We have seen quite a number of people being fooled by cloud mining sites.it's like double the money. when you deposit some money, it will be doubled by the site. but if we send money, then we will be deceived.OP, if you are interested in mining. You can look it up in the mining thread on the forums. I think you will get more complete information.the information from @Charles-Tim is also great. You can consider it before you get interested in mining.",

This one is a real newbie. Mate you would have dropped the website like https://www.worldexpertminer.com/home here for easy access, instead of using it only on the title of the thread. Now we have to go to google to search for it before coming back to make comprehensive comment. The way I look at that site, it is a platform of third hands traders, whereby you sign up and deposit bitcoin and the developers of the forum would used it to trade for you. And at that process anything can happened. Might not able to withdraw your funds or the website would be under maintenance until your funds are diverted. Therefore, if I am the one that will recommend a platform for you to trade I will say use Binance or Remitano these are open source platforms for trading.",

Why I don't have such friends?  it seems as if she was giving more money, just so they would stop asking. however, I understand the situation completely, because some of my friends ignored my advice not to invest in some scam schemes. they preferred to trust an unknown person and give money, rather than to me, who did not ask for it but advised not to spend it.",

This is a very old scam method around the crypto world. When they first time asked for another deposit then you should ask here. So we may prevent making any future deposits. Now we can't help to recover money. Don't be greedy and don't lose money this way. There is no shortcut to earning money online.",
