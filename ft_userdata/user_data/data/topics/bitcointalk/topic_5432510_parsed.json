This will be a string of random numbers and letters, usually 26-42 characters in length, starting with either \"1\", \"3\", or \"bc1\".If you want to withdraw euros from a site, you cannot withdraw them to a bitcoin wallet. You will need to withdraw them to a standard fiat bank account or similar.Quote from: RobbyN789 on December 31, 2022, 02:39:48 PMThe auto-generated one, which i get , when i simply click 'retrive' in my wallet isnt enough..they need the 'public link' in order to process withdrawals.No, they don't. The only thing they need to process a withdrawal is your address. Either you are getting mixed up or this site is trying to scam you.I would suggest that you share the name of the site you are using as well as screenshots of their withdrawal page or where else they are asking for your \"public link\".",

      "body": "This will solve nothing.First of all, blockchain.com is an online wallet so you don't download anything. Secondly, since it is a web wallet it is a very poor choice of wallet and I wouldn't recommend using it at all. But most importantly, it will not solve your issue. It also does not have \"public links\" since these do not exist. It will simply provide you an address just the same as Wasabi wallet does.We can't help if you don't answer the questions I asked. Can you share the name/website of this casino, and can you share a screenshot (or at least a direct copy and paste quote) of what they are asking for on their withdrawal page?",

Don't start multiple threads to solve the same problem. If you want to receive Bitcoin, you should use the Electrum wallet. This is a safe, non-custodial wallet. Get your Bitcoin here and spend it here. Web wallets are not a secure way to accept funds. Don't forget to keep your seed phrase secure and don't share it with anyone. Otherwise, you risk losing your money.",

Don't do that.withdrawing bitcoin - newbie - advice welcomeMetrobank....bitcoin?BLOCKCHAIN? and wheres the Hash?PUBLIC ACCOUNT NUMBER FOR WASABI WALLET - Newbie question..BLOCKCHAIN account- Newbie - how to get one?I think you are trying to cover too many different questions at once, which can make it difficult for others to follow the conversation and offer helpful responses. It might be more effective to focus on one topic at a time, especially since some members have already tried to assist you. This way, the discussion can stay organized and focused, making it easier for everyone to contribute and offer support.It might be a good idea to continue the discussion in one of your previous topics and lock all other topics. You can find the option to lock the topic in the lower left corner of the website.",

      "body": "Thanks dkbit for the reply but as so often the case it only serves to generate my asking a follow up question.Why, despite, being very very clear, can i not get a very simple answer to my problem.The casino ( irrelvant now at this stage to why/what/asking for ), is wanting an address, the simple line of code generated by the likes of Wasbie and Electron etc doesnt cut it.For THEIR withdrawals, they want an 'address'. So -how can i get what they are asking for.I have now mentioned several times on here, the casino sites, plenty of fish, fishy wins, midnightwins, hand of luck  - all using the same 'licence'  / the same 'site of games' - i suspect the licence is there and different providers use this licence..im guessing thats what happens.  SO - IF - anyone can shed light on how i go about getting what they are after for a withdrawal please don't be shy.  But if your asking more questions than giving answers then please, without appearing not grateful, but only causes me to post more  - to try and illustrate what i am after.As you can see, i dont know what i need to provide. I dont want to use bitcoin, i dont like it, hidden fees, messing about, but if its the only way i can get hold of my 'winnings' then i will have no choice but to try and claim in that way.  Regards to you all, and Happy New Year.",
