Realistically though, I would estimate the price to settle in the range of $0.1 to $0.5.I had to double check your math as i i haven't seem link for ages and didn't realize that link was as high as that in the marketcap. But your estimation checks out.I am not sure on what rate the supply is growing on this one, but if the airdrop is 900m tokens, and the marketcap is counted from circulating supply, then you only need $900m marketcap for this to have $1 per token. That would put Pyth on 52th place in the coinmarketcap. And from what i've read about this, it could easily happen.Naturally i am rooting for fraction of it as i wasn't eligible for the airdrop and i want to buy. I missed out because this was the first time i even heard about Pyth. There has been too many of them to keep track of, but i am interested now. But still i am not going to pay overvalued prices.",

I'm not aware how kucoin otc works, do you need kyc? Although the user was not required to undergo KYC, I have not yet provided them with an update regarding the recent change that transpired on KuCoin. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that KuCoin is highly regarded as a user-friendly exchange platform, especially in comparison to Binance. As long as you were not coming from the restricted country and you will be fine but i have my accounts have KYCed. The pre market is pretty much the same like IOU. The price may be different after it will be officially listed by the exchange site. This is also happening with TIA. The price when it enters exchange site was different compared with the pre market.",
