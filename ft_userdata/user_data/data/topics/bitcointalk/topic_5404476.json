  "content": "Nowadays there is a popular discussion about bear market, which started after BTC price declined in the end of 2021 and continued doing so in the 2022 till now (mid 2022). The question is simple: What do you think about the possibility that BTC will grow in 2022-2023 despite bear market predictions (some say it will take 4  year cycle, till 2024), and what would be the price of the growth?I am aware of the 4-cycle theory, but I think that due to the rise of metaverse, digital economy shall rise too (new economic tools designed specific for crypto-purposes, the in-stability on stock-markets due to different reasons: war, inflation, gas prices).If we are going to admit the 4-cycle theory as a basis for analysis, then bear market is on its rise and will last 3 and a half year (till 2025)But this 4-year cycle theory may not consider the rise of a) interest in digital assets, b) possible metavesre market spread, c) the rise of productive capacity due to digitilized world and so - the interest in digital sector of economyLet's discuss",

So that will be around April-May 2024, most likely give or take some months, then we will see some recovery. So bull cycle might start around that timeframe 2024 and not 2025. Not sure what you mean by this.QuoteBut this 4-year cycle theory may not consider the rise of a) interest in digital assets, b) possible metavesre market spread, c) the rise of productive capacity due to digitilized world and so - the interest in digital sector of economy Still rise base on the basic tenant of supply and demand.",

      "body": "Due to that logic the price of BTC depends percicely on what is happening only with BTC itself (trading, halfing, mining, alghorithm changes).But I'm also curious if we should take into account that other markets (stock market, global political enviroment) influence the crypto-currency marketFor example, when the situation in Kazahstan on New Year's Eve took place (country, where price of electricity is extremely low, so miners moved to that country from China), the price of BTC changed too (it fell significantly).So my question is - should we calculate the influence of such events as signigicant and which also shapes the price of BTC, or we should only calculate the inner logic of BTC (trading, halfing, mining, alghorithm changes)?",

Growth, solid growth.If you want to predict only one thing, let's skip price prediction but predict the survival of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. If they are all here to stay, price will grow in a way it should be. If you predict a positive future for it, you must ignore all rises and falls in short term and even in a few years. Let's imagine what your investment looks like after next 12 or 16 years.",

Thanks to all the money printing and free money that was distributed last year, the market is inflated now. This isn't the bottom yet. Expect another 30~40% dropoff in this year and the effect will resonate till the end of 2023. Bullish after Q3 2023This is my prediction",

Wars, gas and electricity prices, and a crisis in the economy show that we cannot predict the future with certainty. Therefore, the behavior of bitcoin, despite its past predictable growth after the halving, can also throw out a new trick.And of course, many people here want quick changes in Bitcoin prices in a positive direction, but all we can do is just guess and feel like analysts, whose forecasts will certainly come true, but no one knows the exact time.",

Last year I planned on selling my bitcoin savings before the start of 2022 and will just buy back in late 2023. But I haven't. I convinced myself that things might be different this time. We have El Salvador and maybe some more countries this year or in few years. Adoption is bigger than before. We also have web3 and NFTs which also started in the gaming industry. The current war in Ukraine and world crisis damage a lot of nations economies which lead to diminishing currency values and plummeting its stock markets. All of these make bitcoin becoming more viable and acceptable as a currency and as an investment.",

I personally don't think it's possible to predict that because the inflation is still rising in both US and EU, and there is no sign of slowing down. In fact there are signs that things could get worse.This soaring price of everything has effectively increased the amount of panic in all markets, consequently a lot of newbies are selling their bitcoins; some are selling to cover their bills and some to fill their bellies. On the other hand the other half are on the sidelines greedily waiting for the best price (which is the lowest price possible) to start buying bitcoin which is why the reversal has not happened yet. These people will continue waiting as long as the economy of the other half continues crashing.Of course some \"catalysts\" could change this trend by providing an incentive for those on the sidelines to jump in sooner.

There used to be no correlation between the two, but at some point big wall street players who made money on the rising indexes begun to invest more in risky assets. Before, bitcoin used to pump on its own, like in 2011 and 2013. There was no wall street in the space, no leveraged exchanges, no loan platforms and no stable coins, but there were bull and bear markets for bitcoin. They are still here just that they are started and ended by stocks because hedge funds have more money than normal bitcoin investors and can tip the scales if they want to and all the small players see that as an omen and follow. This is retarded if you ask me but it's how the market works. One or two big players overleverage and get in trouble due to some real world problems, like they get sued for something unrelated to bitcoin, or their company is battling a takeover and they sell a few thousand bitcoins. Suddenly all those who were leveraged get liquidated and seeing the big drop all those who were saving up to finally get 1 bitcoin also sell at a loss because something big hast to be happening with bitcoin for all those people to sell. Bear markets rarely have anything to do with bitcoin itself, but usually a lot with how confident or how scared investors are. Probably the only time it wasn't so was when Gox admitted they had no money because they got hacked and were lying to customers for months trying to raise money.",
