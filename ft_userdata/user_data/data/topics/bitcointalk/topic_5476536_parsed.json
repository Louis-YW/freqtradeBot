  "content": "I think I just made a new discovery. I repeat, \"I think\". This discovery won't help mankind fight off dinasores.  You can say it's useless discovery since it serves no purpose.All of us knows that, the forum is quite old. And the SMF version it uses is also quite old. So it has a lot of modern day features missing. As an example, modern day emojis. The forum does have some emojis, but not enough. Despite this, many users are using emojis. So how do they do it? I tried to check it by quoting what they wrote. And I found nothing, it was just a basic emoji.The \"discovery\" is that when you put in a modern day emoji and click preview, it won't show up in the preview section. But if you directly post it, The emoji will appear. I used to wonder why my emojis didn't appear. Because I would always check the preview before posting, I didn't realized that. I just thought something was broken from my side (until today). But now I know, it was always there, it just didn't show up.",

      "body": "Yes the format of the forum is quite old but it uses the HTML code for writing which equally means you can input all kind of emojis to the forum but it may not show in the preview but will show when posted because it in a HTML code. Here is an example:  If you can actually input the HTML code of the emoji then it will show when posted the only weird thing is why is it not showing in preview? Which I may not be able to answer.
