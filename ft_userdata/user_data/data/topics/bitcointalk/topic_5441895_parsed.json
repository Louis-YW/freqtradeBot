It means either working extra hours or learning new things, and why would you do that when you can sit and spend time in front of the TV?Therefore, investing is not only about desire, as we all want to become rich, but also about motivation, controlling to continue doing it, and this means that there is no extra money for vacations or luxury for some time.",

      "body": "I agree that the OP does not express himself well, but what he says is understood. When he talks about 'buy more money' he means to increase his income. I would summarise the issue in three points. How to increase capital?1) Adding more capital when you save more of your income, in later months, as Mahanton said.2) Make investments that are capital-enhancing in their own right, such as buying shares in good companies. Here we could consider buying bitcoin as something similar, because although the unit is the same (for example if you buy a bitcoin and keep it you will have the same bitcoin today as in 10 years), the capital understood as monetary energy will continue to increase over time, as people will continue to flee from fiat and put their savings in bitcoin due to its limited, autonomous and decentralised nature. 3) If you have yield-paying investments, such as dividends, rental income, etc., reinvest that yield.",

If you want to raise capital for a business then you need investors. Depending on how profitable the business is you might have no issues with that.",

Now I know that the way to increase capital investment is to invest money or capital. I've been in crypto for years, and I don't know this way. I'm really grateful OP. (sarcasm)The way to increase our capital investment is to just work, work, work, and work. Whether you're an employee, or a businessman or whatever it is, you just need to work if you want to increase your capital for investing. Anyway, what OP has said was really helpful.

      "body": "This could all be summed up as \"inject more money.\" If you have a business and you want to expand it or increase the capital, put more money into it. It's as simple as that. The how is the interesting thing to discuss.1. If you have a job, you can divert a portion of your salary to your business. 2. If you have savings, you can withdraw some of it and add it to your business' capital. 3. As you've said, you can also reinvest your business' profit. 4. You could also take a loan; that's another option. As a matter of fact, you can actually make use of your business as collateral. 5. Or you could also accept additional capital from investors. 6. You could also enter into partnerships, either with existing businesses or with a new one. 7. There is also the possibility of applying for a government or private grant.So there are a number of ways to increase capital. You just have to do some research and explore them.",

Likewise in the crypto space where everyone can use their fiat money to exchange it into crypto digital currency that is on the market. It's just why most people call it buying, it's because on average the exchange provides a buy button when someone wants to exchange their money into cryptocurrency coins.",

What about the case of exchange dollars to naira or other local currency by Muslim brothers that's points to aspect of buying in exchange but that's not my real point here, I made clear demarcation that buying money here could be as a form of savings depriving yourself luxury lifestyle in order to achieved a definite goal or investment, and this could come from friends, savings, jobs, collaterals and rents as case may be. They are exchange values and it's surely cost you money to obtain it.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

To increase income there will be the need to diversify our money into different areas so that income will keep coming whether we are physically present or notQuote from: JamesBorn on March 02, 2023, 08:00:54 PM* Invest More money or capitalCapital is money not in circulation. It is not in liquidity form and so it can be called unused money or yet to use money. Having capital without investing it only amount to savings and savings hardly bring proportional return or profit that accrues through bank percentage that amounts to nothing.. So for more capital to be guaranteed there should be investment of money.",

This can provide an opportunity for me so that the value of my investment will increase in time so if I can still invest regularly, it will provide big returns for me. And by having more sources of income, we can add capital to invest which can later make our investment value bigger.But this requires discipline because we will do it every day, week, or month, so we have to have notes that we can use as a reminder to keep investing.But if what you mean by investing money is a deposit in a bank, I don't think that can increase your money because you have to think about the costs that will cut your amount of money and interest. In addition, if the money you make a deposit is not too large, the amount you receive will not be large either. It is better for you to regularly invest in bitcoin so that the value of your money can increase in the future.",
