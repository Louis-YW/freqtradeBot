  "content": "Samourai Wallet has been taken down by the U.S. authorities: https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-and-ceo-cryptocurrency-mixing-service-arrested-and-charged-money-laundering. You can verify by opening samouraiwallet.com (it's under the authorities' control).Another privacy enhancing tool goes down the road. Apparently, the governments use everything in their disposal to undermine the users' privacy. Samourai team had recently announced that they were developing a decentralized version of whirlpool, using the Soroban network. It could be the case that they foresaw their own disappearance. Very frustrated. An important reminder and good quote is needed here.Quote from: satoshi>You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

I believe that in the future governments will not allow wallets to add or allow people to hold anonymity coins and that people will not kyc wallets and that wallets will operate without a license. This is because the governments' idea is that the same rules and laws that are applied to all financial services in the real world should also be applied to financial services on the internet.For many governments, they no longer want the internet to be a different world from the real world in which the laws and rules of the real world do not apply in the internet world. we just need to see that governments are regulating social networks. Nowadays, speaking badly about someone on social media is punished as if you had spoken badly about them in the real world. privacy on the internet is ending at the speed of light, whoever wants to survive on the internet will have to accept the rules and laws of governments",

Take for example, if Samourai Wallet was being designed by a black man somewhere in Africa and the platform was open to be used by anybody around the world (across other countries), can the government still shot it down?

They do not work alone. They work with other international agencies to do it. For example, in 2019, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) which is almost like the Feds in the US shut down a mixer. It is a collaborative effort. QuoteTake for example, if Samourai Wallet was being designed by a black man somewhere in Africa and the platform was open to be used by anybody around the world (across other countries), can the government still shot it down?

They can shut it down so long as they believe the platform is being used by the criminals they hate the most, such as those North Korean hackers, to \"launder\" money through it. it doesn't matter where the platform was created from or who created it. They will work so hard to sanction it and then probably seize it.Centralized platforms where the developers are not even anornymous are so prone to such a thing.",
