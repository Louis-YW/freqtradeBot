As they knows, Bitcoin is the right investments but if they don't have spare cash or a reserved funds and emergency funds it's very difficult for such investments to yield something very productive.",

There's nothing wrong to sell some part of your investment, but the volatility in Bitcoin is high, you might need money when the market in bear season.Even you've separate money for emergency funds, but not everyone have the same risk taker, they might not able to invest the rest of the money in Bitcoin.",

This is a wrong approach, instead people should consider keeping some money out of Bitcoin to support their basic needs and also have some extra for use when things comes up that may appear like emergency, this way they will not rush to withdraw their investment at the slightest problem.",

And when a significant price drop happens, the newbie investor is more likely to panic sell if he/she is \"all in\" than in the cases it's only some money that can stay blocked in bitcoin for years (until the price goes up again).Plus, as your example also wants to express, (bad) surprises do happen in life and a bit of backup never hurts.Sadly, in most cases, having money one affords to lose is just a dream. And in such cases it's difficult to impossible to invest.Sadly, in many cases, the lack of experience and the promise of easy money makes people make mistakes and lose money.And sadly, most of those susceptible to make this kind of mistakes will not see this, because they start reading after they get burned.",

It can't be considered a financial mistake if you ask me; I will only have to save up again from my salary to keep emergency funds ready so as not to sell my bitcoin off when there is not much profit due to unplanned expenses.",

Of course, when we talk about investing in Bitcoin, it’s better to keep your investments for at least two years. It was a mistake for a person to invest all their finances and end up without money for living expenses, and it doesn’t matter what amount we are talking about. Naturally, you should only invest a portion of your capital; this is a sensible approach to your finances for many reasons. It’s important to remember that you are solely responsible for your finances, and you should carefully calculate all the risks in advance. Wishing everyone good exchanges and investments!",

If I have $5k on my savings account, probably I would only invest $1k-$2k of it, so that if volatility happens, I won’t end up highly affected on it. There’s always high risk in any investment most particularly for volatile ones like bitcoin, that’s why once we decide to invest, we should not anticipate instant profits only but definitely even losses because that is highly possible in all investments. The key here is always invest when the right timing comes, or invest through DCA using your spare money that is not intended to pay your monthly bills.",

No one who buys Bitcoin with $5k ends up at a loss because Bitcoin constantly reaches new ATH's. What people need to learn is not to panic and sell their coins when they are at a loss. Bitcoin will eventually hit a new ATH anyway. Those who know how to wait will never lose in this market.Another issue is that people lose money by buying mostly shitcoins instead of Bitcoin. Altcoins don't move like Bitcoin. They are more volatile, have no guarantees, and don't necessarily hit new ATH's. People usually lose money by investing in altcoins, but blaming Bitcoin for that doesn't make sense because they are two different things. Their only common trait is being \"coins\".",
