Sivasspor won last year, we have seen teams such as Akhisarspor and Kayserispor become champions before.It is not easy to predict who will be the champion, but I have a feeling that Galatasaray will win this year. Fenerbahçe is playing very well too",

      "body": "There was a black and white two different halves. First half Beşiktaş started pretty good and found two goals, we thought they can keep this pace and score more but after that they could only find one more goal. Especially Redmond wasted clear chances. Especially in the second half, the team dropped out of the game. Players entered the mood of okay this match is over let's go home. They generously wasted very clear goal chances, made simple pass mistakes. Şenol Güneş put players on the field that must show their ability but I think a lot of them wasted this chance. I don't see them play in league games regularly with that attitude. Serik Belediyespor is a very small club, they play in second division. They couldn't even attack whole game but their only position became a goal. That show how lacking Ersin still is. He's mentally out of here. Beşiktaş should fix this goalkeeper problem as soon as possible. They passed fourth round easily but this is not an achievement.",

      "body": "We don't usually see surprising results in the first rounds of the tournament because there is a big power difference between the teams. These rounds are an opportunity for small teams to show themselves on national channels. I wish Beşiktaş win this tournament, but I have doubts as to whether the team cares enough about this tournament because in a time when we have a busy match schedule, the order of importance of the tournament may not be the main agenda item...",

There is no hard draw. Beşiktaş and Galatasaray's rivals are very weak, Fenerbahçe's rival is slightly better. But still these small teams cannot cope with the big ones. This round is unlikely to come as a surprise. Teams go to the last 16 and continue on their way. Big teams also want to win this trophy. I think that especially the teams falling behind in the league will give more importance to this cup.",

Pendik match was easy for them but it was clear that they took the match seriously. Antalyaspor did not let the opposing team breathe and pulled the plug in the first half with attacks from the flanks. Despite being victorious in the match they did not break the game discipline. They were concentrated and they could be the team that will see the final in the cup.",

But these matches are an opportunity to watch young football players. Because big clubs go to these matches with substitute players. They rotate the squad by giving the players who could not find the chance to play in the league an opportunity in the cup. For this reason, sometimes surprising results can occur in matches. My favorite in the cup is Galatasaray. Fenerbahçe and Trabzonspor are competing in the European cups. Galatasaray are a little bit luckier in my opinion.",

Some of the big teams will probably not play as a few key players have just returned from the cup, but I don't think it will affect the matches. Especially the teams that rotate frequently in the first rounds of the cup will go through without feeling the lack of these few players. When we look at the matches, the probability of surprises seems low. However, we may see some big teams being eliminated that didn't take the tournament seriously. For example, the rivals of Fenerbahçe and Trabzonspor are a little more difficult. But it wouldn't be a surprise if teams take the game seriously. These teams didn't have many players in the World Cup.",

Together with Şenol Güneş they give the appearance of a team that is closer to more goals and thinks of the attack. They will be strong against Şanlıurfaspor on offense. Şanlıurfaspor is fighting for the top of its league. In their last match, they unexpectedly lost to Afyonspor. They will look for a surprise against Beşiktaş. I think Şanlıurfaspor will try to balance the game in the midfield. Let's just say it's tough in this game. Beşiktaş will win this match with more than one goal.",

They probably won't have a very difficult match and they will win easily. But I'm not sure how many goals they will score. After all, the important thing is to pass the tour. It doesn't matter whether you score 1 goal or 10 goals. Fenerbahçe can idle the game after finding the score that will bring the tour. Because they will have a very important match in the league at the weekend. They will not use their main roster in this match and we will see many young players and rotation players. In this regard, handicap score and goal bets can be risky. Be careful when placing a bet.",
