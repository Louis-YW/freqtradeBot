Blackrock CEO warns of 'slow rolling crisis'Source : https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/15/larry-fink-blackrock-warning-silicon-valley-bank/11479410002/The funny thing is, back in 2008 the Banks were bailed out by the governments ...and now they are blaming the governments for their failure. I quote ==> \" Aggressive fiscal and monetary policy since the 2008 financial crisis has contributed to high levels of inflation not seen since the 1980s. “To fight this inflation, the Federal Reserve in the past year has raised rates nearly 500 basis points. This is one price we’re already paying for years of easy money – and was the first domino to drop,” Fink said.Yes, we all knew bailouts will only help for a few years and then the dominos of the Fiat system will start to drop. I hope people are seeing the signs and securing their wealth in decentralized (non-government controlled) technologies, like Bitcoin.  Let's discuss....",

      "body": "I guess you are mixing some points here, banks tend to benefit more during inflation as the central banks would be forced to increase interest rates which means more money for banks. The FED has been aggressive in hiking the Federal Funds Rate since late 2021, which is a measure to save US businesses including banks in order to attract investors through the attractiveness of stocks and equity markets.What happened to Silicon Valley is a different thing entirely, it only exposes some of the US banks and the level of the weakness of the banking sector. I believe it won't be business as usual for them onward.Mind you, decentralized investment can only thrive if too many people are not involved, or else the government will clamp down on it. Imagine a huge percentage of the world's investors turning to decentralized assets, it's certain that the world's economy will collapse.",

We don't need to go all the way with this. Make sure most of your money is secured somewhere like in a bank deposit box, since those aren't counted into bank's liabilities and as far as I know cannot be taken away in case of bankruptcy. I have some money on my account. It's less than 10% of all that I have, but I do it because it's convenient. If I had all my money at home in a vault, every time there's a bill to pay I'd have to drive to a nearest post office to pay it. The current system doesn't give you many options. You can say you won't use the bank but you'll either have to use another service like paypal or pay additional fees at the post office and waste your time and money getting there.",

A lot of banks do not offer this protection because they do riskier investments and Silicon Valley bank was one of the banks that provided riskier banks and that is why they have not been around as long as some other banks but it is why they are getting bailed out already. I know they have been around for multiple decades but they are not a secure bank when they offer risky loans to start up companies but every bank is risky and they are getting more risky with the living costs rising.",

Since the legalization of fractional reserve (which until the 19th century was illegal), institutions were made to give the ponzi scheme better footing.If the scheme fails in your branch, because people learned about it, a higher institution should exist where they can ask loans to keep the scheme going on. The Central Bank is meant to aid those banks, so in theory a bankrun should not affect a whole country. But said Central Bank also practices fractional reserve so, those guys formed the IMF and World Bank just in case with the capacity to aid those central banks.It was never about deposits. People should be aware of the danger of giving money to a bank, it is a loan, they only promise to pay it back when you want to withdraw.Just like any other scheme, when the people learn the truth and want out, it collapses. Imagine if your usual multi-level ponzi schemer had State backing, that's what banks are.The idea that a bank would just custody your money (for a fee), was pretty much abolished more than a century ago. Now they even pay you because they need the reserve which brings them a potential 10x increase in phantom money, aka credit expansion etc.Whats worse? Yes, exchanges are doing this as well... And \"stable\" tokens. Ponzi backed on ponzi backed on ponzi.",

QuoteIs your money safe? In the bank, it depends on the amounts, if you only have €1,000 (or dollars), nothing will happen. In case of bankruptcy or bailout or problems, people who have large amounts could lose a good part, but these people already know this and it is normal for them to diversify, although someone always ends up falling, as we have seen in the case of SVB.The point is that your money is safe because it is not in the bank. It's an entry in the bank's accounts that doesn't physically exist and that the bank has already lent out, that amount multiplied several times over, so it's all about trust and people not rushing in en masse to take out large sums of cash.As people use less and less cash, the latter is increasingly unlikely, and trust is already taken care of by governments and central banks to keep the ponzi system going.The curious thing is that within the swindle that it is, let's think that since 1971 the world has reached a great level of economic development, which was when Nixon abolished the convertibility of the dollar for gold.",

Actually if it happens slow enough (Bitcoin adoption, that is) it does give them time to shrink. So at the very least, there are too many banks and naturally many will have to go since the era has changed, its not the rule of fiat anymore.But if it happens product of some panic event, yeah many can go bankrupt at the same time overwhelming the capacity of the higher institutions to aid. Of course they will want the all mighty State to help, so you may end paying with your taxes (again) to keep the scheme running for a bit longer...",

      "body": "The main factor that has been running the banking system for decades now is trust. The trust customers have in the system that their money is safe and they can get it anytime they wish to withdraw which extends to trust in the fiscal policies that they come up with to give economies a boost, and boost the value of the money as well. That trust has been on thin ice from before the turn of this century and the more it wanes, the closer the banking system is to collapsing.This brings up the topic of alternatives, where else can we safely store our money where inflation and bad policies cannot get to it. Bitcoin? Precious metals? Real estate? Some other investment?My answer is a combination of all. We need to hold some percentage of fiat, and cannot throw our remaining assets into one box. Keeping a bit in Bitcoin and other bits in other investments we trust would give a healthy balance of diversification.- Jay -",

Although for me, the case with SVB failing, though a testament to how feeble the foundations of the banking system are, is an isolated case that isn't really indicative that the whole banking system is going to fail sooner or later, although it could cascade series of bank runs and collapses in the industry which could then lead to the collapse of the banking system. In any case, the economic crisis has been held on for too long it's finally seeping through the cracks of the barricades. Good thing crypto's still a thing otherwise a lot of us here are fucked royally like the collapse in 2008.",

So the interest and principal repayment of that loan is really eating the banks deep,  and most of them are collapsing into other banks and selling off their assets and shares just to avoid running bankruptcy.Some states are having a backlog of unpaid salaries due to the unavailability of funds due to loan repayments.",
