  "content": "Android, IOS and other phone OS might be going really extinct in the near future. There are really cutting edge technologies on the fly. This couple are retired Apple employees and they've come up with cutting edge technologies that reduces most manual handset approaches and incorporated AI to do almost all the hard work for us. Its called the Humane AI pin, a standalone Phone.Take a chilled drink, relax and watch where technology is heading tohttps://twitter.com/RealOlaudah/status/1726143000504381634?s=19",

Just imagine the high cost iPhones are selling in todays market. Well for those that can afford it let them buy it and enjoy it. But for me I would rather invest such a huge amount in Bitcoin. This device will definitely cost more than a thousand dollars, Just imagine investing such an amount in bitcoin and see the profitable it will be in the bull season that is coming. Those who can comfortably buy it can do so. But me as a bitcoin investor I won't do that.",

Well this is just a piece of information, I wanted is to have a glimpse of where technology is headed to and what the future holds for us and also as a means of encouraging everyone to stay innovative. There's still a lot of problems to be solved, and upgrades to be made on existing solution already in the market. Just stay innovative.For your info. The device isn't in the market already, its still being tested and the power its showcased. It'll be out in the near future. This is just to reawaken the minds of those whom think that these I phones are the ultimate technologies to relax cos something possibly greater is bring cooked up.The selling point of this technology is that it reduces the complexity of having to do your phone operation by yourself, it allows focus as only what you need at every point in time is given to you as feedback thereby reducing  distraction, its very fast in processing and you communicate to it just like another person.",

There's still a lot of problems to be solved, and upgrades to be made on existing solution already in the market. Just stay innovative.You are right, we don't have to feel relaxed about our accomplishments and thinking that we have arrived. At all point people have to be innovative and thinking of new ideas to solve problems. The moment you feel relaxed others working tirelessly to take you outside the market. I think this was exactly what happened to Nokia and other brands that where into phone manufacturing in the early 2000 they though they have conquered the market and felt relaxed and suddenly they were displaced. I like what you said here about being innovative in order to be relevant.QuoteFor your info. The device isn't in the market already, its still being tested and the power its showcased. It'll be out in the near future. This is just to reawaken the minds of those whom think that these I phones are the ultimate technologies to relax cos something possibly greater is bring cooked up.I was thinking that the phone was already on sale. I have always been convinced that there will be greater technologies that will dislodge iPhones. It's just so sad that am not the one that who has developed such a technology.  as long as human race continue there will always be more and more emerging technologies. Hopefully the coming bullrun will give me the money to buy the phone when it is lunch in the market. Who doesn't like the good life? QuoteThe selling point of this technology is that it reduces the complexity of having to do your phone operation by yourself, it allows focus as only what you need at every point in time is given to you as feedback thereby reducing  distraction, its very fast in processing and you communicate to it just like another person.Watching that demo I already fell in love with that phone honestly speaking. Now I have to make sure I invest more on bitcoin so I can make enough money after the bitcoin halving to be able to afford such phone. #NFA",

      "body": "This generational technology is getting out of hand. Anything related to cutting edge is also related to AI. They are moving together both in software and app. The edge browser that I am using comes with AI auto men, the browser sweet die. Every function in that browser is modernize. And it is very fast. And as op said AI is inbuilt in the browser. Yes with this new technology that is coming Android and other phone operating system will fade out. Me personally I promised myself that I will not use iPhone because the phone is useless for me.The new direction where this technology is going is very high that everything is going to be easy and fast in their usages. I have not seen this king of technology. I am suspecting that it is the 5G network technology is that taken place now.",

The main issues with us is that there is little or no motivation to think innovative and develop outstanding things like this. Now, Even If you are innovative enough and get to create good designs of systems to build, you find out that access to funding is not an easy task cos the government agencies whom should be on the lookout for things of this nature have turned and blind eyes to its existence. Believe me, this project has a lot of sponsors, both government and private sponsors alike, they encourage innovation over there and that's why it looks as though they're awake and we're asleep. I have friends who are embedded system programmers and we've often discussed ideas in our mastermind group and believe me, these ideas are great but it requires funding to try them out and these funds are what we don't have at the moment to try out these innovations. I'm sure there are others in that predicament who abandon their dreams cos of lack of sponsorship.  If there is a change of government or the present government focuses on innovations and encouraging startups with quality vision and makes funds readily available to the many inventors in this country, brother the result will surpass every rational expectation. We have great minds in this country, na machinery and motivation we dey lack. I heard recently that  a young man built his own local G-wagon , returned to his village with it and was celebrated by his villagers only. Such human resources should drive more recognition and investment into his talent.",

Omor I just dey watch the video, this technology na blast, the most interesting part na the response time wey e take dey carry out activities, with this technology alone the language barrier between nations go break and we go experience very easy and smooth trading Internationally. I like the way wey you dey talk good about our country, actually Nigeria get very innovative set of citizens but we nor dey fit get sponsors as you talk, I don see many citizens of this country wey dey produce some kind things wey if government put body dem fit make am very big investment for the future, I even get friend wey dey into producing ai house lighting control. Meaning say you go fit use you phone WiFi take connect to control the light wey dey your house, both fan and any other thing wey dey use voltage. And apart from that one e don still create camera wey na WiFi e take dey connect with your smart phone to take control the movement and you dey still the get view from the camera through the WiFi connect, so many things wey this guy don do, but if em just get single spike of sponsor I believe say na world class e dey go so.Though I don see some aba boys(Nigeria phone repairers) wey don clone phone before, if you on iPhone e go dey show you vivo or any other android OS. But I no support the fact say dem fit make this kind of technology, because wattin you dey see there so na the work of micro chip wey contain more than 1 million components for just one small chip. I no sure say we don reach that level wey you dey hype us dey go so. And that na just the physical building part, how about the level of programming wey dem use, though we still get guru dem for the programming lifestyle but the hype no suppose reach that level.",
