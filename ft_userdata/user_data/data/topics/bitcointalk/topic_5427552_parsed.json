  "content": "So who and when Will fund ftx consumers ?What's the plan with FTX ? Too many famous people endorced this project Will they really ruin up their reputation like scammers ??Off course poor people cant do too much but wealthy ones invested also in there. FTX will make people asking can they trust their leaders ?Soft way is just goverment or Banks bail out ftx that's it.I belive they bail out FTX and crypto reputation Will be good again and people Will trust goverment again.I dont think those celebrities who endorced FTX want to lose their reputation and followers.Western society is soft and no extremes not usual we have soft society and money printer brrrrr.. so likely i see bail out and crypto is trusted again.I did not invested anything in there but If i did i would find the owner and havimg talk like this:\" look men i transfered from my wallet in your wallet so give money back\" This kind of talking i will do with every exchangers If they gona try to be smart.My dad use to say dont hold debt pay your debt always fast so Same advice to FTX team pay your debt right time.Anyways Sam bankman can go to jail If not paying back money.I think FTX case IS good example for other crimimals do not steal",

The scenario your father painted to you isn't the same as what transpired in the FTX case. Owing debt and incurring losses from business investments aren't the same thing as taking a loan from someone and not being able to repay it. That's a debt while the other is \"investment gone wrong\" You can't blame anyone if what you invested in goes awry. You only have yourself to blame. In this case, everyone who invested in the SBF exchange FTX should take responsibility for their actions. Crypto is unregulated.Quote from: mk4 on December 10, 2022, 04:00:30 AMif anything, I'm pretty sure they'd want to see this industry burn to the ground.But of course, that's an obvious fact; knowing how the government supports bad press against the crypto industry. Anyone thinking government would do otherwise is a newcomer to this game.",

Those who lose their money in FTT will have no choice but to agree with the idea. We don't know maybe this will work this time.For it to be effective, the FTX team may need to provide liquidity right after they distribute the new FTT tokens to those who deserve it and those people have the choice if they want to sell their tokens right away or if they will wait more for it to pump but for me I think I will sell it right away to cover some of my losses and will just invest in a more safer crypto.",

Bank bailout or government bailout is out of the options available to customers to look for possible resolution since investors have always been warned to avoid cryptocurrency investment because of the risk associated with such investments and that is why countries don't list cryptocurrency among the securities and asset policies. So the bank is a centralized financial institution that will not get involved in this and considering the amount involved in the FTX scam only a few banks have such reserve to settle the balance if their ever attempt to.2. Token issuance is not also good advice, and we have seen a fallout of such action with luna where the token luna classic was created by the developer to recover the crashed Luna but up till now version 2 has become a shitcoin also with no positive growth. So token issuance is also not a good idea.",

They can't even return the damages to the users so it doesn't make sense to ask if they'll still have a trust on them.
