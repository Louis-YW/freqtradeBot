One of the main ones is that who would want to connect their wallet to some unknown site that's most likely aimed to drain wallets?I like the concept and the art but not in a million years i will connect my metamask to buy from your web page. You have to earn your trust before people do that.",

Will upgrade this week. Do you have any good ideas where we could do ICO since we already launched the sale on our website?We can give up to 30% commission for any 'marketing' help without a problem.Regarding connecting the wallet to our website i still don't understand the issue, i mean how could we take anything if you connect the wallet if we only have 'view and transactions to approve' connect option? I don't think it's even possible for us to 'take' or do anything with anyones wallet that way.If you have any good ideas regarding how we could grow faster, kindly DM me, i'd appreciate good tips and any help we can get.",
