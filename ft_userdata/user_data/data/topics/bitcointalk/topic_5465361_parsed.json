AFAIK, this site is even more accurate compared with CMC. It is also friendly users. You can also configure the layout easily, like what you wanted. https://cryptorank.io/I have also used another site like https://dropstab.com/It gives you the easiest to track the price history of your crypto.

I usually check top coins for prices so those are enough for me, most of them usually date back to when the coin was made though I never really checked all of them since, well, I had no need to. I usually just check monthly/yearly price changes to see the general trend.

As Jossiel said, you can use https://www.tradingview.com/chart/. Not all data will be available in the free plan though, you'll need to upgrade your membership to access it.Here's one example for DASH/USDT price in Binance at 8 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, January 3, 2022, using a paid TradingView account.Or if you want to do it freely just use exchange data directly. AFAIK you can access all-time price data from the chart in the Binance dashboard. The drawback of this method is there's only that specific exchange data, e.g. Binance data, as opposed to all markets when you use a service like TradingView.",
