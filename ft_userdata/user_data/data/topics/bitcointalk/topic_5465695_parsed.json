  "content": "Vitalik Buterin has sold his remaining 500 MakerDAO tokens, earning approximately $578,000, while MakerDAO considers a move to Solana-based NewChain. This sale marks a 27% gain on the tokens he divested. He initially acquired 1,071 MKR tokens in April 2018 when their price was $905 each.Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/vitalik-buterin-sells-remaining-makerdao-tokens-worth-dollar578k-as-project-considers-solana-based-newchainHow do you think the move to Solana-based NewChain will impact MakerDAO?Vitalik Buterin is a smart man, and Solana has had many, many tech issues. He knows that MakerDAO is doomed to fail on Solana-based NewChain. He sold his MKR tokens before they become worthless.Or maybe he's just bitter since MakerDAO left Ethereum for Solana. Bullish for Solana, if they can handle it.",

But maybe they are just going to create this drama and introduce some speculations in order for it to be talked about. Having been able to sell it at a high price still is a great thing. Maybe they are just seeing the potential in Solana. I think time will be the one to be seen if it's better to be in the ETH chain or SOL chain.",

I never had it, so I can't say much about getting out, like if you have some right now and you want to get out then I can't talk about that, it would not be right and that would be a wrong mistake.But, if we are talking about a situation where it is going to be a tough thing, then you should just simply do it yourself if you want to and that would be a lot better on the approach. I agree that it is a tough business without saying much about it. I agree that it is tough and that is why you should be careful about it as well. Getting out and not getting in are different things, I suggest not getting in, I can't talk about getting out.",

Oh well, he is not Satoshi but he is like any other greedy developers who mostly care about the money more than everything. About donating, I think this is true, but if I'm not mistaken, he directly donated ETH.Vitalik can also be considered as an expert because he invented the second biggest crypto and copying the strategy that he is making is not a problem. It was actually a good strategy, selling your useless cryptos before they dump hard and use the money on a much better coin. ETH is clogged and so as Bitcoin because we are still in the bear. ETH have undergone a lot of tweaks but it is seem hard to change it drastically so their decision of making a new blockchain can be a better solution to help solve the existing issues here in crypto.",

They can either try and give MKR more value or add a legal wrapper to their DAO using Q Blockchain's DAO Factory or Kali wrappr. 2 solutions, code is law or beyond code is law. My bet is on beyond code is law because the value of the governance token will never be enough to backstop a potential governance attack when there are billions of dollars in circulating DAI.",
