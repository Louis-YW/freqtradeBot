  "content": "Like most new generation forum users(those who joined after the Merits rule), I was eager to find out a way to find new topics to write on. I am sure many of us would agree with what I wrote, as my anxiety level was going up. I asked Chat GPT-3 to help me, but the result was not that satisfactory. Still, it was helpful to an extent and this is why I am sharing it. Anyone here who wants to grow up then this topic is for you.It suggested I work on 7 topics on which I need to work on. I am sharing it as I want everyone to work on these topics if they want to rank up. Code:Sure, here are a few topics that you can write about on Bitcointalk forum to potentially earn sMerits:1. Cryptocurrency News and Updates: Share the latest news and updates on various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more. You can also discuss the impact of current events on the crypto market.2. Trading and Investing: Share your thoughts on trading and investing strategies, technical analysis, and market trends. You can also offer advice on how to get started in cryptocurrency trading.3. Blockchain Technology: Discuss the technology behind blockchain, its uses, and potential applications in various industries.4. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Talk about the various DeFi projects, their potential, and their challenges. You can also discuss the role of DeFi in the future of finance.5. Cryptocurrency Regulations: Discuss the current regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and the potential impact of new regulations on the industry.6. Cryptocurrency Wallets and Security: Share your thoughts on various cryptocurrency wallets, their features, and how to keep your cryptocurrency safe and secure.7. Mining: Discuss the process of cryptocurrency mining, its profitability, and how to get started with miningRemember that to earn merits, your post should be informative, insightful, and add value to the discussion.  The end statement made me realize that everything is not that easy. You still need to do a lot of research before creating any topics to earn merits. I think if you use this AI in the correct way it will help you a lot. Treating it as a ghost writer will only get you into more trouble here. Thanks.",

Is not by asking AI; even most of the answers you got from that AI were insights the AI collected on some topics from this forum and other sources on the internet. Why do you think this will be able to help any member? I disagree that it would, for those who are already making good posts and have collected some merit from their topics and other comments can still earn more merit in the future if they really devote time to searching and creating some useful topics in this forum. Also, those who have not created any useful topics can only explore the AI and do some copy and paste from some articles they may find on the internet, for which they may not even earn any merit.",

We are humans and we can do better than chatGpt especially in discussions and creating relevant topics that are important in the forum. Another thing is this,if you are not smart,you can use Chat GPT because you will believe that it has given you all the best results of your question which is a lie. The dumb ones copy and paste it here ,while the smart ones make research on the information to have a concrete knowledge on it. Human brains is the best in discussions and contributions on a thread or topic. A bot shouldn't teach you how to earn merits when you are active in the forum, you should know how.",

Again I am very sorry if I have hurt anyone. You are looking at things from a completely wrong angle when it comes to airdropped merits. It is true that some (and I am among them) reached their current ranks before the merits system, but many of us justified airdropped merits by \"earning\" several thousand merits since then, which means that looking back, many of us would have reached our ranks if the merit system had existed before 2018.I understand that Chat GPT is a hot topic and everyone is talking about it and wants to use it for something, but that tool will not help you to be a member who will \"earn\" a lot of merits. In addition, what you received as a suggestion are not exactly topics that anyone can manage - you need to have the right knowledge to participate in discussions regarding mining, blockchain, wallet security, trading...",

You’re probably not familiar with o_e_l_e_o posts maybe because you don’t post in the same board as he does. I assume you just looked at his date of registration and believe all his merits were airdropped. If you look at his merit history in the last 120 days, you will find that it’s more than enough to be legendary rank. I’m not going to say getting merits is easy, there are lots of reasons why that is so and you can find those threads on meta. But I wouldn’t encourage newbies and people who want to rank up to solicit the use of AI.",
