  "content": "Hello. I hope this is the appropriate place to post this question.I am in need of a high volume API that I can call on to provide crypto/fiat prices. Free is preferable, but crypto payments would work.Obviously many onion network-based services have this. Can anyone point me to which APIs people are using for this? Not for anything shady.Please send me a message if you would rather do that then post it publicly.Thank you for your time.",

Free is preferable, but crypto payments would work.I only knew of one API with an onion service, but the following alternatives might come in handy:Blockchair's API - You can use their free plan for a few days with a limit of 1,000 calls per day.- For some reason, the API section of their onion services has some issues.CoinGecko's API - Their free plan comes with a limit of 30 calls per minute [monthly cap is at 10,000 calls].CoinMarketCap's API - 10,000 monthly calls on their free plan.CoinPaprika's API - 20,000 monthly calls on their free plan.CoinLore's API - No limits, but they recommend one call per second.Coinranking's API - 5,000 monthly calls on their free plan.Note: I prefer not to vouch, so DYOR.",
