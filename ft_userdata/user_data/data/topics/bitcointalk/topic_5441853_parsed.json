  "content": "I’ve been observing my gambling activity result since the start of the year and trying different way to improve my gambling results. I always allocate 100$ per week on my gambling since I’m using my signature campaign earnings from livecasino. Here’s my observation on my experience when using different bankroll.Bulk BankrollI always start playing 5$ bet on Blackjack then add seat if I’m lose my initial so that I can recover my lose and have a profit at the same time. I always manage to get 50$ to 60$ profit then after reaching this percentage profit, It makes me very hard to win more because I keep aiming to earn atleast 100$ profit to have x2 of my initial bankroll to stop. The ending result is always losing all my balance including profit the moment I experienced losing streak because I keep increasing my bet up to the point to all in just to recover quickly my lose since I’m thinking that I already got the opportunity to have 160$ which is why betting 60$ or more on single bet when my balance decreases is a little bit easy.In short, I’m easily become greedy and careless on bet once my bankroll went down below my initial bank roll.Partial BankrollWhen I using this type of bankroll I’m always winning around 80% win chance rate when I check my history. This time I use 20$ bank roll and start on craps betting 1$ to 2$ on easy and hard ways. I keep doing this patiently until I double my money to 40$. After reaching 40$ mark I usually sit on Blackjack table betting 5$ on single table. I keep doing slow grind without increasing bet. I notice that I’m more cautious whenever I’m using small bankroll because I know that I can’t bet carelessly or else the game will easily over.I’ve been doing this for months and I usually get 80$ to 100$ in profit. But of course this profit is just for recovering loss from my previous game when I use bulk bankroll. This happened to multiple times and I’m finally getting my phase on making good profit.I know we have different style and behavior. Some people might be lucky on bulk bankroll and others is like me who’s lucky on small bankroll. What do you guys use?",

      "body": "Partial works well on me, I'd say better than bulk aside from the fact that i cannot afford buring that much on a single roll. Bulk bankroll indeed will generate bigger profit; higher risk means higher reward. But question is; how long would your capital last? On my case, partial bankrolls allow me to extend my capital to few more bets than it was supposed to. If you have a large capital, and if you are really down of embracing the risk, bulk could work on such instance. At the end of the day, it would be one's fate to determine the outcome. If you are really unlucky for that day, no matter what strategy you will use, you'd end up with loss; will only vary whether it would be big or tolerable.",

Some people might be lucky on bulk bankroll and others is like me who’s lucky on small bankroll. What do you guys use?In my opinion, your bulk bank roll strategy in relation to playing blackjack is a mess. I would never do a Martingale strat when playing Blackjack, why? Because I feel that it does not have enough relevance to your previous bets. For the partial bankroll, I also win little by little when I do that. There is a time when I managed to make my $50 become $1300, all from playing slots.",

      "body": "8n almost all logical circumstances you are always implored by the system to play partial bankroll instead of busting your balls on a bulk bankroll. Bulk's high risk, high reward, but in a game that is already risky for the most pwrt, this just puts unnecessary strain and pressure to the player which they otherwise wouldb't have to deal if they hadn't gone bulk. Plus at the same time, bulk minimises your playtime which therefore limits how many wins you can get in comparison to Partial bankrolls. Personally, I prefer partial bankrolls instead of bulk as it's so much better in many ways, but if I'm feeling ballsy and lucky, I tend to go bulk just for the hell of it.",

Hunches, feelings and everything else although adding to the fun and possibility of 'I made a great call' feeling can never survive the long term math and odds.The math will never change no matter what you do, well in the physical world marking cards and slipping an extra ace in the deck might, but beyond that it does not matter.Yeah, it's boring and playing hunches and going with your gut is more fun. Don't forget that, it's fun not a way to make money. The math says the house wins.-Dave",

      "body": "Appreciate all the reply above. I will not quote you individually because I might just repeat all the answer at once.Partial Bankroll is indeed the best because you can slow grind. My only problem problem with this is my short tempered especially if I’m not getting any win on my game despite I’m playing too long. I experience one my game that it took about half an hour which I just breakeven at the end without giving me a chance to be on the profit side.  I recently watch stream of trainwreck about playing blackjack that’s same to my scenario above. He plays an hour and in profit about 1M USD atthe beginning of his game then his bank roll decreases near his initial bankroll after an hour of slow playing.You can watch the exhilarating video here: https://youtu.be/1qe7Pb3-iDo",

The one being discussed here is player bankroll when playing in the casino!Bulk bankroll is the best if you are playing with consistency and patience because you can save time by deposit and withdraw. The only reason why people always lose on using huge bankroll because they are too easy to become tilted when losing that cause them to bet above normal bets. I’m playing huge bank as always and I’m always getting huge profit because I can have a higher life line to extend my bet compared of having 20$ bankroll and loss it all with just a short lose streak. It’s just same if you have huge bankroll and play it slowly.",

What do you guys use?If you're talking about a blackjack bankroll and just sitting down to hit and want to win a few hands, sure I don't have to think too much for a big bankroll, just $50 by targeting a $5 table, with a small bankroll I'm not too bothered to think about the risk of losing my money in a blackjack bet, because I know any type of gambling is luck.For sure even though I use a small bankroll and risk I will try to play with strategy and do my best, To overcome the possible risk of losing streaks in blackjack betting, the house edge is clearly one of the calculations.For example:Code:0.005 x $5 x 50 Hands per hour : $1.25 loss per hour.So with my small bankroll at stake, if I get really unlucky at blackjack betting, I'm only wasting $1.25 an hour a week just $50 my loss, that's my unlucky count, but I can still make a profit and cover the losses for now on blackjack betting.",

It's the standard idea of the greater the risk the greater the profit, but the lower the risk the lower the profit. The first one pretty much gives you a chance of winning big in a short time while the latter goes slow and steady. Either way they both have their pros and cons, and I mostly don't mind them now that I think about it. I mostly go mixed, whatever way I like it on that session really, mostly partial though since I like to play crash slowly (which was my go to game when I often play, I'm into sports gambling right now).",

Perhaps, sticking with the lower budget is your key to winning, I suggest just keep doing it. It's not about the amount, it's how you will secure every bet that you take.
