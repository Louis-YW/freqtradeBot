Why a Bitcoin node should be validing a transaction honestly ? I mean, if I understand correctly, there are the miners who create the new blocs and the nodes who verify the transactions. But why should a node be honest ? What's the rewards for that ? Are all the nodes receiving a tiny fraction of the bitcoins which afterwards come to the miner's pocket or something similar ? Thank you for your attention.",

Are all the nodes receiving a tiny fraction of the bitcoins which afterwards come to the miner's pocket or something similar ? Thank you for your attention.Let's say some nodes are not honest. What can they gain from that? Nothing.The miners must be connected to honest nodes because if they don't they may get the mined block rejected by the others and lose the block rewards.Since the miners are connected to honest nodes, even if some rogue nodes will try to propagate bad transactions, the miners' nodes will reject those.Keep in mind that each node has its own mempool.",

In Bitcoin if you want to have the maximum level of security, highest possible privacy and beware of the network situation (possible chain splits, vote for protocol changes, etc.) you need to run a full node.The miners run their own nodes or connect to a pool that runs the full node. Since all full nodes verify everything themselves they don't worry about other nodes being dishonest because anything invalid would be rejected by them and the violating node's IP address would be banned. Nodes also don't have to be honest, but being dishonest doesn't benefit them either.",

So basically, dishonest nodes are not really a problem as long as it exists honest nodes and full nodes to verify the transactions.But then is it possible to corrupt the blockchain by having a majority of dishonest nodes and full nodes ? I see there are currently about 14 000 bitcoin nodes, would it be possible for a governement or other entity to create let's say 15 000 nodes (including full nodes) and then corrupt the network this way ?",

Not with nodes no. Nodes are designed to sync to a chain that has the highest height (number of blocks) and highest difficulty.This could be possible to do with miners (known as a 51% attack) but:1. No ones voting in favour of losing money, they'd just switch chains/become incompatible with the \"corrupted one\".2. It becomes exponentially more difficult to remove blocks further down the chain - an attack probably wouldn't bother or wouldn't get far.3. The country that invested into this would lose money potentially by making their mining equipment worthless if the coin changes algorithm (especially if another government(s) that is against the original attacker can quickly roll out new chips/miners to prove a point).",

This allows an attacking node that tries to replace previous blocks in the blockchain to benefit them financially because the transactions are cryptographically signed, an attacker can only make one of his own transactions. One can try to convert so that he can get back the money he recently spent. So it is important to have honest node in system",

A bogus node can get lucky and, at great expenses, validate a double spend but it would be caught and rejected with the next block. That is why transactions aren't generally considered durable until six confirmations. At that point, it is infinitesimally unlikely that a bad actor would have been able to validate six blocks in a row.",

It is why Bitcoin is very healthy with too high hashrate and many full nodes globally.Its network is really decentralized globally. To compromise Bitcoin network, it is impossible, from expensive cost to own at least 51% of network hashrate to successfully mislead many full nodes. With auto detection tools from developers and full nodes, any strange attempt to attack Bitcoin network will be recognized shortly. It is different than altcoin networks that have much lower hashrate, very centralized and bad mechanisms to detect suspicious attack attempt.Do you know Axie Ininity only recognized a hack on their ecosystem after a few days?Axie Infinityâ€™s Ronin Network Suffers $625M Exploit",

(rather than the altcoin)regular users want to be on the chain of blocks that is most valid and accepted with the majority of the network so that they can spend/receive their funds with other users direct or spend/receive funds through main merchants. where the symbiosis is everyone collectively wants a good clean chain that everyone follows rather then altcoins with their individual flaws, faults and issues",

Not by only running a lot of nodes and it won't be easy at all.For example Sybil Attack could be combined with some extra steps to perform a special attack. If the attacked successfully fills all the victim's node's connection slots they can prevent its connection to the real network. Then if the attacker has some hashrate they can replace the victim's chain tip and mine a block or two on top of that fake chain. Since the victim is cut off from the network they won't know that they are on a much shorter chain.But Sybil attack itself is almost impossible to pull off since nodes initiate connection to other peers and choose random IPs in a way that they are far from each other. In other words the victim could still find a way to the network and realize that they are on an stale chain and fix it. Not to mention that the network disruption would be obvious since it takes attacker a lot longer to produce blocks (eg. 1 block every couple of hours).",
