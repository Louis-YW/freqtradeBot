Now think, how many go out richer from a casino?So you've got hooked to gamble under somebody's ref link. You were amongst the vast majority who's losing in this kind of games. You're amongst the hopefully few who failed to understand that a casino is not charity (and definitely not a money prinitng machine) and you should gamble for fun, not to earn money.Now, if you'll try to recover those money, the chances are bigger you lose even more. So, if you don't plan to just play small amounts you afford, for having fun, you better give up \"earning from hi-lo games\" and find yourself more lucrative ways to earn money. Kinda expensive way to learn, you could have been asking first, you would have gotten this lesson for free...",

Thanks for sharing that @seoincorporation. I've been like curious on how a dynamic server works and how provably fair matters: I stumble upon this article here: https://medium.com/@f5.works/introduction-to-provably-fair-f039e241aa2a and more likely it explains here how provably fair really should work, I really like the example here more like ELI5 kind of stuff.

You are surprised about the losses that you are getting but you didn't feel the same when your first roll wins?  Maybe not since it was only 10x anyway, not 100x or more multiplier. It's been a long time since my last win on this site and also on stake.I know that both sites are legit but sometimes I can't help it and think that maybe their fairness have changed. Oh well, maybe it's only just my imagination. I am also gambling rarely now, maybe that's the cause on why I can't win anymore but maybe if I gamble more actively, my chance will greatly increase.",

We also don't know if you are going to change the client seed or not. Both of those things mean that if we tried to anticipate then someone would work out when we would do it and they'd be guaranteed to win.Some small sites use a static server seed but you're right that it would be impossible on a site this large. The \"computing resources\" more specifically disk space required would be astronomical and make the site financially unviable. Most people won't even know what it is and will never reveal their server seed at all meaning would have to store all their rolls for eternity. With over 135 billion rolls so far that would be infeasible. It's also completely pointless. Both systems perform the function of being provable fair meaning that every player has the opportunity to prove if we cheated or not to themselves. Changing the system just because a handful of customers have a preference isn't a good idea.
