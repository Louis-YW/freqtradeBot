Use it to calculate the total amount of fee that will be deducted from you in each trade. I have noticed this before. Let me make you a good example You have $5000 that you are trading withTrading fee is 0.1%The fee that will be deducted from $5000 = $5000 x 0.1 ÷ 100                                                                          = $5Assuming you have $3 profit already, once you close the position or converted back to a stable coin, $5 is deducted as fee. So it would be $5000 + $3 (profit) - $5 (fee) = $4998Remember that you are also charged for opening a position, or when you converted to an unstable coin for profit.$4998 -$5 (used to open position or used to first convert to unstable coin for profit) = $4993. Your $5000 would become $4993 after making $3 profit.Likely this is caused by trading with too much amount of money and you want to close the trade very fast because of fear not to lose. Trade with the amount of money you can afford to lose and make more profit that would be more than the trading fee deducted before closing the trade. Quote from: jackg on September 05, 2022, 11:12:59 PMI thought it was only spot trades that were fee free?It depends on the exchange. Spot, margin or future trading can have no fee, but there can be some tasks attached to it. Some can even be in form of rebate, in a way you will trade and earn some amount, instead of deducting fee, but those are for VIP on most exchanges.",

There's nothing you should lose upon doing scalp trades if you're at win most of the time. IMO, the fees per trade you make don't really hurt that much if they're just a couple of cents.

Do you mean Trading in the Spot market on Binance? not the future market, right?Trading in the Spot market does have a lower risk compared to other types of trading activities. But that does not mean zero risk, yes. And in this case, it seems that on Binance there are still trading fees, but they are quite small, around 0.1% (see: Fee Rate. But indeed here we can really set at what rate we want to get profits even in a period of time that we ourselves cannot predict exactly at all. But at least we can also install SL/CL to minimize a lot of losses because after all we still have to rotate the money for other trading activities.",

It makes sense to put stop losses only when the price is already beyond the channel boundaries or breaks some kind of formation. Putting a stop loss in the same place where you opened the trade is like shooting yourself in the foot. Absolutely illiterate risk management.Setting of stop loss just close to entry price is risky. Following from what @ Ratimov said, putting sl at trend areas or at the trend means price can easily retest those points and take you out easily for loss. I suggest that sl are better behind support or resistance. Support and resistance are strong areas that are not easily broken instead of placing sl at close to entry or at the middle of trade. Learn to use stop loss behind support and resistance.",
