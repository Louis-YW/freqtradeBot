You would need 2 PCs to completely make an offline transaction, one PC should be connected online while another PC is offline where you can sign a transaction.",

      "body": "As BitMaxz says, turning off your internet for a few seconds just while you sign the transaction and then immediately reconnecting achieves nothing. The whole point of a good hardware wallet is to protect against any attacks from the internet. If you don't want your Nano X connected to any device with an internet connection, then you will need a second computer which is permanently airgapped.After downloading, verifying, and installing Electrum on both devices, you would connect your Nano X to your airgapped device and link it with Electrum to create or restore or your wallet. You would then take the master public key from that wallet across to your online computer and create a watch only wallet in Electrum. You would use the watch only wallet to create a transaction, move it to the airgapped computer, plug in your Nano X to sign it on the airgapped computer, and then move the now signed transaction back to the online computer for broadcasting.Alternatively, you could buy a hardare wallet which is already permanently airgapped, such as a Passport.",

How does he manage to be here and there?",
