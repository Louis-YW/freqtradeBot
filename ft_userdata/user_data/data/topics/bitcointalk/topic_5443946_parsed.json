Are you taking into consideration whether the transaction fee is more affordable compared to other channels?Yes, transaction fees are affordable on BP Bulk Sender, and fees vary from one network to another. I tried the BSC test net and sent some amounts of BNB to many wallets, the process was smooth, and they cut a few fees.For how the transaction process works:After that, you will find that the transaction has been completed, and the batch hash has appeared.Really a great tool. Thanks, @irfan_pak10. I will always use it, and it will be a really useful tool for bounty managers for those who find it challenging to distribute coins to thousands of wallet addresses of participants with reasonable fees; I hope this tool will support more networks in the future.",

Thank you for your kind words. I would greatly appreciate it if you could test out this dApp. I am also happy to hear if your client uses our website. Unfortunately, ERC20 gas fees cannot be reduced through bulk sending, but I can ask my development team to add a feature to the UI that indicates the best time to use ERC20 bulk sending. In addition to the gas fees, we charge a small fee of $0.03 per wallet.There is no limit to the number of transactions you can make, and we automatically process batches of 200 addresses. We have taken great care to ensure that our system is secure and safe, but we recommend starting with a smaller number of addresses, such as 10-20, and gradually increasing the number as you become more comfortable with the process. I will need to confirm your last question with my development team.Thank you.",

Could you share with us the contract address for the smart contract your platform is using? Making it public so that everyone can see and check it before connecting to your platform would give us users fewer worries.2. Did you guys build this from the ground up or was it forked from a similar open-source tool like Disperse?3. How much are the fees when using this tool? I've seen plenty of similar platforms that require a hefty amount of service fee when using their dApp which is pretty annoying.Lastly, could you guys also deploy it on Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Fantom? That would be nice.",

You approve them a permission via their smart contract and then you send the tokens to the destinations addresses. @irfan_pak10, good job buddy. Good to see a service provided by a known community members. I used to use coin98 but now I have a choice. I will defiantly recommend it to my clients.  Is there any way to skip this step.
