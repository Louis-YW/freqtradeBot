You might need to check the prefix of the address you are looking for, if it is not a legacy address, you need to prepend. Follow the link on the first reply and read the 3rd instructions. If not then you might be import the wrong private key. I would advise you import the seed phrase on an offline device.",

I didnt even know that there is something to be prefixed while importing the private keys. Thank you so much.There's no real standard for whether a private key generates a Bech32/SegWit address, a P2SH (nested SegWit) address, or an old-school P2PKH  address.  It's totally up to each individual wallet to decide what type of address to derive from your private key and  so if you want a specific address type for your private key, you have to explicitly \"tell\" your wallet what you want.  This is where prefixes come into play. Kinda annoying but it is what it is.",

Thank you so much.To get more details on properly imported private keys into Electrum wallet  I would advocate for reading  the dedicated thread opened by 1miau here on bitcointalk.  It presents the  relevant  instruction in step-by-step manner and lists prefixes needed for given types of addresses.",

When you get to the stage where you need to import your private keys or addresses in Electrum, you will notice a question mark or additional info button. If you click on that, you will see an explanation of how to import private keys, which is what OmegaStarScream was talking about in the second post.",
