  "content": "In an attempt of removing the need to have to trust physical coin makers in generating private keys, I wanted to share the following...In 2014-2015 I'd been contacted by Mike Caldwell and we had a few discussions on how to remove trust from loaded physical collectibles. We went back and forth a bit. In the end the discussion ended with the following possible solutions.I approached several coin makers back then including Mike and all of them either did not get back to me or declined being involved with altogether what I‚Äôve outlined below:IDEA #1 - 2-factor keys generated by TWO trusted parties. Downside you need both parties to be 100% correct in their math to execute this.IDEA #2 - 2-of-3 multisig with keys generated by THREE trusted parties. Downside you need to trust one of the other two parties did their math and key generation correctly.The idea was to use a 2-factor or 2 or 3 multisig coin where multiple parties would create part of a key that would be added to the overall physical coin secured under each of our respective holograms.Assuming it is a 2 of 3 multisig coin, then if one party wanted to scam, they would require at least one other person (i.e. 2 of 3 parties) to sweep/move the funds.There is a possible downside. Not 100% sure how likely if things are tested correctly. If one party or more does their math wrong or doesn‚Äôt put the correct piece of the key on the coin, that can mess up the validity of the coin.You can do everything on your end (like myself) but I would have to trust that the other parties involved actually did put the correct key on to the coin securely and that their math was done correctly.This would be as close to a removal of trust from the key producers from scamming as possible.As more ideas and items come up in this discussion I will collect them here in OP here.Looking forward to hearing all of your thoughts, any and all.",

It's like asking Ballet to make the keys for your coins (believe they do BIP38 with two different entities under the Ballet umbrella).yes I follow you 100%.I would just not be in favor of selling it as a service (personally for myself being involved in such an endeavor) if the parties I'm making multi-sig keys with would be selling it as a service to another coin maker that is not directly involved with being part of the key gen process.There might be a market out there for it and perhaps others who would likely go along with making such a service available.Personally not for me.I'm not familiar with Ballet's key gen process but if the same entity (under the same umbrella) is making 2FA or multisig coin keys, I'm not sure how that works to speak on the matter with any accuracy. Seems like a conflict if two parties associated with the same entity are making all parts of the overall key that allows redemption of funds and selling it as a 2FA key or multi-sig coin.I can't speak on Ballet's process as I'm too uninformed to make any judgements.",
