As for the signature, I have never seen an animated version but I’m sure it could be done but the only issue would be; does the forum allow an animated signature? The fact that animated avatar are no longer allowed should also apply to signatures too.",

By any chance, did you mean something like moving objects or an animated avatar, or a signature? Animated avatar was allowed back in the day, but not now. Anyone who had an animated avatar at the time of disabling has the privilege of keeping their avatar but once they change, they can't ever use an animated avatar.And the signature can't be animated.",

Technically that's not an animated banner either, since it's just a hover effect in css code which it can be activated by touching the banner with your cursor. Currently the html banner is disabled by the admin though.",

I have seen live avatars on some users profiles but those have been set during the times when the live avatars weren't disabled on the forum and those lucky few have kept their avatars since then because they knew that if they change their avatar even for a single time then they won't be able to get that live avatar again on their profiles. Like @jayce said that thing is just an html banner and that isn't a live signature and surely he also said that it's disabled on the forum and that means that such kind of banners can't be applied on profiles anymore. The signatures in their current state are pretty eye-catching and the advertisers are happy with those signatures, and that's why I don't think there is any need to have those html banners back on forum.",

I was thinking it is moving in specific time frame. and guessed it's a GIF.No, it is not an animated gif; it is an HTML5 animated banner. Animated gifs lack a mouse-over function; they simply loop the animation continuously.Quote from: cafter on September 14, 2023, 05:37:00 PMdo you know reason for banning the animated signatures? In gifs we can say it takes more storage and when uploaded by many users it will take huge amount of storage. and it's not annoying too, because we will see flashing lights when we hover on it.As far as I know, there have never been animated signatures. Signatures are made using BBCode, and since BBCode does not allow any form of animation and GIFs in signatures are not enabled by forum admins, animated signatures are not possible. What you see on the Wayback archive is not a signature but an HTML banner (you will notice that it is displayed below the post area) that were active on the forum at that time.Regarding animated avatars, I am not sure why they were removed, but it probably wasn't due to storage issue.",

You must know such animated avatars or advertisement banners are really annoying with most of forum users. You also have to know forum users can customize their profile settings to turn off all user avatars and signatures. When they do this, your money spends for advertisements through avatars and signatures will be useless.",
