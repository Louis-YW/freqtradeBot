My guess is that the bounty board has hundreds of pages with threads. On the other hand, if you go to that user's profile page and check what threads he has created, you will see only 5 pages to work with. That's a much easier and quicker way to check what he has managed in the past than searching for his name among thousands of threads.",

I don't think it's some kind of an investigation but I think the op is only just a normal bounty hunter and wants to know the other bounties that the guy is managing but yeah why can't the op check the post history of that guy directly? That seem to be the fastest way to know or maybe he is literally a newbie and isn't aware of these things but now he know after reading our replies here.I don't think the op is questioning the reputation of this guy. Also this wasn't the first time that a user questions or complains about a manager but before they do it, make sure they read the rules of the campaign because sometimes it's not really the fault of the manager.",
