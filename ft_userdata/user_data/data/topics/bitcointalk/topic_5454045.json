It is known for it's mind-blowing and ground-breaking edifices and skyscrapers. Today, it is at the forefront of history as it's going to be home to the world's first bitcoin tower. The developer, Salvatore Liggiero designed the 40 storey tower to demonstrate Bitcoin significance and also as a sign of recognition for the world's number one cryptocurrency. The bitcoin tower hopes to take the hospitality industry to a whole new level as guests will be able to make rental payment in the form of crypto-staking producing an annual percentage yield (APY) for them to claim during their stay in the hotel.Congratulations Bitcoin!

The Bitcoin tower will surely be a big structure and for sure it'll have more connect with the bitcoin. Country that completely depends on tourism for its economy apart from the oil source have got its plan to make the city and the entire country to be an tourist attraction spot. So that, even if the oil source gets limited the country can stay strong with its tourism economy.",

I have visited Dubai 2-3 times however I am really impressed that they are the only City in the world that is paving towards Cryptocurrency.Almost 95% of the investment businesses from South Asia moved to Dubai because of the zero tax and chill government polices. They are utilising the oil money in a future technology, which will keep them in the richest list for longer run.",

Not only does the city, the artist who's making NFTs and the guest are benefiting from this project but also for all the Bitcoin believers and hodlers as it may catch the world attention that people who's not into Bitcoin will start digging information and most probably going to invest as well. This will then expand the global bitcoin adoption. I super excited on whether or not their narrative being the first hotel that gives you back the money you paid, plus interest is going to work.",

But first, if ever this building is already done, having rental on it is very expensive, which only those rich guys can afford, and their staking is very expensive. I am very curious on how they will do it and how the developer or owner of it can still gain profit. But again, Dubai is always surprising us. The same is true with their The Line project, which they already started. Let's hope this bitcoin build will be successful in the future.",

Anyway, the tower is a good thing for them. More people will be curious about bitcoin, more people will know about it and eventually more people will start using it as a currency.

In essence, this hotel may later have the goal of becoming a hotel that has sophisticated and renewable technology. I even read in the news that guests who come to this Bitcoin tower will also be given a special NFT prize. or guests can also do staking and get rewards. Maybe rich people would be enthusiastic to try it. but I think for sure it will be very expensive to be able to visiting  there.So even though I'm interested, I might think twice about visiting there.  Sourch : https://chainsightnews.com",

The developer wants to signify Bitcoin but only on the sole surface and from the architectural perspective. Deep down, surely a mere Bitcoin logo isn't enough for the project's sustainabilities and hype, as a consequence, those web3 things I mentioned are mixed up with the idea of Bitcoin Tower. This project also boasts it will innovate the hospitality and real estate sectors, which seems an empty promise that some of us are already aware of it back in ICO hype. Well, at the very least they try to build the real thing, the building itself.",

Bitcoin is death-proof.
