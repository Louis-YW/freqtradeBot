(already collected some from reddit thread)This is the first time I see this puzzle so I am certainly not solving it (yet) but I know there are some guys in forum who solved Bitcoin puzzles before You posted this in correct section, so don't worry about that.Puzzle image:https://github.com/HomelessPhD/BLM_0.2BTCI can confirm that 0.2 Bitcoin is still available on that address, so let the games begin.https://mempool.space/address/1KfZGvwZxsvSmemoCmEV75uqcNzYBHjkHZGood luck everyone",

At first glance it's Germanic not Nordic because sign no 4 from the bottom (·õú ) is Germanic but there's no such rune in the Nordic alphabet. Many other runes are from the Nordic alphabet, some defining numbers from the runic calendar. Did anybody decrypt it? I might try, I like these things.",
