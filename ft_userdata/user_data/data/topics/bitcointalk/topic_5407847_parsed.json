      "body": "Why is it the tokens arent showing on the wallet itself but seen on the transaction history? If this is true then your a very generous guy. I am just curious why would you send a $100 worth of jst per wallet and asked us to give 0.01bnb for the transaction.Quote from: tinyteapot on July 27, 2022, 08:51:30 PMI was privileged to receive this token and i feel like sharing with other people, we never can tell what tomorrow will be.Is this an airdrop? Or form of payment for such services? Im not saying its not real but its kinda shady actually. Its much better if youll convert some of those jst to bnb to cover for transaction and send jst tokens to whoever will post their bnb wallet here. That way, it could be less suspicious. If your goal is really to share that wealth of yours. Just a suggestion mate.Dont get me wrong, the idea of sending gas fee to others and will give you reward is indeed a modus of some scammers. I just giving you a suggestion to distribute it without much issue like most scammers there.",
