Some of these that I googled have ranged in value from $200 - 400k USD so i'm not sure exactly what I have here but looking to entertain any offers or guidance on how to get these graded. I mean this niagra falls one postcard w/ this ben franklin stamp has to be worth something.  Title is just to grab attention I did however find some of these stamps I have go for 250-400k and they look the damn same to me.",

      "body": "as correctly stated by @Iced the value of the stamps is given by a whole set of factors.To determine these factors first of all take \"single\" photos and not in groups. Secondly, this is not a huge collection and no it's not worth millions of usd.a bit like what happens to me when they ask me for my opinion on a collection it is good to be very clear  right awayI don't know which ones you have seen that have these ratings (400K USD :O ) but unless they are \"misprints\" or particular runs, the ones you have shown are very common.For example, I see many examples of 1c Benjamin Franklin, Scott n. 300 issued in 1902 (photo 1-2-3-7-8-9-14-15) from the catalog is 0.50 usd (perhaps on postcard or envelope support it can reach 2 USD). it's enough harder finding a buyer some times because these are really commons (and not in \"perfect conditions\" like photo 9)Maybe you can have some rare use for cancellation/destination but its.... rare.Use this site for an idea https://www.kenmorestamp.com/us-stamp-identifier",
