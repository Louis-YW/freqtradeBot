If both the Ming Shing Group and Intesa Sanpaolo are buying Bitcoin, it really gives a signal that a shift in how traditional businesses view Bitcoin. Which is very satisfying. Although the Intesa Sanpaolo CEO (Carlo Messina) said it is a test. Although i still see 1 million euros worth of Bitcoin as a large investment. Which other firm/organization is next? I cant wait to hear more news",

I cant wait to hear more newsThey’re the biggest bank in the country, so smaller banks will likely follow their lead. Just imagine if the entire financial sector started buying Bitcoin—it would mean banks and crypto exchanges could seamlessly link up, making transactions smoother and paving the way for wider adoption.As for the Ming Shing Group, it’s a bit unusual for them to buy Bitcoin since they’re not in the financial sector. If I’m not mistaken, their focus is on engineering. But when it comes to the banking industry, that’s definitely good news if they adopt it. It makes sense since it’s all connected, kind of like merging centralized systems with decentralized ones.",

It shows to us that the big company will also join in the Bitcoin and that will also makes more people will enter to Bitcoin. While Intesa Sanpaolo’s bought Bitcoin at $92,800, the price now reach $97k and still increase so they are making a nice profit with their Bitcoin. Maybe they will still buying more Bitcoin especially when the price is down. It is a right decision for them to buy Bitcoin in a lower price.",

Intesa Sanpaolo could have bought bitcoins when the price was at $50k but see the price they bought it at. Some other banks would buy at $150k soon. QuoteFurthermore, the Bank of Italy released guidelines on applying EU cryptocurrency rules. Its governor, Fabio Panetta, has a strong anti-crypto stance. Panetta emphasized that only banks and electronic money institutions can issue stablecoins, as they are backed by legal tender currencies and protected by specific rules. However, Italy’s largest bank’s official entry into the crypto world will likely encourage even the most cautious and conservative savers to examine this sector more closely.Crypto is going mainstream and it cannot escape regulation.More adoption will result in a price increase. We will see people buying at $150k. What I am thinking now is that will the \"the most cautious and conservative savers\" buy the bitcoin or the bitcoin ETFs?",

Big win for us!More and more large companies are looking at Bitcoin as an asset for their investment. This shows that Bitcoin is a potential asset - to the point that these large companies show their interest in investing in Bitcoin and entrust their money to it. Although the investment made by Intesa Sanpaolo is not that big, only $ 1M USD, but as the largest bank in Italy and also one of the big players in Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo will set an example for other companies and maybe this will have a positive impact that other companies will follow their steps to invest in Bitcoin.",

This is a good news.At a time when the Italian government was planning to increase cryptocurrency capital gains tax, the first Italian bank had just purchased 11 Bitcoin. This might be the beginning of the good news from Italian Banks. I am just wondering where some governments have refused to lift sanctions on banks to deal with or invest in Bitcoin.

It's an effect that would keep on piling up as time goes on, and the amount may be insignificant now, but when every medium bank would do the same - that would be a bit scary.",
