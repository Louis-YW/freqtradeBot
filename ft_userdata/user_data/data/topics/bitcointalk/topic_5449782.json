This is what I am thinking too, thank you for the information.Quote from: Nwada001 on April 22, 2023, 01:16:59 PMLinking the wallet address to the user's location is only 100% possible if the user is using a centralized system where their login location can be detected. I accept this also. It is also possible if using a self-custodial wallet that depends on central servers, the central servers can know your bitcoin addresses and IP address which they use to seek for the person that is using the IP address from the internet service provider. If the internet service provider give them the information needed, they can know the person, but this is still better than using a custodial wallet which is centralized.",

You leak it other other Bitcoin nodes, not Internet service provider which has to do more analyses to figure out what you are doing when using their service. That I don't think they have interests to spend resources to do it.For other Bitcoin nodes, they do know what you are doing as you and them are in a same Bitcoin clan.",

I am not talking about SPV wallets but only full node wallets.As far as I know it's not the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that get to link your IP address to your node but the other bitcoin nodes on the network.Since you are connected to your peers on the bitcoin network they will be able to see your IP address as well as your location and then trace back to you.There are also risks of a targeted DoS attack to your node and so it's better to use Tor at first place.",

But the problem is SSL was removed year's ago in Bitcoin core. That is why the only option you have, if you want to run a full node without data leak is to enable hidden Tor service.",

Assuming if someone uses IP address instead of using Tor, what information can be leaked to the internet service provider? Everything that's transmitted. Bitcoin node doesn't use encryption to send/receive data between nodes. BIP 151 and 324 attempt to solve that, but BIP 151 has been abandoned while BIP 324 still on development for Bitcoin Core software.Quote from: _act_ on April 22, 2023, 01:07:04 PMCan the internet service provider know my bitcoin addresses or the internet service provider will just know that I am using Bitcoin Core but not able to link it to my bitcoin addresses and transactions? I am not talking about SPV wallets but only full node wallets.ISP would have hard time knowing whether you only relay other's transaction or your own transaction. They would have to perform massive logging or cooperate with other ISP/government in order to determine which transaction most likely belong to yours.",
