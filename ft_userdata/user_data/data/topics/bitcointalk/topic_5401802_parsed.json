  "content": "I have read some interesting articles focused on Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) accounting system and public timestamping of transactions and would like to share it with our bitcoin community. Feel free to leave your comments. https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-research/price-implications-of-bitcoin-utxo-age-changes-6ec8e1dd6a62\"...increases in the warmer bands suggest that coins that were previously held are now on the move and indicate a higher velocity of the monetary base. According to traditional economic theory, higher velocity, ceteris paribus, leads to higher prices of a monetary base. We can also consider situations where longer-term holders moving “cold” coins to sell them should correlate with lower prices. Conversely, there should be a positive relationship between changes in older age bands and price: an increase in older bands suggest that individuals are holding more Bitcoin and therefore should correlate to higher prices.\"",

      "body": "A couple of additions to the sourse. Remember that every UTXO amount is written as a binary number in Satoshis. In other words, for example, instead of UTXO with .5999 BTC, you actually have 59,990,000 sats. But every Bitcoin transaction browser and wallet however, will immediately divide this number by 100,000,000 and convert it to BTC.Also, please remember in Bitcoin, inputs and outputs do not have to be equal. In other words, outputs can be less than the inputs, and the difference is the actual transaction fee. Many miners reluctant to accept zero-fee transactions, so in effect no transaction's inputs and outputs are equal anymore and still getting into the blockchain.",

(you can have multiple utxo from the same address)I made a calculador here where you can see how much multiple utxo will impact your mining fee. Just play around with inputs and outputs.https://bitcoindata.science/plot-your-transaction-in-mempool.htmlThere are no zero fee transactions. Nodes won't broadcast them. The only way to have a zero fee tx in a block is that the miner included it by himself:https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69030/how-did-these-zero-transaction-fee-transactions-make-it-into-the-bitcoin-network",

It doesn't sound right. I just remember that not long ago a big platform (possibly Binance) did consolidate a great lot of its funds. Should I  conclude that such a move has triggered the price drop?

Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know for sure; maybe my examples are too rare or don't matter in the sheer number of utxo. But I would not trust such a metric, that's for sure. That's how I feel.",

      "body": "following other schemes like whale alerts that watch for high value/volume/velocity new UTXO and try to coerce people into thinking its an indication of an upcoming new pump and dump is indeed a trap and not a tooljust like the silly people that try to predict pump and dumps by doing TA(trend analysis) by marking lines of 'monthly averages'(MA) and finding patterns of old pump and dumps.. to suggest that pattern is about to repeat.. (bad idea dont recommend following these schemes)the purposes of these silly naive influencers trying to push these schemes onto others.. is simple.if they can get enough sheep to follow their influencer, when they shout jump and enough people jump they themselves can cause a pump.its not predictive or analytical. its simply try to make something sound plausible and then get everyone to jump on command. and when everyone jumps on command like sheep. he can say, oh look the price did go up, i told you so. its not about the data showing something will happen its the influencers pushing people to cause something to happen by using data he drew on some lame chart.is psychology, not data analysismuch like if the whale alert twitter had enough followers and everyone went on a buying spree every time there was a tweet.. its the tweet that caused the pump.. not the UTXO mentioned in the tweet, ..here is the rub.. alot of people have got wise to these and so ignore it. where as some others play the opposite game and try to sell when the sheep are trying to do a buy pump. which actually causes a dump before a pump(when no one jumps on the pump wagon). so because these schemes are known and fail. in many cases the attempt to pump actually causes a dump. (influencer was hoping to exit that week anyway thats why he wanted others to push the price up first, so he can sell for higher price and get out)so again just ignore these influencers that claim they have the ability to predict the daily price..one thing you need to learn when someone is telling you to pump.. its because the person shouting he wants a pump is only shouting it so he can sell . because he is actually needing to dumpin short. when media announced elon bought bitcoin a few years ago. he actually bought them months before the announcement. so he bought them cheap. where by the announcement months later by influencers pumped the price unrelated to elons actual purchase. so that the influencers could sell at a higher price.so be careful about people saying they can predict the active volatile market price daily.. no one can",

It is basically stating the obvious. It says that the amount of money times the number of times it is spent is equal to the total amount of money spent.If you rearrange the terms, M = PQ/V, you can see that the value of the money supply is inversely proportional to the velocity. That is, if the velocity increases, then the value of the money supply decreases, ceteris paribus. It should be intuitively apparent that if the same money is used more often then its value would have to be less to pay for the same amount of products.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_moneyQuote from: Hold-n-play on June 08, 2022, 09:55:05 PMI am wondering if anyone can please explain why are UTXO's necessary in the first place?

      "body": "the issue with just 'crediting' / debiting an address. where its just an address with a single value that increases and decreases is this:when you want to pay another person you would need to ensure in YOUR transaction that their side is updated too. for it to be a successful paymentEG (as an example of you spending 0.08)beforeYOU 0.09btc    them 0.1afterYOU 0.01btc    them 0.18this means at your end you would need to seek out their balance first, and then update their balance within your transaction, aswell as your own balance for it to be a successful payment.this opens flaws up of manipulation because if your able to change their balance. you can nefariously change their balance.(EG why not just make their balance 0)some altnets tried to counter this by only allowing your control to be to make your balance less and their balance more. . however this then runs into more problemsimagine the blocks are 10minutes apartremember there is no central agency, its all independent decentralised paymentslets say 4 people wanted to pay you 0.001EG beforeYOU 0.09btc    personA 0.1   personB 0.1    personC 0.1    personD 0.1they dont know about each other. nor realise the other 3 people are trying to pay you at the same timeat making the transactions.. each person would makes a transactionpersonA 0.099   YOU 0.091personB 0.099   YOU 0.091personC 0.099   YOU 0.091personD 0.099   YOU 0.091to them individually. they are doing the honourable thing. deducting 0.001 from them and crediting 0.001 to youbecause they all looked at your confirmed balance at the same time as being 0.09 and your balance wont update for another 10 minutes if there were changes,, so thats what they presume. so they all presume your new balance is going to be 0.091so when in the block. they have new confirmed balance of 0.099 for themselves each (losing 0.001 each, totalling 0.004 gone on their sides combined)but your balance has been updated 4 times for the same amount as they didnt know about each other in that 10 minute window thus your at 0.091 not 0.094remember there is no central agency, its all independent decentralised payments..some altnets tried to counter this by having separate accounts/balances per partnership.where both partners had to sigh a joint account to authorise both sides agreement of balances.. though that got complicated about how to get balance out of one partnership and into another should they wish to spend balance elsewhere...this is where blockchains came in.it solved many problems.by not being a 'account'/total balance log system. it instead was a chain of custody system. which is not updating a balance. but instead giving slices of units of a previous chunk of unit. whereby showing where the value originated from(mining) where it was spent and how much of the chunk was being split to whom.this meant being able to receive different amounts from different people into the same address without it impacting each other or affecting each other. as its was(outside the blockchain) counting the units received rather than updating a single log of balanceit also allows spending the slices to combine them into chunks should you only wish to have one unspent chunk value associated with your address.this became auditable where every unit of measure is accountable and checkable so no new value can be invented. also it meant they didnt need to co-sign a transaction or be awake to receive/authorise it. you couldnt fiddle with their other funds they pre-owned. and all the other flaws were gone...to make it far easier to calculate total coins associated with an address, that came from different senders. separately from the chain of custody log, instead of interrogating the chain every time and working out which coin had been already spent and not spent, to work out what to include or ignore in updating the (outside) balance. a separate database was added that just indexes the values that have not already been spent. so it saved reading time as everything in the unspent database is just that. the unspent balance indexes of the chain of custody log...and that is the utxoset.....it just makes it easy to see, out of the chain of custody log which records are still active and unspent to save readying the whole long file over and over again.",

Maybe not as simple to gasp, maybe not as simple for us humans, but it's the more straightforward for the system/computers (tracking the utxo is much more straightforward than keeping the results and making sure they're correct)And for humans can be easy too (or at least easier) by just thinking of each input as a variably sized banknote. The result of every transaction getting to you is such a banknote.When you spend, you usually spend a number of such banknotes and get another one as change. The receiver gets a new banknote with a new size = the amount he has to receive.(If you knew all this, even better).The result is something that easily allows the system track the amounts and their history very easily.And the wallet adds up all the utxo from your addresses for convenience and easier reading.",
