Lutpin already has negative tag for shady things done in signature campaigns. Whether that's correct or not, I don't know. But the forum is more that one person.",

His last active date keeps somewhat current but last time he posted anything was a year and a half ago. I remember him when he was active.

If you want to get Indonesian philosophy.Bhasha IndonesiaYou can easily get to know about football, cricket, boxing, NBA, etc. organized in different parts of the world through this forum.Gambling DiscussionFinally I can say, Bitcoin forum is not just a public welfare website but it is a mirror of the whole world with thousands of news published daily.",

Lol  While having to agree with OP, as it's normal, after all, that if someone did something wrong once -- then certainly everybody does it (again, /s) -- still, topic's title brought me back the interesting ideas of another iconic figure of the forum:So it seems that, somehow, three years later after wolwoo spoke the truth acted like the village idiot, someone else reaches same conclusion about the forum being a mafia clan. That makes sense, doesn't it? The only thing that I don't understand is how and why OP chose that particular thread, which is also a very old one.
