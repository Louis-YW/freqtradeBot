  "content": "Americans Must Look to Parliament for 2024Our eyes has been on the Presidential seat ahead of the United States elections scheduled to be held on 5th November, 2024. We completely forgets the Important place of the parliament to the future of American as a state and as a people. The United State Congress is the legislative arm of the government and it has 535 voting members. It is made up of a higher body Senate and a lower body House of Representatives. For the next elections a total of 468 seats in the U.S. Congress are up for regular election where 33 are for Senate seats and 435 House seats.We must look to our Parliament as a people. A lot has been going on there that are not worthy of mention because actions from members of the parliaments are not building our strength as it was before but making us weaker. It is certain we must stand firm on our feet as the next elections have a lot to do with our advancement and progress. Let us be guided there is still much to be done.",

I am not an expert in National politics, but Santos was the least prepared person to hold office in the government of USA. If you have not taken a look at his story and the all alledged crimes he has committed in USA and Brazil, then you will be astonished on how much and person is willing to lie to go through his path to congress. Even after Santos Being kicked out the congress, there are still pretty much several people who, in my opinion, is not supposed to hold office. How knows, perhaps in this 2024 we will see a better representation of the American people in Washington DC.",
