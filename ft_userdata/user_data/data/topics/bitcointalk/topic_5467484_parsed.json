      "body": "If you don’t use the required size, it won’t work; you have to manually resize your image before you can upload it to your profile as an avatar. I believe the reason the forum asks for a specific size or image size to fit in the avatar is because of space, in order for it not to occupy a whole lot of space. You can either use any of the image editors or even paint to resize the image to fit in the forum's required size, then give it another shot.",

You have seen the requirements before you can upload avatar on this forum and anything larger than 120px wide, 80px high, and 100 KiB size images will not be successfully be uploaded but bring up error. There are many apps that are available that you can use to resize the images. These kind of applications also will reduce the kilobytes of the image to less than 100 kilobytes.",

Image resizing is very easy, I usually used mobile sample editor tool to resize image.120x 80x is maximum size forum supported and there is possibility of lower than this. resizing the image will affect the quality so manually doing by self is best and no need of automatic resize however if Theymos want then not a bad idea",

So that images can be automatically resized after uploading?If you are using mobile phone then you can use a apps name Picsart you can find it on playstore and also appstore and resize a picture through this apps. I sometimes cut a picture to 120px by 80px using this app.  But its picture quality is a bit low but it is acceptable.  And if you somehow can't get an avatar weight below or equal to 100kb then you can use a ninja technique like I do.  Send that picture to someone on Facebook Messenger and then download it again and you will see that the weight has completely decreased. or if you use pc or laptop then Photoshop can easily help you for this issue",

If you have some knowledge about photo editing then you shouldn't face any problem. Otherwise you can do it by someone. And there is also a option go to youtube or Chat-gpt and ask them how to resized a photo with \"120px wide, 80px high, and 100 KiB size\".",

Imagine that you want to automatically resize 1200*630 to 120*80, and remember that the space is only 100 KiB size.I once tried to edit a photo from the phone camera into an avatar, and the results were not good. Therefore, the more digital or computer-generated avatar, the clearer and better the results.Quote from: Jocuserious on September 20, 2023, 04:03:51 PMRemember : don't upload avatar many time then it can be suspended. are you sure?

So that images can be automatically resized after uploading?I like the old school design of this forum (everything ingenious is simple) and the absence of such automation, such as resizing the picture on the avatar. Why complicate something that has been working for years?  You'll suffer once and then you won't want to change your avatar for a long time (won't want to do this again). What difficulties might there be with manually changing the size of an avatar? Nowadays, a similar function is available in any graphic editor and there are online versions where you don't need to download or buy an application. In fact, this is a matter of 5 minutes or a couple of clicks. Even a schoolboy can handle this.By the way, I don’t see an avatar on your profile. Have you ever been unable to figure out how to do this?",

So that images can be automatically resized after uploading?Theymos needs to add these features, and I don't think he wants to do that. He doesn't want to make any unnecessary changes at the backend. This feature is mostly used in signature promotion, and a resized avatar is always provided by the campaign manager. There aren't that many users who use these features outside of signature promotion.There are many free online tools that can do this work, so use them.
