Uncle Gary and the US SEC also have unresolved cases against Coinbase and Ripple. This will certainly take a much longer time than expected. I am quite sure the market will recover and enters a new all time high before the case is resolved hehehe. This is because everything about the SEC's complaints are based on regulatory inclarity. They are playing the game of which exchange or project should they sue at any given time hehe.In any case, here is the filing of the SEC's case against Binance, Binance.us and CZ. These coins were mentioned as illegal securities. It is not limited to them, however. It implies more tokens can be included.Since the Binance Platforms launched, Defendants have made available fortrading on them crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus assecurities. This includes, but is not limited to, BNB, BUSD, and the units of each of the cryptoasset securities further described below—with trading symbols SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL,ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI (collectively, the “Crypto Asset Securities\").Source https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf#page=85",

[1] https://u.today/breaking-sec-unleashes-legal-fury-on-binance-and-cz-bnb-plungesWhat scares me the most is the misuse of clients’ money because if any problem occurs, random FUD started and money withdrawals start, suddenly we will discover that the platform owns only less than 10% of the depositors’ money as liquidity, and more liquidity as BNB that are printed to cover the money that was withdrawn. This reminds me of what happened with FTX.Those affected in these incidents will only be the users and the reputation of the cryptocurrency, so everyone who has money on that platform is better to withdraw it from that platform, and stay away from BNB pairs for a bit (unless you trust the platform)editSEC Complaint Aims to Unilaterally Define Crypto Market Structure Binance reply https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402fast reading QuoteWe are disappointed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chose to file a complaint today against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief.  From the start, we have actively cooperated with the SEC’s investigations and have worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns.  Most recently, we have engaged in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigations.  But despite our efforts, with its complaint today the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate.  We are disheartened by that choice. They are promises and claims that they have tried to do anything to avoid litigation and we will do everything we can to defend ourselves, emotional talk without evidence, I bet they will leave the US market soon.",

After all, what is the difference here between trading penny stocks and shitcoins on Binance? What Bitcoin was meant to be, and how it is nowadays are two different things, we can live in the fancy of the white paper, or face reality. The reality is, the percentage of people who treat BTC as a P2P E-cash system rounded to the nearest whole number is 0%, it's now a store of value as far as the majority of people who use it are concerned.Binance is a centralized exchange, it's a massive gate for fiat going into crypto, BTC wouldn't be worth what it is today if not for the liquidity provided by those centralized exchanges, I'd imagine it would be a problematic task bringing the market cap of crypto to 1 trillion with dozen guys meeting at Starbucks to exchange cash for crypto.See, I don't disagree with you on how \"terrible\" things have become and how the security, and value of crypto have been tied to centralized exchanges that are known for lies, corruption, and nearly everything the legacy banks are known for, but you can't have everything at once. if you want to get rid of all the \"bad guys\" in the crypto space, you will have to start from when BTC was worth no more than a couple of hundred bucks, hard to buy, difficult to sell, no known market value and only a couple nerds use it to buy Pizza and some CPU cooler.For Binance as it stands right now, every hack that resulted in funds lost was paid back to the clients, they are pretty flexible with other nations and don't suck up to the hegemony of the united states, they are the last exchange to ban a U.S banned country, they operate one massive mining pool that helps to a good degree with mining decentralization, they have very good customer support. if we can't say they are the most sane, we can at least say they are the least terrible (which I believe is a better description)QuoteThe SEC can't sue FTX, it has raised charges against Sam and Nishad Singh, for FTX collapse the SEC has no business there, that's the role of CFTC and this one has already filed charges against both FTX and Alameda.ha? According to the defination of the SEC role:QuoteThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and protecting investors.If they can SUE Binance and Coinbase, they sure could sue FTX, didn't U.S citizens lose billions of dollars in FTX? wasn't the SEC responsible for \"protecting\" investors? Not sure why you say that is the rule of CFTC, it's true that if something is a commodity then it's under the CFTC, but currency trading is under SEC, they most certainly could sue FTX for a dozen things.Here is a TL;DRQuoteThe SEC and CFTC are engaged in a turf war over regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies.The CFTC has the authority to regulate futures and derivatives trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.The SEC focuses on areas such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.In order to avoid regulatory uncertainty, the SEC and CFTC have been urged to cooperate.The ultimate authority over crypto regulation and legislation is yet to be determined.",

Mainly because exchanges are definitely on CFTC's turf since none are registered with the SEC, so the SEC deals with sales of coins or cases that involved defrauding like in the normal stock market that's why it has filed charges against the operators and not against FTX, while the CFTC has filed charges against both the exchanges and the owners. FTX Derivatives was licensed and registered by the CFTC, not the SEC, they were the overseer and it's pretty normal they should deal with the case.",

But this can't stop me from hating this reality!  Why would you even hope that you will spend dear Bitcoin to buy a pair of socks when there are less valuable currencies that you can use? \"bad money drives out good.\", we will have to run out of every medium of value before we can use BTC for every payment.I think Satoshi calling it \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" was either misunderstood by the public, since those words don't imply that BTC would be used for daily payments and only meant that you could send/receive it on P2P bases without having a centralized party approval, something like \"Cash\", hence the \"Cash\" in the wordings.The other possibility is the fact that Satoshi underestimated his invention, he didn't see all of this coming, and he didn't think BTC would eventually be too good to be spent.Regardless of which scenario is more likely, I think the backbone of BTC is the ability to transact it freely without government approval, this has been holding true since its inspection, how we treat it isn't something major, in fact, it really almost doesn't matter, whether you use it to buy coffee to save it for your grandchildren in a cold wallet, it doesn't change any of it's decentralized and limited supply characteristics. Now back to the topic and to give more clarity on why I think this is a systematic war against crypto and not just a war on an exchange, the SEC is a government agency, they act based on what the government wants, the concept of consumer protection is just for media consumption, the government knows that attacking central exchanges is key in its war against crypto, whether the goal is to destroy crypto all together or just to control it, they see things we don't, the fact that they started with the exchanges is somewhat good evidence that they think exchanges are a point of strength for bitcoin and crypto as a whole.If you take down centralized exchanges, you take away too much from crypto, without having to piss your people off because again, you are doing all this to protect them from the devils like Binance, while in the background your real intention is to cripple crypto, if you manage to bring BTC's price down to 3 digits again, it becomes easier to control.Within our own inner circuit of the crypto community, we can curse Binance and all the centralized exchanges every day of the week, but when a government agency attacks a crypto-based entity, we should stand against the government, it is safe to assume that every monetary decision taken by any government around the globe will have a negative impact on the average citizen, if Binance falls on its own or due to compensation that would be perfectly fine, failing by government's action is going to have a huge negative impact on the crypto space.",

Depending on how the case develops, I don't think Binance would just \"leave the US market completely.\" It's too huge to just abandon. As a matter of fact, I completely understand why Binance is acting differently on this one. While Binance quickly packed up, didn't even put up much of a fight, and left a number of countries due to regulatory and other legal challenges, it has now promised to defend itself \"vigorously.\"There will also surely be a lot of backchanneling and backstage negotiations on this one.",
