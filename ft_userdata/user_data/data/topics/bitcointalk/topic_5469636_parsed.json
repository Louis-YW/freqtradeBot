I mean, maybe if it had enough PCIe lanes, you could fit a few NVIDIA gpus in there and get to work on CUDA. I guess it would have to be assembled manually and it would be very large.",

      "body": "There is no possibility (sorry) that you can reduce for one key. if it could be possibility - then all btc has been worth nothing.but......as always we need math include in our conversation.@NotATether wrote: \"That's what I'd like to know as well - it does not seem feasible to condense a 129-bit range into a 90-bit range without accounting for all of the divisors and hence all the keys it will result.\"and it is TRUE, or almost TRUE -> Â \"all of the divisors and hence all the keys it will result\" we do not need \"all\". only part.If you think about BSGS like normal BSGS , no -> you need modificate for BSGS inside BSGS as doubled @NotATether wrote:That's basically enterprise server kind of hardware, right?Do those even support GPUs at all? I mean, maybe if it had enough PCIe lanes, you could fit a few NVIDIA gpus in there and get to work on CUDA. I guess it would have to be assembled manually and it would be very large.Answer : Yes, enterprise server of hardware.Do those even support GPUs at all? I mean, maybe if it had enough PCIe lanes, you could fit a few NVIDIA gpus in there and get to work on CUDA. I guess it would have to be assembled manually and it would be very large.At the moment no: I have finished and tested for 2**90 bits , and it works.I have no \"knowledge\" in GPU code. My testing was only test of my theory with succesfull.If someone would like to work with me for it -> GPUS support , it will be nice.the 1,5 TB ram , is calculated according my previous work 2**90 bit , has been solved in 73 hours with 128 cores.Edit:40 cores for main server 88 cores for workers",
