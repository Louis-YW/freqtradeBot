  "content": "Hi guys, what do you think about our new crypto that is backed by gold???I believe that money should be a clear representation of the value of work done. If you work hard, producing something amazing or providing best quality service, you should be paid well regardless of the type of job. I believe in equality of opportunity. But today we are all enslaved and working hard for the useless paper which elites print daily to keep us enslaved. GRC brings back the gold standard and revolution against the slavery of all people in the world. Real money for real people. It's time to wake up and stand up against the global tyranny. We should stop fighting each other and unite. Only together we can create a global change and build a new world on real values.🌏🔥🚀 GLOBAL RESERVE COIN 🌏🔥🚀Contract Address: 0x8e4653Ef0f8Ce731653192bb642D5347Ccec2c6a☀️ GRC is a First BEP20 (BSC) Gold-Backed token with BUSD automatic rewards.

So, America decided why should we be limiting ourselves to gold supplies. Let's just print paper and exchange it for goods, and if we run out of USD we just print more. And since USD was a closed global system - available and accessible everywhere - it still works today. Until the end of this year. The bubble will eventually pop, same as the realestate bubble. So, 2024 will be the beginning year of bringing gold-backed currency back.",

Our gold wallet, marketing wallet and liquidity are transparent on BSC Scan. You can see all the values there. There are 100 billion tokens and all of them are in circulation. Developers have nothing. Liquidity is locked on Pinksale for 6 months. Then I will relock it. My face and voice are on GRC official Youtube Channel. My full name, place of residence and age are verified. If I do something illegal, the investors can find me. I'm not anonymous. The contract is audited as well. And it's good you have doubts, which means you can distinguish between millions of shitcouns and GRC. In terms of other projects in the past. I can only say I'm built different and I'm here for a long run, we are talking decades and nothing can dissuade me, as I believe this is the futuelre. Only time will show how serious I am.

I agree it's hard to retain an idea these days, but I'm from Russia, and trust me I'll die for an idea that can help people get out of USD useless paper slavery. I'm ready to take the greatest risk for people. And those who join me will contribute to the project and our rebellion against the global tyranny.

Im not saying you arent dedicated but that platform is known for memecoins, so some could get the idea of it being a memecoin instead of a serious project.Quote from: yarik0409 on June 25, 2023, 12:32:47 PMSo I don't agree with your assessment of GRC being one of the shitcoins.Okay it depends on one justification but being listed on cmc and coingecko does it mean the project is already legit. Maybe a few more authencity of legitness might make the public invest on that. Maybe will wait for more development? The concept is very sensitive and Im sure you are aware that there are some previous projects like yours that died in the process. Of course public want a 100% guaranteed safe platform.Are you working alone on this one?",

I didn't use any launchpads.I just listed you so many reasons why investors can trust me and Global Reserve Coin, so I'm not sure what do you mean by \"one justification\". I didn't even mention CMC in my reasons... So please address the reasons I provided to you in my previous response. More guarantee will be visible once we purchase our first 2 oz 999.9 Gold Bar from Melbourne mint and we will store it there. So, only purchasing more gold and time will create more trust. You don't have to rush and buy in, if you are still afraid. You can wait a few months and see. I'm not here for pump and dump.Yes, I'm working alone and in full control of the project.",

One more?First factor is true, and I agree it should alert anyone, so research is a MUST for every BSC token you guys want to invest in. The reason why we chose BSC, because we have complex tokenomics and that's why Etherium transactions would cost users a fortune. Second factor is not true at all. The token wasn't laucnh on any launchpads. I provided 100% of liquidity of the token and locked it on PinkSale. I didn't use PinkSale as a launchpad, it only serves GRC as a lock.Third factor: PancakeSwap is not that unknown, is it? You may say that there are 99% of scam tokens on Pancakeswap, but that's a different argument. PancakeSwap is very well known, and you can trust that exchange.I didn't know that there were many gold-backed crypto, but I'm sorry to hear that they were all scams. I can't go back in time and change that history of gold-backed tokens, but I'm here to change the history now.",

Another scam token.  ? The first sentence doesn't make sense to me, sorry. You can read the contract and check all contract transactions. The passive income in the form of BUSD goes to token holders. More coins you hold, more passive income you get. Many early holders already got their investment back, you can ask for testimonies. Moreover, as a creator I don't possess any coins. I locked all 100% of coins when I launched. And we have antiwhale mechanism at the moment. You can only own 4% of the total supply. That's why we don't have whales who can dump the price.I'm sorry about your bad experience in crypto, but that just means that you made poor choices and didn't do your research properly, investing in scam tokens, instead of legit projects.We are generating passive income from tax. All info is transparent on the website.No liquidity? We went from $300 to $5k in a month with 0 advertising. I know it's not much, but we only starting. The time will show, if we are legit don't rush. And no I can't dunp the coin, because I don't have any.",

There is $5k in liquidity with $300 initial liquidity. People are buying and selling as they wish. Bitcoin and bnb also crashing ay?🤣 GRC can't crash with 240 holders. There is nothing to crash🤣In regards to CMC warning. Yes, the contract fees can be modified by me. I explain extensively why so in my Youtube Channel and Whitepaper. Mainly, so in the future I can leave only gold tax and remove other taxes to make coin more tradable. I'm not even going to comment on \"They don't have a website\". It's right there in my Topic post 🤔",

I have no idea what you mean by \"you already get our money when we buy the token\". I put 100% of tokens into liquidity when I launched a token. I didn't do farilaunch or presale, I put my own money into it. So when people buy GRC, it all goes into liquidity. I get 0. So, I get 0 from sales. That's why there is a marketing tax, so I can use some funds for marketing. All these taxes are awesome in their own way. Holders get passive income, GRC price stabilises and increases through lp generation, GRC gold reserves always grow and back the token and marketing funds used to spread awareness and increase the token price by increasing number of holders.So the rest of your paragraph has no meaning.Moreover, I left the tax modifiable so I can reduce it in the future, and leave only gold reserves tax.",

So, only purchasing more gold and time will create more trust. You don't have to rush and buy in, if you are still afraid. You can wait a few months and see. I'm not here for pump and dump.Yes, I'm working alone and in full control of the project. Oh so are you planning to have this documented or visible on the public too? Like purchase order and the facility reveal? I think thats a lot of money to spend, yeah definitely will need to wait for that progress to see the full dedication first.You dont have a team working on this? Only you, how can you possibly make this successful alone.",
