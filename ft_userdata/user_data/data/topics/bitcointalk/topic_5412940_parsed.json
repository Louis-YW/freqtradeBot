RIP Queen Elizabeth.But damn!  Anything can be monetized these days with meme tokens even the death of the Queen. If  blockchain was already alive when Micheal Jackson died, the internet will be full of meme coins already with his image doing the moonwalk. It was sort of a debate during that time when Micheal's death was monetized by spreading articles about the controversial death.",

Those manipulators and pumpers resemble vultures. The most heartbreaking aspect of everything is that someone is preparing to spend his hard earned money in these scam project in the hopes of becoming rich quickly. Extremely pitiful.",

If they can do that, they can also take advantage of this sad yet huge news and try to make money. After all, they're not the ones who killed the queen. They're simply making use of her death to scam innocent people for their money. These people have no guilt. You can't expect anything from these cretins.",

As long as they earn a large amount of money, these opportunists are really good and smart, and they are good at timing.Knowing that Queen Elizabeth is popular they were able to take advantage of the opportunity to raise a large amount of money in the world of crypto space in just a few hours under the ERC20 and Binance smart chains.Imagine the Queen Elizabeth Inu immediately processed 700k$ with a trading volume of 200k$ and as of writing this immediately increased by 23, 271% on the Binance smart chain and also increased by 3708% on Uniswap and the save the queen token by 1517%, the size of the earnings of these opportunists is extreme.These are meme coins or shitcoins, but if you have the time to suddenly pump, you will be an instant millionaire. I hope I can have time to pump the meme coins I'm holding.",
