  "content": "I saw a lot of drama in this forum regarding meriting alt accounts. I saw some people also got tagged because they merited their alt accounts. Forum members believe this is not a good practice. I can gather up a lot of harsh replies from the community when someone merited their alt account. But, I will not spend my time there since almost everyone thinks the same. As I also noticed, Meriting alt is not a merit abuse according to forum rules. But, Moderators discourage users not to doing this.When you check Bitcointalk Stats From Here,You will see that philipma1957 Is the Number 1 Top poster on this forum. He has made over 39241+ Posts in this forum since his registration date (With this account only). He is an DT1 Member. He is Top 2 in the Most Recognized Member. He is Number 21 On the Most Trusted Member list. He is number 17 in both Most Activity and Most Merited members.He already has four accounts (5 from now)philipma1957 DT1Philipma1957cellphone DT2Philipma1957onvacationphilipma1957laptopWith the philipma1957 account, He included his cellphone account on his trust list which makes his cellphone account DT2 (I guess it's allowed).philipma1957 Trusts these users' judgement:26.

Almost 40K posts are no joke. But, My question is- When a low ranked user gets caught by others meriting his alts, I see DT members give harsh replies and expose them in a toxic way. Some of them Added them to the Distrust list and also some DT members tag them. No offence to philipma1957. But, I want to see how they react when it comes to the Top Contributor of this forum.",

I would have not done that in his place (and if I would have had alts) even if that would have been meaning that for example I would not be able to post images, but being harsh on him for this would be really silly.Hence I don't know why you are so keen to create this unnecessary drama.",

Have some balls, it's not illegal to ask a question even if it might piss off a DT user. With that being said, I do not think it's right to merit am alt account. If the OP were to do it, I'm sure some DT would tag him/her for it. I don't feel like Philipma sent merit to abuse the system as it was only 1 merit. Maybe so when he hit Jr he could post images, who knows. I also think it's wrong to include your alt in DT/trust lists but there are multiple DT users that have done so I think. Hilariousandco is the only 1 I specifically remember. Whether I feel any of these actions are right or wrong, it does come down to a case by case thing. Older established members with nothing to gain will not get tagged, whereas newbie or lower ranked members will likely not get the benefit of doubt.",
