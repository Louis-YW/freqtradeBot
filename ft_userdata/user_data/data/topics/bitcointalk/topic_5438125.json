  "content": "hello,I understood that Ichimoku Cloud is the best and single indicator that gives an idea about future move of the market compared to the rest of lagging indicators.What's your own experience with it for intra-day trading? It works best for lower volatility coins like BTC or you had good experience with any altcoin?Which are the settings your using? When do you open and close a position?thanks",
