How much BTC you own is not something you publicly announce here on the forum, or anywhere else, especially to people who know you personally.Another advice would be storage methods. Since you're on the forum, you'll probably know the most recommended wallet softwares are electrum and Bitcoin core. For higher amounts of Bitcoin, it would be wise to invest in a hardware wallet.",

Since you're on the forum, you'll probably know the most recommended wallet softwares are electrum and Bitcoin core. For higher amounts of Bitcoin, it would be wise to invest in a hardware wallet.For frequent transactions, hardware wallet would be advisable. Or a watch-only wallet (watch-only wallet for tracking transaction, generating unsigned transaction and also for broadcasting signed transaction), and its cold storage (for transaction signing).For save keeping, also other cold wallets generated on airgapped devices are recommendable. I mean paper wallet generated on airgapped device, and also a wallet on airgapped device. As long as the person is not spending from it. He can just be tracking transactions with watch-only wallet using master public key import.",

Having more knowledge is essential but experience is also a key to be on this game. Most of the users are simply doing dca and this is good chance for us since the price of bitcoin is tanking. We dont know how long it will stay at that price so we just keep accumulating until the price appreciated and we could sell and gain some sats in a longer period.

So better keep your profit in private so that there's no disturbance on your growth and you can continue what you are doing smoothly away from people who always want to take advantage on newbies who's exploring more opportunities and exploit them.",

But what upgrade00 said to you that its better to keep quiet and hold your satoshi or BTC privately because not just compulsory that you will be announce what you've reach or how many BTC you have in your wallet and its better to be safe because nowadays if we talk about money many people will interested to scam you even your closet friends so you need to be careful and double your security.",
