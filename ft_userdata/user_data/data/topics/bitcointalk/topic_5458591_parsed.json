If you go and tell them that Bitcoin does give money quick, then they will definitely be thinking of making quick money out of the investment, and if the market goes the other way around, you will be the one to be responsible because you didnâ€™t tell them the risk involved.If you want to preach or introduce Bitcoin to someone, then you need to make it clearer by explaining how the Bitcoin market works so they will know the risk involved.",

That is just trading. If you are an investor, you should have at least 6 months in mind before selling any of your bitcoin holding. Six months is just a short term investment. Thinking to go longer may be better, holding for like 2 years. Holding some of your bitcoin for 10 years and life time is also a good idea as a store of value. The more the world adopts it, the more the valuation.The problem so people have is that they do not have enough knowledge about bitcoin investment. So people may rush in and rush out and advice their family or friends to invest and not telling them how risky it is. Although what I noticed among people is that they know that bitcoin is risky and that they know they can either gain or lose. But what I still notice about this people is that they fail to know the proper time to invest in bitcoin. Some people just have the fomo when the price has already pumped. Some get lucky but some invested at almost high price while bitcoin started to fall, and that makes them to be losing. Although, it is an unrealized loss. People should know one thing, if they invest during this time and bitcoin price decreased, it is an unrealized loss. They should not sell their bitcoin, they should just be patient and wait. One thing about bitcoin is that it has not disappointed people yet and reaching all-time-high. So people should expect that bitcoin will surpassed $30000 again. Even possible that six digits could be reached in the next bull run after halving.Bitcoin in long term can be a store of value and a profitable asset. People may be disappointed with short term speculation and trading.",

Them no understand how the process be and how the market dey go and where some people dey get am wrong when dem dey talk to people about bitcoin be say Dem no dey tell Dem raw as the bitcoin market be so that Dem go save themselves the stress of Â accusations.If you are teaching people about bitcoin, it should be in your best interest of telling them everything raw. Do not hide it or want to cover anything as it requires one investing their funds because if anything should happen and it resulting to them making loss, believe me they would come after you. Do not press or talk them into investing but rather how it works and the risk involved so they would know before time to save you some stress.",

Bitcoin is a prominent project in the space and have made people financial stable and have also send so many people to trenches. We're use to it, we got the experience and everything at our disposal, the only thing left for us is to gather enough knowledge and knows basically how the market operates.

Even if you take your time to explain the concept of bitcoin bit by bit to some people, their main focus will still be on the outcome of that investment and how soon it will happen and the possibility of it happening soon. The long time reward is enticing but not everybody has the patient for it to grow till then. I strongly feel that for one to be successful in teaching someone about bitcoin on the positive and negative aspect of it, the person youâ€™re teaching must learn the virtue of being patient before they can invest into it. Bitcoin is no shit coin that is controlled by their inventors, it is a dependable and reliable cryptocurrency for people to invest in unlike shit coins that can exist the market at anytime.",
