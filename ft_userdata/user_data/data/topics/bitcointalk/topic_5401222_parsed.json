  "content": "Hello my friends,Today I wanted to introduce you to a project I've been working on for a few months and it's finally time to go live with it. I would be happy if you take the time to look at the project All in all, it's about a Crypto Safe that stores your data in encrypted form (AES-256 block cipher). This includes accounts, passwords, notes and soon also files and bitcoin wallets that you can generate with one click.If you have any questions about the development or want to know more details, then let me know!Long story short, here is the website (there is already an iPhone app - an Android app and a Chrome extension will be available soon):https://crypto-safe.ioiPhone App: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cryptosafe-your-secure-safe/id1624789739Thanks and have a nice day!BTC",

      "body": "Not a good idea so far. I don't even store by password and seed phrase on any online device. So how will I use your site to store wallet credentials even its open source? Anything could happen at any time over the internet, so I can't trust a third-party website for storing credentials. Rather than I always use my notebook in real life to store everything related to crypto. So even if I forget credentials my notebook helps to recover my wallets or accounts. And plagiarism content is an unprofessional move so far. It look like another red sign for users. I am not a fan of that kind of service.",

I won't forget my passwords, I won't give any of it to anyone, and I won't trust anyone to keep them for me. Ever!QuoteStoring your passwords with us is much more secure and convenient than other solutions.This is a lie. Storing passwords with anyone online is not more secure than my current solution.QuoteWe use the AES-256 block cipher for encrypting your details securely.Also activate the 2-Factor authentication for maximum security.So access to my passwords depends on a third party? Let's not!I clicked Create Account to see what data you ask, but nothing happened in Tor browser.If I manually go to https://crypto-safe.io/user/register, I get:QuoteAn error occurred during execution; please try again later.I guess that's for the best.
