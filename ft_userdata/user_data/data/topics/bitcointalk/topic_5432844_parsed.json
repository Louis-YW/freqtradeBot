  "content": "Hi,i'm a huge fan of the DJ Hero series, it's a great game in my opinion. The only thing that isn't that great are the turntables; Them broke easy. So i wanted to create a case out of wood (i've asked a friend of mine for that). But now comes the neat part: i don't want a simple wood case on which i fix the turntable, i want to make some accessoires with LEDs. Like some blue LEDs around which turn on, when i press the euphoria button and some other blue LEDs, red LEDs and green LEDs which turn on, when i press the (green/red/blue) buttons. It would also be great that they make some tripy effects when i scratch or something like that. Has someone an idea on how to realise this? Is this idea even possible?I know i would need some sensor for the Wii remote which controlls then the LEDs. Now i'm no electrical engineer (i learned a bit at school but wasn't that good tbh). So if someone could tell me what parts i need to buy and how to build everything, that would be great.Also there needs to be some programming to do (i imagine), that the LEDs know what to do, when a button gets pressed. I've also learbed some programming at school but there i also wasn't that good^^ So if someone could write me that code would be great Now to the rewards:For the programming part i would give away 200$ in BTC (if there is more to do, i'm also willing to give away more BTC)For the electronic part with LEDs, Sensors and what ever, i would give away 60$ in BTC if you can provide me links to the needed items and a manual on how to assemble themI would suggest that everyone who wants to help me should send me a PM and i will comment here if i've found one who helps me with part one/part two, to let you know. Thanks for your help everyone ---Edit: would be nice if someone could help me who has also a Wii and DJ Hero for testing purposes.",

      "body": "It sounds like you have an interesting project in mind! It's definitely possible to add LED lighting to your DJ Hero turntable controller, and to have the LEDs respond to different buttons being pressed on the controller.To get started, you will need:LEDs (in the colors you want to use)A microcontroller (such as an Arduino) to control the LEDsSensors to detect when buttons are pressed on the controllerA power supply for the LEDs and microcontrollerWiring to connect everything togetherAs for programming, you will need to write code to control the microcontroller and the LEDs. The code will need to read the input from the sensors and turn the LEDs on or off accordingly.To get more specific guidance on what parts to buy and how to assemble them, it would be helpful to know more about your skill level and experience with electronics and programming. Based on what you've mentioned, it might be helpful for you to start with some online tutorials or courses to learn the basics of microcontrollers and programming before diving into this project. There are many resources available online that can help you learn the necessary skills, and once you have a better understanding of the concepts involved, it will be easier to get specific guidance on your project.Here is an example of code that you could use to control an LED using an Arduino microcontroller:int LED_pin = 13; // LED is connected to digital pin 13void setup() {  // Set the LED pin as an output  pinMode(LED_pin, OUTPUT);}void loop() {  // Turn the LED on  digitalWrite(LED_pin, HIGH);  // Wait for 1 second  delay(1000);  // Turn the LED off  digitalWrite(LED_pin, LOW);  // Wait for 1 second  delay(1000);} This code will cause the LED to turn on for 1 second, then turn off for 1 second, in a continuous loop.To modify this code to respond to button presses on your controller, you will need to add some additional code to read the input from the button sensors and turn the LED on or off accordingly. You could use a similar approach to the one shown above, using an if statement to check the sensor input and turn the LED on or off based on the sensor reading.I hope this example helps to give you an idea of how you might approach the programming for your project. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further guidance.",

Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further guidance.Hi, thanks for your answer So my skills are not that good, i understand your code perfectly, also the if statement is some kind of logical to me. But i've never soldered for example. This was part of the first class which i have skipped (since i made a carieer change). In the second and third class we always made this with a pinboard. I also don't own a soldering iron. Also i didn't know much about on how to connect everything. I guess if you give me a wiring diagram the most part i would understand. But some things i might would ask. For the parts needed:LEDs: no problem, it's one of the easiest thingsWiring: also easyMicrocontroller: should also be easy; if a Raspberry Pi would also do it (which it should), i have one at homeSensor: thats the neat part - which sensor? As far as i've read it should be a bluetooth sensor, but is every bluetooth sensor compatible or only some specific?Looking forward to hear from you Edit: i guess i also need some resistors for the LEDs, right?",
