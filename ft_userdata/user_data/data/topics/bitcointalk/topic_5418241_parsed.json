This doesn't make much sense to me, not to buy again if you are so sure that we won't go back to 18k. But I guess you haven't since you are not buying. :p Last time I made similar mistake was back in mid 2019 when I tried to be smart and \"sell high buy low\" and in the end I ended up doing the opposite thing, which made me realize that trading is not for me and I guess its not for you either so better stick to hodl if you don't have the stomach for it.Having said that, I do think that there is a solid chance we go back to 18k, and below. Quote from: NotATether on October 25, 2022, 07:56:04 AM meaning we will never see $17K again (sorry Bitcoin to zero doomers).Hah, many said that for 19k as well. And I don't think that those who think that there is a chance for bitcoin going below 18k automatically think its going to zero.",

Even $18000 has been a very strong support. Let us see what would happen before the end of this year, but very possible bull market will begin by next year or some days or weeks before. Not an advice but a guess.Profit is more guaranteed if you hold, instead of creating a short position.",

We cannot tell yet if the bottom was touched, however, I also agree that betting on 17k was pretty much foolish (under 20k there seem to be much better chances upwards than downwards).Yep, best would be to buy back, and although \"market pumping like crazy\" is not actually correct, not for Bitcoin, I feel like the opportunity window (for buying back cheap) may get very small.However, please do your own thinking and do with your money as you decide, not by what I'm writing.

Good luck to all, i hope you're smarter than meIsn't strange that you are holding bitcoin since 2020. This means you did not sell anything in the 2021 bull run. Bitcoin was at 60,000$ , 50,000$ and even at 30,000$ you still not sold. I wonder why u become so panic at 18'000$ and sold everything?Didn't you have believed the bitcoin will again go to all time high in its next bull run. You have held bitcoin for 2 years, you could have held them for another two years.",

Good luck to all, i hope you're smarter than meSorry to hear this but from what you said, you have been hodling your BTC since 2020 so you definitely would be in some profit even as you have sold which was obviously a mistake because if you look at all relevant Bitcoin price chart, the market is basically around the bottom which would have suggested continuing to hodl, but we all make mistakes and since we can establish that, it will be good to buy back cos even IF the market might go down, it might not really be that much againQuote from: NotATether on October 25, 2022, 07:56:04 AMI suggest you buy back your BTC now before prices shoot back up because the logarithmic rainbow charts are already putting this current price in \"Basically a fire sale\", even almost breaking below that color line - meaning we will never see $17K again (sorry Bitcoin to zero doomers).And I agree, we can clearly see what @NotATether is talking about there, and even though the market could go below, I still think we are around the bottom.",

That's indeed pretty absurd. Especially considering your obvious weakness on the technicals. I'd like to hear your reasoning on why you thought this was a good idea. Did you have any particular goal in mind when making this decision? Did you want to buy it back at a lower price or what?Oh well, each to his own, I guess. Personally, I've never had much patience, so I made a few buys/sells here and there during this period (and lost a bit as well). But I'm sure you're aware, bitcoin is a very volatile asset. You can't just buy it and expect to see a constant upward trend in price. If you're not willing to take risks, I suggest staying away from bitcoin. But remember, there is no free lunch in this world. You can't have security and high returns on your investments at the same time.",

You can sell in the event that either you have reached the price that you planned, or you want to sell some part of your investment in order to buy something, as a reward for yourself. The speculative sale of bitcoin is already trading, and in this case, the risks of losing your coins will increase significantly. There is still a chance that the price will drop lower, but this is already a lottery, no one knows whether this will happen or not.",

Good luck to all, i hope you're smarter than meI don't understand, did you actually short bitcoins or did you only sell all your coins? If you bought your coins in 2020 and sold them now you should have at least made a profit and have 0 exposure now. That's alright you are not losing any money when bitcoin rises again, but you are also not making any profit. In case you actually are short and have a negative exposure to bitcoins, I would recommend you cover your position immediately. It's not really realistic for bitcoins to fall in price. Your potential upside is very limited whereas your downsize is huge. I wouldn't take that risk. You sold almost at the 52 week low, which is never a good idea. Hope you learned from your mistake and will not repeat it. Good luck for your next trade.",
