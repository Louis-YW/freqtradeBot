Some have believed that free money is possible, if the money is free as they claim, what need is it for people to claim with money. This guy's are taking advantage of newbie in the Crypto space to make money with their deception. There is no free money anywhere, any such promise is a scam. Any free offer that is based on big sum of money is questionable. Same thing goes to new Crypto investment platform with unimaginable ROI. Institutions/companies that have made it big have not at any time share those big sum of money to people without anything offered in return. One need to be wise in this desperate moments of sunden wealth.",

At then whatever thing around me I don't understand including some kinds of telegram inbox messages for investment and the rest I do consults trusted people whom I think were very clever than me.Ponzi scheme is a no go area for me even though they are 10 Billions Naira per day I don't put my ass over there because I know certainly it must crashed and people who are just coming would fall victim of it. As matter of fact this forum has given me an edge to easily understand phish out fake investment platform.",

So I had to wait till now as I checked the local board i saw this post then I remembered I saw similar thing I had to check but it is no more in the bitcoin discussion board and it seems moderator deleted it because it was having key phrase as you have said here. Just what you explained here replicated itself.  And the scammer mentioned the amount on the wallet together without the key phrase so that a desperate novice could fall easily for their tricks.OP you did a nice job by exposing them here. Atleast we know how they operate now. Newbies can take caution from this update now.",

I have come across this scam twice befor, the first one was an unknown user sending me log in details to a wallet that contains thousands in USTD, coins but since I already know this scam attempt I quickly blocked the user, another time was through emails and this time about 3 bitcoin were in the wallet and the guy says I should pay the fees to get the wallet unlock, but since I have not work to earn such amount in Bitcoin, I quitley told the guy to keep his money that I am not interested. So newbies have to be careful to note that cryptocurrency is trustless, and you should never send your money to people you meet online with verifications.",

      "body": "LOL, you know, my friend, it's just circumstance that makes people fall victim to some kind of sophisticated scam, but having to fall victim to some pretty cheap scam like this one is just bad. I know some times an absolute lack of experience can cause us to fall victim, but when you come across this sort of scam, the first thing to enter your mind is, \"Does anyone really come online to showcase such a huge amount of money to people, if not just to entice and scam one\". Or \"is there a way a reasonable thing comes so easily?\" There is no very profitable thing that comes so easily; good things come with a lot of effort, time, energy, and smart thinking, but I am glad you are experienced about this now and are also warning others.I can say that in the past, my friend scammed a scammer who wanted to scam him. How did it happen? It happened that day that he received a message on Telegram from an unknown TG user who asked him to help him with the gas fee in Tron so that he could withdraw a token in the wallet he showed my friend, and he promised that he would give my friend about $1k worth of the token if he succeeded in withdrawing the token, which was worth $20k+. So my friend entered a CEX and purchased Tron coin, but in that exchange the minimum Tron withdrawal is above $10, so my friend took a screenshot and sent it to him, telling him that he had just spent $10 to purchase Tron but could not withdraw it because the minimum withdrawal is about $20. This foolish scammer foolishly sent an extra $10 to the address my friend sent him, and my brother blocked him. That's all I cam remember. Let's be more careful and never fall into these cheap scams; they were very popular in 2018 and 2019.",

I understand how zealous they are when such an opportunity gets to their hands couple with way things are going on with our country they felt is real and they are eagerly wanting to utilize such opportunities, and wonderful offer it seems to them. Well any newbie can escape such attempt if they removed greed because most times is greed of getting rich that always ends them up getting into being scammed by a common cheap scammer.",

As a normal human being one should be able to detect a scam and do away with it immediately to avoid the unfortunate to happen but out of desperation, greed and selfish interest, it seems like being bent on getting the fish out of the hook which ends up catching them in.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on May 11, 2023, 05:34:14 AMI can say that in the past, my friend scammed a scammer who wanted to scam him.

That's all I cam remember.Your friend was very smart and lucky enough to plot his own scheme very fast upon realizing the person he was chatting with is a scammer.  I guess the scammer was thinking your friend was a mugu to have fallen for his tricks of sending him the Tron so he quickly sent it to your friend to convince him but forgot the scheme he himself was trying to plot. He now became the victim of his own plans.That serves him right. In his next sojourn he will never think of it to any random person's the feel will fall for their gimmicks.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on May 11, 2023, 05:34:14 AM Let's be more careful and never fall into these cheap scams; they were very popular in 2018 and 2019.Newbies are more likely to be prone to all these tricks as they have no idea and experience on how the system works so they are likely to fall for them.
