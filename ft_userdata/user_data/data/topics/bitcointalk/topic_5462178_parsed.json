Quote from: couplecomedytv on September 11, 2023, 05:57:57 PMSubscribers approaching 160k , Offer still stands. Based on the overall appearance of your channel and also its stats on the social blade, I don't think that's the reason behind this sale [e.g. some of them appear to be inorganic views and subscribers], but regardless of that, you probably have a better chance of finding a potential buyer in the following sub-board: Marketplace (India)- While you're at it, you might want to also mention if you're fine with using escrow services for this sale.",

The channel is 100% organic and you can see inconsistency in posting because of my current job now it is really hard to put enough efforts to create quality long videos.",
