In my opinion this is bad for long term but those who have bought early already made bunch of money.",

It's not a good altcoin for now. HEX is quite stable even during the bearish market and that means the return will be low compared with the tokens that dumped even deeper than it. It will better to buy crypto which has been dumped so hard. The return will be more. Precisely. Don't buy anything that doesn't move in this bear market or you will just end with the same amount and value at the end of the day. Investing is supposed to be making more in the future. Might as well go to the bank if you are looking for stability. About HEX, if there are bad rumors like that, you might want to double check. Some rumors are true and being discussed in different platforms like discord or here in the forum. You won't lose anything just by deep checking and you are trying to lessen the risk you are taking. You could just buy BTC now for it holds a good history of going back up in a short span of time.",

So before it was and now it isn't? I don't think that there's a pyramid scheme that has been known to be one before and became not anymore just after a year or two. It won't change that status that quickly or forever.",

Like if you've got those bored ape then they can be said as good for long term holding.The rest of the NFT market is good as flipping as fast as you can because they're highly volatile just like the crypto market. That's my take for bored ape NFTs and near to its ranking.",

I have heard about this altcoin for a long time now even while many believe its a pyramid scheme project but it doesn't look like one anymore, what do you think about HEX project let's discuss.HEX is ranked at 201, quite not a good position. Investors never look to the bottom, that is why they don't consider this project valuable compared to others. However, seeing the performance of this project isn't that bad until the bear season comes and it moves that price drops. But this is not how people will choose coins for investment, it seems more advantageous to pick coins that are on the top rank (at least top 20) as going to believe that they will sustain long-term.",

The demand for NFT is also very difficult to find that. This is different with the token that is pretty similar to the shares that owned by the company and that make sense for people wanna try to use it for their long term investment. NFTs was so bad for long term except the popular NFT but this asset is also can't be liquidated easily. Can you still consider nft as investment? i wanna say no for this",

One of my acquaintances got older brother Hex. But he left a few and sold the rest.Today he got a lot of money from that Hex.That's why I say that every cryptocurrency should not be sold out completely. I have never seen a coin grow like this Hex.The price of a stage was much lower. Each coin was priced at 0.00056. Those who bought this time but now own enough money.It's good to hold on, but it's a couple of projects. The projects we hold have never seen such growth.",

The best thing to do, is target alt coins that have potential value to explore in the nearest future, then put your capital as investment in the coin. Then watch your capital turn into something Hugh at the end of a period of time. It's all about patience to wait for the altcoins to target a bullish movement. Whenever the cons dip, keep on bagging, buy as much quantities as possible inother to gain Profits later on.",

Any altcoin is pretty bad when it comes to holding for the long term, you're better off basing your trading plans in the short term with altcoins so as to prevent losses down the road.
