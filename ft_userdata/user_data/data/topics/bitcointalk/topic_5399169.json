That will give you a clear answer to all these questions.Here's a website that provides links to all the emails, source code, and posts that Satoshi did when creating Bitcoin: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.orgOnce you read them you'll understand Bitcoin much better than the vast majority of people.",
