  "content": "Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are all exploring the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in their payment systems.-Â  Â  Â Visa is exploring the use of blockchain technology to process recurring payments using smart contracts on the Ethereum network.-Â  Â  Â Mastercard has announced a new platform called Artist Accelerator, which will allow musicians to grow their brand and increase fan engagement in the Web3 space.-Â  Â  Â American Express is exploring the use of blockchain technology to improve security and efficiency in their payment systems.These developments show that major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly adopting blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. This is a positive sign for the future of crypto and its potential to become more mainstream. It's worth noting that these developments are just a small sample of the progress being made in the crypto space, and in the future, many customers may not even know they are using blockchain technology.Will Visa customers care that the company is using blockchain to improve efficiency? No. Theyâ€™ll be happy with lower transaction fees while continuing to use their cards.Will musicians even realize theyâ€™re using blockchain technology on Mastercardâ€™s Artist Accelerator platform? No. Theyâ€™ll be grateful if it increases their fanbases.Customers donâ€™t care how the tech works. They just want better products at cheaper prices. And thatâ€™s what blockchain will offer.",

Nowadays such news almost don't have any impact at all anymore on the markets and also on the price of the projects. Also i have to say that if you read those news, than it is also obvious, that those companies are only exploring the possibility to use blockchain technology for certain products or functions that they are offering. So it is not like that they are already starting to really use blockchain. That being said, it is still good news that they are investigating the possibilities of blockchain.",

Discussions about implementation of payment giants in cryptocurrency have been going on for years and I think that it will be good for the whole industry, there will be even more adopting, but I am not sure that it will happen in the nearest future. Maybe a full-fledged launch of such projects will be in 2024-2025, but in the meantime these companies will need to solve a lot of regulatory and legal issues.",

Either by developing their own blockchain, or following the currently available blockchain. Rejecting crypto is the same as rejecting technological developments. Of course this can not be done by anyone. Crypto will be one of the last solutions for financial transactions. Financial companies will abandon all current transactions and switch to crypto.",

But if they are planning to use anything from an existing cryptocurrency, that might become an issue. It will block the network and cause an surge in fees. Not really ideal. Big corporates are good for reputation of the crypto market, but that's not preferred as they can easily manipulate the market with the money they have as their backup.",
