  "content": "What do you think is the ideal bitcoin price?I've read predictions of people who believe bitcoin will be worth $100,000, some believe bitcoin will reach $1 millionLet's calculate the price of bitcoin when aligned with goldThe total amount of Gold [2016] : 244,000,000 kgs sourceThe total amount of Bitcoin : 21,000,000 btcGold : 244,000,000 kgs x $48,000/kg = $11,712,000,000,000Bitcoin : 21,000,000 btc x $30,000/btc = $630,000,000,000If the gold marketcap is divided by the number of bitcoins then:$11,712,000,000,000 : 21,000,000 btc = $557,714/btc   [Current price of bitcoins $30,000/btc] If the bitcoin marketcap is divided by the number of gold then:$630,000,000,000 : 244,000,000 kgs = $2,581/kg   [Current price of gold $48,000/kg]So the current bitcoin price is too cheap or the gold price is too expensive? or should bitcoin price be $557,714 and bitcoin head there?The number of people on earth = 8,000,000,000 [2022] ~ sourceThe number of bitcoins divided by the number of people on earth21.000.000 : 8,000,000,000 = 0.002625 btcThe number of gold divided by the number of people on earth244.000.000 : 8,000,000,000 = 0.0305 kgSo the amount of bitcoin is only 1/11.5 of the amount of gold. Bitcoins are rarer. Even though we believe bitcoin is gold in the future, So, bitcoin can have a price of 11.5 x $557,714/btc",

I was shocked while reading the calculations, like one side of my mind was thinking what types of calculations are these and what could be the purpose of it and my other side was just reading the post. Well, you could use the factor of scarcity between Gold and BTC. Which would help you out to differentiate which one is the most rare. And the answer is BTC. Because no one knows how much gold is still buried under the earth's crust but we do know how much BTC is above the ground. If i wants to go with your calculations then they are outdated like the data you are using for 2022 and according to that the final multiplication of 11.5 to 557.714 will be around $60k to $65k and believe me. 90% of the crypto users have already made predictions that BTC will cross $70k easily and your calculations proved it right also.",

Yes, bitcoin is an honest and freedomed cryptocurrency, but we live in a material world and gold is material, unlike bitcoin. And the fact is that from time immemorial lyuli loved gold. It is beautiful, even if not practical, and we all tremble before it. Understand: in the worst of times, people prefer to store their savings in gold. It's a safe haven currency. Unfortunately, in bad times, people sell bitcoin. This is the reality at the moment.Therefore BTC price is lower that 550k i think.",

Actually I was taking the numbers as decimal number so I thought it as a point like 2.1 or 2.33 etc. It would be helpful if you would use coma instead of full stop because I think in mathematics both have some differences. But these differences are ignored in many field but in writing down calculations. It would be important to not to misuse the terms. I hope you wouldn't mind me.",

But there is something I just noticed about this thread, as it lack proper use of punctuation marks in your figures, because the position of a dot or comma in a figure alters the meaning of that figure.Example;244.000.000 simply means Two hundred & forty-four, while, 244,000,000 means Two hundred & forty-four million.As the use of dot or comma in different position of a figure alters the entire meaning of it.",

If that change happens, price is going up alot because we are still so tiny vs other world wide assets traded.Some think vs monetary base in dollars, gold could reach 10k per ounce which is extraordinary when it was sub 1k for so long.   But thats founded on the monetary base expansion, QE and inflation etc.  so maybe its reasonable though only a few estimate 10k but if BTC has even a slight amount of that effect its likely to move far more with less effort required or capital required to do so.",
