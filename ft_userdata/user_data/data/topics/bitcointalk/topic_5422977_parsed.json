All centralized coin e.g. ETH, BNB, USDC, USDT etc that run in ETH or BNB network can track anyone IP address and it's bad for your privacy.",

      "body": "Metamask is a non-custodial wallet but it is a wallet that stores altcoins and altcoins represent centralization, so this won't affect your privacy too much meaning once you've used altcoins your privacy is gone. But with this move showing an increasingly centralization trend spreading in the market, this is alarming. Organizations are probably under pressure from the government so they can do nothing but obey orders. Lucky to see that Satoshi made the right decision 14 years ago, if he revealed his identity perhaps bitcoin would also become centralized.",

Is FTX incident haven't teach us enough lessons? What if bad actors got employed to Metamask team and they start carrying out attacks on people's home and addresses? Yes, don't blame me for thinking this way. I need to, we can't trust the government and now it looks like crypto companies are also in the government.",

It is worth thinking about using a VPN.Well, what problem that may arise to be exact? Did you suppose that using VPN will be okay even if the user address is logged?If some users truly want to achieve privacy, there is no reason for any transaction that is tied to potentially identifiable information like IP or address to be okay to be logged. Naturally, the SPV wallet and the ecosystem of ETH itself are concertedly centralized, we can look at things like OFAC, the merge, etc. The way forward for ETH itself seems did not prioritize decentralization.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 25, 2022, 10:38:01 AMwhy is a wallet that's supposed to be fully decentralised tracking users location and data? A wallet is not supposed to decentralize. You might want to comprehend what the word actually means.",

It's a condemnable invasion of privacy and we should all stay away from it. And we chose crypto to solve that problem but in the end centralization is a contagious disease with no way to stop it. It won't be a problem if they just collect our IP address and ETH wallet as we can use a VPN but this is just the beginning and I'm afraid they will do more in the future.",

As long as it was not collecting your privatekey and this will be fine for me. The only problem once metamask was starting to collect sensitive data related with the privatekey owned by the users. That will be a big problem. Tracking IP was a common thing. There are so many sites were also tracking another thing like geo location.
