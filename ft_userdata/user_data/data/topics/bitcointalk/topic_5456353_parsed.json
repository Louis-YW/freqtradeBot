  "content": "I've tested Virtualbox with Linux Mint & Bitcoin on Windows 11 but didn't want to connect SSD in external USB so uninstalled it. I love learning about bitcoin so in my next fun & learning I've ran Bitcoin Core 25.0 QT with Electrum Personal Server on Windows 11. I'm using full blockchain on Bitcoin QT wallet with Electrum Personal Server faultlessly. The command prompt shows it's connected it shows the first addresses from the MPK. I had to make changes so it's functioning now.I've unchecked the Select server automatically box & added localhost in different configs. The network alert in Electrum desktop wallet isn't green it resides red meaning it isn't connected to Electrum Personal Server.localhost:50002localhost127.0.0.1:50002127.0.0.1I'm stuck because I can't make Electrum desktop wallet work on localhost it doesn't connect. Bitcoin Core is working & Electrum Personal Server is connected to Bitcoin I don't know what I'm doing wrong. If you've worked Electrum EPS, Electrum wallet & Bitcoin Core QT on Windows flawlessly please tell me how your configurations are set.",

An attacker could potentially link your transactions to your IP address. See here for more info: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Tor_and_tor_broadcastingTo avoid this, you can either run your node via Tor, or you can choose to run your node via clearnet but broadcast your transactions via Tor. For this second option, you need to do two things:1 - Add walletbroadcast=0 to your bitcoin.conf file. This will stop your node from broadcasting your own transactions.2 - In your EPS config.ini file, navigate to where it says broadcast_method = tor-or-own-node and change it to broadcast_method = tor.Any transactions you make via Electrum via EPS will now be broadcast to random nodes over Tor only.",

I've understood walletbroadcast=0 stops my node from broadcasting my own transactions so Electrum's going to do it with 127.0.0.1, 50002 or 127.0.0.1, 9150 on tor. That's helpful advice. I'm firm my IP address wasn't leaked in Electrum it's localhost so stopping Bitcore Core from broadcasting transactions stops leaks. I'll post after it's been tested.",
