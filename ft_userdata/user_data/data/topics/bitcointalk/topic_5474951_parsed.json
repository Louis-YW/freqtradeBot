It doesn't matter if the investment amount is big or small. But to protect your funds you need to choose the right legitimate scheme to invest. If you are a new investor then it is better for you to invest small amount in the beginning. You have to be very careful if you choose altcoins for investment. So that you don't get scammed by investing in the wrong altcoin",

You can you use 50% to invest and use the remaining 50% to do small scale business to have income daily to sustain the cryptocurrency investment. Investment is a very good idea but you have to understand the implementations first before going into it so that you will not regret later. The $15000 is good amount of money to start a business or investment but you have to do your calculations very well before carrying out any project or investment.And if you want to use such amount to invest, I will also advise you to split it to invest in bitcoin and and any other good cryptocurrency project if you don't want to use some percentage to do business.",

Everything is in your hands and on how you're going to grow that money. It's not about how much you're going to invest but it's about how much your knowledge in what you're going to invest, that's what matters on this part and DYOR is a must. Likely, this is part of the DYOR that you're doing. As for suggestion, BTC, ETH and other solid altcoins that you think of at the top.",

Instead of asking for financial opinions, how about you do some research and maybe bring ideas for the forum members to help you compare and contrast? Idk for you but $5,000 (which is even the smallest on your list) is a huge money so to risk it, you have to be sure of what you are doing. Whatever crypto you hear the name of, do proper research, check the volatility nature, team members, etc. If you don't, you could hop onto a sinking ship and it'll swallow your money as it goes into the ground.",

I will only use the $5,000 capital for the investment, and then I will divide it among various crypto assets that are at least in the top 10 in the market.  But if I have no choice, even if it's $15,000, I will still split it into different cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. Maybe I will allocate the $5,000 to Bitcoin, and then I will divide the $10,000 among 10 crypto assets that have known potential that will follow the rise of Bitcoin, of course.",

These sums are hugh and it will certainly settle whatever business we have in the system. Five grand will go a long way in investment, the only stress involved is to calm down, and thoroughly DYOR on these projects before triggering any investment. There are numerous projects to invest in the system, we just have to stick to proper ones, most especially a project that have a good road map, which directly means a promising projects.",

IMO, 70% of Bitcoin and the rest is on potential altcoins, like SOLANA whose community is now quite happy with what they witnessed right now. There's no required amount of your capital, as long as you know the perfect timing of buying on it as told above the DCA way of investing in crypto would be the best idea overall.",

If we assume you have this money, you should determine how much you can afford to lose or risk in your investments. It is incorrect to invest your entire capital. $5,000 may be a significant capital for someone and a small capital for another person. It is also advisable to diversify your investments in different baskets and tokens. Also, you will find some advice here, but the investment decision is ultimately yours to make after conducting your own research. As for the best currencies to invest in, which are considered promising investments, include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and some leading altcoins in the market, away from exchange-backed currencies, meme coins, and new projects.",

Maybe then you would get more money.So for me, you only have that, it's best to invest in yourself and then a business.",

Everything is dumping now and i think that this will be slowly recovering back again at the top. This is giving us another opportunity to invest, the smart people will be going to the top 200 cmc. It's caused by the potential owned by these top 200 cmc to recover is so big. Expecting another bounce to come after the drop and this is how crypto market works. The longer you investing during the bearish trend and the smaller you got from what you have invested. I think that anyone was seeing the bearish market as an opportunity to invest at this moment. The news about CZ stepping down as CEO has been also giving many people surprises. Binance has sorted out the problem with US. We will come back later again. You will see the price of token will be recovering so fast. Just wait a few days and everything will be green",

This is for short term. But if you are a low risk apetite guy then buy bitcoin but better to segregate your buying power like 300 monthly so you could average your buys cause it isnt sure what would be the lowest price or down of bitcoin or upside of it.",

With a capital of less than $20000, I think it can be an optimal plan to profit 10 times more after 3 years, clearing the first year of holding Bitcoin, then gradually switching to altcoins according to the price increase cycle.In reality, with that imagination, I think it would be better to research more new knowledge, accumulate more knowledge, and not just think of investing simply as money. Most people do not realize that the mistake of lack of knowledge is the reason why they lose money, so it does not matter how much they start with, but the investment becomes successful if the person starts practicing seriousness with the plan.",
