  "content": "I've seen a couple or so newbie accounts asking for a 'criteria' on how to choose an altcoin that would have the greatest potential to be a 1000x coin.I'm gonna throw around some ideas but as all of you already know, this is in no way financial advice.  This is just all for the lulz and it would be cool if you guys throw your own ideas in the mix too...  So here goes.Criteria to find the next 1000x coin:It must not be listed in any of the major exchanges.  This is not a hard rule but I noticed that 1000x coins are mostly unknown.It must have a dog logo.  What can I say, memecoins seem to go up by a lot more than the rest of the market.Be mindful of market cap.  The lower, the better.  If a coin's market cap is 100m, 1000x would be 100b.  Lol.  It would take a lot of money to pump it that high.  But if the market cap is just 1 million, 1000x would be 1 billion.  It's much more possible it could happen imho.That's it for now.Edit:  Great criteria here...Quote from: o48o on November 27, 2022, 04:33:46 PMI would like to add that it needs to be new token/coin that people haven't yet tweeted about, at least not too much. Preferably with no advertising bounties. Old projects under 10M marketcap have either died or something bad has happened behind the scene. Something that no one is interested in them, so unless you know some inside news about those, you are betting on a dead horse.Also no price talk on the channel gives a professional touch that makes me think it's already more mature and professional then 90% projects out there.",

Many newbies wants to get easy money right away which Is understand why, and in this bear market I can safely say that its impossible to happen, better wait for the next bull market.",

      "body": "Well your predictions is pretty cool but somehow arguable, why what if the project market is $1M and nothing much happened or no pump occur to get 1000x? The simple analogy here is no one knows a project that would even gets to that much and if it does then the project might likely be scam because after which dump follows immediately and may or may not survive a strong bear market just as few projects could stay for long run.Why does people look for 1000x project and what happened to those who bought when the token gets 1000x and dump on them don't you think their lives are stake and could lead to suicide?",

      "body": "I am not sure you can find the coin or token that can increase by 1000x, especially if they are not listed on the major exchange. We will miss that moment of the pump because it will be difficult to monitor all of those coins or tokens. Besides that, there are many small exchanges out there in which we can not have the chance to know what coins or tokens are. The other reason is the coin or token must have a dog logo. Well, that will not be easy to find as we know, there are many dog logos in the exchanges and we need to identify them one by one.But maybe you can try to check the Big eyes token. They are in the presale phase so you can try to buy the token while the price is low.",

Even if Elon hadn’t touched doge, it still had such a huge potential. Most people like me though, even though we sensed what’s going on, couldn’t believe that would actually happen. At some point doge almost reached $1 and few years ago it was like $0.0000xx. That’s 1000x and more.I can’t see any other coin with such potential anymore tbh. Doge came and went and most people missed it too. Sadface.",

If you are going to observe, most coins do have less than $100k in volume that's why it's easy for anyone to control the market. I actually don't look for x1000 coins but rather a coin that is good for long term as it is much secure and good investment rather than picking a dog coin or memecoin just for a quick money.",

The difficult was on trying to find that meme coin that will be supported by the community.It's difficult to know if what coin are going to 1kx its price but you can increase your chance of catching it if you based your picks on some criteria like the op have mentioned especially the coin with a low market cap or low supply. There is no science behind it but that is how stuff's work here in cryptos. Add in if the coin has a good utility because that is how it can drive a demand.People like to invest on them than gambling on coins with no utility or so called meme coins and shitcoins. Speaking of them, they are not only limited to dog but they can come in many form like for example we have world cup event now, so coins with football logo/theme are also coming out. They can sometimes pump too.",

I think that it can't even be considered as an investment as it doesn't have fundamental. let's see what's gonna happen with your investment. that will be pretty interesting to see how much return you will get. I have been taking some tokens from the market but i just need it to be 10x. I don't even expect a greater return than it. My take for the 1000x potential token is if you can't get this token at the ico or before it got pumped so hard and then for me that's impossible thing to happen. I hope you can wring what would be your maximim multipliers once the bulls will come back again.
