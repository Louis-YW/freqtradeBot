Should I pursue mining for a steady source of income, or would it be more beneficial to directly purchase coins with an eye on long-term potential?Let's do some mathS19 XP = $314510 x S19XP = $31450Ethernet cable, PC, and other accessories for configuration = $2000, So lets assume the total cost will be $35000Daily earnings from units will be $83 so you need to run 35000/83= 421.5 days to make the capital alone. Remember I didn't include the operational costs which is maintenance and cooling.And the price of bitcoin is highly volatile so your profits will be highly dependent on BTC price, Mining difficulty.I will prefer to buy the bitcoins directly instead of mining and accumulating over the years because I feel it is best choice especfially when we have low capital but the profits will not be steady as mining so I presented the calculation so you can decide which one suits for you based on your preference.",

But if budget is tight then maybe try to choose the second one since mining is so expensive and we are still not sure if we can earn,break even or totally at lose.",

Should I pursue mining for a steady source of income, or would it be more beneficial to directly purchase coins with an eye on long-term potential? It depends actually. Mining is lot more than just making profit. If you mine and keep selling them, there is no reason to buy mining gears. But, If you can pay the electricity costs from your pocket or you sell coins only to cover your electricity costs, then you should go for mining. We are around 278 days far from the next halving event. We are observing 29K at this moment which may get doubled before the halving. The current block reward is 6.25 which will be 3.125 after the halving. Mining is fun as well. Sometimes you need patience. I feel like your electricity cost is fairly low compared to the most part of the world.",

Thing is, mining is not just you plugging in asics and collecting satoshies but instead it is a constant responisbility, especially at the start when you are still figuring things out. Add on that the fact that equipment can die, price of electricity can go up or there might some other unforeseen circumstances which makes buying bitcoin even more logical.",

Maybe all the calculations you do give an idea of the expenses and income that you might get. But you should know that this is just a calculation and we don't know the actual conditions.As long as we are mining Bitcoin, electricity costs will never increase. Will the rewards we get always be like that and there won't be any changes? Many possibilities can happen after you start mining Bitcoin. You also have to calculate maintenance costs for mining tools and others, which you don't know how much.So my advice is that instead of buying those mining tools which cost a lot of money, you better use that money to buy Bitcoins on exchanges and hold them. That's to avoid everything you don't know while mining Bitcoin, including costs that can arise later. If you directly buy Bitcoins with that money, you can have many Bitcoins or you can use DCA to buy Bitcoins. But this is just a suggestion and all the decisions depend on you.",

      "body": "Both are beneficial between mining and one time investment. But if you want to invest your money potentially then I will suggest you to invest in Bitcoin as we are now in a Bear Market. So probably very soon we will see a huge pump or a bullish season. So in my opinion if your money is ready to invest then just buy Bitcoin and store it to a safest wallet which may be Hardware wallet or an open source non custodial wallet. Then when you make profits then do your mining setup. It's all about my opinion and you have to choose the most potential way to grow by doing own research. I just shared my observation or opinion.As your destination is to make profits that's why I want to add another option which is Trading. If you have passion on mining or can effort on it then go for mining and as already calculation have been posted so I don't need to add more. Another way is to invest half of your investment in Bitcoin for long term and you can do some short term trades with another half if you are good in it or well experienced. Obviously you must have a good knowledge in technical and fundamental analysis.",

I think for miners, it's not just all about the profit but of course, it has the biggest portion and reason on why they do that.

Many of us anticipate the next bull run to start sometime next year and reach its peak in 2025. Thus, rather than investing in hardware, I would choose to invest money directly in BTC. The money that would otherwise be spent on electricity can be used for dollar-cost averaging (DCA), so that I accumulate even more before the next bull run.",

There are many variables that turn mining from a profitable activity to forcing you to stop because of losses.There are additional factors other than electricity, which are space, cooling, capital recovery, depreciation, taxes, noise reduction, and can you sell mining tools later. Also, your country plays the effect of whether the weather will be good all year or if there are more risks.Therefore, the easiest option is to buy bitcoin, although it is less profitable, but a small gain is possible better than a lot of gain that is difficult to obtain.",

The most crucial component is electricity. Once you have this whether you are paying for it or you are using a renewable source of energy, consider mining. A reason I said this is because you get more bitcoins when you mine than when you just invest a large amount and hold, the bitcoin you have through direct investment will remain constant,",
