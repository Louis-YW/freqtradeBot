I will advice you as a newbie who wants to learn more about cryptocurrency to stick to bitcoin for now because,it is only bitcoin that is easy to make profit on,if you invest in a long term investment.

How can I differentiate an open source wallet from a close source wallet.Exchanges are using close source wallet,which allows them to be in charge of your coins and it is risky for an investor to leave his coins in an exchange because they can do away with your coins and you will have nobody to be held responsible for the loss. In a closed source wallet, there is always a back door to it and a third party is involved,but an open source wallet is open for anyone to have access to their code and it cannot be manipulated by a third party.",

In my experience yes if you are one of the early investors of these altcoins and you accumulate a lot on their test net period this is where the price is very cheap, but there are a lot of risks, you need to have an insight on what they are bringing and if there's acceptance from the community, I have two tokens where I am part one of the early bird its a big risk but well worth it if the developers kept their promise and there's the adoption of their platform   QuoteAlso which wallet do you advise a newbie like me to use to store my coins.

How can I differentiate an open source wallet from a close source wallet.Bitcoin has an actual utility which creates high demand for it, plus its capped supply, thus it will always have an appreciating value in the long term. Whilst most altcoins on the other hand are pump and dump coins with no utility, you might be lucky if you buy it right before it pumps, but the chances are pretty low, and the risk of you holding it when it is dead is somewhat high. So weigh up the risks and decide for yourself which option is best. To summarize the answer to your question on wallets to use: not your keys, not your coins, thus be your own bank.",

Apart from Bitcoin you can find many good and best coins in the crypto currency market which can give you great profits in the future. altcoins have given people huge profits in the last bull season .One thing to keep in mind is that it is important to be well informed about the alt coins to choose. It is only then possible that your choice is good and perfect. BNb, Ethereum, Arb, OP and Sui are some big Altcoins having big backup and long term idea. You should do some research on their buying range and should not take entry in fomo. My advice for newbies is that if they want to make long term investment then choose hard wallet for it. It is a secure wallet for all coins. By the way, people also choose soft wallet and keep their coins there too, but I prefer hard wallet more, because with hard wallet I feel very satisfied",

There is a possibility to make profit from altcoins, but it is not very high and also altcoins are not reliable to invest in with the idea that you want to make profit. You can get lucky but you can also loose everything you have invested if you invest in an altcoin that appears good but does not turn out to be good. A bad experience with altcoin for a new person can spoil the persons mind about cryptocurrency and make the person to become uninterested. As a new person in cryptocurrency, make sure that you always have more bitcoins and not more altcoins.",

Yes there are plenty of choices on the altcoin space that might give you profits. But make sure you are doing a due diligence with those alts cause some are money grab and if you havent experience trading some tokens especially new one then you might loss a lot of money. I think focus on major altcoins so that you might not be scared of being burn. Pick a low to mod marketcap and has a good platform and product.",

First, Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, and the term altcoins is coined from the words \"alternative cryptocurrencies\".  Experience has shown that altcoins are not reliable to invest on as there are so many pump and dump altcoins that have led to the frustration of so many investors as they ended up dumping in value and didn't gain value after falling till date.

Yes, there are high possibilities of making huge profit in altcoin investments where you can make 10x, 1000x or even 10,000x of your investment due to it's very high volatility ratio, and don't forget, that's the same way you could likewise make 1000x or 10,000x lost of your investment if you are unlucky to invest in a scam token/coin.
