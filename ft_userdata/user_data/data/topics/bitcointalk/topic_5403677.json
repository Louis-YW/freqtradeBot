Holding CBN + any CoreBNB Index = increased Index APR!We designed the CoreBNB DAO tokenomics to foster DAO growth and reward $CBN lockers, those most committed to the long-term vision of the protocol. We set four goals to maximize value for $CBN lockers:-Encourage and reward DAO participation.-Encourage CBN buy pressure.-Encourage locking.-Decrease sell pressure.üíéDeflationary Token FlywheelA user who purchases and locks CBN can earn idxCBX. Similarly, a user who purchases and stakes idxCBX can earn CBN. This creates tokenomics that are sustainable and deflationary.Locked $CBN¬† earns idxCBX from fee distributions. Staked idxCBX earns CBN rewards.Users buy CBN.Users lock CBN to earn vlCBN. This reduces the circulating supply.Users earn idxCBX from fee distribution.Users stake idxCBX to earn CBN.Users lock their newly earned CBN to repeat the cycle.-vlCBX Token Utilities-Fee Distribution1.

The CoreBNB Index is comprised of a variety of CoreBNB positions. Purchasing idxCBX grants you exposure to all of the strategies within the index at once.- Reduced gas fees. Creating a diverse portfolio of CoreBNB Positions yourself would be costly, requiring gas fees for each and every transaction (50+!) the index performs. Instead, a user pays just a single gas fee for purchasing the index token.- Secure, risk-adjusted strategies. Each active strategy within the index is heavily screened through a rigorous risk assessment process before each capital deployment, saving users the headache of manually vetting strategies before each and every deposit.- Secure, stable returns. The CoreBNB index favors stable and steady returns over risky degen yields. - Low correlation to DeFi blue chips, BTC/ETH, S&P500.
