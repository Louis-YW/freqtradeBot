We have all watched how both small scale and large scale businesses have started to accept the idea of bitcoin as a form of payment for good and services.

But Bitcoin is much more popular today than it was back in 2015. Slowly but surely, people will understand the usage of Bitcoin. The new generations are getting interested in it. As long as it spreads worldwide, the government also minimizes its usage. But, due to it's nature, people love it. It will continue to spread as long as people care about their privacy. Bitcoin does not have to be a dominant currency. If countries regulate Bitcoin usage, there is no point in using Bitcoin anymore.",

It could be cheaper, but you're talking about big companies, while your imagination is any company scale must accept Bitcoin because its easy, secure and low fee. This is wrong because if you send small amount of Bitcoin, you need to pay fee, while using debit card or cash will not charge any fee.Bitcoin could be accepted by many companies, but it's not a good choice to be used for regular/daily transaction. Why I need to spend more fee when I have a free option?",

We also know that many nations desire to control Bitcoin, but they are unable to do so due to its decentralized nature. BTC also poses a danger to the financial institutions of the central bank and the government due to its decentralized nature.As a result, other nations are enforcing regulations on other centralized exchanges, but in reality, they still have no control over the cryptocurrency holdings of traders. Perhaps the only restriction is the KYC procedure that the exchange's user clients must complete.",

It was launched as an alternative to fiats and Bitcoin been adopted globally and been used for payment will achieved that goal. Bitcoin is still very young so we shouldn't be expecting it to achieve the dominant currency status any time soon. It'll take decades for that to happen but Bitcoin been recognize globally as a currency is imminent.QuoteBut then how can we ignore that bitcoins journey towards being dominant means of transactions Is faced with challenges such as concern on price volatility. As Bitcoin gains more popularity and adoption, the volatility of the price will be reduced. It won't be completely stable but it won't be as volatile as it is currently. Also no currency is stable when they're trading against each other which is something we do when we buy or sell Bitcoin. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC just as 1 $USD is 1 $USD. Currently Bitcoin value is been represented in fiats that's why we're seeing volatility in the price but when we start to value things in stats (Satoshi) there won't be volatility again. Instead of buying something for $10 worth of Bitcoin, we'll now be buying things in mbtc, stats or BTC without fiat value attachment.",

Beside have conflict of interest with United State and countries have bilateral relations will difficult to accept bitcoin as payment currency transaction to make their dollar keep stable and use as all transaction payment for import and export. To make bitcoin an acceptable payment currency transaction need to change of regulation with several country viewed with bitcoin, not understood well how advantage when adapting bitcoin as legal payment currency and get chance with bitcoin dominance as currency payment in the future.",

I don't know, no one can predict the future, but I think that in the near future or in the next few years Bitcoin is unlikely to become a dominant currency or the main currency used in the continuity of the economic system of several countries, because even now there are still many countries that There are no clear rules or regulations regarding the acceptance of crypto itself.It is possible that some countries will only try to recognize and regulate and make Bitcoin only an investment asset or a commodity instrument but will not make Bitcoin their main currency, because for now if the government only uses Bitcoin as a currency the main thing is that it is the same as destroying the financial system that they have built and that will definitely cause many problems which will ultimately cause chaos in the country.Moreover, Satoshi's goal in creating Bitcoin was not to make Bitcoin the main currency in the world, but Satoshi created Bitcoin to provide an alternative in a decentralized financial system and not depend on third parties, right?.",

We know how it went, at the beginning it may have given a great response but when TESLA started selling bitcoin it became an instant crash. If you want to see a truly sustainable adoption look at El Salvador, the country is fully adopting Bitcoin and will even create a Bitcoin Island that is all based on Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin the dominant or fully accepted currency in a country will be a difficult challenge. Each government has its own regulations and governments do not like currencies that cannot be fully controlled like Bitcoin. It's also about high volatility with a greater risk of price fluctuations.So it's a tough decision for governments to make Bitcoin the dominant currency.",
