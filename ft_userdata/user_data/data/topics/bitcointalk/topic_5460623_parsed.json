And this is how you want to solve your problem. Tell us more about the coin and why you think this coin can attract the attention of an investor.",

Considering that the maximum saplay CryEx is 1 billion tokens and your plan is to sell it by 10 cents, it is not difficult to calculate that you dream of getting 100 million dollars in this way. Well, it's not harmful to dream, but I don't understand why you decided that investors would buy this token at $0.1?",

Just do not write that you released it in order to earn millions of dollars at the expense of stupid investors who will hope that you pump the token up to $5.Sometimes I can see how people stupidly think others doesn't have any sense of reasoning to have this mentality that one would definitely buy his token without having to know anything vital information about the project own or even having to know whether the token has a usecase and possess the quality of someone to hold & to invest in the project. I can see from what you have been asking op, he has been skipping those questions and giving what I think doesn't even need to be the answer. Well, what do I say bull run is around the corner and everyone needs to buckle up.",

And I'm assuming that at some point, a beginner who, like you, does not understand how the cryptocurrency market works, can buy your coin. But this will be an isolated case that will not bring you millions of profit.",

Why would anyone agree to do this? I mean you made zero effort. Not even a home page (not that it would help your case in any way as there are no development, community and one single address holding the tokens. Why would anyone else do any work for this if you only made the token that ANYONE can make?I don't even mean to diss you, it's a honest question. I am baffled about how you thought this would work.",

Why don't use your money for something better like trading or something else? You pumped your own coin and that's it. There will never be someone who gonna buy your coin. I checked it through some explorer if you have removed it. You can do something better like earning money from trading rather than creating another BS token like this. I hope you will realize if that method will never work. Think about that. You said that you have been honest by pumping your own tokens but others will still see that as fraud. You shall think about that. Stop wasting your money for nothing. Please, go back to the right track again.",
