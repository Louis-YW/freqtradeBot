  "content": "According to the US, the relationship between Russia and Iran has warmed up to be a fully fledged defense partnership.Where are all these coming from, is the US trying to drag Iran into this war between Russia and Ukraine?US national security council spokesman John Kirby said Iran is giving Russia an unprecedented level of military support.The co-operation between Russia and Iran has been highlighted recently with Ukraine accusing Russia of using Iranian military drones in some of there attacks. Iran denied sending drones to Russia but later admitted to have supplied some drones before the invasion.John Kirby said the partnership between Russia and Iran will cause much damage to not just Ukraine but as well as Iran neighbors and the international community. He also added that \"Russia is seeking to collaborate with Iran in areas like weapons development, training, he said, adding that the US fears that Russia intended to provide Iran with advanced military components including helicopters and air defence systems. Iran has become Russia's top military backer. He said, Russia has been using Iranian drones to strike energy infrastructure, depriving millions of Ukrainians of power, heat, critical services. People in Ukraine today are actually dying as a result of Iran's actions.\"In response to John Kirby statements, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said that Iran has become Russians military supporter and there relationship will be threatening to global security.He said the sordid deals between these two countries is for Iran to be sending hundreds of drones to Russia, in return, Russia is offering military and technical support to the Iranian regime which will increase the risk it poses to our partners in the Middle East and to international security.He said the UK agreed with the US that Iranian support for the Russian military would grow in the coming months as Russia tries to get hold of more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles.Ukraine accused Iran of supplying Russia with \"kamikaze\" drones used in a series of attacks which killed at least eight people on 17 October.Iran initially denied this, but later admitted sending a \"limited number\" of drones to Russia, \"many months\" before the war in Ukraine.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said this was a lie and that Ukraine was shooting down about 10 Iranian drones a day.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63921007",

      "body": "The alliance between Iran and Russia is nothing new. They have worked together for a long time on Syrian soil, as they are both allies of the Syrian regime. And I think they are still doing this to this day since the Syrian crisis has not ended yet. So it would not be surprising that Iran would be an ally of Russia in the war against Ukraine, especially since both of them have a common enemy, the West and the United States.Arms deals are not the only aspect of support, but it may go beyond that to economic support and even impose more pressure through gas exports, since they are among the largest gas producers in the world.",

      "body": "It is funny how almost the entire world is sending Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars of what they call \"advanced\" military equipment and yet they are so worried about a fake story about Iran's simplest drone that cost barely a grand being used by Russia. I wonder what they're gonna do if Iran decided to actually send drones to Russia specially advanced ones like the ones that are capable of air to air combat Quote from: Sexylizzy2813 on December 10, 2022, 02:57:22 AMWhere are all these coming from, is the US trying to drag Iran into this war between Russia and Ukraine?There is a project called \"Iranophobia\" on all US administrations desks over the past 44 years where they always make a pariah out of Iran in the media. These days Russia is the \"bad guy\" so it works best for that project to claim that Iran is also helping the bad guys.This is unlikely to force Iran into this war, they couldn't get us into Afghanistan war after they escaped it neither could they pull us into the Baku invasion of Armenia and those are right at Iran's borders.Not to mention that Iran is the only country that is actually against this war.QuoteIran denied sending drones to Russia but later admitted to have supplied some drones before the invasion.\"Admit\" is a strong word considering how this has been public information for nearly a decade!We all know that when US regime created ISIS (according to Clinton and Trump) just across Iran's borders in Syria and Iraq, that forced Iran to start the fight against this multinational terrorist organization. In that war an alliance shaped between Iran and Russia and during those shared operations Iran sold some drones to Russia to be used against terrorists.This is from years ago.QuoteJohn Kirby said the partnership between Russia and Iran will cause much damage to not just Ukraine but as well as Iran neighbors and the international community.Someone should ask Kirby that what does the partnership between US and Saudi regime that has invaded Yemen and has been killing children there using weapons US sells them do to the international community?QuoteRussia intended to provide Iran with advanced military components including helicopters and air defence systems. This sounds like a joke because the only \"advanced military component\" Russia has that Iran needs is their Sukhoi-35 otherwise the rest like their air defense is inferior to what Iran already has manufactured domestically.QuoteUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said this was a lie and that Ukraine was shooting down about 10 Iranian drones a day.In other words Zelensky is admitting that these drones are not Iranian!It's pretty simple, Ukraine receives all its capabilities from NATO (mostly US) and the NATO bases (mainly US) that are occupying Iraq and Syria and have been helping Saudis kill people in Yemen have not been capable of shooting down a single one of these exact drones. It is impossible for Ukraine to have capabilities that their supporters don't even have.So he is either lying about shooting them down or lying about them being Iranian made.It's the later considering his other statements regarding the components of the drones they gathered after they hit their targets being made in anywhere but Iran (eg. made in US, Australia, China, etc.). Iran's Shahed-136 drones are 100% domestically manufactured without any foreign made components.",

Is he scared of voicing it at first when they noticed that those drones are from Iran?Something doesn't feel right.",

Russia is more powerful to be left alone to fight Ukraine. As an Enhanced Opportunities Partner, of NATO Ukraine enjoys the privileged of military support and that is why they are been backed by many countries. But this is a war and all parties are looking for diverse way to win or survive. Russia also has its allies that would definitely assist them militarily.China and India a big players in the global economic sector that is why NATO cannot attack or sanction them like Iran. Iran is under multiple sanctions that has really affected its economy and the partnership with Russia would be beneficial both militarily and economically. There are also speculations that Russia might also increase its military partnership with North Korea.",

Korean so contract logging operations in their forests, and not much more.  That's my estimate.",
