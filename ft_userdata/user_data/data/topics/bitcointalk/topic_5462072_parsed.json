  "content": "Today I was contacted by a friend who is into crypto, but mainly he is the more of the buy, trade and sell off type. He chatted for some time and then he introduced this new website to me and he himself doesn't know much about it so he taught I could shade more light but I didn't want to tell him my opinion on the website because the whole interface of the site looks like a scam project and although I haven't done much research on it but I thought I should drop the link here so maybe one or two members can help me clear my doubt.My friend had already deposited some usdt in the website and although it looks like an exchange platform but something fishing I assume is up with the site. GLOBAL EXCHANGE Immediately I told him to offer a withdrawal to his binance usdt wallet but on since yesterday being 3 aug 2023 the withdrawal is still showing pending review which is very unlikely to me",

      "body": "first look at the site already tells me that they are only here to scam, no self-respecting businessman would open their website to provide service that looks like that.why the hell did your friend deposit without doing proper research about the site? he'd be lucky to get back the money he deposited on that site. also, I wouldn't be surprised if the site messages him that he needs to deposit a \"fee\" to release the money he deposited.",

      "body": "A legit exchange will use a much decent domain than that website currently using. They are using a URL that is not exactly the same to the name of the exchange which means the owner doesn’t have the capability to purchased a premium domain for his business. I don’t understand too why you and your friend need to think twice about this and risk money on shady website while there’s a lot of trusted exchange available in the crypto market.Quote from: Mr.suevie on August 04, 2023, 02:29:41 PMImmediately I told him to offer a withdrawal to his binance usdt wallet but on since yesterday being 3 aug 2023 the withdrawal is still showing pending review which is very unlikely to me Can you clarify this withdraw on Binance or on the exchange because your screenshot is contradicting your statement. Or is that money is from the exchange that offers on your friend to try the platform.",

As far as I can see, they don't even have a regular version of the site, for mobile devices only.I have seen more web templates like this for exchange. I would certainly never trust them, I even find it strange that anyone with at least a little crypto experience would send money here.",

      "body": "This is a complete ripoff of kucoin exchange.If I may ask why did your friend decid to use this exchange? Because from the look of things this is not a non-kyc exchange and since it requires kyc verification why didn’t him just use one of the reputable ones we know of rather than going into the abyss of the internet to uproot one unknown exchange and depositing his money into it.Up till this day I’m still trying to figure out how do you guys come across this type of website, like what exactly do you search for that brings them up on your page and also if there’s a force that makes you people want to test those sites. It’s still a mystery to me.He should keep hoping that the delay is a technical problem and it should be resolved soon if not he should bide his money goodbye.",

      "body": "One look at their site is enough for me to know that it is an amateur or scam exchange. No serious service provider would allow themselves to have such an amateurishly made website, full of grammatical errors.Quote from: Mr.suevie on August 04, 2023, 02:29:41 PMMy friend had already deposited some usdt in the website and although it looks like an exchange platform but something fishing I assume is up with the site. Best to stay away from that exchange. If they can't even bother to present a professional and error-free website, it's a major red flag. And tell your friend that the next time he asks, he should consult you before depositing his funds, because, from the looks of it, it is highly unlikely that he will ever get his money back.",

Well according to him some dude refered him saying this is actually the best trading platform and him not knowing having much idea of crypto got entangled and made deposit since he is looking for all quick method possible to accumulate some cash.Well thanks for the clarification I have showed him and I think his eye are clear now as all what we can do is just to remain optimistic about the whole issue.Note will lock thread now since I have been assured of my thoughts on this.",
