Looking for a members that can help you scam ordinary investors? Well this may not look scam but the main purpose of this group is quiet suspicious. Again, be careful everyone.",

      "body": "So you want to play a pump dump game? If so very likely it's out of your hand. Who needs to post to get members from the forum to increase channels subscriber he won't do it. Because the forum users aren't much interested in your scheme. Building such as channel isn't an easy task at all. You should have all real traders who will follow you blindly. You have to find some other way to build your channel to provide the signal.",
