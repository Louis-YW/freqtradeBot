We all are aware of the US government negativity over bitcoin but of lately it is beginning to bounce back but i do not know if it is for political reasons all these are coming now but for sure I have watched and read  a lot of interviews press conferences held by Presidential aspirants of political parties talking about supporting bitcoin if elected.

      "body": "The problem is that the cost of power in Montana for industrial power is about $0.075 per KWH. So unless they drop the rates no large mines are going to move there, protected or not.For the small private 'hobby' people with 1 or 2 miners it's not going to matter one way or another.Business follow the money. And, just because they support it today, does not mean they will support it tomorrow.After luring miners to Texas with low electric rates and support they look like they are going to pass this sooner or later:https://beincrypto.com/texas-lawmakers-pass-bill-limiting-bitcoin-mining/So, it's great, move to Montana you are protected from getting gouged in electric rates. However, that it today....tomorrow is tomorrow.-Dave",

Miners have always been targeted by lawmakers, from paying high taxes to shutting mining firms down based on their beliefs regarding the environmental hazards caused by miners and high electricity usage, which the miners are even paying for; it's not as if they are using it for free.This bill passing is really a good thing, and it's showing that the Satoshi Action Fund group is really working hard to fight back against the sanction against all miners and Bitcoin traders.If this bill is successfully passed in Montana and miners now have the full right not to worry about extra tax fees and other sanctions, it will really create room for other cities in the USA to make their own moves, knowing that they have a greater chance of achieving a positive result.",

I think the immediate economic effect of this might not be that good but overall it's a good sentimental change for the US as even other states might begin to do such things if they think Montana has benefitted out of this. Eventually if a lot of states agree to this, the Federal government will have to bring a law around it as well. So i feel it's a move in the right direction.",

Once government applies this law in many cities, they wouldn't mind that 30%, they will use rivers and wind for free electricity.",

So let's see who's next and how it will affect not just mining but bitcoin is general in states as the Biden government wanted 30% tax on crypto miners.The good news is that the state of Montana has shown a willingness of welcoming Bitcoin miners. The law protecting miners is the first step because they had a very unfriendly law before now. How can a law state that Bitcoin miners must build their power source before they can mine in the state, that was bad. But this new law if adopted and implemented will be friendly and has the potency to attract Bitcoin miners to the state. I am sure that the next phase will be about the cost of electricity or avenues to generate electricity. The government can reduce the cost of electricity or partner with miners to generate power. The US has many abandoned dams that can be refurbished or converted to electric dams.Great job by this advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund. It is good to hear that there are groups that are fighting genuinely for the protection, promotion, and advancement of Bitcoin.",

Some years ago I had speculated that the government on the federal level (say 3 letter agencies like the EPA) would have authority over state law and implement mining restrictions under the guise of environmental safety. A SCOTUS case last year limited the scope of the EPA to enact carbon emission reductions and under dual sovereignty, the federal government already has limited powers over how states handle legislative matters. I'm glad I was wrong because it looks like a lot of states are giving miners the freedom to mine without price gouging or regulatory hurdles. None of that can be overridden unless by the people of that state.",

Miners should be taking advantage of the protection but the cost of the energy will hinder them because it might bring losses than gains.   I hope this move from Montana can influence other estates on approving miners to their business in their states.",

Over time, as more states adopt similar regulations, it could lead to a more supportive environment for cryptocurrency businesses and entrepreneurs. Overall, it is certainly a positive development to see a state like Montana taking steps to support the growth of this industry.",

So they may introduce their own laws that are more crypto-friendly, and similar things can be done in other states, but the country of the USA overall may have different policies. Unfortunately, it was determined in the US that federal legislation has supremacy over state legislation, so if a federal law is passed at some point, requiring all miners to invest in eco-friendly solutions or something like that, Montana should technically abide by it as well. Thankfully, it's all just bills and discussions at the federal level, so states can make their own policies in the meantime and perhaps people from those states can later advocate pro-crypto federal legislation as well.",

It is obviously clear to the United States that they need to start taking advantage of the market situation in the sense that they had to start reviewing some of their policies and embargo placed on some businesses from operating because if the needful Is not done, they would end up being at the lossing side to other nations because they are open to receiving businesses and industries leaving the United States which is a plus one added advantage to their national economy.It was indeed a smart move by Montana State to begin the process early enough and going by OPs statement, it look like there are more Crypto friendly aspirants this time contesting for the exalted office of the President. I think they would make better policies and regulations when it comes to blockchain and Crypto currencies more especially bitcoin.",
