Bitcoin is a speculative asset that is too unstable and dangerous to be trusted as a means of trade or a store of their wealth. Others view it as a paradigm-shifting technological advancement that might alter how we view money and finance.",

Nobody knows for sure what will happen to Bitcoin in the future, but people are still talking about it and interested in it.Those were old thoughts about Bitcoin, which won't change easily at these times. But what's good is that many understand the better side of Bitcoin and those old thoughts are starting to be gone. These views will not change over time until they've realized that many people are already invested in it and they can't stop it. Eventually, they'll all be changed and we don't need to worry about it. Let those people that keep on worrying about it, worry. While us, there's nothing to worry about as we all know what bitcoin really is.",

      "body": "Based on what you write, you are talking about two classes of people: those who believe in Bitcoin (Bitcoiners) and non-Bitcoiners, which are those who are very skeptical about Bitcoin. But the truth is that some people go from not knowing what Bitcoin is to finally getting to know about it and beginning to accumulate some, but some people will not adopt Bitcoin because of what they really believe, and that got me to say Bitcoin is not for those who don't want it. No one knows what will happen in the future, but even if something bad happens to Bitcoin, it doesn't mean our lives will end there; surely there are still other things that one can venture into. To me,it doesn't really matter what others think about Bitcoin; all that matters is what real Bitcoiners think about Bitcoin.",

There are many people who have achieved their success in life through Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, they first invested in Bitcoin with risk and held their investments patiently for a long period of time, resulting in success.  Another thing you mentioned is whether Bitcoin is used by criminals as a means of money laundering. Everything has good and bad side of using Bitcoin many good things are happening with Bitcoin like many people are buying and selling their houses with Bitcoin Bitcoin is connected to various educational fields and many more positive things are associated with Bitcoin.  Although no one knows in advance how the Bitcoin market may go in the future, some predictions can be made by market research. By the end of this year, the market is likely to get better than the current situation. And I am very optimistic about Bitcoin.",

Yes that’s very true thats why Bitcoin is regarded as a volatile(can either rise or fall) currency that why it’s an investment opportunity for some, but also normal currency experience something similar with inflation and deflation of the currency. Your friend should also be worried about that too.Quote Quote from: Sidra101 on May 03, 2023, 04:31:24 PMThey also worry that it's used by criminals for illegal activities like money laundering. However,  Money laundering, scams, and other criminal activities did not start with bitcoin, normal currencies (Fiat) has always been used to perform those activities and it’s still is been used till date. All this statement are from minds that doesn’t want to understand the values of bitcoin.",

And since bitcoin technology is still new it is natural that criminals will exploit it to their advantage. The news that it’s purpose for criminals to by pass government law is just a stereotype spread by the government and some factions of the media to create FUD around it. The fiat currency is still the highest currency use by criminals to carry out there activities even with all the regulations on it by the government they still can’t fish out those criminals.People will continue to pick up more interest in it as the banks continues to frustrate people and also as people begin to see That their fiat savings is losing value due to inflation and excess printing of it.",

And that is a mentality mindset.This is why you should really be needing to zoom out if you are really that serious on learning on what Bitcoin is. It would really be normal to have that approach where people do mostly be starting up on having those beliefs that Bitcoin is neither some sort of ponzi or something that could make them rich quick which sooner or later they would be able to know on whats the real deal. Its better not to worry becausethey would eventually be able to find out for themselves on what truly it is. Just like in most of us on which we are still starting up on this market or something we didnt been able to encounter.It would be normal to have those bad beliefs but due to experience then you would be able to adjust to that. This is why its really that important on having that deepresearch if you are really that serious on dealing up with something.Quote from: mendace on May 03, 2023, 08:50:36 PMQuote from: Sidra101 on May 03, 2023, 04:31:24 PMSome people don't see Bitcoin as a normal currency and think it's too risky because its value can change a lot.

Thats it, generally people see inflation as products going up  when in fact its the FIATdevaluing. In terms of Bitcoin it has had many years of bad press and constant attacksfrom investment institutions, banks, governments and main stream media so its understandablethat generally people would be negative towards Bitcoin.For traders I imagine volatility is kind of a necessity, thats where gains and losses can be made and as a non trader if you have a long term outlook with Bitcoin volatility is a nonissue. Where it gets dangerous is when inexperience and speculation meet along withgoing \"all in\" on the short term.",
