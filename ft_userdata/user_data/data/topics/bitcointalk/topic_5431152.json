  "content": "Hi fellow Bitcoin traders,There is a new Cryptocurrency Trading Dashboard where you can view derivative exchange data from Bitcoin and Ethereum in a one-page view. It's called Whaleportal (https://whaleportal.com/).This can help you better grip the markets for shorter-term timeframes.The chances for traders to create successful trading strategies significantly increase if you use derivative exchange data in your analysis.",

I have not read all but I will still later continue to read it.Quote from: BitcoinUpOnly on December 23, 2022, 08:55:01 PMThis can help you better grip the markets for shorter-term timeframes.The chances for traders to create successful trading strategies significantly increase if you use derivative exchange data in your analysis.I can see something like exchange balance, this can be used for long term trading or even holding, maybe you want to make it in a short time, but why not make the period up to at least 4 years or even from all time?Â  The period can be added underneath the chart in a way it can be clicked.Is it true that only three exchanges are used for the data?Also that there are some information and data that can help in trading, but it should be known that indicators may fail too, nothing is 100% accurate in trading, but with the right strategy, profit is possible.",
