If the former or original coin did make out some pump then expect that there would be lots of similar coins or clones would really be making or creating on the same nameand just going along with the hype.We know that once hype is built or trend then expect that lots of people would be seeking for another next one which on the time that they would  get fomo'ed then pretty sure they would be looking around and would carelessly throwing out their funds without having that solid DYOR.Speaking about popularity then there's no assurance. We've see on how high WOJAK did able to reach which is on erc20 platform.If ever someone created on BSCthen it would depend or vary if there would be some considerations from investors or the community.",

So there might be a bunch of profit taking unless we print new highs on PEPE. I'm not smart contracts expert, but from what I can see the contract is renounced and the liquidity pool is locked so rug pool is impossible. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong)In addition, the contract states that only 1% tax is charged on buy and sell, from which all tokens are automatically burned. So with each transaction the number of tokens decreases.I know that many shitcoins are scams, but in this case I dont see any danger. It's just a matter of how strong dev team will promote it.",
