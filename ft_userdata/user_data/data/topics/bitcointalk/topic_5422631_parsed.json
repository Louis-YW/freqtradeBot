Their intention from the onset of establishing both HashCoins, HashFlare and Polybius Bank was just to defraud people. Most people that fall victims to these set of businesses are driven by the desire to get-rich-quick. Most of these fraudulent businesses entice their targets with mouthwatering profits or cheap products or services that they cannot despise due to greed. It is a good development that they have been arrested and hopefully they would get the stipulated punishment. It would be very good for these fraudulent individuals that keeps giving the crypto space a bad name to be arrested and punished accordingly.",

Anyway, a lot of us here know by now that cloud mining is really a bad investment.But I did invest on known cloud mining sites before but unfortunately, didn't get the profits, and lost also.Good for the community that we lessen this kind of fraudulent people, capitalizing from the trust of users.Hopefully, some of this amount will be recovered and returned to those people who were owed by their scheme.",

I checked these people account here (the one they used to promote their scam) and I realized it was created back in 2015, which I did not expect from a ponzi squeme.This leads me to assume these criminals went out their way to give as much aura of legitimacy as possible to extent the life of their shady \"business\", so they could scam more people.I hope the FBI is able to seize and help victims to recover part of their capital.",

Greed and ignorance are a perfect recipe for losing money to scammers. Red flags, although obvious, are oftentimes set aside when offered with a huge ROI. This is a big success not only to the authorities but also to the victims. It might take time, or perhaps forever, for them to get back their money but they've learned precious lessons for them to share. They're now hard and convincing proofs to their family and friends that cloud mining and other crypto investment opportunities are nothing but scams.",

The projects they worked on have been on the market since 2017, and it is strange that they were not discovered until after more than 5 years .I think you misunderstood me, yes we have been suffering from the fluctuations since the FTX scandal, but we have settled down around $16,200-$16,500. But when this news broke out, the price suddenly dip dive to $15,700 (but after that we have recovered again).I also did not say that it was put in the market, what I'm trying to drive it is that the market is very volatile, everyone is at the edge that every negative news about bitcoin and crypto in general will have an impact in the price in short term.Perhaps the two has been hiding for years that's why it took time for the US authority to find them. Nevertheless, we all know that they will used any force that they have in their arsenal to find the suspects. Doesn't matter if it takes 5 or 10 years.And recently, they just had to make it serious, if I'm not mistaken, it will started maybe around 2019 or 2020 for them. So imagine the backlog of many crypto cases and so they have to prioritized which one should be given the man power by the FBI to chase.",

The damage has been done by then and who knows how many victims have fallen.
