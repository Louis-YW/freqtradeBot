      "body": "Metaverse was still an experimental and it's not yet become a thing. To be honest mana was an over rated what people called that as metaverse. Sandbox is far better in so many aspects. It seems like that you have been trapped at the peak price caused by you were buying at a very high price. I thought that DCA was not even working here. How fast recover from the market actually depends on the numerous factor. The price of decentraland may able to recover but this will not gonna happen in a short time. It seems like that you must be patience waiting for the recover to come but this might not be in a short time. I do believe the recover may slowly come around next year. The crypto market will be doing sideway this year. There are so many incidents in crypto that prevent it to recover. I don't like the condition in the crypto market right now. You just need to save your mana until the recover may come next year. This is still possibility",

Are you for or against Decentraland and if so why?Honestly, there is not much prospect for this project, it was overrated during the bull season and now it can be seen that it is returning to its true value. You bought them at a high price so selling now doesn't make much sense but you should stop DCA, too risky. Metaverse is a trend that is not so obvious and we still don't know if it is the next trend of the market, so don't invest too much in metaverse projects or other trends. You should focus on bitcoin or ethereum would be better.",

I think the interest hasn't peaked yet so there's still a good chance to recover in the next two years.",

Are you for or against Decentraland and if so why?Just have patience and better check updates and community growth of the token you are holding.  Almost all the times, whenever we heart the word the \"next big thing\", it is almost an empty phrase.  So better to do more in-depth research and don't trust people who are hyping a project.  I am not against Decentraland, I am just stating the general situation in crypto whenever someone is hyping a project.",

Are you for or against Decentraland and if so why?I think that the same thing is true for Decentraland as for most of the other crypto projects. As soon as the market as a whole leaves behind all those negative news and happenings with the drama around Terra Luna first and now the bankruptcy of FTX and starts to recover most of the projects will recover with the overall market. The next question is, if Decentraland is able to reach the price levels around it's ATH again.Regarding that i am not sure to be honest. Play2earn and metaverse were two big trends of the crypto industry of the last 2 years or so. Now that the big hype wave is over only the good projects of those genre will survive. I think though that Decentraland is one of them.",

I've know this project since its started though I was not able to buy or invest but still I see a bright future for this. Metaverse will grow more, bull market will help them to rise again. Just stop buying for now though, instead buy other good coins that can help you have some profit to cover your losses with Decentraland.",

I advise you to stop DCA as it is very risky, at this time only invest in bitcoin, with altcoins please do not invest in them. I would still like to remind you that with each passing bear season, a lot of old projects become unrecoverable, so it is not wise to focus on old projects. There are a lot of new projects under construction preparing for the next bull season and we can wait for really clear signals from the bulls, then decide which altcoin to invest in.",

Are you for or against Decentraland and if so why?yes, this is a normal thing to happen in the market, you have to adapt to the extreme bear market. Decentraland's main project is Metaverse, where we will have our own character in a place that has been provided by Decentraland, have friends, and create a virtual community. this may be a big project as it will need repairs from time to time. the concept is the same as when Facebook was first created, the difference is that the metaverse is much more complex because we can create our own buildings in it, etc.Big projects like this are indeed very potential so many are investing because under the pretext of the existing facilities in the Decentraland metaverse they can be used for business. but maybe the circumstances of the world speak differently, all investors are forced to withdraw their money to save their businesses in real life.Of course, Decentraland can recover because they have the potential to change the world of social media to become more complex.",

It's still too far to be the next big thing. Metaverse didn't perform so well in the market right now. I guess if this gonna be a long term journey for metaverse.

Why don't you just try to take care with another crypto? this might be better for yourself. Mana has a small chance to recover and this will rely with bitcoin price movement.

Are you for or against Decentraland and if so why?Decentraland was buld during the hype and hype was immensive. It wouldn't be able to deliver anything that even resembled those expectations people had. Cult like communities are rarely started that way. Succesful ones start small and grow bigger, like facebook. Like google, Like minecraft. They weren't about making money, but perfecting and experimenting with something. If there had be a referral incentives of any kind, or things you could have bought from the start in those systems, they would have invited wrong kind of crowd and they would have failed, because people would have seen those as annoying ponzi scams. As they do with decentraland.Idea of metaverse wasn't anything new. And every implementions people have tried with (especially when there's some sort of gold rush involved), have been mostly cringe worthy. The idea is good, but everyone is using it wrong.The future of Decentraland depends on the users and devs. Just getting big names in isn't enough at all, as it doesn't add fun to anything.",

Decentraland is a good project judging by the number of big names buying lands in their virtual world but it will all become worth the while in the future, not withing a few months of existence or investment.Like you already said, the alts are down by 90%, btc is not left out, you should continue to dca if you have the funds to do so, plus you should be happy it is not some shitcoins you put your money on, decentraland is a great project but requires time and patince which is what you are going to need if you want to regain your invested funds back.",
