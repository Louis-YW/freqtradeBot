      "body": "Well it is not a good thing for you to have a addiction. It doesnt make a difference if the addiction is to a drug substance, something like being a thief, or something like sexual activities. Having sex is a good thing. It can lower your blood pressure and give you better heart health. It will also build your self esteem and build confidence. I think sex is really necessary for a man and woman. But not if you are doing it too much. If it is a addiction taking over your life you need to seek help from professionals.",
