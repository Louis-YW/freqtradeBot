A friend of mine informed me about this website actually I am interested in cryptocurrency.Hello, Welcome to bitcointalk.org forum. If you are really interested in cryptocurrency  and  wanna get knowledge about it then you came in right place.QuoteAny earning source for beginners? And what skills should I need to work on this site? If you have skill on web designing or development, Graphic designing or marketing etc then simply you can make a service thread and offer it to here  Services . On the others here you can also earn from signature and Bounty campaign. But for doing signature campaign you have to be ranked up (Visit here for more information Signature Campaign Guidelines). On the others hand bounty campaign if you don't have any skill then I will prefer to you this. Here you need you promote some projects by your social media account.  You can visit here- Bounties (Altcoins) ActivityQuote from: Lauda on July 16, 1970, 06:33:30 AMActivity is increased by posting and is updated every hour; however, the updated number of activity points will be reflected at your profile at the end of the current activity period. As a note, in case you have latent activity points from earlier periods (meaning activity periods where you didn't post daily: in this case, the days when you did not post become latent activity points), these ones will be updated on your profile after 1 hour. You can gain a maximum of 14 activity points every 2 weeks.MeritQuote from: Lauda on July 16, 1970, 06:33:30 AMWhat is Merit and sMerit?You have Merit and sendable Merit (sMerit). sMerits can only be send, they have no other purpose and hoarding them is pointless. When someone gives Merit to you they lose sMerit of the amount transferred and you gain Merit as well as sMerit (which in case you can send again)Quote from: Lutpin on January 25, 2018, 01:00:08 AMQuick Example:should I send 10 Merit to you for a post, my sMerit would decrease by 10.Your merit would increase by 10 and your sMerit would increase by 5.Position Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIn addition to activity, everyone now has a merit score, and you need both a certain activity level and a certain merit score in order to reach higher member ranks.

I think not and the forum is not an earning site as The Cryptovatot said. You really did have wrong impression the same as op about this site or this forum. To be precise, you did earn money as you have said but the one who paid you is not the forum or theymos but the company or whatever you call them who used this forum to advertise or whatever their goal is by running a campaign like signature campaign, twitter campaign where you can participate and get paid by them (not the forum).",

Since you seem enthusiastic about being able to work and earn, I suggest you just go and freelance instead. You have plenty of opportunities to earn outside the forum and it would even help you in the longer term than just relying on bounties as that I assume that you are after, am I right?See this forum as a place to make discussions and learning new stuffs about cryptos..",

Hello and welcome to the forum!You asked the question backwards, I believe. Start with what you know to do and think about the skills you have that would be useful to others. For example, say you're a programmer, you can offer your expertise in programming, but maybe you also know web-design and graphic design. Maybe you have a knowledge of journalism and the online publishing process. You can serve as an editor or copywriter for content on the site. Or maybe you’re great at marketing, so you can do social media management, or lead email marketing campaigns.If you really want to work, you need to evaluate what your interests are and what would be valuable to other people, and then go out and get the skills to develop that knowledge and expertise.",
