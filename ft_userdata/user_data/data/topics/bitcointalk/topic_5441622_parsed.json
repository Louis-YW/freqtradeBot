You will receive a reward in bitcoins and therefore buy the desired coin. If you have inexpensive electricity, then you can see the profit and payback in the calculator   https://hashrate.no/",

Just like how the term \"decentralized\" become so widely used but most of the time it refers to different things which make new users become misled later on. I think \"mining\" also has this kind of problem, not to the same degree as \"decentralized\" though. Sometimes it refers to earning coins through submitting blocks in the PoW style, but the speaker/project also uses it to refer to earning coins from staking, etc. Hopefully, new users will explore more, and won't stop knowing the terms from marketing articles in the future.",

You're arguing about metaphors. They can mean anything you want them to mean.To be fair, digging dirt also involves some hardware power in order to extract minerals, I believe this is the whole point of the careful selection of the word mining, isn't it? Otherwise, they couldn't have ended up with \"mining\". They could have just said we are producing or growing or constructing Bitcoins  ...and AFAIK, not all conventional mining involves digging dirt.But we are diverting away from the topicI wake up one day, stake 10,000 BNB in anticipation for a staking reward which I know it will receive based on all those mathematical APYs and APRs. Do you consider this crypto mining?",
