      "body": "The set PCB temperature of T19 cannot exceed 90Â°C, otherwise, it will not work normally, usually due to the high ambient temperature. If the abnormal temperature is displayed when turned on, it may be that there is a problem with the control board or the temperature control circuit. Check whether the heat sink around the temperature sensor is welded well, and check the prompts in the kernel log for troubleshooting.",
