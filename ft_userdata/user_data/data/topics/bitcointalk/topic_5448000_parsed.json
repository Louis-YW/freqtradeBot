  "content": "2016 first ever face off2023 current face offTomorrow is the day when we will see an all out war between this two. A lot of people surprised including me that Israel is still the favorite between this matchup with 1.70 odds and Pereira is the underdog with 2.15 odds. We all know that Alex lost 2 matches in kickboxing and 1 match in UFC to Pereira but he still the favortie in the main event of the UFC match tomorrow. A lot of bettors are keeping eye on this match including drake who bet again to Israel with $900,000. As for my prediction, this match will proved that Israel can beat Alex Pereira, I saw to his eyes that he is ready to fight and even die just to beat Alex. I watched some podcast of Israel before where he really believed to law of attraction or some metaphysical things about human can achieved anything if he really believed to it. Alex said to himself that the dog is ready to unleash out and he already imagined that he can beat Pereira in matchup. It is a do or die for Israel Adesanya so I'll got bet with him. Don't get me wrong because Alex is really strong fighter and I respect him, I just wanna bet on Israel because I know that he can pull this out. So excited for the match tomorrow. Who you got between this two?",

Yes you are right that mate these two fighter hide their best strategy to surprise us in the octagon it because we all know that these two fighter have a strong stamina that can long last until the final round and also we all know that this time the favorite fighter is Israel adesanya which is no doubt it because this fighter si have good strategy in terms of fighting and also he is an aggressive behavior fighter.",

I agree that he is still young and strong but without the will power, His career will go south once he encounter the great wall on his career which is Pereira.I think the only reason why Adesanya has the advantage on early stage is because Pereira is being cautious due to Adesanya adequate skill until he realizes that Adesanya can’t handle solid blows once you are already inside his reach.I hope Adesanya will win this time to have a possible 3rd fight.",

I'm surprised by Adesanya's motivation and fighting skill in their 2nd fight in Glory kickboxing, he is winning the fight until he got caught by a vicious left hook with only three seconds to go, same thing happen in their third fight in UFC this time he is 3-1 in the scorecards again that vicious left hook rocks him and he losses his equilibrium and from there Pereira pour in a lot of punches, now he is confident that he can beat him not only beat him but beat him in a worse way than what he suffered.These are strong words for a guy to have been beaten three times in a row and have that spirit, tells the kind of character that he has.",

I have been telling this in the main UFC thread about Israel Adesanya mocking Alex Pereira even before Adesanya became a champion during an interview and that actually motivated Alex Pereira to start MMA and then sign with the UFC. So Israel Adesanya asked for this one . clip starts from 7:07 minute. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jfZJpu80mEQuote from: coin-investor on April 08, 2023, 01:26:35 PMSurprisingly Izzy is the favorite here and I see him also as the favorite to win the fight on his last two losses to Alex he has a wide margin and in their last meeting Izzy was up 3-1 until that left hook in the last round he is winning the fight and just needs on to hold to defend the title.Alex have crazy knockout power and that is what makes him dangerous. I wont be surprised if Alex Pereira starts wrestling in this fight to make a point and frustrates Adesanya .",

It's titled Adesanya versus Pereira 2 for a reason. But you are correct, losing to one fighter in a row will create a bad image. I mean, just take a look at Kamaru Usman now. He may have lost a lot of fans after being defeated twice by Leon Edwards and then there's the negative mental effect on every fighter which is a normal thing to happen because they will lose confidence in their skills. This is a must-win fight for Adesanya so I will be rooting for him. It doesn't matter if Pereira comes back prepared because we will see a complete Adesanya in 3 hours who will be throwing everything he got without any hesitation.",

I don't know if Poatan lost focus and got over-excited when he was able to connect and then corner Adesanya but he dropped his guards and that cost him that fight. The Style Bender has quicker hands and Poatan paid heavily. The status is now 1-3 in favor of Poatan. Another match might happen soon. If Poatan somehow managed to win this fight, I don't think there is a fifth fight just like when he mentioned that he is closing the series after his 4th win which failed to materialize.",

Now , we will get a another fight between them ? I would say this saga deserves one more fight",

The hype before this fight is really amazing and to clear every doubt about their last fight was truly a great performance by Izzy.I won’t say it was an easy fight because the match is very close counter punching and kicking before Pereira. In fact, Izzy was already cornered after receiving a solid blow but Pereira didn’t expect the heavy counter that Izzy setup for him. I think he will not be knocked it if back down first after receiving the counter punch because he still gonna throw some punch until Izzy launch the follow up punch on his face that knock him down cold in the canvass.Rematch is inevitable with this rivalry because both matches ended in the same manner. The current match is the opposite of what happened in the first fight which Pereira is in the unfavorable situation until he get the momentum to TKO Izzy. This is very nice main event to watch on a Sunday vacation.",

What a great performance for the both fighters and they also have great sportsmanship between the 2. Hoping to see trilogy in the UFC between the two. The speech of Alex at the end of the match is so good, it actually gives me a goosebumps and he only proved that he deserved the belt again.
