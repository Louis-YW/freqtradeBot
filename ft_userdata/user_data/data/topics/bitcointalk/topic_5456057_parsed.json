      "body": "Welcome to the official bitcointalk forum.The thread here is purely empty and lacking of words to convince the audience and reader about your project as an exchange platform ( No security aspect of the exchange was included, how are users funds being safe) then for a better view i suggest to get a copper member to be able to upload images. I think your website is entirely empty lacking of good designs and information.Wish you Goodluck",
