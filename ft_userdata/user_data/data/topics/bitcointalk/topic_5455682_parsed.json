But you can always have your own strategies and move towards the one that favour you the most. Risk management, using low leverage, learn more about indicators, controlling your emotion and to be discipline are part of trading strategy, but there is more to it.",

      "body": "As a result, his win percentage is around 100%. It's certainly achievable with little leverage, as you said previously. Even if the leverage is simply x2, a tiny percentage increase in price will gain you a lot if your capital is so large. So if he closes a position with only a 1% to 3% profit, it is considered a victory. Because he only experienced one loss, I believe his stop loss is set at a risk-reward ratio of 2:1 or 3:1. I've seen some folks that trade in this manner and are still profitable. We don't know what his approach is, but he most likely just trades when the market is trending. He appears to be a scalper trader.",

Only doing long trades so he is more relaxed. Look at the volume of trading he does, of course, he uses large funds to do it, because if you only use a small amount of profit will also be smaller. He has his own strategy and analyzes well. That may be his strategy so that his trading activities look more with less defeat. it is useful to attract the attention of people to follow him and choose him. Then the profit he will get will also get.",

As for strategy then there's no way on knowing on what strategy he is using whether having that bot or manually be doing this.The major reason I hate some of this copy trading stats is that someone could actually be using a very small equity to trade, like 1% of his total equity or even just 1 dollar. He will open 100x leverage positions, price moves the direction by over 10%, his ROI goes somewhere close to 1000% and boom! He's account gets ranked as the top traders by ROI just for risking $1 or 1% of his totally equity.Since a very small margin is used, even the fees will not be that much. So he could go on for quite a good number of trades before thinking of adding a few more dollars to the derivatives accountI wish OP would tell us the name of the account trader. I have a Bingx account, I would love to check out his statistics.",

Plus can you share some proof this could be just a show off in any case cause the win rate is too high. I think that would be great to follow if ever its true.

That stats is very impressive, 3069 trades and only 1 lost trade, that is nearly perfect.QuoteDoes anyone know what strategy he uses and why he only trades long and how he gets those results? I understand he uses a bot?I don't know that trader but assume your information is true, he must use a very strict trading strategy. He must be very disciplined and accept to don't trade if risk is big. It means when he opens a trade position, he knows chance to get profit is big. If he trades manually, he must be a very disciplined trader.However I believe he traded with a trading bot but you provided lack of information. 3069 trades but I need time for those trades, within 1 month, 6 months or 1 year or 2 years.",

Most likely what he is doing trading with extremely low leverage and basically never closes his losing trades. He probably keeps them open. Exactly.For example, 2x leverage is a good one for high market cap coins like BTC. Longing it at the current price would mean liquidation price would be at around 13K. If using small margins like 1 or 2 dollars, the trader can even afford not to use any stop loss or risk reward ratio and will close the position at whatever price is above the entry price. That will be recorded as a win for him. What he will care about is the win rate but not the ROI which could as well even be in negatives due to fees.",

After all, we also don't know if that person is such an expert that he only had one loss. It's interesting to learn because not many people can do it.And as long as it is for profit, people can use various methods, including what he did. And for people who want to copy his trades, you better be careful because we don't know how he trades. It's better to rely on our ability to trade so that we can improve our skills if we still can't help to make a profit.",

I understand he uses a bot?That trader is surely doing something fishy and keeping the ones in dark who are copying his trades. There isn't a strategy to win all of the time in the world of crypto-trading. Even if someone is expert in technical analysis he/she still has to face some looses once in a while, and that's enough to prove that strategies aren't always profitable and the market changes could destroy them.In the world of crypto-trading news media and other huge whales have enough power to change the condition of the market and if someone is constantly getting profitable trades then that trader will never ever share his trades and his open positions with anyone. Why would someone allow others to copy him if he is making millions per trade? I don't think that anyone would do that and that's why you should be careful when you are copying the trades of a user whom you don't know personally.Instead of following him and copying his trades why don't you learn trading yourself so that even if a trade doesn't work, you can still protect yourself from huge losses. I recommend you to learn trading as a beginner and only trade with short amount of money in initial stages of learning. After experiencing the trading you'll learn a lot about it in some time and may earn good income from trading.",

Learn how to trade and how to do analysis and do it yourself.As you said, these traders will not always provide profits to their followers too, if their trades start going wrong, they won't really care about their followers and make trades for them but they will start trying to correct things that have gone wrong with their own accounts and trades.",

It could be sheer luck or extreme precision. The only thing I can say is that the trader uses very low leverage which makes his trades more economically effective and profitable. I see some people calling it fishy but I do not find it fishy at all. In the real-world stock market, I have seen multiple traders making money with such precision without subscribing to any signal services. So such kind of result is actually possible. This doesn't prove that the trader is doing something wrong or fishy. Or it could be one of the platform-owned accounts. Some platform owner uses accounts with ramped-up stats to make their copy trading services more popular among the users. It could be one of them.",

If he only lose one, then it can tell that his strategy is effective, and that copy trading site offers a good one. I’m just wondering if its a high leverage, can that site provide more winnings too?
