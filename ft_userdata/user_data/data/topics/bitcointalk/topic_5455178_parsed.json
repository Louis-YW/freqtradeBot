  "content": "Once again there's a rumor spreading around that binance got sued by SEC for breaking some US rules (Im not sure which). BTC is acting weak since then for a while as the rumor is getting viral slowly. Cz says its just another fud. Shall we trust him? I always get afraid whenever a topic is about binance (as its the biggest liquidity exchange).Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/sec-sues-binance-and-ceo-zhao-for-breaking-us-securities-rules",

I've seen the news about Binance vs. SEC a few days ago, not knowing exactly what will happen in the crypto market going forward, 2023 has been a bad year for exchanges, it doesn't go away, exchange A has problems, B and C also have problems, now Binance is being sued by the SEC, indeed the war that happened on the crypto exchange, has been very cruel lately.My only hope is about the tragedy that is happening to Binance, hopefully it won't have a bad impact on BNB, don't happen like what happened to Luna, hopefully in 2024, all exchanges can be even better, without any problems like what happened so far.Very sad to see some troubled crypto exchanges.",

      "body": "SEC can always accused binance ofmjust about anything but Gensler alone has been saying a lot that people in crypto couldn't really believe. Even the congress witness it themselves for one moment he says a token is a security and then next he was questioned he couldn't say a thing.SEC accusing binance is a very targetted exchange where there are tons of exchanges before Binance that still operate today.",
