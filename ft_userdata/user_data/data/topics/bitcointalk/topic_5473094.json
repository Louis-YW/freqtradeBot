  "content": "Up for auction today are 9 different Fully Functioning Block Erupters!!First a little history about the Block Erupters for those unfamiliar with these items.  Originally 12 \"Emerald\" Block Erupters were put out as a proof of concept.  These are the absolute rarest of the rare when it comes to these little pieces of Bitcoin history.  Unfortunately there are none of those available here today.... however there are some RARE ones to offer up!After the \"Emeralds\" proved the concept the Sapphire Collection was released.  They were released in 2 batches.  Batch 1 had 4 different faceplates.  Batch 2 had 7 different faceplates.  The original sale price was 1.99BTC per unit and a minimum order of 300 units!  ....and yes that's 597BTC for the minimum order!      During my research I found that the early calculations for ROI on these were about 163 days and seemed to hold under 200 days until Batch 2 FLOODED the market.  A rarity statement about the batches:\"Batch 1 - Block Erupters USBs were all flat colors:- Silver with an orange bitcoin logo (First ones to be shipped out) (RARE!)- Black (COMMON)- Yellowish-Orange (RARE!)- Red (COMMON)Batch 2 - Block Erupter USBs had regulatory markings on the aluminum heat sinks and had slightly better surface processing done on them. While they were the same hash rate, they did have a few minor hardware improvements. These came in 7 different variations:- Black (COMMON)- Blue (COMMON)- Red (COMMON)- Silver (COMMON)- Gold (SEMI-RARE)- Blue with surface concentric circle effect (SEMI-RARE)- Red with surface concentric circle effect (SEMI-RARE)\"With that being said.... today the following ones available for auction:From Batch 1Lot 1 - Silver with an orange bitcoin logo (First ones to be shipped out) (RARE!)Lot 2 - Black (COMMON)Lot 3 - Yellowish-Orange (RARE!)Lot 4 - Red (COMMON)Lot 5 - This one is a Black (ERROR)(It had the faceplate installed upside down.
