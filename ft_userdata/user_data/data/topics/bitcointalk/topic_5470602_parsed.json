I seriously need your contributions and advice. Electricity has been one of the major problems that has hindered our economic growth in this country as due to poor or no electricity, many businesses has suffered setback more especially now that the petrol pump price has been increased thereby making it difficult for business owners that have generator.It is very funny to see how a country that has not experienced a stable power system will be supplying electricity to other countries like Ghana in compromise of her own country.However, there is always a way out of every challenge because as a result of negligence from our government in some vital sectors, it is advisable for one to take responsibility of one's needs in other to succeed. In as much as poor electricity  has been a lingering challenge over the years I think every individual needs to look for other ways of making sure that there business doesn't go backwards as a result of the fact that we don't have a stable power supply as in the aspect of how to charge your devices to continue your interaction in this community, I believe you can sort help to power your devices from a neighbor or business owners that uses generator to charge your devices",

I seriously need your contributions and advice. How you can get out of the epileptic power supply? I don't think anyone here can give you that answer since we're all suffering from the same plaque as you are and can only mitigate the issue through finding their own alternative. But na so we all they suffer from this lack of electricity o. And that's exactly how other MSMEs are also suffering from it. But like the MSMEs will look for alternatives, me and you too can. At least our activities require less power consumption unlike other businesses.So what I will encourage that you look for an alternative that can last you several times without Uninterrupted Power on your phone. For example, you can get a bigger Power Bank or add two extra to what you already have. There are also solar charger power banks available. You can get like two of that as a standard. So far as it is to charge your phone devices, that should suffice.Unfortunately, we live in a country where basic amenities have become luxury. Where comon electricity don turn to something else. Now we gaz go look for other options. But why won't it be like that. I remember during the senate interview of El-rufai for the ministerial position, he made mention of we having around 11 licensed DISCOS (Distribution Companies) of which it's only 3 that are functional. Then why won't their be wasted generated power whereas we are saying even the megawatts currently generated are not enough, yet we have enough being wasted due to lack of transmission and distribution.",

If you get some money you need buy better phone, ask your friends about their phones to know which phone get better battery quality wey dem dey use so you get get first hand information from experience users as nobi everything we go dey believe for phone manufacturers. You fit also buy alternative power supplies like power banks, small solar just for changing of your phone. This things no go take much from you if truly all your hustle na for the forum and if you no get cash, try look for manual hustle raise funds and use arrange yourself also I go advice you to get other alternative hustle just Incase forum cast make you no dey stranded.",

      "body": "OP I understand your plight and the fact that you find it difficult engaging in activities here as a result of the epileptic power supply here in our country Nigeria. As a matter of fact, this has been a problem in Nigeria when it comes to electricity power supply. Nigeria is yet to tackle the issue of electricity let alone to have it constantly being supplied to the consumers or citizens. You can be able to work with your phone if you can as I believe there are no much task here on this platform  you can not be able to work out with your phone. When it comes to creating a thread, replying or post or comment even to the point of wearing a signature and avatar, that can be done with a phone although phone features are a bit limited but at most some engagement can be done with a phone. When it comes to electricity as it regards to your functions here, it should not be a thing of complaint to you because you should always improvise to sort things out. There are phone charging spots where you can go charge your phone for as little as #100 more or less.  At least you have a barbing shop where you go to barb your hair, barbers do not bother their customers when it comes to charging of phone but they can only tell you to watch after your phone as it is your sole responsibility to do so while charging it. You can explore other means of charging your device so as to help sustain your work as the case may be. You may as well consider relocating from that place if you see that the electricity situation there is not favourable to you.",

With electricity, industries can function, business can thrive and other activities dependent on it will wax strong. Same is applicable to the Crypto and Bitcoin industry. It is true not every Bitcoin activities that can be done with a phone but for those that can be done with a phone and are beneficial to OP, I think it would be better for OP to look for a way out because what ever is your source of income must be taken seriously and as such OP should do the needful by looking for a means to power his or her phone if he or she means business. I have read other response from members and I think what they have said is what is obtainable and not negotiable if OP really appreciate his work. For the miners, before they think of erecting a mining farm, they already know the situation of things when it comes to electricity power supply so I believe they must have had an alternative means of power supply so that their business can strive because no reasonable person would depend on our electricity to power their mining farm.",
