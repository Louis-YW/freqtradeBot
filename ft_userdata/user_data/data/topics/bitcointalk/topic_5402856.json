  "content": "I bought some \"3x short Bitcoin tokens\" 7/25/2021 on FTX when the Bitcoin rate was BTC1/$34175 for 329USDT. 1 btc have been around $40000 for a long time now, and currently it's even down to ≈1BTC/22000 but my 3x short Bitcoin position is still currently only worth around 111USDT. I understand it's about time and value of an underlying asset. I also learned about \"volatility decay\" then there is a fee on this leverage. Furthermore, I don't think btc will fall much under $20000. But how long will it take for my short position to recover in this bear market, will it ever?",

This is the cost you pay for the \"no-liquidation\" perk.Go read up more about them, but they re-balance every day, meaning when the market is not volatile, you lose money, when the market is going up, you lose money.Honestly, unless you expect bitcoin to repeatedly go down in a manner that each day is a red candle increasing the value of your leveraged token, there's no way you're going to make money.To put it into perspective, go look up the BTCBULL token price from January 2021 (~30-40k) to Nov 2021 (2nd ATH), and you'll see it also has lost value.Next time read up on leveraged tokens and how they work.",

But very well just found it interesting to trade for a while, not the end of the world. Then yes that seems reasonable that the bulls from Jan 2021 was still in a loss Nov 2021 because the levels around the ATH was just brief.",

Leveraged tokens are far different from the usual x3 leverage futures or margin positions… If I were you, I should have exited the market way back via stop loss when things started going downwards.Leveraged tokens are usually suitable for only short term not long term. You will gain nothing or will get more losses holding the positions long term.",

However if it’s in your ETH wallet then find an exchange that supports the token and just sell it there.",

Depending on the leverage level you used, it could take quite a while before your position turns a profit.And when someone already knows about the uncertainty of profit in crypto, that is why some people suggest using free money that is not used for life's things in investing and also trading in crypto so that when bear conditions occur in the market, he will not easily get panicked and losses due to releasing its assets during a panic. Actually dealing with conditions like today is quite simple and simple, if someone has bought more Bitcoin, then be patient waiting for the price increase to come and if someone still doesn't buy Bitcoin at this time, then use it (free money which when experiencing loss is still very willing) to buy Bitcoins.",

When you opened a leverage token it would basically buys or sell the contracts on the perps market for whatever coin you wanted. And during the day it would keep the leverage balanced. And when you went to sell it, it would do the opposite.",

Yes, it's down right now, and investors doesn't want to leverage their money on FTX token. Not sure though why you mentioned Lightning Network? it has nothing to do with short position that the OP is asking.Yes, it's good that the implementation of LN is underway, but nowhere near what we are expecting to happen this year as we are in center of bearish market.Worst of all, next year this sentiments is going to continue. So taking position right now takes a lot risk.",
