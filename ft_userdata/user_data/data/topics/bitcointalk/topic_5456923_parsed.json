When we realize these things in our lives, we need to know how to overcome them so as not to limit ourselves by limited binding prejudices.My view for the transmission of electrical communication is that the object is suitable for the method of transmission, not everyone wants to listen because of the above that I mentioned, it is like a circle with no way out, most of the time. We're all going to go through things that benefit the individual, then the collective. In any environment, learning will have no limit, there are also bad and beautiful things that appear for us to get trapped in the game of life, not clinging to those things that we have to see for ourselves everything is positive and contagious.",

Not all the students like all the teachers so if those teachers students hated came to the class they would not like them. Sometimes the students would even walk away.And if the student is in that class, he will not learn anything. Open minded is always there if the student like the advisers, he will accept all corrections. Nobody on earth lives without mistake, so correction make life better. It is not always one is good mood to learn. So some time you have to do other things to forget some stress in the brain.Pride is one of the thing stop people to learn from others. This one can't teach me or I can't learn from this person, that is proud and you will never know that thing again. So if you want to learn you have to swallow pride and learn from the known source.",

Not all comments are equal in terms of their accuracy or usefulness. Sharpness is required to filter and focus on the feedback that can actually contribute to learning.Quote from: tech30338 on June 20, 2023, 01:47:32 AMAlways be hungry to learnMaybe I see this point more, so don't rely too much on other people's opinions and don't take it completely 100% means when Receiving information blindly without critical evaluation can lead to a shallow understanding or the adoption of wrong information.Quote from: tech30338 on June 20, 2023, 01:47:32 AMif you have something in mind please don't hesitate to add Here are some additional suggestions from me:A. Practicing critical thinking, That means Assess and evaluate the information received, even when it comes from a trusted source. Think independently and develop your own understanding based on evidence and logical reasoning;B. Seek diverse perspectives. The picture is when we interact with individuals who have different viewpoints and backgrounds. Exposure to these diverse ideas can broaden our understanding, encourage critical thinking, and challenge our own assumptions;C. Embrace respectful discussion. I think by creating an environment where ideas can be shared and debated respectfully. Constructive dialogue promotes learning and helps flesh out arguments and perspectives;D. Continuously reflect and reassess means Re-evaluate your position based on new information or alternative points of view to ensure continuous growth and learning.I think that by being open to ideas and comments while exercising critical thinking, individuals can navigate the complexities of learning effectively, both in the realm of cryptocurrencies and in a variety of real-life scenarios.[/list]",

They correct people in an unfriendly and disgraceful manner which might make the person react negatively. There is a need to correct people respectfully even if it is a child. Some people are not also happy when they correct them using disgraceful words like \"Why are you asking such a stupid question, you are so dumb for not knowing this\". I agree with your thoughts op but there is a need to learn how to correct people politely and respectfully.QuoteTips on how you will learn along they way, and be on track with crypto currency and also in real life scenario.Apply and test what they have told you All your recommendation are very good points but I want to add that you shouldn't apply before testing what you have been told. You should verify the information and if it is valid, you can test it before you apply those recommendations. Verifying is the process of researching more on the information and gathering more facts about it to ascertain if the information is valid or invalid. If it is invalid there is no need of going further to test or apply it.[/list]",

It doesn't have to be ashamed if it's wrong and it doesn't have to be arrogant if it's right. What is certain is that you must know how much ability you have. Admit if you're wrong, it's easier for you to keep learning to get better. But you have to have a way of validating. Validate people's opinions, because not all suggestions are suitable and good. Validate it by reading to find other information with good credibility. They give advice based on what they are going through so you have to adjust your abilities to everything.

Users who are able to keep their temper when criticized with constructive advice are those who are willing to take things as seriously as possible - but if they take offense, that's fine too.After all, egoism is different for everyone - so don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because in the end you have to learn in your own way.
