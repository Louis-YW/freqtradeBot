Not an official bounty, not from any dev or community fund, and not guaranteed by anyone including me.I am casually, temporarily, offering 100 grin for an open source C32 grin miner that can run on an M1 Mac at anything greater than .02 Graphs per second.No expectations of fulfillment, just throwing it out there for fun in case anyone is capable and bored.Here’s a more serious offer:I am offering 1 BTC for an open source Mac Studio (M1 Ultra) Cuckatoo32 miner achieving 0.5 Gps.\"Source:   https://forum.grin.mw/t/informal-bounty-100-grin-for-macos-m1-c32-miner/9652/2Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Mining HashrateCuckatoo32 -1.1 Gpshttps://2cryptocalc.com/what-to-mine-with-3090Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Mining HashrateCuckatoo32 -0.53 Gpshttps://2cryptocalc.com/what-to-mine-with-3060ti",
