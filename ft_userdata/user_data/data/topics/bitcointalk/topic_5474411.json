You should ask yourself what's the maximum amount of coins a poor person could get, not the minimum!A poor person is somebody who can't afford to invest in the first person, that's the definition, you're poor and you lack the purchasing power to buy basic needs for a minimum standard of living, at this point, you don't have spare money and even if you would have what's 50$ or $100 going to change? Even assuming Bitcoin would be able to make a x100 in the next decade on top of inflation (that's 3 million per coin) that would be a one-time paycheck of $5000-$10000, which would help your situation far less than simply trying to get out of poverty on your own in 10 years.",

However, there are minimum amounts that are usually set by most exchanges when buying using your fiat currency to exchange to USDT or directly converted to Bitcoin depending on the exchange.Holding Bitcoin depends on you. You can take a profit once the price goes up or hold it until the next bull run. No one can identify when it will happen, but the longer you can hold and wait for that to happen, the better.",

Typically a poor person has no money to be able to look after himself so he won't have much to invest in Bitcoin to begin with so he doesn't have to pressure himself by investing like others as he'll always be in need of the money. He can set aside 10% of what ever salary he's receiving and keep investing in Bitcoin. If he doesn't have a job then he need one first because the best way to invest in Bitcoin is by using it as a capital gain and not cash flow. There's no minimum amount that he should own but don't put pressure on yourself to own more than you'll be comfortable Hodling during market correction or you'll be force to sell since you can't stand the losses you'll be seeing due to the decline in price of Bitcoin. Quote from: Ndabagi01 on November 17, 2023, 08:02:23 AMYour question is amusing, but it still makes no sense. Many peoples still seek for approval from others that they feel are superior to them in knowledge or whatever they're trying to advantage into and I believe that's what the OP is doing. He wants those that have already succeeded in the field of investing in Bitcoin to guide him but OP fails to understand that what works for Mr A may not work for Me B. OP feels there's a specific amount an investor should invest to make profit from Bitcoin. OP isn't alone on this thought as I have people coming to me off the forum for similar advise but just as I have told them and you have said, the OP need to understand there's no minimum investment to make gains. We have to invest as much as we can invest and hodl until we have reach the profits that is okay for us.",

      "body": "There is no minimum nor maximum amount of bitcoin to hold OP. The real question is how much a poor can save regularly in order to invest part of it into bitcoin. Remember, only invest amounts that one can afford to lose. Bitcoin is not a sure thing especially when someone is looking for short-term gains, ask those who invested at $60k above. We can hold bitcoin long enough to pass it to our children and the next generations. The most important at least is to only consider selling them when in profit. due to bitcoin's scarce supply, the longer we hold, the higher the rewards.I hope OP is not planning to borrow money or sell something important in order to invest. Research and study bitcoin first in order to fully understand it. Once you have enough knowledge and you can answer your own questions, that is the perfect time to invest.",

A poor is someone who is not capable enough to meet daily deadlines like food, shelter, etc. You are either a Student or someone who is working on an average wage and that doesn't make you poor in any sense.Now coming to the topic of the minimum amount of Bitcoin, you should focus on investing 10-20% of your savings to Bitcoin.",

The first time I bought Bitcoin it was roughly $20, and I made that money from faucets, and later I started investing $50 in a month, through airdrops and faucets, I had no job and yes I was really poor, still I don't let that limit my potential, I looked like I was wasting my time but I actually wasn't, I got so many bad comments, some said I won't end up making a thing and they are dead wrong all along. OP you have the answer to your question, it's beyond anyone's on this forum, so start investing in Bitcoin even if all you can save up is a dollar, keep gathering the dollar to certain amount every day and buy Bitcoin at the month end, you will thank yourself later for taking this action in just a year or two.",

And the other one rejoices at pennies and enjoys, not considering his life poor. However, every time you think about investing, you must understand the system in which you want to invest your money. Poor people are usually less educated, and it is very easy for them to be sucked into a scam where they can lose all their hard-earned money. Therefore, study everything firmly, and then invest as much money as you can confidently live without for some time.",
