Let’s be honest and consider how low the price of Bitcoin compared on its total supply. Bitcoin is scarce while fiat unlimited print is now suffering the repercussion of bloating supply. Bitcoin is performing in good times and bad time of global economy. Only time will tell which most people realize how worthless the fiat and what they are missing for not owning a piece of Bitcoin.We might see multiple ATH in the future once fiat explode.

The reason for which I am so confident about this statement is because Bitcoins are limited in numbers, and the rise among people to acquire Bitcoins is increasing. Currently the price and marketcap is enough to prove that Bitcoins will rise.

Perhaps he worries to the extreme, but I see the point that the future need not repeat the past.The trend of bitcoin from the beginning has been to rise in price and it is normal to assume that it will continue to do so, not only because of trend following, but because of what bitcoin is, a decentralised, limited electronic asset that does not increase its supply when the price rises.Therefore, it is normal to assume the most probable, without ruling out the improbable, and in this case the most probable with a very high probability is that the price of bitcoin will continue to rise, and continue to break records, because of the above and because fiat currencies will continue to devalue.To the specific question he poses, I don't worry about bitcoin never making a new ATH, because I consider it extremely unlikely, and in that case I would consider what to do, maybe ask for a job at McDonald's lol.",

Just maintaining the same demand and supply that currently exists is what helps to drive up price, as we have seen in 2016 and 2020. While I'm personally not a big believer of the average Westerner dumping stable (enough) fiat currencies for Bitcoin, the reality remains that in hyper-inflationary countries, these users don't have much of an alternative store of wealth that can be used for payments other than Bitcoin.Quote from: a298b112 on April 21, 2023, 09:57:19 AMWhat if 69K was the maximum it could reach, and for the next years or decades it will be mostly fluctuating between 15k and let's say 40k. I'm also going to say that sure, price could be in the range you referenced for a decade or longer. After all Gold was in a range for a decade between $1K and $2K. The difference being that it maintained it's high valuation ie >$1K, after previously being valued between $250 and $750 in the 80s and 90s, which means it was/is still a good store of value, hence it eventually did make a new ATH even if it took a long time again.",

We're not guaranteed that it'll happen, but it is possible. However, even if we suppose that doesn't happen, I'd be satisfied with a price ranging from $45,000 to $50,000, since that's almost double my DCA. My average price acquisition is at $28,000, thus, I'd still be at decent profit and I'm satisfied with that, but as I mentioned earlier, chances are that Bitcoin reaches a new ATH within the next few years.",
