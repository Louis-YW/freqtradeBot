My story is not unique to me only. There are many more Nigerians like me who had to part away with their bitcoins at the hands of Police offers and unfortunately some have lost their lives too because they refused.

It's quite sad about the different cases I have even heard about as regards the attacks targeted at crypto holders or investors on social media or on other news channels. Here again I had to read same tales and the only thing that comes to my mind as a thought is that, what if everyone crypto holder stops to talk about it to anyone mostly when excited or tipsy or  for even campaign sake and just leave it to remain a secret that no one knows about. Still, it wouldn't do well to publicize or portray cryptocurrencies as a blessing to humanity and even if the cases of such attacks reduce, there's hackers and scammers to contend with. Everyone crypto or Bitcoin holder should do well to learn from the experience of those who have been attacked before and do well to adhere to security tips and protocols inorder to keep ones wallet safe from hackers and scammers and even physical attackers.",

It is quite disturbing that some of these attacks happen in person. For a quick judgment, I could say that they must have carelessly mentioned some how that they have BTC hence their attack, however, it’s not the case for all. For instance, those who had to do with Bitcoin ATM, and I don’t see how one will go to the ATM without everyone knowing that he/she is into crypto. So let’s think, does this mean using Bitcoin ATM is not safe as people could perceive you as rich, hence plan an ambush?",

Even if you had reported your own case, it would not have been reported to any media outlets, and you would be afraid to do so after being threatened with death by security personnel, those who are supposed to protect lives and properties are now the robbers themselves. Living in a country where you know your money is not safe when stored in a mobile wallet, it is preferable to store it on a desktop that you do not need to carry around. You can always delete a mobile wallet if necessary and redownload it back when you have your password stored safe and can’t be forgotten easily.",

I have been, handcuffed, beaten, and threatened with a gun not by armed robbers but the Police in my country. Their reason was because they found a Binance, TrustWallet  and other crypto apps on my mobile device during a routine stop and search. I was forced to send $1000 worth of bitcoin to a wallet address provided after they had treated me inhumanely or else they were going shoot me dead and frame me for robbery. I was scared shitless. My story is not unique to me only. There are many more Nigerians like me who had to part away with their bitcoins at the hands of Police offers and unfortunately some have lost their lives too because they refused. Many of which weren't reported and still happened up this till very day.Seriously? What about the situation of a passenger who has $1000 of Nigerian money in their wallet? Still, the police will treat them similarly and rob them or let them go.If citizens are robbed by the one who are supposed to safeguard them means the country is seriously messed up and needs some serious change.",

Attacks of this kind will only get more common as time goes by, since there is the false assumption on the minds of many people that believe that anyone that is part of this market is loaded, and if given the opportunity they are not going to think twice and steal from you, also we must consider the place where we live, since there are countries out there in which the police is corrupt, ineffective and in many cases they are criminals themselves, so the best strategy for someone living in a country like that is to bring no attention to themselves and carry nothing on them which could out them as a bitcoin holder.",

This forum is not like social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram where influencers, KOLs use to show their wealth. Hence, I believe your thread will not reach too many influencers or KOLs but I agree this thread is helpful.Because there will be some Bitcointalk members want to become influencers, KOLs in their communities. They must think more after reading those attacks (kidnap, kill) cases.Yeah, is such a long thread, I was just able to pick out some few cases because of how long the thread is, I really need to appreciate the OP for taking out time to compile all these cases, is really a job well done.Without been told, you will think cases like this don't exist, but here we are with such a long list of them.",

Posts on social networks shouting about a beautiful life will be taken under close attention, either by scammers or supervisory authorities. They always say that our language can become our enemy. Stories where you should remain silent about your activities will not be useful. I did not study all the cases of attacks on cryptocurrency owners, but if you imagine that if people behaved more modestly, they would probably avoid such problems.",
