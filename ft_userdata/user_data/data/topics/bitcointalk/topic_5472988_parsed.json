My resolution to invest in bitcoin is final and there is nothing anybody can do about it.I would understand why your family will be mad at you, because you have sold your family's land. And we all know that in every culture, a family land is very sacred, I mean it might be with your family for generations and generations and it's one way why you and your families survived. And from the way you put it, you might not have consulted them in the first place as you made that drastic actions and so there are going to be consequences.But not sure though how you made that actions, of course, bitcoin is a great investment no question about that and it can make you a lot of money in the future. However, it's family land, it's inheritance and so it's priceless for me and hopefully though if you make some profits, maybe you can buy back that land of yours. Best of luck!!!",

Now that you've made the investment, what if the pressure on you becomes too severe and you have no alternative but to sell the bitcoin and compensate your family members for their respective shares of the property? It will be really bad if that happens, but for the time being, your peace of mind will be more disturbed as long as they are on your neck demanding their money. Never borrow money to invest in bitcoin, the repercussions is always bad unless you can control it to the best minimum as you’re trying to do now with your family.",

We usually advise people against borrowing to invest in bitcoin because of how the market is and from all indication imo the medium op used in getting the money that he had invested in bitcoin is liken to borrowing to invest because from all indications the land you claim to sell seem not to be your solely yours but of a collective family ownership. It's true we advocating for more bitcoin adoption but we have to put it straight to people when they're doing it in the wrong way, always invest in bitcoin with money that's solely yours and you can afford to lose",

When making decisions, didn’t you think that the land you sold with the name of travelling abroad is not your land but what belongs to your family? What where you think? All I can say to you is that the decision you took was so childish because you used the opportunity of your family's illiteracy just to invest in bitcoin, whereas in bitcoin, you normally invest what you can afford to lose, not by selling the family property just to invest.",

I appreciate what you are planning to do, but you should also realize that there are risks in investing in Bitcoin. You should use safe money to invest in bitcoin, one of the conditions that makes people lose money when investing in bitcoin is when they need money and the price of bitcoin is not good so they sell the bitcoin they have at a loss. Even though there are many success stories in investing in bitcoin, there are also many people who lose money because of bitcoin. The main key in investing in Bitcoin is to hold it for a long time, you have to consider this and don't rush, adjust it to your financial condition. However, if you already have a strong determination to invest in Bitcoin, I can only wish you success",

Nobody who hears of such an act you took, will support you or say good of you no matter how you present it to them that bitcoin would make you rich in the future. Stop defending yourself because the more you do that, the more it sounds stupid that someone sold their family for bitcoin, he or she doesn't know its future fate tomorrow. If one of my family members took the same action you took, I would be very angry because he is sane in thinking of selling our family land as an ideal step to take in preparation for the upcoming bull run of bitcoin",

Dude, bitcoin is made not just about money, but about honesty, where Satoshi made long time ago just for goodness people who own that. So if you create the big lier and think if the benefit will make them happy, I think you've gone too far from what satoshi's purpose is. Maybe this time is better for you to be honest with your family, just tell the truth if their money (land) just invest on bitcoin. I don't think that's wrong, because the bitcoin value was increased, you have made a profit, If you tell the truth I am really sure, they will give for you money to buy more bitcoins.",

Telling a lie to make them agree to sell the property, what would you expect to be the result? The regret you feel for not investing early makes you agitated, resulting in investing even without the use of your own money. I don't mean to make you feel bad, but you should have set up a plan first before you initiate any actions as the approval of your family is required in this kind of plan. The reason why you've been abused and feel mad is that you removed their right to know about the investment. Even if you tried to educate them about Bitcoin and no one listened to you, that's not enough reason to make your own decision.",

Its great that you understand the details of Bitcoin, from the text to the fact, but you should also follow some basic financial rules. Spread out your investments and never let them cost you things or connections that you cant replace.Your family's anger is a sign of a bigger problem with trust and communication. Their dislike of cryptocurrency isnt just due to a lack of knowledge; its also a sign of how individuals with different backgrounds understand new technologies. But making big changes like selling land can cause family problems that are much worse than any money gained.You've called this a search for financial freedom, but what about the costs to your relationships? This needs to be critically reevaluated. You need to find a balance between your own goals and the needs of the group. Along with protecting finances, making sure that investments are clearly described, understood, and agreed upon can go a long way towards reducing conflicts and protecting relationships.",

If you don't have a job then never take big ricks because you should invest only if you are in good financial position, any time there may be volatility in the market, and you may face loss that is why first of all you need to have personal funds.

Is this a piece of land that has been in your family for generations but that is solely owned by you? In that case even if your family is mad because of what you did, you were in your right to sell it, so you just need to endure until the bull market comes and buy the land back if you can, while you still retain a great deal of your wealth that you can use in whatever you want.However if by that you mean a piece of land your family members had a right to, then you unilaterally took a decision that was not for you to take, and in that case your family has all the right to ask you what you did with that money as you acted without their consent.",
