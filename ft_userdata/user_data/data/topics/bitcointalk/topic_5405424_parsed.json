If its somewhere where mining is profitible you're probably more likely to be able to sell them without paying for international shipping. I can't find many places that sell them though or list a price for them that seems legit, bitmain don't list them on their website either.",

      "body": "That is a very weird situation - isn't there any information on the packages? Not even a logo from the seller? Can't you ask for details to the shipper as to whoever send them? Assuming current prices[1] you're looking at 24.000 € (excluding VAT) that someone paid and probably due to a typo in the address didn't received those units. Imagine that it was you - I'm sure you'll be very upset.At most I would once again approach the company that gave you the package to inquire further. When did you first receive these units?However, if you still do intend to sell the units despite all of this, you can do it right here in bitcointalk! You just have to post the ad in Marketplace -> Goods > Computer Hardware[2]. You can take some notes for the creation of the thread here[3]. You'll probably need to find an escrow for this deal considering the value that we're talking about.[1]https://www.antminerdistribution.com/antminer-z15/[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=75.0[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4576802.msg41268015#msg41268015",

I would never receive such a package, and every honest person would do the same, so let the company that delivers the packages deal with that problem.It's up to you to decide what to do, but I would personally return it to the company that delivered it with a written request that the package not be delivered to you anymore because it doesn't belong to you.",

Not only do you have a vocabulary problem, you don't seem to know the basics of grammar and spelling. If you received something that does not belong to you, the best thing to do is return it to the rightful owner. It can be a very important sum of money for someone. Imagine that you are on the other side, and that you didn't get the product you paid for. I suggest that you should do what is right and explore all available options for returning miners instead of trying to sell them for personal profit.",

Just search for your model of antminer online and find it's current price.According to that you can fix a price you want to sell for and then from the local borad enter your country's board.In the local marketplace section you can put up a post saying you want to sell these devices for this price.Interested people will reply to the post. You can also put the devices for sell in any app/website that your country has for marketplace.",

I would never receive such a package, and every honest person would do the same, so let the company that delivers the packages deal with that problem.I agree. If someone had purchased miners that ended up at the OP's address, they would presumably be trying to contact the seller, trying to find out where they are. Further, if someone had sold miners to someone, it would be unusual for them to be unresponsive to their customers, as the OP has claimed to be unable to get ahold of the sender.",
