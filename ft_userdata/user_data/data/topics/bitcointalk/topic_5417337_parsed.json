  "content": "HelloYou may think that they are a great site to play at but they just took me 25 mbtc telling me that my account was linked to another account. I told them that I had an account on nitrogen sports, and there was no indication that was not allowed to play also on nitrobetting. I asked for proof of me having other accounts and they told me that there were \"similitudes\" with an older account without explaining what they mean by that. They told me explicitly that they will not share with me what proof they have. They just took 25 mbtc. I had 26 mbtc just as deposits and previously cashed out once 10 mbtc. So in total I'm losing 16 mbtc just in deposits. Really can't explain. Their language was also really arrogant.https://gyazo.com/f3b7048291bbbb48f698ca4800a3e4ec",

When the truspilot and other reviews sites got so much negative reviews and scam accusations they changed Â the name to nitrobetting to get more new naive Â players. . In a year they will get a new name and they will go on .i dont really think if op messaged them here it will help .",

And also included an email frkm themGuys please check last email nitrobetting sent me. Now they are accusing me of choosing bets from internet sources and forums. So this is why they are connecting me with other accounts. They have confiscated me 500 usd for this ðŸ™„. My bets have been mostly live and if the bets are suggested you don't wait to place live bets. Wow, just wow. Definitely scamhttps://gyazo.com/c7ceb87e0bda94460bf2ba90f16d31ea",

Bookies will not share their information to prove an account is multi accounting with the excuse of opening a hole for the cheaters. Cheaters will always take advantages of the promotions. The fight is in between bookies and the gamblers. As forum members we are not getting paid nor can talk with confidence who is guilty because you do not have any data.Lately I am tired of seeing the accusations against bookies and them not defending cases with evidence.Betesports, is this money includes your deposit?",

Â  You should read correctly, he said he had an account with nitrogen sports in the past, and now this problem is with nitrobetting, the sister company. They migrated all old accounts from nitrosports to nitrobetting without even informing their customers, I also suddenly got nitrobetting emails even though I quit nitro 2,5 years ago, at that point nitrobetting didnt even exist. Then they told me about the migration and also that my account now is blocked because of \"similarities to an other account\", even though I never even created this account in the first place, so never logged in or whatever.Nitrogen is just a scam site and should not be trusted. They pull this multiple account bullshit all the time.",

Nitrogensports some years ago created nitrobetting and actively encouraged players to also play on betting.They sent emails to nitrosports players sounding like \" did you know nitrogensports has a new site you can try with more bonuses, more blabla, and so on\" .I even asked if its allowed to have accounts on both sites (because back then I was still ok with nitro and considered trying the new site) and they said it totally allowed.So OP did nothing wrong have an account at both sites, trust me.Well at least we both know nitro is a worthless scam, whatever which endingÂ   .",
