I've been using it for years and it simply does the job well and it's very light on the system. I've browsed CoinGecko with it for the past minutes and no popup appeared. I would advise you to uninstall AdBlock and just install uBlock Origin and try it out for a couple of days.[1]https://ublockorigin.com/",

I've never used Coingecko so I can't relate, but the pop-up is supposed to be a coin tracking tool, not an advertisement, thus, it's not being blocked by the adblock. Perhaps your browser may allow you to block such pop-ups. Coinmarketcap is just fine and allows you to switch between all major currencies on the top right corner of your screen.Personally, I wouldn't switch to another browser about such a petty issue, due to Gmail synchronisations with Chrome.",

We are discussing today that it is necessary to separate entertainment from cryptocurrencies, which means not even using the same computer for both activities. There are various levels of security and privacy, it all depends on how much someone needs it and how important it is to them, because in the end everyone is spying on us.",
