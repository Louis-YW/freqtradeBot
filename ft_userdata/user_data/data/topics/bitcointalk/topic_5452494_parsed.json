Some of the later ones are definitely accidents that were returned by the miners that added those transactions to the blockchain. For instance, the 200 BTC transaction fee in 254642 was returned by the miner in block 254769: https://mempool.space/tx/b18abce37b48a5f434f108ae7ce34f22aa2bfbd9eb9310314029e4b9e3c7cf95I think it is going to take like a decade for people to understand the the mempool fee market is an incredibly important part of scaling bitcoin.",

Mining pools can do the right thing to return mistakenly sent coins to the sender if there is enough proof for Bitcoin return. I remembered I read at least one case like that but there maybe more similar cases.After 2140, when all 21M bitcoins in total supply will be mined and available, no more new bitcoins will be mined from mining process. Miners after that will receive bitcoins in transaction fee only, no longer receive any bitcoin from block rewards. What will happen with mempools, Bitcoin scalability in 2140 will be vital for Bitcoin miners. They must receive enough from transaction fees to pay for their operational cost.With what happened around Ordinals, BRC20 tokens and very expensive transaction fees, I believe that miners will be fine with their mining earnings in future.",

What will happen with mempools, Bitcoin scalability in 2140 will be vital for Bitcoin miners. They must receive enough from transaction fees to pay for their operational cost.I think the things will be very different after 2140 or even before it. As we all know that the tech world is improving at a very fast rate if the rate continues then things will be totally different in 2140 than the way they are today. As the technology progresses the new jobs are created and who knows that in 2140 the mining operations won't be run by individuals but by the whole governments or or companies. In that case would the transaction fees be enough to fulfill the cost of running those power-hungry Asics?I think that the current miners will sell their Asics if the mining halts in 2140 because they won't find it lucrative and would lose the interest in their Asics. There will of course be mining operations but who know what the future holds for us. QuoteWith what happened around Ordinals, BRC20 tokens and very expensive transaction fees, I believe that miners will be fine with their mining earnings in future.I don't think that the miners will ever be happy with the transaction fees only because that kind of events appears hardly once in a while and in the deep sense these are not good for Bitcoin as they cause more harm than good to the popularity of Bitcoin. Although, the miners will be incentivize for short term but that won't hold for too long.",

More people need a better understanding of how fees work and which wallets they can use to set the fee manually. Too many wallets have fee presets like \"low, medium, and high\" but those are arbitrary terms while 1 sat/vbyte or 10 sats/vbyte are objective and precise. I also feel like coin control can help with some of these scaling issues but not enough people know that merging inputs or sending to multiple outputs increases the size of the transaction and inflates the fee.",

Exchanges will approve their withdrawal request and broadcast those transactions. The withdrawal fee from centralize exchange is always expensive and it is much more expensive than the fee you can use by yourself if you broadcast your transaction from a self custody wallet.Not all wallets or websites that give fee estimations are good and correct. Some will give you overpaid fee than a more feasible one to use. Don't rely on them completely and always go to mempool sites and check mempools.Quote from: Jon_Hodl on May 13, 2023, 03:05:11 PMYes, I agree.

The more people that broadcast with RBF, the more precise and efficient the mempool fee market becomes because more people will be bidding below the average priority and waiting for a slump in mempool congestion. I have done this a few times in the past couple weeks and it has been working well. The issue is that it will take time to educate everyone how to use fee bumping efficiently and effectively.",

Full credit goes to him: https://twitter.com/alistairz80aftw That's for sharing. I was reading about this on twitter recently and the general consensus was that it not only hadn't happened since 2017, but that was the first time it had happened as well. So it's interesting to see that this has happened through Bitcoin's history, especially when a lot of mempool data doesn't go back beyond 2017, so it's otherwise impossible to tell when there were fees as high if not higher.Quote from: DooMAD on May 12, 2023, 03:20:09 PMBut, more recently, Bitcoin has essentially gone a full 5 years without any massive, prolonged spikes in fees and suddenly people are crying that the project is \"dead\" just because it's been congested lately.  Just goes to show that people don't look at the big picture.  Too much reactionary drama with too little justification.My thoughts exactly. Nearly everyone in fud-based threads was claiming that it's been months of a congested mempool and the situation was never going to improve, whereas already within a few days the fees have reduce by over 95% and even last month most of the 1 sat/vB transactions were cleared out, so it hasn't really been months the mempool has been congested what so ever.We're now closing in on the 10 sat/vB theshold, which when crossed, will likely see the mempool cleared out again within a week or two. People forget how quickly this occurs, because despite the perception that with low fees there will suddenly be high demand, the reality is most of these transactions have already been made and are sitting patiently in the mempool already, so they'll clear quite quickly imo.",

That being said, their worry is definitely overblown. Not sure what the exact reasons are for those who are genuinely asking though. I can only assume the ability to make transactions with cheap fees is very important for their living. I've seen a few threads saying miners don't care about those who don't have the capacity to spend $100 for transactions fee here and there. Maybe they are also new and never see any congestion before.",
