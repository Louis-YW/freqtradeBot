One person should not have as much as 14 accounts, but if a person does and they have not used it to break any rule, they cannot be tagged or accused of anything, except account farming.",

But since the accounts last post are since 2019 and 2020, which they're not doing any wrong for 2 years, is there any reason why you're want to report those accounts? For me, if the accounts activity are inactive and didn't have any good reputation, I wouldn't take a look in depth to prove if they're breaking the campaign rules and will got negative feedback.",

Because Later, the community will say you are a potential account buyer. You exposed them because the price negotiation wasn't suit your budget (This has already happened with a guy. But luckily community didn't believe the seller). I guess this guy has a Good ranked account or was scammed by account sellers. So, He was trying to expose those sold or up-for-sale accounts.

Could it be that the time range is a period they go to bed in their country? My major interest is not whether the accounts are controlled by one, but none of the accounts has gotten to full member rank, despite registering as far back as 2017, 2018 etc. I believe that the chances of one person controlling 14 accounts is rare, because there won't be quality in the post, unless for works as dumping links in the thread like bounty hunters do.Quote from: Crypt0S0ul on September 09, 2022, 05:01:25 PMA few days ago.

You shouldn't be discouraged by the fact that your investigations are being questioned. All investigators go through this at some point. If you have valid evidence, you should persevere, even if some members are skeptical. Let the evidence do the talking.",

If you look at the security log, you can clearly see what I'm saying. To make matters worse, all the accounts in question are worthless shit to give us a headache. Until they found out how difficult the forum is since they were last here, they would return to the caves one at a time. It's not even the season for altcoin or bitcoin and all the bounty right now are all scams.",
