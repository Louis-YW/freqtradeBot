      "body": "It is really nice to think that troll face meme is revived, and is once again being endeared and appreciated. This is a classic, and preserving it would also mean preserving memories and and experience of those who were really into it at the time it came out. However, I don’t think that I am interested with it being affiliated to NFT since this seems to be just a scheme to make money out of it. Plus, the original creator of the troll face meme won’t even benefit and credited to such creation, which the original artist truly deserves.",

From 300,000$ going to 10$ ~LOL.Even shitcoin can still better rather than NFTs, we can cut your lose because have some orderbook to be fill. Meanwhile NFTs need to wait buyer first.",

Although for such collections, if you're up for it and it's affordable you may get one and if it has got a big part of your childhood or memories or it's making you happy.You may want to spend how much it's worth right now but to think that if may go up in the future, it's much better if you don't think that much.",
