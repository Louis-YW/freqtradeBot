      "body": "There are also some common mistakes that happen when carrying out bitcoin transactions using the wrong wallet or when you, as the sender, don't understand what you are doing. I have read in this forum and also in other places where some people overpay transaction fees as a result of using a faulty wallet or trying to customise their fee and end up spending an amount that is even higher than what they are sending out. I'm not trying to justify what the bank did, but most times we can also check from both sides as the mistake is yet to be identified. The cause could be the sender's fault, or it could also be that of the bank app used. If it's a bitcoin transaction, with the transparency of the system, you can identify where the money went to (the wallet), but what you can't identify is who the owner of the wallet is, and you can't also reverse that transaction as the money can also be considered lost forever.",

I also don't see them as disadvantages either, as it's part of the good features of Bitcoin.

Even if it's just 1 confirmation, there is literally nothing that can be done about it. My own definition of reverse is if the coin gets to the designated address and then you initiate a sendback, which will then bring back the coin from the wallet, which receives it back to the sender's address. Such things happen with bitcoin; they are only common on Altcoin, where the contract developer has such revoke access.",

You should not overestimate bitcoin, as well as underestimate fiat, but rather take a realistic look at existing financial instruments and use the advantages of this (having leveled out the disadvantages by using alternative solutions).I often see people totally discrediting the fiat currency or the bank system I know we all must have had a very terrible experience from this traditional banks but I will say they have some times I prefer to use them over bitcoin as at then it will be easier and that’s why we say bitcoin is an alternative to it and not to take over from it, although bitcoin edges over it way more to me. But regarding this particular Situation bitcoin can never be like this, this a situation where the bank charges the fees without his prior knowledge which is very wrong. On bitcoin network you fees are what you set by yourself when you see excessive fees then it is usually the human error of the sender, no miner can take more than your fee. Look at the the price example you brought it was the sender that used 0.7bitcoin as fees Quote from: MeGold666 on September 16, 2024, 03:05:39 PMIf you want your transfer on Bitcoin to be finished with the same speed as wire transfer, you will have to pay similar amount in network fees Just look at the high fees people are paying:https://mempool.space/€100 is the fee charged there, this is not usually common with bitcoin although on some occasions when there is congestion we get this kind of fees but not right now.

You wouldn't blame bitcoin for big fees if a cex you withdrawn it from wanted €100 for the transaction either.But i guess that it's a good selling point that you will always need some kind of bank that takes a fee when you send fiat money. It's just not often that much, depending where you are sending it to and from what kind of account. And sure, sending it from your own wallet is cheaper than with banks any day.And selling point for fiat money on the other hand is that banks have lots of more safety measures in place, than one person without any tech skills could provide for themselves.",

They will appreciate this market as fiat transactions are really becoming expensive and would require a lot of documents if you try to send high amount of money to other people especially with cross-border payments. As people who are here in the forum already experienced the swiftness of crypto transactions, they just wish that it is also true with fiat payments. For those noncrypto users, they won't understand this market up until they tried creating their first transaction. The first transaction is usually the make or break for any person.",

I think there's a complication somewhere; €100 can't be surcharged for a transaction of €1000... The fiat system has never operated without compliant.  Sometimes when I decide to fill out the withdrawal slips in the bank, the number of people queuing up, waiting for the customer care rep to attend to their diverse cases is enough to tell anyone the truth.He should just visit and make a complain in his local bank or better still, call on their hotline.",

I used to write texts and translate stuff and one contractor wanted to pay me $500 for a job and sent me the money through paypal, but when I got the money it was only $470 or something like that, which used to be a large hit for me. Maybe for many of yo $30 isn't a big deal, but back in the day when I was studying, I'd spend $10 a day on groceries, so $30 was a big deal. For instance, a cinema ticket was $10 and you'd pay $3 for a beer in a pub. They wouldn't charge the guy that paid me, he thought he was sending me $500, but they'd for some reason charge me, the recipient. Have you ever wondered why banks charge you so much money for exchanging foreign currency? Why their rates are always so much worse than what private exchanges offer? Why does it take 5% or something like that for moving money abroad? What if you have a million to move abroad? Why do you have to pay them your yearly wage to do it if it's just numbers on a server?",

You pay to send this type of wire and you also pay to receive a bank wire. So if you are sending a small amount, like less than $10K, then its a huge fee. There is no avoiding that. Honestly best never to send any small wires.Similar situation in bitcoin. When fees are high, its also not wise to send any small amounts. Right now fees are low but there are times when you end up paying $10 just to send a single UTXO. And Ethereum is worst at times. I remember during the conjestion days having to spend $50 just to move 1 stablecoin. And their onchain swaps were worst, when I had to pay $75-$100 just for a simple ETH-USDT trade.",
