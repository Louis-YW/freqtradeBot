There are 13 and 10 card rummy variants. I like the 10 card version of rummy more because it is faster and easier to learn and it should be provably fair. I can even give out more info as it should be a single player rummy. some call it solitaire. means you don't play against anyone. First of all, it is not the idea to bring it to casinos. It is for me as it is unique and will be a real money maker game for anyone who will offer it.But to be frank for example for me I would need to find participants that will take time and eat money and then when out everyone can copy it. That's why I thought that there are many casinos out there with a large amount of players/members and let's take for example Freebitco with 50 million + members, for them it would be a money printing machine. especially because they have Fun Token and it would fit in perfectly. Imagine a daily skill game tournament with xxx participants with a small buy-in and the sum of all buy-ins goes back to the players/participants as cash prizes from the prize pool. Thanks again and stay safe!",

I may have posted this in the wrong sub forum, as no developer has replied yet.Cheers",

Offering it on a website makes a lot of sense to me but I thought a dapp might be a good idea. but again I am not an expert.Cheers",

Where do you live? cash could be crypto or stablecoins. if a license is needed I will need to check which one and if to expensive or to much headache I will look for someone who has also license and maybe needs a cash printing machine   as this game idea is a cash printing machine if it is in the right hands",

To sum up your points \"An owner should not receive rain or tips.\"- 10/20 - NotTardy hits Jackpot for 105 BTC only receiving 72 BTC of the actual wager.- 10/20 - JackPotRacer receives 4 forced tips equal to approximately 30 BTC from NotTardy- 10/21  - JPR rains 7.x BTC to his users as inline with his contest.Proof: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1508394.msg16636073#msg16636073So where did the remaining 23 BTC go? You kept it. Just as you did with every other jackpot win. You walked away with a 23 BTC forced tip.-------------",
