If it's bitcoin-qt then the above is right look for the wallet.dat file you can mostly find it in the bitcoin folder under AppData/Roaming/bitcoin.Or use the search button just go to your drive then search and use the \"wallet\" keyword to find it.Once you find it make sure bitcoin-qt is closed because sometimes if the bitcoin-qt is running while copying the wallet.dat it would become corrupted. So make sure it's closed then don't forget to make multiple copies before you try to extract the private key from wallet.dat. You can also use pywallet to dump private keys from wallet.dat.",

It was only the name that was changed and there isn't any big difference between them. Bitcoin QT was actually rebranded to bitcoin core in that time. Whether a wallet has been created by bitcoin QT or Bitcoin core, it should have created a wallet.dat file.Please correct me, if I am wrong please.To OP:Since you have used your wallet for mining in 2010, you should have a wallet.dat file. As already mentioned above, try to find a wallet.dat file or your private keys.Note that if your wallet.dat file is encrypted, you will need the passphrase for decryption as well.",

Perhaps I need to emphasize it: With only one year ahead of the genesis block, the only wallet software he could have used is this, provided that he owned the coins. If he stated he had been mining in 2012, or 2014, there would have been a variety of wallet software that he might had used.",

That should be OP's last resort, and not the first thing to do. Proper recovery instructions have already been provided. If OP gave us the correct information and the computer with its hard drive are still running smoothly, they should be able to access the coins. Let's just hope there isn't a password used for encryption that monTTana has forgotten about.",
