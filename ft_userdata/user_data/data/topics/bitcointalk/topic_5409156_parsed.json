      "body": "Interesting. I also just read that Nvidia has posted financial results showing a big drop in gaming revenue.I was wondering if they might drop LHR as a result. After all it was a knee jerk reaction to angry gamersduring a supply shortage.As far as new 3060s not having LHR I'm a bit suspicious. They shouldn't have to respin the HW, a driver updateshould be able to unlock LHR until Ada Lovelace is out, hopefully without any LHR.",

Someone in China told me this, trying to confuse me to forget the LHR part though, what do you say friends.? I think that the LHR is still there and for example the Gigabyte brand which posts 1.0 version without LHR,then 2.0 LHRv1 and then 3.0 LHRv2 and even V3 in some other manufacturers is there,with a driver update this limit can be removed as many of the mining software have already done so in their latest versions.Now it is worthless if Nvidia make the cards with LHR again knowing that over time most mining software developers will unlock them,it does not make any sense or good logic if they keep producing cards with the LHR enabled.",

      "body": "I am pretty sure Nvidia will eliminate LHR GPUs since they are not going to run into the out of stocks GPUs due to miners buying them all out. The reason why they did it was because gamers complained to Nvidia that miners were buying all their GPUs and they didn’t want to pay these crazy prices.Hence why LHR was introduced. However now with mining profits low and Ethereum going POS there won’t be much demand for GPUs in general, so they will get rid of it since it serves no purpose anymore.",

Well said @Philipma1957, if we humans can read minds we will see clearly that Nvidia loves miners the most, this world big business cares more about making money not workers or less buyers, look into their mind you will see that miners are booming their business more, they just throw that play out on gamers to think otherwise.",

There are millions of 3xxx gpus stocked in their deposits because of the manipulation, there was never a real shortage, they created this shortage, now they have too many gpus and yet they are still manipulating the market, they will not send all those gpus to retails because if they do, they will have to cut 70% off those gpus minimum of msrp and they dont want to do it, plus they have already too many 4xxx gpus already. Only idiots/trolls believed this gpu shortage.",

Someone in China told me this, trying to confuse me to forget the LHR part though, what do you say friends.? RTX 3060ti LHR and RTX 3060ti are the same in mining. Miners do an excellent job of unlocking. But the RTX 3060ti was released at the very beginning of sales and is older than the RTX 3060ti LHR version. The RTX 3060 12 GB had some problems with unlocking on some algorithms, so study about them in the announcements of the miner programs.",

Because they knew it wouldn’t of made a difference. New miners bought LHR GPUs anyways and were upset when they started to hash at a lower speed.But gamers weren’t all over the Nvidia forums and doing nothing but complaining about the shortages and scalping and how they will switch to AMD. So Nvidia responded with LHR.",
