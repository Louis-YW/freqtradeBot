So you are proposing an idea and I thought this is a thing already in functioning haha silly me. Well, I liked the idea and it will make things really quick while talking about the token but what if any token will not be listed on these (CMC/CG) sites, or what good it brings for us?I mean people search for the tokens/coins on these sites when they have to get the live price, trading volume, etc., etc. Or some specific information according to the post in which it has been used like \"the trading volume is skyrocketing\" One might want to see that and this automatically hyper linkage can take us straight there and can save our 30s. Well, small ideas will always save time, but in my opinion, the developers of this forum should add an equal sign in front of IMG and LINK tag so we don't have to write it manually <-- This suggestion can save more time of ours. And still idea is an idea and you made a good one.",

And btw, what do you think will happen if a user decide to just include a special character in his post that turns out to be a ticker? Or some random token comes up with a token that its ticker is not found in cmc/cg what would be the result? It would only just make the post be filled with so many urls that lead to nowhere, if someone wants to checker out a token then they should do it the way they have been doing it… after all this is not an app its a forum so all they have to do is to open a new tab aid they don’t want to lose their current screen and search for whatever it is that they want to search.",

It's not much of a big deal to get a coin's details through the coin tracking sites like the two popular ones you mentioned. I know that lately, there have been so many requests and ideas for some features, local boards, subboards, and applications for merit sources that seem very important but are still pending. I am not condemning your idea, but I believe that the boss T would come across all this, and he would only add the one he was well convinced about.",

I understand the idea, but it wouldn't actually enrich the forum, for several reasons:- A user might not want their text to be associated with a link, regardless of what they wrote. He almost no longer had \"power\" over what he wrote.- The forum is diverting its user traffic to third-party sites. And the objective is for the user to remain on the forum for as long as possible.- Which site would you choose? I had to earn something to be giving traffic to that site. Something that goes against the forum's own \"rules\", where affiliate links are not well seen (especially when they are hidden).- A user could like CMC more than CG, or vice versa. Taking into account that it was the user who wrote the post, how do you choose the site you prefer?- Technically it is possible, but it is not very useful for the community.Therefore, despite understanding the idea, I think it is not useful for the forum, nor does it make sense for such functionality to exist.",

I wonder how occupied he could be and, what op is suggesting is just something that will be favorable to him maybe if someone else comes and noticed any difficulties he would also want to suggest what will make him have easy access to what he wants by then the forum won't that safe anymore. What I sense from op is that he is a regular user of social media and he wants the entire environment of bitcointalk to looks as one but I can tell op with full assurance that here can never be like other social media, so any one who must stay in this environment most learn to be friendly with the forum.QuoteAnd I don't know about coingecko, but CMC has been undergoing a lot of changes as of late and who's to say they're going to remain the top site for prices and such? Maybe Yes or No, but I believe for now they are still the best price checking site for cryptocurrencies there may be other site I don't know but for years now I can say they have most of the population of cryptocurrencies being listed in the site. Any coin/token that is listed there easily get great exposure especially in terms of price increase, still I don't doubt you but with time more site will overcome them.",

Both CMC and Coingecko provides a more accurate and reliable real-time information and analysis on various cryptocurrencies unlike Preev which simply a ticker. And compared to Preev, they're more well-established platforms and are less likely to experience outages or stop working.In addition, The company has a 40 man team with 6 data scientists, and Forbes estimates it earns between $20 million and $30 million a year in ad revenue. While Coingecko claims it has over $3 million in annual revenue and tracks over 3,587 tokens from over 259 exchanges. That's a lot of money if you ask me, so it's almost impossible for these companies to experience an outage with that kind of annual revenue.",
