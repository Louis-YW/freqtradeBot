  "content": "Hello guys!Could of days ago I wrote a post while Bitcoin was going up that it's a bad time to buy it and it will go down because of the macroeconomic factors. And now, could of days after, bitcoin is really falling. So I want to explain why and remind you of what you can expect next.So while bitcoin was pumping, some people were hesitating if they should buy bitcoin right now, but for me, it was pretty obvious that crypto winter is NOT over. It's not that I'm really smart of something, I just try to ignore all this hype that comes from Bitcoin going up 1-2k. I just follow the same signals for the last half a year.So first of all, I want to recommend staying skeptical about people saying that bitcoin will keep pumping without any visible reasons. And also try to ignore FOMO. You won't miss anything and you still have a lot of time to buy bitcoin at a good price.So that being said, I want to share my thoughts on what to expect from Bitcoin next.My predictions have not changed, I still think that Bitcoin will fall or stagnate for the next half a year. It's all connected to the economic crises that are still happening in the US.I still think that the best signals to watch are FED actions and interest rates. When FED will start cutting them, I think it would be a good time to buy crypto.There are some speculations that interest rates will soon go down, but I don't really see a strong reason for that. We still see that core inflation is high so FED still needs to push more to lower it. So we probably see another 0.25% raise at the next FED meeting. And after that, there is a possibility that they will start cutting them in Q4 of 2023.But I think it's pretty early to assume that, so lest just keep watching inflation reports.I wish everyone a nice week. Stay safe.",

If the trader reacts positively then of course the price will go up, but if the trader faces it in panic then of course the price tends to fall.I agree that the correction in the bitcoin price that occurred during April is normal case after the market started to recover since January 2023. It is impossible for the price to continue rising without stumbling (correction) to find new support. Also this correction was a lesson that it is not normal to expect price to always go one way even during recovery, this is a perfect opportunity for anyone looking to buy at lower prices.",

Interest rates are currently still high, and the Fed also added 0.25% in March, bringing the total rate to 4.75%. But can you explain to me, why bitcoin is still going up from 15k to 30k despite interest still being high? Bitcoin is unpredictable, it can still rise no matter what the Fed does.",

If you've been in this space for awhile then you know this is nothing and it's very rare that outside news effects the cycle. Without fail BTC every cycle has lost between 70%-90% of its value, then accumulation starts then eventually the pump that restarts the bull market begins on top of that there still hasn't been a bull market where we don't go above ATH. It's almost like its \"programmed in\". After being in this space for 11 years its become very predictable to read. The only factor BTC hasn't endured is an actual recession, not \"covid\" recession but a 2008 level recession and with BTC being so tied to stocks it will be a very interesting time, personally I don't think it will start \"depegging\" from this standard like all the die hards want.",

I have some stablecoins in my wallet that I want to use to take advantage of the market, I am only waiting for a better opportunity, not those 15% decrease in price, if Bitcoin can go down to 20k once again it will be a wonderful buying opportunity again.At the same time, I don't want to keep waiting and waiting, because it will become too late to buy at any moment, those who are waiting for the FED to start cutting rates down don't know that it will be too late already if this happens.",

It is not \"crypto winter\" and bitcoin wasn't \"pumping\" when it went up as it is not \"dumping\" now that it has came down a little.In any case there are two main reasons for this recent \"tiny\" drop, the main one is the fact that price failed to go any higher and short term traders are pulling out their profit trying to gain another entry at a lower price to make more profit.It is also because of the ongoing recession that I've been talking about over the past year. People simply have not enough money to invest and they also are forced to sell whatever assets they have to make a living. Hence the sell pressure.You can see this in all markets and also in the society. For example check out how the number of looting of supermarket, shops, grocery stores, etc. has skyrocketed inside United States over the past couple of months.",

As you can see, bitcoin is going down and I believe that it will keep falling. As I explained in my last posts, this Bitcoin rise wasn't sustainable. There are literally no reasons for Bitcoin to go up now.So I want to remain you guys again that right now is not the time to buy bitcoin.Inflation is still high, interest rates are still getting higher, FED is not planning to stop any time soon, and the economy is suffering. All these reasons won't let Bitcoin rise from the ashes YET. But I believe we will see the end of it this year, probably in Q4. So I recommend holding on to your cash/stablecoins right now and waiting for the signals to buy Bitcoin.And as always, the best signals to look for: FED start cutting rates. When this will happen, it will mean that economy will start recovering soon so it's a great time to buy anything you want before crypto and the stock market will go up.Have a nice day and take care.",

Stay safe.First of all, you sounded like a financial or investment advisor because of your statement like “bad time to buy Bitcoin”, etc., coz’ you’re trying to tell the world that you want us not to buy Bitcoin as of this time. That’s really a financial or investment advice statement to me, which is something that I didn’t like at all.The truth is that there is no “bad time” and “good time” to buy Bitcoin. Coz’ there’s no perfect timing. Even the so-called pros of crypto trading aren’t perfect in their TAs either. The decisions would be entirely on our own instincts and not listening to the so-called “financial or investment advisors”. You’re not the one who decides for us. The future is in our hands.

And why don't you just keep buying when it's down and hold until the real bull season comes? I'm having the opposite feeling as you, I'm excited to see bitcoin drop because I'm waiting for that to happen to accumulate more bitcoins.

When Bitcoin remains stable for a few days, there is a heightened risk of significant movement in either direction. If Bitcoin jumps in value, it is likely to experience a subsequent dump, and if it dumps, it is likely to experience a subsequent pump. This is why Bitcoin is considered a highly volatile cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, long-term holders need not fear, as they have historically seen gains. Patience is required, but the rewards are often substantial.",
