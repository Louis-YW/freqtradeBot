I don’t this so, there were two warning threads about a breach on the Atomic Wallet system I’m not sure how it happened but users were advised to sweep their coins into a more secure open-sourced non-custodial wallet. A Non-Custodial wallet, Atomic Wallet, being compromisedAtomic Wallet hacked! Get your funds out now!",

I just wondered if there was any way to recover or block the address of the hacker ?You can not freeze bitcoin in any Bitcoin address (in a self custodial wallet) but if it is altcoin, altcoin developers can use their smart contract to freeze it. If hackers send your bitcoin to exchanges and you know what are the exchanges, you can open a support ticket with proofs to ask them freeze those coins for you.It is hard as you must have evidence and I think the hacked amount should be big to be noticed by customer support staffs. Exchanges can do it with any user account on their exchanges but they need reasons to do it.Two months are very long time, you are too late.",

This can be done if your country legalized cryptocurrency,and you need to act fast but from your explanation,I guess it might be too late because the hacker might transfer the coins to another wallet by selling it,if he used an exchange to keep the coins.

      "body": "Why did so many ppl trust Atomic Wallet when it's closed source? Atomic wallet's noncustodial decentralised so users are responsible for their cryptocurrencies. 1% users were hacked so they're paying the price for trust. Blockchain tracker ZachXBT said the largest one-person loss was $7.95 million the five biggest individual losses accounted for $17 million. Full hack stolen was $35M from 1% Atomic Wallet users.Atomic wallet aren't updating their blog. If it's an inside job they'll leave clues if they're professional hackers it won't be easy finding the criminals until they move funds between addresses.

But is it possible that everyone will have a hardware wallet ? If they have small assets or want to reduce expenses then obviously use an online wallet. So what wallets should we choose? The answer is Open source non custodial Wallets which are Electrum, Blue, Mycelium wallet. They are the safest from every online wallets.

Even It's normally impossible to catch up a transection because Bitcoin is decentralized and anonymous. At that time hackers are much intelligent than a common user so they will mix their coin or something else. You should know that in 12 years technology still not able to catch up hackers.

Never use a close source wallet like atomic wallet in storing your funds.
