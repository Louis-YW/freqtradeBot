      "body": "First of all note that since bitcoin was created, we only had a few upgrades like segwit and taproot to make some improvements. Bitcoin is still bitcoin and will remain bitcoin.Secondly, it's not that easy to propose an idea and get it approved. The proposal should be supported by vast majority of miners.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 11, 2022, 11:16:15 PMtoday they might be proposing a change to some fee mechanism. tomorrow it might be changing the max supply.In the case by changing fee mechanism, you mean taproot upgrade, note that however taproot makes some transactions cheaper, that wasn't why taproot was proposed. The main purpose of taproot is to improve the privacy.Also note that maximum supply of bitcoin will never change. To change the maximum supply, we need a hard fork and if that happens, the new coin will be no longer bitcoin.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 11, 2022, 11:16:15 PM#2: anytime you introducing new changes to bitcoin, you run the possibility that you are introducing bugs. Every proposal is reviewed by many people and it's very unlikely that an approved proposal causes a bug which ruin bitcoin.",

What about the point of view that to KISS. Keep it simple stupid. Doing one thing and doing it well is better than trying to do alot of different things. I would much rather bitcoin try and stay true to its roots and just be a way of sending electronic cash rather than adding all of this extra features and complexity into it. Let that be something else. There are always going to be new projects that pop up that try and do something else. Let them do it. Let bitcoin be what it was originally and no more.So if we just need to send electronic cash then we don't need taproot. Legacy addresses are just fine. Keep it simple stupid theory at work.I guess if quantum computer comes along then well that's a different story but none of the changes that have made it into bitcoin up to this point do anything to mitigate QC anyway.QuoteNot only that the technology around bitcoin also moves forward and we could run the risk of creating new vulnerabilities for bitcoin that were unthinkable before, so this attitude of not updating bitcoin will simply bring more problems than benefits, while it also makes no sense, because as a society we are always striving to move our technology forward and it makes no sense to somehow exempt bitcoin from this.I prefer a cryptocurrency whose sole purpose is transferring cash electronically. Don't necessarily want it to be anymore complicated than it needs to be. Don't necessarily want it to have anymore features than are absolutely necessary to achieve that goal. How could bitcoin become outdated? math always works.For example if I want NFTs, I'll try and find something that was built from the ground up for that particular application. But that's another story since NFTs kind of just got patched into ethereum as an afterthought...",

The Bitcoin you want cannot be removed by the new updates that keeps appearing. Think of Satoshi that created Bitcoin out of cryptography and Vitalik made Eth out of the idea of Satoshi etc. The root is open source and any update can pop out as many developers have personal reasons to bitcoin contrary to what you want. They build as they view and nothing will stop it. Don't think it'll get complicated, just like maths, a new formular will be hard to learn immediately, but, sooner or later you'll enjoy using the formular to solve problems. If the formular is difficult, you can stick to the existing fomular you know how to utilize.",

I don't think bitcoin code is very well documented and structured. I've heard it being called \"spaghetti code\" which if that's the case, that means it is not very maintanable. But I'm glad you used the phrase \"been carefully thought out\". There's no way you can carefully think out in full detail something that is spaghetti code. What ends up happening is you keep your fingers crossed that nothing bad will happen after putting a few eyeballs on it and maybe seeing if it works in some testnet scenario.

I'd like to see bitcoin code be modular, elegant, readable, well commented and thus more easily maintainable. If not then I don't see how you can keep going like that with  just patching things that don't work quite right.

You are right when you say that some changes are happening when it comes to Bitcoin, and we can discuss whether they are good or bad, but as many others have already said, these changes do not change the very essence of what Bitcoin represents. People believe in the Bitcoin that was given to us by Satoshi, but even during the time when he was active, many changes happened and this is a completely natural course of events if you want to improve any product.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 11, 2022, 11:16:15 PM#1: that kind of ruins the idea that bitcoin is going to be the same today as it was yesterday and tomorrow. today they might be proposing a change to some fee mechanism. tomorrow it might be changing the max supply.The idea of changing the max supply is radical and does not have many supporters, because it is essentially negative and would cause a lot of damage in the short term, but also in the long term. You have to accept that everything in life changes, whether it's about you as a person, the computer you use every day, or the car you drive - so you can't expect Bitcoin to stay the same forever.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 11, 2022, 11:16:15 PMAnyone that's ever tried and program some simple software and then later on come back and add new things into it it can end up being a nightmare to try and understand and maintain the code...there's alot of bitcoin users out there who don't understand this aspect of bitcoin at all!The average Bitcoin user will never be able to understand some complicated technical things, but does that mean that you should lose faith in Bitcoin because of that?
