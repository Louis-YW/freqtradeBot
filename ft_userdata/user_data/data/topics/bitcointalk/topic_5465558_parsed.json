Remembering the past Bitcoin halving this is a similar scenario market price is already going to skyrocket probably months before even the Bitcoin halving event we probably we could already expect 40k$ in the end of the year or either esrly next year.September was not a good month if i remember correctly in the past so i sont really expect any this momth. I dont really expect anything my only goal is the Bullrun and aiming for long term investment . In my opinion this is a better methos and dollar cost averaging. Most of the cruptocurrency is going to skyrocket  so as long as you are going to sell on the Bullrun or just aiming for that it wouldnt really matter as long as your going to start accumulating today and only sell at the top.",

But what is certain is that we are going to experience a bull run when is what we don’t know, and I also believe and agree with many that have commented before me that  we are going to see the bull run but the time frame and the new ATH that will be added to the chart is what is not clear yet.",

Difference between estimate and real halving date is a few days would be acceptable inaccuracy of estimate.",

Only by price and only with a biased chart that doesn't go as far as today.Price is all very well but it is a consequence of why you should buy bitcoin, and that is because of its characteristics that make it unique as a decentralised, autonomous system with limited and finite supply. If you manage your bitcoin, they cannot seize them, or at least not as easily as they can seize your money from the bank. And if you want to send a good amount to another part of the planet, you can do it in ten minutes, without asking permission to send your money, without filling in forms or giving explanations.",

The first time I bought Bitcoin was in 2017 and I summoned my courage to hold because of the past Bitcoin price action, such things give encouragement, there is nothing wrong with looking at the past data history of Bitcoin. We are all different, some people don't need proof to keep believing in Bitcoin, and as we head into the final battle of the bears, faith will be shaken, doubts will arise and only the strong will prevail, in these cold ❄️ times we can only hope for the best.",

Your welcome. It seems simple to you @OP, but your reason to choose bitcoin to a total newbie with no understanding of cryptocurrency is not enough. This same reason can be used by someone who has already chosen to invest in an altcoin to convince a total newbie to cryptocurrency to choose a certain altcoin too, and they will be convinced, so it is not a sufficient reason to choose bitcoins. The historic price of bitcoin is good to note, but when trying to convince a newbie, more reasons are needed.",

The chart probably won't make you believe it because maybe they're beginners, but it can give you one proof it's happening. And it keeps repeating. So start preparing, with the red sauce you've bought to enjoy the green sauce after the halving. Many people really hope that this period, there are many possible options. I still believe in this period. So for people who don't believe don't you start please go and wait when the price has gone up. Many people regret it when prices have gone up and they say \"why don't I buy when the sauce is still red?. LOL",

Indeed, there is nothing wrong with seeing data like this, because the picture shows the price of bitcoin has indeed increased significantly, but buying bitcoin is not just like buying then you will make a profit, it is not that easy, there will be a risk that when you buy bitcoin today it will be the same tomorrow the price will drop, and a bitcoin holder should understand this.that's very good if someone wants to invest in bitcoin, that means that bitcoin is an interesting asset for people to look at. However, if his mindset is still fixated on profit, in the end a person like this will be disappointed because he cannot get rich quickly as he expected.someone who invests in bitcoin must be aware of the risk of volatility and not just fixate on data like this. they must be absolutely sure that they invest in bitcoin really because they want to invest and are aware of the risks, not just because they follow other people.",
