  "content": "Ukraine applied to join the NATO, and in a bid to extend it's arm of support, member countries have pledged millions of dollars worth of air defence systems to guard Ukraine against Russia.Countries that have pitched in to support Ukraine are Germany, the US, U.K, Canada, France, Netherland and Poland.Germany has sent units of its Iris-T air infrared-guided air defence system, and the first four of them have already arrived in Ukraine.Weapons from Germany include self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and portable surface-to-air missiles.The US has pledged to send the NASAMS system, which can also shoot down aircraft, cruise missiles and drones.The US has also given Ukraine weaponry worth more than $15bn (£13.5bn), including the long-range Himars system, Javelin anti-tank missiles, howitzers and Switchblade \"kamikaze\" drones.UK, Canada, France and Netherlands are also sending air defence systems.Poland is providing almost a quarter of Ukraine's weapons from abroad, including T-72 tanks and missiles for its fighter jets. Some of the Soviet-era equipment it has provided has been upgraded to perform better.Equipment sent by the UK includes NLAW anti-tank weapons and MLRS long-range missile systems.Since the invasion of Russia in Ukraine,this has turn out to be a massive amount of arms NATO countries have been sending to Ukraine since February. In addition to these, NATO also included extensive training to Ukrainian troops.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18023383 I'm curious, with all this supplies will they be able to win or is zelensky just prolonging the inevitable??",

I would settle for peace. Russia will never admit that they lost. And when you think about this senseless destruction of cities and lives, do you really think things would heal very quickly? And even after that peace there will probably be ton of pissed off Ukrainians trying to get their justice one way or another. They will most likely try to revenge all the torturing, raping and pillaging by something Russia will call terrorism. Only thing speeding up the healing would be to overthrow Putin and withdrawing immediately. Ukraine will most likely want their their old borders back so that's going to be an issue as well.Sadly replacing putin could mean there's going to be even more war-hungry megalomaniac in charge. Putin is going to be hard to beat on that but there are many crazy officials ready to step in.",

      "body": "NATO countries spending huge part of their defense budget to supply weapons to Ukraine. But it's not enough. For counter offensive operation they need long range missiles, but NATO isn't giving as they don't want \"escalate conflict\". Ukraine is liberating occupied territories, but it's not going as fast they want want and it costs too many lifes of their soldiers. Also, they need much more air defense systems. Currently they managed to shhot down something like 70%-80% of Russian missiles and drones. It looks like good numbers, but remaining 20-30% is making huge damage to their infrastructure.Also, big part of arms that they get is soviet tanks, jets or very old howitzers and armored vehicles.

What would be point of it? Involve NATO into this war directly? I don't believe in such version.Ukraine still believes that it was Russian missile and they want to participate in investigation of accident.Even if was Ukrainian missile, most blame still goes to Russia. As Scholz said, \"it's clear that this would not have happened without the Russian war against Ukraine, without the rockets which are constantly, in large numbers fired at Ukrainian infrastructure\":https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-scholz-hopeful-g20-resolution-condemning-russian-invasion-2022-11-15/",

      "body": "This situation is getting more complicated every second of the time...If this attack on Poland isn't investigated properly I just see the whole blame going to Russia and not Ukraine, because currently we don't know who shot the missiles on Poland leaving two villagers dead, and if it happens to be that is Russia, I see the NATO members protecting there own and joining the war directly instead of supplying weapons to Ukraine.Things are really getting out of hand...Russia is being accused of a missile strike that killed two people in Poland.Here's what we know about the developing situation that has caused alarm across the world.What has happened?There was an explosion at 3.40pm local time (1.40pm UK time) after a missile hit a grain silo in the eastern village of Przewodow, near the Ukraine border.Two Polish citizens were killed.Poland's foreign ministry initially said the missile was made in Russia but, later, Poland's president Andrzej Duda was more cautious, saying it was not yet clear who fired the missile or where it was made.Mr Duda said it was \"most probably\" Russian-made but this was still being verified.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called an urgent meeting to discuss national security.Poland raised the readiness of its military units and the Mr Duda spoke with US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.What has Russia said?Russia's defence ministry has described reports of Moscow's involvement as a \"deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation\".It added in a statement: \"No strikes on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border were made by Russian means of destruction.\"However, a large number of Russian missiles had been launched at Ukraine on Tuesday, with several hitting the city of Lviv, just 50 miles from the Polish border.What has NATO said?NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg spoke to Mr Duda about the explosion late on Tuesday.\"I offered my condolences for the loss of life,\" he said in a statement.\"NATO is monitoring the situation and allies are closely consulting. Important that all facts are established.\"Poland has not been directly involved in the war, but has welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees and widely condemned Russia's aggression.What has Ukraine said?President Zelenskyy said he had long warned that Russia's actions were not limited to Ukraine.He added that any strike on a NATO country was a \"significant escalation\" and called for \"action\".What happens next?The first step is to investigate what happened.NATO leaders will meet in Brussels later today and are likely to seek to invoke Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.According to Article 4 of the alliance's founding treaty, members can raise any issue of concern, especially issues related to security.A more extreme measure would be to invoke Article 5, which provides that if a NATO member is the victim of an armed attack, every other member of the alliance will consider this as an attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist.How has the world reacted?Leaders of the world's largest economies are in Bali for the G20 summit, so US President Joe Biden called a meeting between G7 leaders and the NATO members present in the early hours of Wednesday UK time.After the meeting, he seemed to contradict reports that the missile had come from Russia, saying: \"It is unlikely in the lines of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia, but we'll see.\"Shortly after the explosion, Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad said he was \"very concerned by Russian missiles dropping in Poland\", adding: \"Russia must explain what happened. Senseless attacks on infrastructure must stop immediately.\"Russia's recklessness is getting out of hand.\"US Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said America would \"defend every inch of NATO territory\", but added that he had \"no information to corroborate press reports\" of the alleged Russian attack.UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly tweeted: \"We are urgently looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, and are in contact with our Polish friends and NATO allies.\"Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said she was monitoring the situation closely and in contact with Poland and NATO allies.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo tweeted: \"We are all part of the NATO family.\"The Estonian foreign ministry said the news from Poland was \"most alarming\" and it was ready to defend \"every inch of NATO territory\".https://news.sky.com/story/poland-what-we-know-about-russian-missile-strike-in-nato-territory-12748459If the missiles is truly from Russia and not Ukraine, Will NATO join the war and protect it's own or rub this whole thing off and go for peace talk to end this war?",

President of the US Joe Biden stated that it was unlikely that the attack was carried out by Russia. The Russian military has also denied that it carried out such an attack. Rather they are suspecting that it was one of the air defense missiles fired by Ukraine in a bid to defend itself against Russian attack. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is claiming that this attack was orchestrated by Russia and that the world should act accordingly. Poland is a member of NATO and it has the right to invoke Article 4 of NATO’s treaty which starts the discussion about the attack if it is discovered that they are in danger, Article 5 of NATO’s treaty can be invoked which could lead to NATO members joining the war. But for now, that missile likely came from Ukraine and I pray it was from there. This is because the world might not survive a full-scale war between Russia and NATO.",

This action by both the US and NATO goes against the agreement they signed that the West would stay away from the East. One would see the actions and donations of the NATO as magnanimous, I see it as all a grand plan to flush Russia out.

Within a span of six months, where Russian oil goes has changed completely.China and India are forming the backbone of the latest surge in Russian seaborne oil exports. Other countries like Turkey, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates are also deepening their ties with Russia by purchasing more oil. (Related: US-EU price cap on Russian oil threatens India’s crude imports and economic growth.)In the 28 days leading up to Friday, Nov. 11, the volume of Russian crude oil heading to China, India, Turkey and to several other countries has  soared to a record 2.39 million barrels of crude per day.China and India still make up the vast majority of this Asia-bound crude.

Turkey received 300,000 barrels of crude per day and around 410,000 went to unknown destinations.Tankers hauling Russian crude are becoming more secretive about their destinations because of fears that the EU or the U.S. might retaliate if they find out certain countries are purchasing more Russian oil.Brighteon.TVRussia diverting even more oil to Asia to avoid new oil sanctionsThe U.S., EU and their allies, including the United Kingdom and Australia, have imposed a new set of sanctions on Russia that will come into effect on Dec. 5....",
