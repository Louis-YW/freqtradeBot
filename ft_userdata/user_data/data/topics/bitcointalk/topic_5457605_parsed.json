But it is good to know that gambling is just about the matter of luck because if he wins, he is only lucky. And because he wins most of the time, there are days of disappointment too. And another thing is that a gambler may win more for sometimes and later lose more. Gambling is just gambling, a gambler telling others that he is winning more is just rubbish because gambling is luck and very risky.Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 07:11:39 AMWhy did they go around looking for people to teach? This is why experience after following a friend to a gambling group on telegram, but I am not ready to take the step in any other their predictions..I have noticed this in trading, so not a surprise to see that people are doing it for gambling too. They know people are not wise there are many people that can fall victim of them and be scammed. If the person pay them and they teach him, with him continuing to lose would be when he will know that he has been scammed.

If it comes to money, avoid or you will be scammed. Go to prediction sites, analyse some matches yourself and just pick like one or two matches and be good, rather than to be depending on someone.",

If you have a winning strategy in gambling, you don't want to bring it out publicly. For example when you get to offline gambling house you see bettors who win at least average of 50% but such people don't give out same games that will win but they can give out less probable winning games and conceal their real winning games. You hear such people cashing out the next day while your game given to you by them will fail. That is the reality of life.Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 07:11:39 AMWhy did they go around looking for people to teach? This is why experience after following a friend to a gambling group on telegram, but I am not ready to take the step in any other their predictions..Your getting to a telegram group may be good for you to have an experience that will help you understand what is happening there. Example if you don't pay you are not given certain games, you just get average games like free prediction but both paid games and free games have no guarantee.Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 07:11:39 AMMy question for you my friends is are there sport betting groups that gives betting calls that are legit?

Not really winning games because nobody is certainly giving you such. They research them from other prediction sites and compare with their knowledge of the games and collect fees from you as you register. They have different levels of registration up to VIP and VVIP",

They cannot, nor will any telegram or forum group be able to guarantee you a win. They use their knowledge on a certain sport and give you a reasonable statement as to why a team will win. Most of your telegram groups are just people hoping to get lucky on their picks, you see the same here on the forum. These people disappear pretty quickly as they go on a massive red streak and noone wants to follow them anymore. Basically, stay away from the group unless you are just following them for a little extra fun. Don't join hoping they will make you a millionaire in a month.",

So it is better not to trust any strategy that is advertised as proven winning mechanism because it not always true and those involve in those scheme are aware of that,  but choose to deceive newbies who are looking for sure strategy when there is none.",

Hey let's give them the benefit of the doubt and well, they're just really nice people who is looking to build a community of sports gamblers. But well to say that there's isn't a legit sports betting group that gives out calls is fake, is kind of, well, fake imo. But, it's simply a chance that doesn't really make you change or turn your life around imo. There's legit groups out there most likely, probably a community of people who really like numbers and statistics that offer advice, you'd be surprised by how much free time some people have. At the same time there's also probably a lot of other people who's going to use that to scam people in the worst case, or manipulate/skew the odds in their favor by using ignorant people.",

There are legit groups in the sense that they already tell you that they don't guarantee you any results and you bet on your own risk and usually there are a couple of good telegram channels.They usually win more than they lose but as I said they cannot guarantee you any profit in the long term,you can also join them and have a look at their stats because most of them keep statistics or the ones more advanced send you daily notifications,I don't remember the names of such channels as I used to use them some long ago but I know they are there for anyone who want to have an idea of what other people think of betting in sport in general.",

Lets be honest nobody will want to expose where they are truly making money from just to random people online, if those people are really having the strategy which they claimed, then they wont want to sell it because they will believe it can be exposed at any moment.",

Like they join different of such group but they belong to the free signal section to see what is being predicted there and they use them alongside with what they see from some other groups, they compare and contrast before staking their bet. These are the class of people who do betting for a living, they have the time to research on all that they want to bet. They sometimes compare idea with other bettors and doing such has higher chances of success sometimes but if you rely on just what was predicted without your personal effort then you may likely just be paying call fees with no benefit.",

Precisely the same question to the signal sellers. They create a secret group and sell their crypto signals to their subscriber. If they know the market movement, why don't they open a big position and change their lives? Why they have sold their so-called crypto signals to people to make money?  This is among the most selling scam courses or subscriptions people still buy.

I came a across a famous punter on twitter called mayor he's very good with his predictions and chances of winning his predictions are very high and he usually does some sort of giveaways to his followers thereby assisting them with funds to stake on his predictions, he has a high staking power and if you register into any of the bookies sites he operates with, you stand a chance of getting double the amount of your first deposit into the site.    Well you're right because most  of this punters don't share all their winning strategies to their followers, cause they believe this bookies would take note of it and block the options, because the sites is a business for the bookies owners and they won't want to keep loosing. However what some punters normally do is drop a random game options with high chances of winning and ask their subjects to edit to smaller odds and stake high, it works most of the time but some people out of greed would want to make larger profits and end up losing.",

Since if there's really a perfect one for them for sure they will not share it and also they became greedy to bet more then make their selves more richer. This is so obvious thoughts to think about since its so shady why they want to invite more people.

So most times they can share one winning game and it is not out daily. Therefore, rate of there winning is not constant and not anywhere near 85%. Moreover, giving out just one game is not enough because majority of bettors are those who don't have huge pocket to take big financial risk to stake on just 1.30 odd (on A level teams like Madrid, Barcelona or PSG, Manchester city) for example because some of those \"sure\" games that those groups share out are already predicted winning games around the betting space, so a bettor need at least reasonable winning games like 3 different games to play for a reasonable potential winning.
