      "body": "Why someone should start investing in NFTs is because people just like what has no value to be valuable, there is nothing special about NFTs than normal coins and tokens which are better. I prefer to just invest on coins and tokens that are fungible which their value are based on demand and adoption. People can not quite fungible coins and tokens for NFTs because both can be invested on. No one that knows about crypto that will not want to invest on fungible coins and tokens.",

And what was interesting about it? ðŸ˜‰I think people here very few people invest in NFT, here we only prioritize coins, tokens over NFT. But admittedly NFT is trending on twitter these days and recently Facebook also allows users to connect to metamask wallet to show NFT on facebook and I predict twitter will soon do the same as facebook and reddit did. It is not yet clear if the NFT hype will return when the bull season arrives but it does indeed still have a small niche to grow and not die as many have speculated. Investing in NFTs is still profitable but finding a profitable NFT is as difficult as finding new potential altcoins.",

      "body": "It is precisely this question that makes me curious why anyone would want to invest in NFT, so far I only see it as the same as crypto in general, only NFT is made like an art work but I don't think it is. This is not to attack those who invest in NFT but its initial purpose for art in the end mostly just ends up as coins traded on exchanges same as coins in general.So far have never invested in NFT and have no interest in investing in it, at a high enough price on well-known NFT projects investing in Bitcoin makes more sense in my opinion.",

But for those who are not, then probably it's the hype around NFT for the last couple of years that made them invest on it.Admit it or not, this is how the market moves, if there is a new hype, then investors flock on it and pour their money to take advantage of the situation, \"strike while the iron is hot\".",

Overall, I don't recommend anyone to invest in NFT, it's like a monkey investment, it doesn't have strong fundamentals and definitely won't last long.",

People invest in bitcoin because they like safety, they want long term investment and they don't like short term and risky investments like altcoin or NFT. I am a person who holds most of my assets in bitcoin but I have never missed any trend in the market, as long as it can generate profits then I would consider investing.",

It's just full of hyped a f stuff, which is yes, in some form can be an investment if done properly but the most that you could probably rely on would be luck and not anything good about the NFT itself imo. NFT's are a big thing though, even some big wig companies are doing it though I don't think there's a proper idea as to how you'd actually invite non-NFT enthusiasts into buying them. The hype around it really is about the money being made, and not about the NFT itself from what I've seen.",

NFTs are computer generated images which can be copied a million times and no one cares about its ownership. So I don't personally see a reason to invest in NFT at all. It will be a sheer wastage of money and nothing else! NFT is a marketing buzzword. Whoever invested during the initial phase of NFT, made some money. But now it's almost impossible to make money in NFT market. It's a failed initiative. So if you are serious about your money, buy gold or bitcoin. Never invest a single dime in any NFT for God's sake!",

I read news about losing a lot of money with the NFTs art, this might be the next trend now after the hype. NFT will become more interesting if many projects able to find itâ€™s purpose.",

However, investing in NFT is a different story, people are thinking that riding hype could make them instantly rich. Well, some people got lucky and multiplied their money but some did not (including me) which I think was too risky than investing in Bitcoin alone. If I were you OP, don't focus into NFT but rather spread your fund to different coins to have security, otherwise.",

NFT was illiquid2. It's pretty much the same like art3. Value determined by personal view4. Mostly of these assets were not having any value on it. 5. Lack of utiltilities6. many more bad things about NFTSwitching from crypto to the NFT is the worst choice that has ever been taking by crypto investors. Why do they need to switch from liquid asset with more utilities to the useless illiquid assets without any utilties? i guess the only NFT that's worth to hold is hyped NFT like crypto punks but the price of NFT was also going down so hard.

Your money that used to buy NFT might be gone caused by there will be no demand any more for your NFT. The old owner of NFT might be lucky enough to have you as a buyer for his NFT.Â   think about that.",
