That's only what they have to flag, blacklist and blocked abusers the same time those users who are randomly scammed by their \"fraud team\" without giving any valuable and strong proof. Most of them are just probability, a percentage that a user is an abuser by their rigged system or what word should fit to that. Asking for help on askgamblers and other review sites and third party mediator could be very helpful to at least remove those gambling sites as recommended gambling on their list. Or file a lawsuit.",

Are they not deceived, It's the newbies that I often see here crying cheated $ 100k to $ 500k, do they not read the rules, bullshit.I personally don't believe the ramblings/accusations made by newbies here, it's so stupid for newbies to bet up to $1000k in online casinos, where does that kind of money come from, all bullshit, strangely, they accuse almost all the casinos here, casino A loses $500k casino B loses $500k, per satan, is it possible that an account is made to accuse in any sense of the word (competition), attack each other with a beginner account, wise thinkers judge it.",

They think that all the rules are almost the same as other casinos so they deposit money immediately and if there are difficulties, they quickly accuse the casino of scam. And therein lies the biggest mistake of players who do not read the terms and conditions while the casino does what it can.But casinos suspected of committing fraud are deliberately toying with their users on the pretext that their users violate their rules. Apart from that, players should also be able to choose a trusted casino so they don't experience difficulties.",

      "body": "Even if gamblers read terms and conditions, they would see it's pretty common casinos close accounts and confiscate money when they spot the gambler as a potential cheater. Every casinos will act like this in order to protect their businesses from abuses.The point is how each casino is handling with this issue. Some casinos don't present any evidences when punishing gamblers, what increases the suspicion they are the real cheaters, instead of the gamblers. However, terms and conditions aren't directly related to this issue. The main concern here is the reputation of the casino, how the gambling community sees the platform.When a casino starts acting maliciously (like 1xbit does), there will be lots of negative reviews on the internet about their services, so other gamblers won't feel encouraged to deposit on that platform. That is the key factor which is going to prevent lots of gamblers from losing money to a scam website. Terms and conditions will remain mostly default for most websites, though, and hardly ever gamblers are going to read it in every cases.",

The defense is to use reputable sites and denounce any unfair treatment in this forum to assess.It's possible and would be easy for non-reputable or small casino sites to do especially if they are focused on monitoring their users' activities. Since they have the right to change their TOS anytime, they could use it for their lucky players but I don't think reputable casinos do it. Reputable casinos strongly implement their TOS but they won't restrict your account if you are not breaking or violating any of their rules. Our choice of casino will always have a huge part in our gambling activities. If you want peace of mind, then always pick a trusted casino site and of course, we must be mindful of the terms of services and should be aware of the regulations that we should follow.",

There are some people who always look for flaws of an online casino and as soon as they find the flaw they just misuse it by earning all the bets.That thing can be harmful for the online casino as well for the users of the casino. Those people who find such flaws will have higher advantage to earn all the bets because of the bus\\flaw, and the others users will mostly use their money to such hackers. I would call those hackers rather than gamblers because they misuse the system.There are some scamming casinos who do that as well because those sites are mainly doing that for looting  the money of the innocent users.

And also for smaller amounts: I had to wait more than 48h from a gambling site in the past... to withdraw $10!
