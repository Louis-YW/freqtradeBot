  "content": "If you are asking for a bitcoin loan without any collateral, it is irrelevant as to when you will pay back or how much interest you are offering, as the instant you receive the coins you end the agreement with prejudice.The lure of the instant payback was great in the days before the internet; if someone needed money and was willing to pay 50% interest, they would be monitored by a goon until they gave the money back.On the internet, you can evade my goons every time with efficiency, and then move on without a second thought. If you have an idea that you are sure will generate a lot of profit, go to a loan shark.   They can make sure you pay them back - we cannot.Have you heard legendary rumors about an account that catches loan scammers?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfpoSrCGsQ",
