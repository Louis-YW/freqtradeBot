Using the mine coins for trading is very risky unless you have knowledge and skills in trading and if you also have free power you don't need to worry about the monthly electricity bill and risk of loss in trading but mining units have a lifespan we do not know how long your mining units can mine.

Small miners leave the business, big miners take over their spots.You should probably invest in something else.",

How much per kWh and how much power can you get at that price? Do you have a location and the budget for this at hand? If you do have the favorable conditions you can start expanding on the subject but otherwise, well...Of course, since we're in the bitcoin section of the forum I assume we talk about bitcoin mining, if you're interested in GPU then you can start a topic in altcoin>mining",
