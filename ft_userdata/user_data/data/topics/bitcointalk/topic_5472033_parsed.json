      "body": "Let me start by correcting you that the N27,110,056.50 exchanged value you came up with is a heresy, the actual value of 1 BTC in Nigerian Naira is way more than that. By my rough calculation of 1 BTC at $34,100 and $1 at N1155, we should still have a whopping N39,385,500 (34100x1155)N. My guess is that you used the official exchange rate, but this would only amount to a serious miscalculation as how many people dealing with Bitcoin use the official exchange rate for their BTC/USD to NGN exchange? I guess no one would do that since there is access to higher P2P rates. We are already dealing with an electronic payment system and this is where we get our fair exchange rate which is so close to the parallel market rate. No one would like to cheat themselves with the official rate while they have access to a better one. Or do you do otherwise?However, those whom you call white might be in a very sane country where there is value in living and ease of making money. This is unlike Nigeria where we all know the hell being faced here. This is why we don't think like them as their country has provided a conducive environment for them, they can even use their 1BTC to buy a mere watch, but Nigerians must be smart.Frankly, If I were in this shoe, I would divide the money into 3 parts. The first part would go for agriculture, the second part would go for business, and the third part would go for land acquisition. There are many other combination alternatives but this is a viable one that should have passed the gist well across. There is no need to waste my money on frivolities, all I need is to enjoy the necessary things of life in a moderate form which I believe the proceeds from the investments of the money could easily provide for me over time.",

Get a business, trade , hodl, real estate and many others... Our economy is in a downward spiral, and there are additional opportunities to start earning money online. Are you serious about owning 1 bitcoin? In the current situation of the Nigerian economy, one Bitcoin will undoubtedly go quite a distance. Remember that our objective should be to channel these profits into multiple streams so that we can continue to reap immensely from the system. To get started, I will purchase hectares of fertile land in an ideal location, in a developing or already established vicinity, add one or two suitable automobiles, a comfortable 4-5 bedroom flat, and then channel the remainder of the funds to businesses. I would contemplate starting a phone enterprise, which I feel will make significant earnings, but all businesses encounter difficulties, which is understandable. I would then save up, invest in transportation, and try to be successful.",

Personally, I'm a real estate enthusiast and in as much as I can get a whole lot of profit from Bitcoin I wouldn't want to let go of that dream just to sit at home waiting for speculations about Bitcoin price rising and falling. And about the wrong Bitcoin price in Naira, my bad. There are too much wrong information on the internet and I fell into the hands of a few while writing this thread. So sorry for the wrong information but the current price is not 27M oo.... Thank you .",

Exactly, you are apparently right, the naira currency is dying, as the naira is dying. It has no value anymore, and it is not a wise thing to do if anyone wants to get an asset that has to do with naira value.Now that naira has no value, it will be a good thing for someone to buy enough Bitcoin and hold on for dear life. The current price of Bitcoin today is very much better than the naira rate, so if one can store some good amount of Bitcoin in Nigeria it will be of good help to the person than saving his/her funds in naira.",

Dem dun use diversification brainwash una for the forum that when una here diversification una go immediately think say una dey do the right thing, that's why many people go investing in altcoins with the mindset of diversifying and they think they're doing the right thing. Investment in this country are all sinking so be careful what you're investing in make you no go sell gold go buy iron. You said if you have one Bitcoin, why will you sell want has the potential to increase more in dollars for another thing wey even though e increase for Naira, the devaluation of naira dun make you lose all the profits you supposed make.

If you convert your Bitcoin to Naira (do investment in Naira) make we say you covert at $35,000 and dollars dey $1=1000 naira (note this is a rough explanation so all figures no dey accurate). It mean say your invested #35 million naira. In 2025 Bitcoin reach $100k per Bitcoin e mean say by just holding you would have made 100million Naira that's if dollars no increase oh then imagine a situation wey dollar reach 2k naira per dollars that's 200 million. That Naira investment wey you get no fit give you 100 or 200 million in just 2 years. Unless you dey extra lucky and buy land for where e explode due to development. People wey Invest for shares 10 years ago are regretting because the devaluation of naira dey make dem no get profits. I no dey against diversifying but no go dey sell your Bitcoin for that kind thing, Bitcoin itself is an investment with more higher potential, you fit use your Naira dey diversify not selling Bitcoin.",

As a matter of fact mate, 1 Bitcoin is a bit money here in our country which we all know about.Â  Talking from the striving perspective of becoming relevant to the society and earning a living by making profit, I wouldÂ  go into business although it is big enough to buy land and build a portable house for living but business is very much important because that would sustain you as an individual MD build more houses if you wish to but investment is paramount and of great importance.Looking at the way our currency is getting devalued, one would have no option than to invest in Bitcoin because that alone could salvage our investment of it be the contrary.
