I am an artist and content ceator, making my manually created works into digital art NFTs and more, with historical message and cultural value, but also with an educative effort. I can help you if you want. May youcan use my already created works or I am able to do content for you for any historical or other themes. I studied cultural studies, history, semiotics and last three years of my university studies specialized on marketing semiotics strategies in history and culture.

The NFTs are always associated with your wallet/smart contract address, timestamped and validated on the blockchain (public ledger). I'd love to chat and learn about your NFT journey thus far",
