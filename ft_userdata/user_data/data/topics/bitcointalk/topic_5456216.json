  "content": "I need to surgically implant this RPC for a fork of the dogecoin full node (don't ask) to make my library work with all required cryptocurrencies, so I'm trying to look for the commit where the command was added.Note: I already know where it's located in the current version of the codebase, but now it is using C++17 and so there will be a lot of hair-splitting agony trying to port it to C++11 doge What I do know is that it's not in Bitcoin Core <= 0.15, so it must be in a more recent version. Any help locating it using \"git blame\" or something will be appreciated.",
