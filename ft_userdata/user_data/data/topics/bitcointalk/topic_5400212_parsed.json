You know who you are...  *cough* rartychck lol...   Idk about any of that buddy but it you’re talking about MrCryptoHodl from the 1HODLclub pieces he’s about as solid as they come in my opinion. BCmint.com is a website and I think the owner of the page may be a member on here but if I’m not mistaken hasn’t been active in some time. I’m not sure the issues you’ve had with raritycheck either but so far I’ve had none and he seems to be open and address any concerns anybody has. Also the BCmint pieces aren’t loaded/funded they are diy wallets. Hope all that gets worked out for you bro bc getting screwed over sucks. And I know it’s not aimed at me I completely agree on the topic of scamming and being careful who you buy from. It comes down to risk vs reward i guess and I try and make the best decision I can with the info I have at the time. I’ve only been burned twice BCmint included so hopefully that’s a wrap.",

I believe up until the 1st qtr of this year everyone got what they had ordered/paid for - something happened near the end of Q1Not to argue, but as for having the same issues - coldkey did have similar issues between last year to this year - I know I waited almost 10-11 months to get a card correctly funded. The difference is that yogg had a strong presence here and had for quite some time. So he had earned that trust and I believe nearly everyone waited patiently for him to come back and fix the issues.",

I don't think any has ever had a problem with MrCryptHodl. I have bought 1 or a few of everything he has ever made and he is always great. One of the best creators making coins right now in my opinion with the special bonus that he can load them without any problems where he is, and that he is always reliable. What problem have you had? I am sure this can get worked out. Steeley",

      "body": "Maybe he's emphasizing that producers of a certain size should come out openly/publicly.Albeit I made the first review of BCmint last August when I received my order (where everything went well) I wrote:\"...but only time will tell how secure your privKey-management is => I, for my part, was not intended to load them anyway...\". https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5356044.0Just4Fun: let's calculate the scam assuming all keys are compromised (straight forward planned scam):Let's say (by far) not all of the 321 & 500pcs. of both series have been sold (assuming 200ea. sold) and just a fraction of buyers would even load the coin (let's say 10% of these coins really got loaded... max. 40 loaded coins left) and no one in his/her mind would put more than 0.001BTC on that thing (remember: it's a $24,- coin)... but for worst case calculation, let's assume all of that 40 coins got loaded with 0.01BTC => 0.4BTC max. damage but I'd estimate it to be more likely between 1-10% of that.Maybe I'm just lazy (fact is I'm not a scammer but I got scammed enough in the early days... what didn't make me immune to scams -obviously- but at least more cautious) but for some hundret or even thousand bucks I wouldn't set up such an operation. And also maybe that's what people at BCmint thought by themselves after a while and got tired of it and just left that whole thing with a pay-to BTC-address... So, question to the community: Has anyone of you ever loaded a BCmint coin and are funds still on the address? And has anyone of you ever redeemed a BCmint coin and 1.) is there really a privKey and 2.) does it fit to the pubKey printed on the coin?",

This can look like possible shill bidding, so I suggest you tighten your rules / rethink your policies...  I certainly will not bid against 1 post newbies, that's for sure...  But have you researched and looked at my latest sales? I can tell you no, because the people you call newbis are all new collectors who participated in my old sales.did you do any further research to find that I was advertising my collectibles and Bitcointalk on Twitter? Well no, otherwise with some research and comparisons you would have seen that they all come from twitter.I don't know what you heard, I don't know who you are, but if you want respect from people, you should start by respecting them. You can be whoever you want, it can be written legendary under your nickname, I don't care.If you have something to say about me, come tell me directly or create a thread, don't hide it in a thread that has nothing to do with it.have a beautiful day !",

      "body": "I already mentioned my issues with the mrcrypthodl items directly with mrcrypthodl - out of 21 coins and 2 ingots - I had 3 double funded coins and 1 coin where the address did not match the publicly provided address. The double funded coins were funded last year and again this year. The coin with a different address was an \"extra\" that was done by the mint in case one of the coins did not pass quality checks by mrcrypthodl - the list of addresses just was not correctly updated to reflect this. I did have some shipping issues where it too a few months to get shipped and where one shipment was short some coins and two shipments went to a different address than I provided - luckily the address was to someone else on here who lives close to me so I got the packages. Last week - I peeled and redeemed all 23 coins/ingots - all private keys held funds, with 3 of them double funded. He did give me an extra coin and an extra ingot to make up for the issues. Also - in running the addresses on the publicly provided lists, it is noticeable that some others are not funded as I know a few other members here who have coins that were never funded as well.Would I call him a scammer? No. Just rushing too much and trying to do too many releases without any help and without catching all the errors. I have been telling him to slow down for at least 9 months.

I have hopes that hodlclub will be a great coin for decades to come. If he is listening. Destroy the private keys if you still have them. Your success depends on your coins never being compromised. But until that time my coins stay loaded.No i think he speak about Cold Storage Coins (who is a coin maker too if i don't mistake) and BCMint.com I see in the thread about Titan Issues that they keep the private key in a bank vault .... wtf XDMy process is clear, I shared it from the presentation of my first collection loaded with BTC( the 1HoDLCLUB Casino) when Cygan asked me, nothing has changed since!  You can find it there -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5356705.msg57793863#msg57793863",

No. Just rushing too much and trying to do too many releases without any help and without catching all the errors. I have been telling him to slow down for at least 9 months. And, as far as I know, he has remediated all issues.Yes indeed I'm a little too fast, it leads to mistakes, that's why I'm going to calm down  about the help, it's that I don't want to include people in whatever the step because the trust is given to MrCryptHodl and not another person, I prefer to have all the responsibility on me and to have to work 4x more than to have to worry about the loyalty of another person!  You still may want the buyer to confirm they have received before funding.  If unresponsive, you could also check tracking to see if it got to them before funding.",

I mean even Max Mellenbruch (Kialara, IMHO the very top tier of DIY coins) sells his stuff unfunded and it's upon a buyer whether to load it or not. I personally trust you (hopefully rightly ;-) but doing this would stop the discussion as a whole. <- Just an idea, feel free to disregard itSo yes the next step was DIY and/or \"buyer funded\" such as Kialara or AlpenCoin! But the replacement is not planned!   If one day I stop making loaded coins, it's because no one wants them anymore, but not because someone isn't happy, someone who has never bought one of my collectibles.  Btw thank you for your trust and support ! always really appreciate !",

Happy to help provide some guidance. Goes for anyone. Quote from: Cryptogreatdane on May 27, 2022, 03:25:34 PMare you referring to hodlclub as well as bcmint? I purchased many coins from hodlclub with no issues. I understand that it requires trust to be given to any coinmaker. But until there is an issue he should be given the benefit of the doubt. I have hopes that hodlclub will be a great coin for decades to come. If he is listening. Destroy the private keys if you still have them. Your success depends on your coins never being compromised. But until that time my coins stay loaded.See link posted in my comment.",
