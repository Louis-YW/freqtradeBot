  "content": "I recently heard about \"Gresham's Law\" in a conversation about Bitcoin.Basically Gresham's Law says that: \"Bad currency tends to drive good currency out of the market.\"Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_lawThe law states that any circulating currency consisting of both \"good\" and \"bad\" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the \"bad\" money. This is because people spending money will hand over the \"bad\" coins rather than the \"good\" ones, keeping the \"good\" ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the intrinsically less valuable money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save the intrinsically more valuable money.This situation sometimes occurred when the money in circulation was made of valuable metals (gold, silver and bronze). People preferred to spend coins with a lower metal value, to save those with a higher metal value. With inflation, coins with a higher metal value began to have a nominal value lower than the value of the metal they were made with, causing people to start melting these coins to obtain the metal. Thus, bad coins ended up dominating the market, and good coins disappeared.Could something like this happen to Bitcoin?In other words, are people starting to want to save their BTC coins so much that their value is lost?",

Why? As stated in \"Gresham's Law,\" bad currency tends to drive good currency out of the market. When we refer to the market, it could mean investment, which means Bitcoin gets pushed out so people can use it primarily as a store of value, while fiat is used for daily transactions.However, this doesn’t mean Bitcoin will become obsolete or lose its value. Just like gold, it’s not used for daily transactions, but its value appreciates over time.",

This may even make it scarcer and the value would remain same or increase based on the market perception. Quote from: joker_josue on October 27, 2024, 10:24:03 AMIt's a simple reasoning.

It's worth melting down that coin and selling the silver, rather than using the coin to buy something for 1$.But, it explains the theory of Gresham's Law better. That's why Fiat intrinsic value is lower than its nominal value to prevent such actions. When people start melting silver it is removed from the market and what remains is a currency That's perceived to be inferior. Inflation increases the likelihood of Good money leaving the market and held while the reverse is the case of bad money.",

Bitcoin is magic in a way that if you have private key, you can spend bitcoins belong to that private key. Bad or good coins, you all can spend it anytime by signing your transaction with private key and waiting for confirmations from Bitcoin miners.In Bitcoin, there is only tainted coin and non-tainted coin but it's vague overlap between them in practice too. Bitcoin is fungible with a smallest unit is satoshi and it's really hard to know that your bitcoin is completely non-tainted, clean and not related to any past mixing activities. In addition, as a Bitcoin user I really don't care about that too.QuoteIn other words, are people starting to want to save their BTC coins so much that their value is lost?It can help price to increase, not to decrease.

If there are two kinds of money, bad money is the unlimited supply of Fiat, and good money is Bitcoin with its limited supply.In terms of this, I hope that more people will save their Bitcoin and want it so that it won’t lose value. There are a lot of factors simply because I think of legality with the government as well, so maybe there would be a different thing for it, like a tax. I think there are still a lot more things to consider.",

An investment (or a means of storing value).2. A means of value transfer (i.e. transacting).3. A means of commonly known value measurement.The USD is always all three of these things, and will always be #3 forever.Bitcoin is mostly #1 today, and rarely #2, and will never be #3.Fast and scalable digital currencies like Haypenny currencies can be #1 and #2, and will never be #3.(Only currently well known currencies like USD, EU, GBP etc. will ever be #3).",

If a silver coin is worth $1, it is worth $1, and what happened in ancient times is that to devalue the currency, starting with the Romans, instead of making silver coins they began to put alloys of copper and other metals in the silver in coins with supposedly a nominal value of $1, but people soon realized that it was not pure silver and when carrying alloys of other impure metals they asked for more coins to pay the same as if they were coins of only silver.
