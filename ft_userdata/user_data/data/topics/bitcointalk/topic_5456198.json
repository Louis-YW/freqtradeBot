  "content": "A Bitcoin whale account unexpectedly comes back to life after 10 years as it transfers an equivalent of $37.8 million to another wallet. Data on Lookonchain on June 8th reveals that a Bitcoin account that had been dormant for over 10 years has transferred a total of 1,432.93 BTC, equivalent to $37.8 million, to a new address named 'bc1psv'.The last activity of this account was on April 9, 2013, during the period known as the 'Satoshi era,' when it received 1,432.92 BTC at a price of $195 per Bitcoin. This means the investor had invested $280,000 and could potentially make a profit of nearly $37 million if they decide to sell all the coins in the wallet at this time.Currently, the intentions of the owner cannot be determined. Data from Cointelegraph shows that every previous awakening of a 'whale' has resulted in significant fluctuations in the Bitcoin market. The event has garnered attention from the cryptocurrency community due to the potential impact of the origin of these coins on early-stage participants.",

A Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of Bitcoin, often with the potential to influence the cryptocurrency market due to the large size of their holdings.The reemergence of this particular Bitcoin whale has caught the attention of the crypto community and market observers. After ten years of dormancy, the whale has seemingly reawakened and potentially has the power to impact the Bitcoin market dynamics.",

BTC is not stored in a wallet, it is stored on the BTC network and the funds can only be moved with its keys, so you can hold your keys in one wallet software or in a hardware wallet for as long as possible and it will remain safe if you have good operational security of keeping your keys and your seed phrase safe. And surely the best way to do that is to store the funds in cold storage, either in a hardware wallet or in an air-gapped device. If your security hasn't been compromised, i don't see the reason to move your funds annually, it does not increase how secure your funds are.",

In fact it did not happen on the market and that movement is not for dumping on market.Logically it is not reasonable to dump your bitcoins in 2023 that is a bear market if you are not in an emergency and need cash when your pocket is empty. It was better to cash out in 2021, 2022 or wait till 2024 or 2025 with a new bull run.",
