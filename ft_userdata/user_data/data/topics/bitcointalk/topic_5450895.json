  "content": "Hello Everyone,Lets say I've a wallet named: Wallet_1and its has a SEED phrase:ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVEand when I clicked on Receive Tab, Electrum created an address for me:bc1jsdklfjsufojfkjlksjfousdfjlkjsdofuldja1I received some bitcoins on this address.Now on the second day I again clicked on Receive Tab and Electrum created another [New] bitcoin address for me:bc1ueioutoiueo3tuo9hmcnanvoiroujjljslfjjk2which I gave it to someone to send me bitcoins.Is it possible for any Bitcoin exchange or Any Crypt Expert [who has expertise in cryto algorithms] to come to know that these 2 addresses are:Created from Same walletor Created from Same SEED phrase [even though that Exchange or that crypto expert don't come to what the seed phrase is but can they guess it?]orCreated by same personIs there any such thing reverse engineering or any other similar term or technology in crypto to come to know that both Bitcoin addressed are created by same wallet?Thank you (in advance) for answering ðŸ˜€",

      "body": "If you are using Electrum out of the box and connecting to third party servers, then yes, these servers will be able to link these addresses together.As Electurm is a light wallet, it connects to third party servers and nodes to download the transaction data and address history relevant to your addresses. It will query all the addresses in your wallet at once, so whichever servers or nodes it queries this with will know that all those addresses are linked. If you want to avoid this, then you need to run your own node and your own Electrum server.If you do run your own node node and server, then as OmegaStarScream says, the only way to link addresses as belonging to the same user/seed/wallet would be if you use them together in the same transaction (or you accidentally leak this information).",

(not all of them does but consider your privacy compromised by using public servers)",
