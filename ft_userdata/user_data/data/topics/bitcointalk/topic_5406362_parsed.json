There is also a custodial wallet, which are not also advisable just like exchanges because if talking about privacy and full control, if exchanges are the fire, then custodial wallets are the hot frying pan.",

      "body": "\"Your coins on CEX may be at risk this bear season\"Actually, they are not 'your' coins if they are in a centralized exchange. The exchange holds the keys and the coins as well, you only trust them to let you spend it when you need it and that privilege can be revoked in a bull or bear market. There is also the risk of privacy loss, with your personal details falling into the hands of hackers or being handed over to government agencies.Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 15, 2022, 07:31:16 AMQuote from: Majestic-milf on July 15, 2022, 07:04:20 AMYour privacy matters a lot always use a segregated wallet and save yourself the stress.What did you mean as segregated wallet?I read it as segregated witness wallet.

Freeze the asset, stop the withdrawal.But to be fair, the CEX exchanges are a bit more resistant than those loan companies. Because those loan companies boom thanks to the bull market last year. They can pay back the high rate they promise but once the bull market is gone, you know what is coming. Even in the Mt.Gox case, people can still get their money back abit after a very long time of waiting so if you keep your asset at Binance and not fall for lending bullshit, you're not at risk of losing all of your assets.",

It doesn't matter if it is on some two bit exchange no one has heard of or on Binance or Coinbase, on some lending platform like Celsius or BlockFi, or in a web wallet. If it's not in your wallet, not only is it a risk, it is not even yours. Every one of these platforms, as we are now discovering with Coinbase's recent SEC filings and with Celsius and Voyager going bankrupt, treat coins deposited from users as belonging to the platform. You give up all rights and claims of ownership over those coins as soon as you deposit them, and they can and will be used by the platform to pay off their debts and liabilities.Quote from: Poker Player on July 15, 2022, 07:12:59 AMGood initiative but the problem I see is that the average user of this forum knows what you are sayingI have been warning people about platforms like Celsius for years, and every time I do, there are always multiple users in the thread saying variations of \"Well, I use them and have had no problems\" or \"They are big and reputable therefore they are safe\".

Take Celsius as a prime example of this. They ran with the slogan \"Unbank yourself\", they claimed all over their website and social media that your coins were safe, that they were collateralized, that they were stored securely, etc. And then the bankruptcy proceedings go ahead and it turns out they were handing out uncollateralized loans, and spending the little collateral they did have to take out more loans themselves. Incredibly risky and completely unprofessional. Or Coinbase as another example. Say on Twitter how all their users' coins are secure and safe if anything should happen, but then file legal documents saying that users are unsecured creditors and their coins will be used to pay off any bankruptcy proceedings, leaving the users with nothing. These companies say anything they like on social media to attract customers. Almost none of it is accurate. Your coins are at risk.Quote from: cabron on July 16, 2022, 06:57:13 AMI could have withdraw the $500  from one account  if only withdraw fee for stablecoin will be cheaper.Then that's an argument to find an exchange which doesn't charge outright theft levels of withdrawal fees to force you to only rarely withdraw.

Weak exchanges can be on the same direction, Time can tell when would they close. Actually there are exchanges now that are filling up for bankruptcy, one of them is Voyager Digital.
