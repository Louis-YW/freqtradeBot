I am not btc rich. I buy btc to buy collectibles. I spent somewhere around $800 (also believe this auction was a steal - and seller originally paid much more) for that set which is now practically worthless. Putting a BTC figure on this based solely on what is swept is less than 1/3 of what was actually lost - conservative estimate as this same release sold for near $1200 to Yoda. Literally impossible to be made whole and I’d prefer Yogg’s damage is not diminished by being valued by what he stole. What he really did is so much worse - especially to you Cygan and to the forum members that have supported him for years. Such quality work - all destroyed Edit: I actually thought this was a post of gathering information - not of Cygan fixing part of it. Kind of unreal to get anything back and gives me a newfound respect for Cygan",

Such quality work - all destroyed This is true, and I'm very sorry to everyone as well. Yogg was what I thought was a good friend. he stole from me as well. I feel guilt for even helping him resurrect this project now even, but how could I have known?  Anyhow, to get anything back at all in cases like this is the best you can possibly hope for/get... Most times, scam victims never get a dime back, this is better than nothing, but I feel your pain. I lost about 20k overnight all told... Poof... Sorry again all, and thanks to the guys wanting to help make things right, you are truly the best - Kialara, Frank @ Alpen, Claycast, and others I may have missed, thank you and I am sorry this space feels like it will never be the same again.  So many burns on so many levels. Not how I planned on starting a new year at all. Edit - Cygan, Thank you, but I won't be asking for a  refund for my silvers, you took a huge hit too here, and I'm not going to make it worse for you brother. Thanks to you sir, you have a heart of gold.",
