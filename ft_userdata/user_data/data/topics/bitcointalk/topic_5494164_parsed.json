  "content": "We all know BlackRock is one the major beneficial from the launch of bitcoin ETF on January 11. They have being attracting investment worth millions of dollars daily consistently, which under 71 days, they have gotten $15.5B in total . But there was a surprise yesterday that this big firm was unable to have any inflow, and it was recorded that BlackRock for the first time made $0 inflow on April 24.Another ETF participant Fidelity's FBTC, two weeks ago also  experienced $0 inflows for three days. However Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF have made more outflows than other ETFs inflows put together. The record says that GBTC has made a total of more than $17B outflow, while the other bitcoin ETF have made a total of $12.3B inflow. Does this show that GBTC is taking over the ETF market from the others. Or most people put their trust more on GBTC than the rest. Or maybe investors are now keeping their coins in their private wallet after they have bought from an exchange, waiting for the bull run. What are your thoughts on this. https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-no-inflow-first-time-since-launch",

      "body": "Well, I actually think it can be a good thing. Maybe not for investment companies like BlackRock, but for other people. ETFs were growing so fast that people feared that the market might get too centralized, with barely any coins left in self-custody. Some days of no inflow and a general decrease of interest shows that the ETF market it stabilizing, reaching its proper size, and that it won't be a threat to decentralization. Investment companies are making profit anyway. People who want to invest can still do it. And the price isn't impacted negatively by such developments.",

      "body": "Zero inflow is not a new occurrence in ETF market. When the market is uncertain and people are not sure whether to invest or not, ETFs can have zero inflow. It should not be seen as a problem. ETFs are very competitive! Especially when you have multiple companies having a single asset ETF. When the market goes up, you will see more outflows than inflows on profit booking. Also it's hilarious to have an ETF for an asset which is very easy to buy from open market and without any middle man.",

And that only happens with Blackrock, not all ETFs.I believe that traditional investors pay a lot of attention to macro news and as we see there is too much geopolitical instability in the world as well as inflation in the US which is showing signs of increasing again. Therefore, it is not too difficult to understand when people delay and hesitate to invest to avoid losses. Additionally , if this condition persists for several days, it is time to worry. Now is not the time and we need to wait a few more days to have a more accurate assessment.",
