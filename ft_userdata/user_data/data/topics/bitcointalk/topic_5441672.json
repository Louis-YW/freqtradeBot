  "content": "QuoteFebruary 27, BLiTZ: News On the island of Bali in Indonesia, Russian investment blogger Yuri Boytsov was beaten and robbed. According to the tg-channel Baza, unknown persons forced him to transfer bitcoins in the amount of $284,000 to their accounts. According to him, the attackers are an Indonesian in the form of a policeman, a man in a Balaklava, as well as two “two men of Caucasian appearance.”According to the blogger, the attackers broke into his villa and began to demand money for the fact that he “dumped” someone. Fighters did not want to give away their funds. And then the unknown hit him on the head several times. So they managed to force the Russian to unlock the smartphone and transfer the passwords. Some transfers had to be verified.His girlfriend, who was with Boytsov, said that the service did not miss a transfer for such a large amount. To fulfill their plan, the kidnappers photographed a Russian citizen with a passport and sent the photo to the support service. After that, the hijackers left the villa, and the victims went to the local law enforcement officers to write a statement. The police managed to detain one of the alleged perpetrators – their faces were visible on video from surveillance cameras – but he denies his guilt. According to the detainee, the Russian is a swindler himself.[1] https://www.weeklyblitz.net/news/in-bali-284000-worth-of-bitcoins-were-stolen-from-a-russian-bloggerin-bali-284000-worth-of-bitcoins-were-stolen-from-a-russian-blogger-news/i'm sorry for the victim, who seems to be still unable to get his bitcoins, news of robberies like this have caused a stir several times because the thief did not want cash or other valuables from the victim but only targeted the victim's bitcoin.  there is no detailed explanation of how the thief could find out that the tourist has bitcoins, however, bitcoin ownership cannot tell it to other people because it is very sensitive and can provoke crime. if you have already told other people the number of your bitcoins, you should make other reasons when people ask you about it again, crime can come from anyone and anywhere, so being suspicious is quite important.",

Just another proof how dangerous is to let everyone know that you are into crypto and I am susprised that we are not seeing more $5 dollar wrench attack cases like this.Then again, he might got what he deserves as he seems like a scammer that got robbed. Karma is a bitch.Quote from: https://tor-corporation.com/en/urii-boicov-razvod-na-dengi-razoblachenie-moshennika/Our current hero creates channels and groups where he sells signals for making money on betting, mining, cryptocurrency, offers to buy his courses as ready-made solutions for good earnings, but by contacting Boitsov, people only lose money and nothing more.Positioning himself as a good financial expert, the young man actively promotes various projects, charges quite expensive for his services and signals, promising a 100% result, but his clients do not get what they want and suffer significant financial losses.Yury Boytsov cleverly organizes the draining of clients, although through his social networks he beautifully advertises the proposed work schemes, calling them a 100% path to success, but in reality this does not happen.The scammer, in order to justify his unsuccessful projects, voices non-identical stories of success and development in various interviews, and he is also actively blacklisted and deservedly so. If Yury Boytsov is exposed in relation to the personality, then one can understand that this young swindler sells a dummy as valuable information, earns almost out of the blue, and because of him people go into the red and remain with serious debts.",

If that is not possible, in the case of an investment blogger, then never carry huge amounts around. You can have a decoy wallet which reveals a believable amount of bitcoin and then one with additional security or an added passphrase which holds majority of your funds.If that was the case here, the attackers would have discovered about $20,000 or $10,000 in his wallet and felt that sufficient to get away with, while over 95% of the Bitcoins are still secure.- Jay -",

      "body": "Yes, and this kind of attacks has been increasing, as others said, this is what we call $5 wrench attackQuoteA $5 wrench attack is when someone finds out you have a lot of crypto and physically attacks or threatens you for your private keys. On Wednesday, at least eight men, including a police officer, were arrested in the city of Pimpri-Chinchwad, India, for allegedly kidnapping a crypto trader and demanding ransom. The arrested officer, Constable Dilip Tukaram Khandare, reportedly learned of the trader's 300 crore rupee ($40.13 million) crypto wealth via access to confidential data while working in the cybercrime department. The trader was let go after his friend filed a missing person report that prompted Khandare, who feared repercussions, to release him. https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-wrench-attacks-appear-to-be-on-the-rise-in-the-crypto-communitySo the best weapon against this kind of attack and just simply don't tell anyone that you have bitcoin or crypto. Because you don't know who you dealing with her, maybe they are just listening and when the time comes they will simply attack you at the comfort of your home and forcefully cough your private keys or extract any crypto information from you.",
