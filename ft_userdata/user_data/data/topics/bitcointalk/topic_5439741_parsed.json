All that's lacking is nothing but good leaders in position of public offices. I hope someday Nigerians can get it right by jettisoning every religious, ethnic and political affiliation and vote in the needed and capable man for the job needed to be done to make Nigeria and Nigerians great again.",

Nigeria is really not as democratic as the preach, but we should always keep in mind that one vote is our power, and casting the right vote can change this country for the better. No body too good but we should try voting for our choice and see there performance, if we don't try we might never know if it's work's.",

Power is given to the same caucus people which all have the same agenda in mind,which is to steal the country's funds to themselves and their families, leaving the people to ravish in hunger and poverty. I just hope opportunities should be given to good people just the way Zambia voted a good man that is only after the welfare and growth of his citizens. Our votes can count,if majority votes for one same candidate, I guess it will be hard to manipulate but if the votes are shared amongst the parties,then it becomes easy to manipulate. Imagine how much a senator is paid monthly in Nigeria,it is enough to take care of 10 families in Nigeria.",

The country has been battered for decades, and it can't be fixed easily, yet a good leader now is desperately needed that will set things back to what they should be before other good leaders will start building on it.I hope this will happen one day, but I am certain that it will never happen with the PDP and APC candidates. If the two enters, then we continue from where we stopped.",

If a country like Zambia can achieve this in two years of choosing the right leader into office, then I believe Nigeria can also do that even though it will take a tenure (4 years) to achieve that. We are blessed as a nation, we have the resources just like other great nations have. What we lack is a good leader, and I hope we get it right this time around as OP said.",
