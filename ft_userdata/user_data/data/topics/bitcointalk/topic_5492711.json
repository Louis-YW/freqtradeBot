So all the talk about a supply crunch and exceeding demand after the halving show it had all just been speculation because right here and right now we get a huge price drop that reminds us that the halving was priced in. Thanks for the FOMO to anyone that played",

Anyway let's come to the point. It is true that bitcoin surprised most of us crossing its current all time high price before the halving starting because history says that Bitcoin make new all time high price after around 1 year of halving. We have two thoughts about this record breaking one is bitcoin may will do a explosive bull-run and the second thought is may it will not goings to so high make the history wrong :\"). But the positive fact are highers than the negatives specially the etf approval and halving. But I am not expecting much in sooner we already seeing a huge dump on market maybe it is for the correction so I think we will gonna see the real explosion on after the halving likely about 1year",

      "body": "Bitcoin was able to break an all-time high before halving, but it's not much of a difference to the previous ATH. The ATH for Bitcoin this year is $73k+, while the previous ATH was around $70k, so it's still within the range of $70k+, meaning that Bitcoin has not yet experienced a very huge pump before the bear market will start. Despite the current ATH, I am expecting that Bitcoin will reach $80k–$100k+, which is where I can sell my coins. I am not certain about the price before or after the halving, but just like some people predicted some months ago, Bitcoin will get to $70k before the halving, which has already been achieved, so there's definitely going to be corrections.",

This excites everyone most particularly for those who have been hodling their coins for couple of years, which means they’ll be able to reap massive profits soon. And while we are preparing for the halving, we are also anticipating the next bull run that won’t happen long after bitcoin halving. Yes, bitcoin bull run will probably make a new history, and it won’t be possible to end sooner.",

This dump today was just part of the correction that was warned off since the new ATH was attained. The dip is only severe today due to the WWIII chants. As of the second option I don’t think the bull market will surpass the duration of the last periods but in terms or daily or weekly raise it will be faster. So what I see is a 4x happening",

In short, bitcoin investors all have optimistic thoughts and expectations like you because no one wants bitcoin to fall in price because if it falls or the bull season ends early, we will lose money. But if we stay calm and evaluate fairly, anything can happen, history may or may not repeat. As an investor in the market, I think things are never easy and there will always be changes from the house that make the match more unpredictable. The financial game is a fierce one, it is not a place where everyone can make a profit. Halving or not, bitcoin is essentially a financial market, halving does not change this fact. Therefore, we need to be alert and analytical, do not rely on intuition to invest.",

Pretty impressive too that it did recover so fast.Now in regards to our talk about the nearing of the halving, time flies so fast for these and I'm not ready for the fact that the market's almost there, it's best that we have to remember that this halving is a bit different, it might take a while before things happen because it's a different kind of halving compared to last time because this one, we've got a new all-time high before the halving has started and I think that it's a signal that something's going to change for the bitcoin market, we need to expect the unexpected.",

But this halving is different in a sense that we already have an ATH even before approaching the date of halving. There is no denial that current bull run wasn't possible with out ETF's. Another aspect is that the Bitcoin community has grown over the years and is now more mature to understand the halving events.",
