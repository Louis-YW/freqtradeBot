Tokenization of the Real World Asset is indeed experiencing sluggish pace nowadays, but it is likely to regain momentum once the potential of this sector is recognized by the prominent investors. I agree with your perspective that next bull run is likely to be driven by institutional involvement in cryto currencies, specially once they obtain regulatory approvals from Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), that is likely to materialize in 2024. It is worth recalling  that bull run of 2021 was largely sparked by the involvement of MicroStretegy company in crypto currencies.",

Real world assets (RWA) are entering the DeFi and crypto space via tokenization and some people believe that this is going to be explosive as here we are really talking of real business with real revenues and most of them have already a good track record in the real world. Now, with AI, there is no stopping it from being a universal influence that can surely affect many people and industries...and this is only the beginning as more and more applications of AI will be added to the market in the coming years.",

Consequently,the regulatory authorities face complex task to interrogating them into a legal framework without compromising the interest of general public and promoting the consistent advancement of this emerging technology. Therefore, it is essential for us to exercise patience and grant reasonable timeframe to regulatory authorities to embrace this fast developing industry.",

The influence of the US economy, as well as many issues from the SEC, are affecting this market. I have had some arguments with friends about the fact that the SEC is not a judge and that bitcoin or crypto need to operate independently. Many of us are easily panicked/excited by what they say, that's ridiculous.I have quite humorous fantasies about how one day, a regulatory agency from China or Russia will speak up about accepting and supporting crypto development, and everyone will look at the SEC with which eyes?",

These narratives have a strong use case in the industry and real world, though there aren't too many projects in these categories except web3. Telegram bots and Chinese coins were trending for sometimes but these narratives were for short term and weren't that hyped out. Most of these narratives are somehow connected with DeFi so i think layer 2 solution is also a trending category that we should keep an eye on. There is something we should keep in mind that an unfavorable regulation from SEC for any of these narratives can heavily affect them. Even they can be ignored by investors and i am especially concerned about the RWA project because it can be targeted by the SEC due to its connection with real world assets.",

Curious to know what others thoughts on it is as well (full disclosure I have a shift large portion of my portfolio into it). For 1. Liquid Staking Derivatives have a look into Eigen Layer. Eigenlayer is pioneering a new primitive called superfluid staking, which reverses the order of liquid staking by modifying the core consensus protocol, thus enabling the staking of liquidity provisioning (LP) tokens through a middleware platform like Eigenlayer.",

It needs to be a system that requires no previous skills with blockchain tech in order to bring adoption.

They can be good for scalping and small transactions but on a larger scale this telegram exchange bot even can not compete with lower tire crypto exchanges. What i am seeing is only hype about the Telegram bot project due to telegrams upcoming announcement about their roadmap. Some telegram bots I saw providing MVE services that can be used in dex especially if you are a regular dex user. Sudden dumps in the pair can be tracked and used for instant buys in that range. Also there is a risk that these telegram exchange services can be used by scammers to promote fake exchange projects because there isn't much information available for most of those bot and they can easily be removed by the owner of that bot. Telegram based exchange bots are not very practical solutions that we can see.",

The important thing is the credibility and the reputation that they have. We see nowadays a lot of things can be developed through Telegram and I think that they're upgrading as well as part of their roadmap since they also have their own token. But if it's about this matter, I'll avoid them.You can name a lot of exchanges that has good reputations and I'm not yet willing to try new things like this. I've seen some about casinos that are on telegram but I wouldn't also going to try them because for some reasons, I just don't know how it works if it's a thing already.So, as long as there's an involvement of money using these bots on telegram, I'm off with them. But no doubt if it's just about communication and stuff, that's all about Telegram is done for.Who will trust an exchange that is based on telegram because it is not safe to give your cryptos custody to a telegram bot that can even handle a few millions of dollars worth of transactions? They can be good for scalping and small transactions but on a larger scale this telegram exchange bot even can not compete with lower tire crypto exchanges. What i am seeing is only hype about the Telegram bot project due to telegrams upcoming announcement about their roadmap. Some telegram bots I saw providing MVE services that can be used in dex especially if you are a regular dex user. Sudden dumps in the pair can be tracked and used for instant buys in that range. Maybe OP since he's the one who suggested and maybe he has used it already or he advocates the usage of it.Quote from: Sophokles on November 04, 2023, 07:13:21 AMAlso there is a risk that these telegram exchange services can be used by scammers to promote fake exchange projects because there isn't much information available for most of those bot and they can easily be removed by the owner of that bot. Telegram based exchange bots are not very practical solutions that we can see.Yeah, usually with these exchanges that are found they are not strict with listing. So if it's just a type like it's a dex, then everything is on there and everyone is more prone to the scam listings and tokens that will be there. And aside from the security measures that you're likely to connect the wallet you use like meta mask or so, the chances of you being scammed is high when you're not researching and you just keep with the flow just as what these people telling that there's a hype and trend on it where in fact that there's none.",
