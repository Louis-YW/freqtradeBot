  "content": "Hi everyone, today I'm here to propose a new experiment. We have already replicated a large part of the Italian section of Bitcoin Talk on telegram and I would like to share with you too. As you well know, telegram has recently introduced the possibility of dividing the chat with topics. So I created the first Bitcoin talk italia forum on telegram and this will have to be complementary with Bitcoin Talk in order to attract as many people as possible.But that's not all, @babo has also developed the bot for assigning merit with the same forum score and which will allow users to achieve the same levels.Do you think that's all? No. Soon a circuit of sponsors with banners inside the chat will give the possibility to remunerate the most deserving users in satoshis who will create interesting contents.In the meantime we stopped the domains @bitcointalkINT international section @bitcointalkUK English section @bitcointalkDE German section @bitcointalkFR French section if anyone wants to take part you can contact me here in the inbox or on Telegram @mendace. Update 0.0.5We have recently introduced the first tests on the publication of sponsors within the topics. Here is an explanatory image.But that's not all in the meantime we have opened international community groups, English, German, French, Spanish, Indonesian.  At the moment these are empty and looking for administrators who want to commit themselves to carrying on the project with us.  The proposal is open to all but we will verify that you are a user of the forum and also your level.As already mentioned and in the replies to the threads, the project tries to integrate with the forum by posting in a bidirectional way.  For the more skeptical in the Italian section we have already managed to get some of the desired result by bringing old members back to the forum.At the next updateII already told you that the merit system is already present in the group and in fact it has now been well developed by @babo and already operational.The first test sponsors started a few days ago, this will be the counterpart of the forum signature which, since it cannot be personal, we will have one or more than one but collective and which will provide rewards in satoshi in % of merits, activity and level. Didn't you tell us that someone could pretend to be a forum user then the good @babo added the \"verify by talk\" function or through an alphanumeric code that you must temporarily affix to the location label of your profile the bot will be able to authenticate yourself and verify that the btctalk UID corresponds to the Telegram UID.I hope these additional changes are appreciated.In roadmap (what a shitcoinaro term) it is foreseen to open a topic where all the new threads of the Italian board that will be posted will be reported, this should allow a further connection with the forum.At the next update",

Telegram has millions of users and if forum users are interested they can also join in as well.Attempting to replicate the merit and signature system would depend on how much interest it generates. It could be some other way for users interested in Bitcoin, but not so much in the forum layout, to get to experience it on some other platform.",

The user turnover is in the region of 50ish monthly active users. I am actually inside a few Italian telegram channel with member count from 3K to 10K. For sure I cannot see the risk of some users that voluntarily logs into Bitcointalk.org with his 20 years old format, being lured into the Telegram discussion because of this channel. I know the telegram handles of many Italian board members, and we are all in the same TG groups, meaning they already know the Telegram media, and for various reasons, they like the forum the most. While I cannot see a risk of users going from the forum to Telegram (50sh)users, I can see, linking forum articles in Telegram, the possibility to lure some of them in the forum.If only 0.5% of the 10K user group ventures into the forum on a monthly basis, this means another 50 users, or a 100% upside on the forum members.
