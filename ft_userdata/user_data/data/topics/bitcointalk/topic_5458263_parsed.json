      "body": "I believe for most online casinos which are not strict with their kyc requirements, some underage may have been playing.But they know the risks as most casinos stated on their ToS about such age restriction, and they will be screwed once the site starts asking their credentials.But definitely, I think some underage kids are playing in online casinos. Especially now that access to them is quite easy.Maybe, someone can take legal action on the site, however, I think, you will just waste a lot of your resources to push thru such case, in which, the better thing to do is just talk to the kid about repercussions when he decide to go into gambling spree.Quite hard to go after the casino as you need a very motivating case to go thru all the troubles of filing a lawsuit to them.",

So that should cover for the age limits,  note that most casinos have their date of birth information inevitable and this is to prevent underage gambling",

      "body": "You should know that in some countries, the age to gamble on land based casinos can be different from the age to gamble on online casinos. Some countries may not have well established legal age for online gambling, but the gambling site will set the age of the offline gambling site like 21 years which is common in US. On the terms of service of each gambling sites, you will see the legal age that is there, I have noticed 18 years to be the most common. If regulators wants to fight underage gambling, they should first look towards that. But most countries legal age to gamble is 18 years. 18 years is the legal age in most countries in Europe, Africa and Asia that allow gambling.If a gambling site is in US, like Stake.us, the legal age in their terms of service is 21 years which is what that is most common in states in United States. But gambling sites that are international that we are using, put the legal gambling age to be 18 years because most countries legal gambling age across the world is 18 years.",

Online casinos without KYC are the one who are more prone for underage gamblers, this might be the downside of having no KYC at all, but then again if you get caught expect that the site will do necessary action against your account. In my country 18 years old is the legal age to gamble, to young for that.",

But as we know, such murky enterprises skillfully hide. By the way, how does opening loot boxes in CS:GO differ from gambling? I don't see any fundamental differences. And here any minor can participate in this game of chance.",

This is usually stated on the front page and during the registration process, when you have to confirm that you agree to the terms of use of the service. As for the specific regulations for individual countries, most casinos have a clause in the terms that each player has the responsibility to familiarize himself with the local laws and that he is obliged to act accordingly. This means that the responsibility falls on the individual, and you cannot sue them for breaking the law unless they did it knowingly.",

Well, I would also say that those casinos that ask for KYC when your withdrawal amount is higher aren't always shady ones, because they ask for KYC to better know about their customers. Once the KYC process is done they will allow the user to withdraw the earnings without any issue. They have been doing this for a long time and have built up respect in reputation in this community.I'm quite sure that most of the reputed casinos are honest and they accept those users for gambling who are in acceptable age group for gambling activities. I'm not sure about gambling casinos, but there are many applications that allow teenagers and even the children to play games like poker.
