  "content": "Projects Visibility (Sig Campaigns) in Bitcointalk.Before Read:This thread shows the level of visibility of every active signature campaigns in Bitcointalk forum. The arrangement is such that the No.1 on the table is the most visible while the last is the least visible It also shows the maximum  weekly budget of each project owners to sustain the campaign, among other things such as the highest permissible payment to each participant, the percentage visibility in gambling boards, etc. I will be updating this thread as time goes  No shit posting, spamming or off topic posts would be tolerated here. Besides, this is a self-moderated thread, such posts that do not fit the purpose of this thread would be deleted without the poster’s consent.   I will allow extensive discussions for the first week of this thread incase of observations . After the first week, every other discussions would only be about updating the thread or the information therein.

Sometimes the participants do not make up to the expected posts and the weekly payment would definitely be less than the maximum weekly payment for that week Some budgets are calculated with approximate estimation, such as Stake where the number of posts made per week vary greatlyIMPORTANT INFO: There are 25 active bitcoin paying signature campaigns in Bitcointalk. Out of the 25, Gambling campaigns constitute 52% Mixer campaigns constitute 30% while others make 17%. Duelbitsis the highest employer of BTT members (112 participants).Duelbits spends the most in campaign payment ($6,965 peer/week)  Whirlwindis the highest paying campaign per participant ($150/week), not bonus base. Crypto.games is the active longest lasting campaign launched on the 6th day of June, 2015CONCLUSION:This thread was not created to measure the financial strength of any company. Rather the purpose of creating this thread is to enable project owners who would want to launch a signature campaign to estimate their budget and know the kind of exposure they will get with their budget.This thread will no doubt help campaign managers to see how to arrange their campaigns to give their client best result.This will also help project owners who like prestige to re-adjust their funds in order to occupy a better spot in the forum.Updating...

Will it be a way to invite the ended campaigns to re-launch their campaign. Comparing past campaigns to the present, without data I think the present campaigns are gaining more visibility maybe because of the recent inflow of Mixer campaigns with high budgets.

There are other factors for a post, and therefore the signature, to be more visible than another. BestChange, for example, implements a rule that only 2-3 posts made on threads beyond 5 pages are to be counted. This is because mega threads are usually full of spam and posts beyond the 5th page are more easily missed than those made in the first 2 pages. Also, posts that are already buried deep in mega threads are normally less interesting because they are most probably just repetition of earlier posts, and posters probably didn't even read everything before joining the discussion. Another factor perhaps is the level of influence of the user wearing it. If theymos, for example, wears a signature, it becomes very visible to everybody even if he only makes a single post per week.Perhaps a more reliable measurement of visibility is the number of visits made to their websites through signatures, or perhaps the number of users referred by signature links.",

Stake is a long term campaign and they spend reasonable amount of money to promote their brand here, yet they are not seen as prestigious campaign. Many people tag their participants spammers.With over $6,000 weekly budget of stake, they can employ more than 60 participants and make a flat rate of $100 per participants. You can make the required posts per week to be 30 and then 15 of the 30 posts should come from the gambling boards. With this method their campaign will still have obe of the highest visibility in the gambling section while maintaining sanity and some more exceptional members of the forum could join their campaign.

This thread should be a little more useful to campaign managers looking to provide info to potential employers such as budget. My only suggestion would be place an asterisk or remove 1xbit completely. Needs to be a note at minimum that they are a scam company although i'd rather them just not get any sort of exposure.Agree with this, scam company and I don't think there is any member of that campaign I don't have on ignore  Don't like to see any exposure for them as well.@rby superb job, and I don't know how this could be done better. I will just list some of the shortcomings of current format and maybe you or somebody else can find a way to mitigate some of them. Don't think of this as critique even though it will probably sound like it  1. For instance just looking at LiveCasino campaign I am managing, if I was writing the info in the table only campaign name and participants number would stay as they are now. All other info is not 100% correct even though I feel it is clearly shown in our spreadsheet and rules. If there are mistakes in such small campaign then I have to take all the other info with a bit of reserve as well.2. Number of posts per week as main metric of campaign visibility is not good enough criteria to measure. For instance Stake campaign is on the top of the list while I would personally argue they are generating so much spam that it even has negative exposure. But that is quite subjective and I don't know how somebody can incorporate it into something meaningful.3. Place where posts are written should be valued in same way as well. I will again mention Stake since I am basically in gambling sections all the time. Most of their members are writing in spam mega threads that are mostly ignored by good members. Resulting with increasing post counts in threads that are only frequented by other spammers, where nobody is even reading the posts before adding their own. To be fair I am guilty of facilitating some of that as well since I am creator of English Premier league thread for instance and that one has been hit quite badly with spammers. So bad in fact that I am doing all my Premier League discussion in paid pool thread. But that is my dilemma and problem for some other thread.",
