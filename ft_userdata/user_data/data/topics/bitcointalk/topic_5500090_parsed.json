Instead, they send cryptocurrency directly to your wallet address.OmegaStarScream is right. Exchanges are generally cheaper and easier to use, especially if you're already comfortable with them. But, this \"kiosk\" thing does have some advantages. Anonymity is one, for example. You don't need to go through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures for smaller purchases, at least where I live. And, some companies offer promotional periods with fee discounts, so buying or selling can sometimes be even cheaper than on online exchanges. For instance, Bitomat.com (formerly Shitcoins.club) currently has a 0% commission promotion for sales in Bulgaria, Croatia, and Slovenia. link to Bitomat blog",

It reminds me of a famous old Bitcoin mixer that was giving you the private keys of an address with coins. I like it, there might be a moment when you don't have access to your Bitcoin wallet or don't want to use device where you have your coins, so you buy a wallet that is filled with coins, it's like prepaid visa cards.I personally support the idea but 7% is too much to charge for this service. I don't know who uses ATMs with extremely high fees and terrible exchange rates. My friend has one Bitcoin ATM in his restaurant but no one uses it because rates are inappropriate.",

Yeah, its definitely true that using one of those Bitcoin vending machines could let someone spying on you steal your private key if it gets printed on the wallet receipt.Â  I mean, those new to crypto dont really get how risky that can be yet.Â  Makes sense why there dont seem to be as many of those machines around anymore, even though they did help more folks learn about Bitcoin back in the day.Â  Â I remember when my buddy first showed me how to use one at the mall.Â  We were pumped to get our first fraction of a bitcoin.Â  but then I realized later that anyone could have peeked over my shoulder and gotten my key.Â  I would definitely be a lot more careful today.",
