Simply carve out some portion of your funds you want to use for investment, buy Bitcoin this year and wait for 2024 and 2025 to see what great an investor you are. Some of these grammar are really not necessary as they mainly apply to those controlling funds of others and are being pressured to return profits.",

Because I did not see the market as stable, even the pegged tokens are not stable anymore. Precaution is the main thing we all should take before making any type of investment, whether in cryptocurrency or in any other sector of life like real estate, etc.You do know that due to inflation, the prices of things are shooting up, and you also know that the prices of real estate or properties will also increase, but why are you not buying any, or why do you do research before buying any property? If you are looking to make a profit and you know prices are increasing, then why not buy some property?The reasons are very simple: without analysis, you will make a loss. The same thing happens in the crypto industry. Without analysis, if you take blind trades or make blind investments, you will lose.",

If you have the funds to invest in cryptocurrency you should make the decision of taking the opportunity of the coming bitcoin bull run and the halving by  Investing in bitcoin and become long term hodler. The beauty of hodling is that you don't necessarily need to have expertise in cryptocurrency before you can make profit, just hold your portfolio for long period of 2-4years and you're certain of profit without being professional.",

This forum has experienced members in almost all sections of the Bitcoin space. From my little experience, there have been questions that have not received some helpful answers. The worst thing you will do is to get information from social media. These platforms can come up with different false information that will only lead to FUD. You have to also be careful of the so-called crypto experts. Many of them know little or nothing about bitcoin but their intention is to promote Bitcoins that will end up becoming worthless. Don't also follow the predictions or hypes of some celebrities because they were paid to promote these projects and cannot guarantee their credibility. If you think that you have to be cautious when investing in bitcoin then you should be extra cautious when dealing with altcoins.",

Many have fallen victim to fraudulent scams promoted by famous channels on YouTube and Twitter, and some have received false news and information and lost their seats and investments within the market.For me, one of my great sources for years is Bitcointalk. This is the Bitcoin & crypto portal, and expert members discuss any information here, so this source always reassures me.",

Trusting Bitcoin is easier than trusting altcoins because Bitcoin has been here since 2009 and has never stopped continued its growth with time.Altcoins are more risky, harder to trust because most of them can die after two years or a little longer years. Unfortunately, people only spend their money to buy altcoins, not because they trust altcoins but actually because they are too greedy and want to gamble. By gambling, they see more chances to multiply their capital with altcoins than with Bitcoin. Because with Bitcoin, now it is an investment, no longer a gambling like years ago.High risk, high return when succeed but big loss when fail.",

It is true that it has happened in history but there is no guarantee that history will repeat everything exactly. I'm not saying bitcoin won't increase in price, but we should have a long-term vision, not be too focused and put all our faith in the halving. Bitcoin will and will only bring profit when we invest long-term, so hold it until it is profitable, don't be too subjective when relying on history. History does not represent or guarantee anything for the future.",
