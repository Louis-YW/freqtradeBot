All i try to do is challenge myself to hold Bitcoins long enough. Even the earlier adopters who had 500 BTC and did not hold long enough didn't really enough the benefits of the price pump after some years.",

They'll buy at near peak when hype is rampant, then panic sell when the bubble bursts thinking bitcoin is dead.As for me — once I've learned enough about bitcoin 7 years ago, I remained longterm bullish. What needed fixing on my side was only my allocations as I was almost always over invested; leaving me with very little dry powder when crashes came.",

Many people have missed an opportunity like you, myself included, but I never regret it because I know that no matter what I do, time will not come back for us to fix it. Instead, I will try to look to the future and will never let those mistakes happen again. The opportunity to invest in bitcoin is still there and always will be, it's never too late, and those who grab it now will have the same opportunity as early bitcoin adopters. We are still in the early stages of the bitcoin revolution.",

During the last two bull runs that happened, I was blaming myself for why I didn't find a way to buy bitcoin when its value was still low in the market.     Especially during the times when I reached a drop of 180$ for each bitcoin, considering that during those times I was not that deep in having an interest in bitcoin. That's why if the past can really be brought back but it's not possible anymore and we have to accept and prepare for the future that's what's important.So this is what I'm doing now that I didn't do when the two bull seasons passed because I don't want to be late anymore.",

At the time when I was at high school, I though the price was really expensive back then(it's still expensive today) and I thought to myself \"I don't think this is legit because I had never heard of this one before and this was a scam when I did PTC back then) so I refrain myself from investing in Bitcoin because lack of money and didn't make me interested to invest but at least I did still jump to Bitcoin train in 2016 and still got pretty much good profit until today, so there is no such thing as late in cryptocurrency.",

When my circle started trading bitcoin I was really left out of the circle and was not much interested in it. However, few of my friends really helped me to get involved with the bitcoin in long terms. Initially when I heard about bitcoin, I was just reading about it and seeing the blogs over internet. It was until 2015-16 when I started with first purchase through local bitcoins and made ownership with it. There were still regrets because I sold almost all of them in just 6-7 months after booking some profits. Then in 2017 I regretted the most of my life right there since bitcoin had that magical pump and I could have been half millionaire already. I think there are almost everyone who has gone through such drama.",

Do you know that you that have just decided to invest in bitcoins can in no time have more bitcoins than someone who has been into bitcoins for a longer time than you have? Sometimes it is not not just how long you have known and owned some bitcoins, what matters more is how much bitcoin you have been able to keep. Develop good habit and a consistent behavior/pattern to buying and keeping bitcoins, be dedicated to it since you already know that you have lost some time already. Bitcoin Halving is expected to happen soon, you will be happy tomorrow if you develop the habit of buying and keeping the bitcoins till halving occurs.",

In 2011, I was freelancing with my old laptop when a client proposed to pay me in Bitcoin. However, due to my apprehension about the lack of monetary value at that time, I declined the payment. Reflecting back on that experience, I regret not accepting the offer, as I could have potentially become a millionaire today had I accepted the quantity of Bitcoin that the client was offering to pay me.",

In as much as you believe its never too late, I still think that some opportunities never come to us again when we miss it.For me personally, I discovered bitcoin in late 2015, Bitcoin was still pretty cheap back then, I could have bought a lot of it but didn't, and my not buying is not because I thought Bitcoin's value would never increase, No, but rather, I was because, at that time, I was so poor, i barely get enough money to feed and take care of my self and my family properly, let alone having extra to invest in bitcoin, this is one of the reasons why i don't really regret missing out big on bitcoin, because there was nothing I could have done. But then, I am still thankful because, even though I didn't invest in bitcoin in its early stage, my financial life have turned around for better through the same bitcoin, i now have a good business and several ways i earn extra income through the same bitcoin, I don't have much regrets.",

Lost up lots of Bitcoin wayback when Hyip/Ponzi scheme sites are flooding in the marketTrying to remember or on the time that i have seen or realized this, then it  cant really be avoided for you not to regret out because if you have done the opposite then i might be rich now.",

If you are talking about regrets then let me join. Way back 2017 when I first heard bitcoin I did not really believe in it since I was not old enough but I realized that starting young is not a bad idea. I should have believe in it and invested bigger since I have a money to spare that time and the price was cheaper than right now. I am not gonna miss this time and 100% believe that I'm not gonna regret it. I'll be saving up bitcoin and not gonna spend it like before.",

For the past years when Bitcoin have no influence on the society, many people do have a shambles thought of Bitcoin, and especially investing for long term duration, sometimes we won't blame them because they are ignorant of Bitcoin investment, past five years many people doesn't believe or have trust on Bitcoin, Bitcoin investment is something of determination and that's while so many of us who has invested in Bitcoin will continue to advice a beginner not to use all it has for prolong Bitcoin investment, what a good investors uses for cryptocurrency investment and especially bitcoin is a spare money because of it's disadvantage of market.",

If you think about it like this, then after every trading, everyone will have to feel regret, because this market is always moving, there will be ups and downs all the time.",

We feel satisfied opting out while the action is on until we look back and realize it was an opportunity that shouldn't have been missed. Now that we can take a guess at what the future portends, having learnt from history that every bull year has done better than the one before it, I want to believe you're positioning already for the next bull run that will likely happen in 2024/25?
