From Jan 2023 until the current date, I have made substantial deposits totaling $10,000, without receiving any bonuses as promised & a total bonus of $50,000k.From January 2023 to now is almost 5 months.May I know why you have been waiting even after your first bonus was getting delayed on your first attempt of availing it?If I were you, I will start with $50 or $100 and if I am not getting what I was promised then I will leave that places rather than keep trying with same place until my total spending accumulating to $10k.If you have valid points and proof, please rewrite your complaint in this format: Scam Report Format (Use it to make scam reports properly)",

I am sure, you survive with your affiliate earnings, please do better things rather than going with a scum casino.I'm not going to defend Duelbits but I will just question your motive because you are not providing anything, you are asked to follow the format but you prefer to attack Duelbits if you are going to attack be sure you have the evidence to back up your attack, I don't consider this as a valid accusation without providing anything even screenshot of the conversation, you can ignore my post but your accusation is invalid and you will be considered a sore loser, who cannot accept his losses and prefer to attack Duelbits.",

Now if you care to follow the format[1] it will help people here to understand your issue regarding @duelbits. While the post above me is quite correct about the accusation without proofs will be considered nonsense and just an attack. But by reading your post it looks like duelbits doesn't give you the deposit bonus as they promised. Now if you can post a screenshot(upload images to talkimg or imgbb then include it here) about the deposit bonus promo ad, your deposit txs, and other images like chatlogs that will back your accusation.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0",
