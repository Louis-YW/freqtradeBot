  "content": "Whenever we see a rise in bitcoin price, the debate started hag tag altseason(#Altcoinseason) on social media specially on tweeter.  Last year when bitcoin grip its support on 28000 we have seen the rise in bitcoin price and atltcoins too. so, the debate started hash tag atcoinseason on social media, and when bitcoin reached 69000 we have a massive decline in its price also in altcoins.                           On a some websites (www.digitalsurge.com) there is written. when, we see decline in bitcoin marketcap, and rise in altcoin marketcap. So, we can say altcoin season is started.                                Is it right to say that altseason depends on bitcoin ?                       In Near future we will see the same hash tag debate on social media when we see rise in bitcoin price.              In my opinion hash tag altcoin is just a Myth.                                          (The senior can batter explain this.)",

But there are times that we can see bitcoin dominance go down and started to shift to altcoins that means many people are keep buying altcoins instead of bitcoin. But that is not the only factor since we can also rely on other parameters especially on fundamental aspect of tokens or major projects that keep building and innovating.",

I don't think we can go back to that kind of market. I have altcoins and I want to see them grow but I do believe it's all up to Bitcoin first. It's a sign that many investors are flocking and they would also purchase altcoins if ever they feel like it. Right now, buying cheap coins that look to have a good future ahead is the only option.",

But currently we're have around 20K altcoins which is 10 times higher than 5 years ago. Actually Bitcoin marketcap and dominance aren't decreased, but the reason behind this is there's many altcoins there and that's make Bitcoin marketcap and dominance are smaller.I don't see any chance altcoin season might comeback since everyone already know altcoins are mostly pump and dump scheme, not for long term.",

I think that is only a niche where very bull run there is a new trend, just like recently where we saw Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Non Fungible Tokens (NFT). As I remember last 2017-2018 where ICO fever happened, any altcoins which got ICO they are just flying even how shitcoins they are, there are lot of people lost money during that time.",

We can take this as our guide every time we buy altcoins, though of course this a case to case basis and you still need to consider other indicators it doesn't meant that Bitcoin pumps, all altcoins will pump too, you should still need to choose the best one.",

It cna't be argued if altcoin can decouple from bitcoin caused by it was always following bitcoin. It will be going up if there will be a pump.

Usually Bitcoin is the first project that has noticeable gains when a bullrun is starting. Even though we have so many crypto projects now Bitcoin is still the big indicator for the whole industry.Once Bitcoin has been rising a certain amount of time like a few weeks or so, then usually the bigger altcoins also begin to raise in price noticeably which means the bitcoin domination goes a bit down again. Again a little later when we are really in a full bull market even the small altcoins are rising in some cases even absolute shitcoins.When this is starting then it is time to prepare for the next bear market again.",

Cryptocurrency is a market unlike others, every market movement depends on the trend of bitcoin. By analyzing the trend of bitcoin, we are able to predict the trend of the rest of the altcoins based on that trend. Sometimes there are some alts that go against the btc trend when it is pumped by some event, news highlights, but that happens only individually and is quickly extinguished and back to the trend of bitcoin later there.",
