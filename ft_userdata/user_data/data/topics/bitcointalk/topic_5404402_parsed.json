However there is already little public support in Russia for the war and Russia is not a democracy, so Putin cannot get voted out. Do you have any specific examples of when sports were used, in part to end wars? Most modern wars that I can think of have been won by one side with their military",

Sport clubs or teams is just an ordinary things for entertainment and pleasure. And it's ordinary people who is fully in government that manage teams of sport activities, in which they have no mouth in government and government still control them",

Sports plays a big role to keep the people separated because if they love one team so they will hate the people who ever is playing against them and sometimes it can turns out into violence as well in small scale. Sport is a business now, it plays a big role in the entertainment field and keeping the people distracted all the time from their responsibilities. How many people are now playing the game which they love in present days?",

      "body": "Sports play an excellent role in establishing peace in society. I give the example of Pakistan. After 9/11, the American and Afghan war was also fought on Pakistani soil. Terrorism increased. People became insecure but even when the war stopped, The locals were reluctant to go out without any special need and in these circumstances, Foreigners did not come So the government started resettling the sports fields. In the beginning, there were some difficulties but now the situation is much better. With the settlement of cricket and other sports grounds, people became stronger both mentally and physically. Investment also started coming in from outside and people started engaging in various activities which increased the activities in society.An idle brain is the devil's workshop.that's why sports are very useful in making society better.Pakistan and India are enemies of each other but when there is a cricket match during the World Cup our hearts beat together love grows so Russian and Ukrainian can also come close to each other but the condition is that first the war should be stopped from both sides",

Hey, I will back that 100% It's never gonna happen, but that would be something if achived. What I do see is countries going to war because of sports, that seems more realistic to happen XD",
