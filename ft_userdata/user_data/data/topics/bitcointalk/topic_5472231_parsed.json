For those who are new here, halving means Bull run, and in general, it happens after the halving in 1 year. As we know there is a race going on in the USA where every financial giant is trying to get their Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC. Considering these two factors what do you guys think would be the new Bitcoin all-time high? Please use the poll and comment below on why you think the price of Bitcoin will break the old-time high and the reason why it will reach a new ATH.",

      "body": "It is very hard to predict where Bitcoin will reach in the next bull run. Looking back how it went after halving one thing I am sure is that it will break it's previous ATH of $69k. I feel that the next stop would be $100k. It is my prediction looking at the current scenario wherein a minimum  of one ETF would get approved. That will start the bull run l, hopefully next year. Then by 2025 it should take a big leap which will lead it to my price point or more.",

Be realistic here and keep realistic goals. We need to break the previous ATH first and then find a new one. Anyways when a new ATH happens, a lot of selling pressure to defend that price will come in.",

Anyways when a new ATH happens, a lot of selling pressure to defend that price will come in.Honestly, I feel 120K to 130K can be the realistic value to achieve, and it's just based on doubling the ATH value of BTC from its previous bullish season. Here is a breakdown BTC price chart.From the chart we can see the from 2017 to 2021 the price tripled, and previously it was way higher, so I assume even if it doubles the price can reach over 120K for sure.",

A few days back we saw a surge in Bitcoin price when Blackrock's application got listed. The price went up to $36k and now it's trading around $34 to $35k. The recent one is from Invesco & Galaxy Spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). We might see another surge in the price of Bitcoin in the coming days.",

In 2021 COVID panic and uncertainty of the future helped Bitcoin reach 69k, wherein both Institutional investors and retail investors invested in Bitcoin heavily. Now with the war looming, Bitcoin ETF, and halving we might again see the same kind of Bull run due to one factor that is uncertain of the future. I am positive the next ATH would be bigger than the previous and it would make Bitcoin one of the best investment option in the global market.",

Sudden rise means a sudden fall too.I was able to compile the dates and the price point when Bitcoin reached its ATH- November 2013 - $1,242.00 - reason media coverage of Bitcoin.- December 2017 - $19,783.06 - reason crypto bubble. - April 2021 - $64,804.72 - reason institutionalized investors- November 2021 - $68,990.90 - Current ATHThe big gap happened between 2017 and 2021, as we progress near halving which is next year I feel we might see another big jump in 2025. The reason this time would be ETF and a lot of Investment coming from big financial institutions.  That is why I feel the price of 100k for Bitcoin would be easy to reach.",

What you predicted for this year is something that I can agree too. The reason being there are only two months left for the year to end.Since we are speculating what happens if one of the Bitcoin ETF's get approved before the year ends. What happens when  a third world war starts as we know it is looming now. Why I talked about a war is because anytime when there is a global crisis Bitcoin gets pumped. The best example will be COVID 19 which I feel was the reason for Bitcoin to pump and create a new high.What is happening now can cause a lot of people to invest in Bitcoin. It has happened in the past and it can happen before the year end. There is one thing that everyone believes and that is called security of someones money. Bitcoin provides that security without the influence of a third party.",

AFAIK, SEC rejected all Bitcoin applications that is why we saw the stall in the price surge and network become congested still the ETF's may get accepted in other entities which will not be helpful at all in the long run for bitcoin, but it will become the catalyst to pump bitcoin's price.At the time of crisis the asset prices will crash at first then it will grow beyond its previous value but WWIII, I don't know because if there is such an event then we can safely say that the extinction of human race began.",

I talked about a crisis scenario and the last crisis we encountered was when the human race was hit by a pandemic. Already there is a war going on in Europe and a few European countries are already in recession. Now there is a similar situation in the Middle East, which can escalate to a proper war in some time. The US is funding both wars they have already opened two fronts. This is when China will try to take over Taiwan and most are predicting it will happen in 2024. Now, my friend in such a situation the wealth of those rich will depreciate and the global market would go down in such a situation they come to Bitcoin, as in the rich and institutional investors. The same scenario happened when the pandemic caused the global market to go into the red.When two powerful economies are indirectly in war against each other then they drag those countries that support them into the war. This is why I suspect another World war is in the making and it will be called WW-3",

But be realistic here, if a war like that does happen, we will have difficulty surviving in our own country itself before thinking about bitcoin.

While there are many, there is one important pro and con that I can think of.If bitcoin ETF gets approved it will bring huge market players into the crypto market which will increase the crypto market cap and send bitcoin to new heights.But this will also bring centralization into the market since big players will be able to manipulate BTC price (may be a little bit but still).So if bitcoin ETFs get rejected we will be on a safer side from such centralization and manipulation.",

I think we should achieve it by the end of this month or the first week of December. I read some speculation that the rebound might lead the price to go below 22k. I doubt that would happen but nothing is guaranteed with Bitcoin volatility and we as a community have seen how fast it went down from its previous ATH earlier. In the meantime did anyone check how fast ORDI is pumping? It started from $10 and yesterday it touched $24, now trading at $22. This is the coin that is causing so much congestion in the memepool. The Bitcoin transaction fee is skyrocketing because of this coin and it will remain the same in the coming times.",
