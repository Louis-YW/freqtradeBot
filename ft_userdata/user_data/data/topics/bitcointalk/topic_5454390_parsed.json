It should be noted that the victory was not easy, the opponent from the opposition Kalychdaroglu with 47.9% of the vote turned out to be a serious contender, which is confirmed by the need for a second round of voting. The elections showed the active participation of the people in the fate of the country, and their tension - the commitment of the population to democratic principles, which is especially important as a fact for all those who believe that Turkey is not a democratic country enough. Yes, Erdogan is a believer, but this is his personal matter, democracy does not prohibit religion, in this matter the main principle is to separate religion from the state, which, for example, is not in Israel, where rabbis take an active part in the political and economic life of the state, and laws Halakhas are part of the laws of Israel, which positions itself as a democratic country. By the way, the presidents of America, so to speak, the stronghold of world democracy, are believing Christians and, upon taking office, take an oath on the Bible. So why are so many people in democratic Europe biased towards Erdogan, calling him an Islamist? Yes, Erdogan is as much an Islamist as they are Christians. What's next! Has Erdogan changed something in the country's Constitution regarding religion since the time of Ataturk? Here it is appropriate to recall the fact that it was Erdogan who waged a political struggle with Fethullah Gülen, who wanted to turn the country into an Islamic republic similar to Iran.      On my Facebook page (1) on the eve of the elections, I pointed out the preference for Erdogan as an experienced politician, under whom Turkey has achieved significant political and economic success, entering the top twenty countries with developed economies. True, Erdogan's opponents reproach him for the fall of the economy, but forget that as a result of the pandemic, many economically developed countries are experiencing the same difficulties. A series of catastrophic earthquakes that befell Turkey also aggravated the situation, but Erdogan courageously accepted the disaster, not showing a single ounce of doubt in successfully overcoming the misfortune that suddenly befell the Turkish people.     Unlike Kalychdaroglu, Erdogan understands the importance for the Turkic countries of the grandiose project put forward by China, “one belt - one road”, which is essentially the Great Silk Road, the revival of which has been carried out for several years by Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkey. (2)          In political terms, and here we must pay tribute to Erdogan as a mature politician, he did not dwell on the issue of admitting the country to EU membership, knocking on the door closed to Turkey, but continued the path of integration outlined by Togrul Ozal with the countries of the Turkic world. (3,4,5) And of course, thanks to Erdogan, who managed to tie the Russian economy to Turkey, and thereby neutralize Russia as an ally of Armenia, Azerbaijan, taking into account also the military assistance from Turkey, won a convincing victory over the Armenian invaders in the second Karabakh war.       It is impossible not to point out the political talent of Erdogan, who showed literally virtuoso tightrope walking in the war with the Syrian dictator, who was supported by Putin. Erdogan managed to avoid a direct military clash with Russia, and so successfully that Putin even swallowed a grudge for the Russian plane shot down by the Turks. Erdogan has tied Russia with economic ties to such an extent that breaking them is like death for Russia. America with Europe.      In view of the above, it seems that the people of Turkey were not mistaken in re-electing Erdogan as president.1. facebook.com/alikbahshi/posts/pfbid02jVNi7Y8NzD3JSAT9MREuNLeaewZgJkhZPw7dvj5qmV16GZ5ByTrEw6HBLVDtuBvYl2.
