If any one want to diversify their investment, it is good to also invest in Dogecoin because the future of that coin e dey promising. And many of us in this naija we no dey invest in altcoins for the fear say the coin go collapsed orne no go go forward. And na true true if you invest in this Dogecoin you go wait for years before im reach were u fit like. Remember di coin e never reach one dollar. im still dey 0.08312 before it will reach $1 it is not even next year. But this is the best time to invest in this Dogecoin so that whenever it rise up you can make your profit. But make sure you invest with it , with the money that you will not use it for years oh. Invest wisely.",

The thread has been quite for long now that is why many people don’t know about it. It will be best if bumped again. For reason like this is why we want sub-boards in this local board, so that all topics will have their sub-boards for discussion instead of generalising and posting everything here. Vital informations can easily be missed without this sub-boards.",

OP I understand you are not a professional and you giving people a crypto professional advise on what altcoin they should instantaneous invest into. That's not fair and risky not only for those that will take this advise and put it to immediately action but also you op as all blaming fingers would be directed at you should anything goes south. Don't forget that's an altcoin.It would have been preferable you had made the post  appear in a way that suggests that you are only bringing in an altcoin idea you think might do well in the future and that any person that feel interest should also do their own research about it and think of the next action to take based on how they also observe it. Instead you make it sound so sure and that investors should troop in immediately and invest before they miss out.My candid piece of advise to anyone is that, if you have to invest in altcoin invest a very amount that won't hit you hard if it happens that you lose it, and always DYOR.",
