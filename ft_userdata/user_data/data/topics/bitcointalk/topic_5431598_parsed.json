      "body": "However there's a genuine users who create a complaints, not all complaints are just attacking the casinos. But usually their problem are easily get resolved since they're contact the casino via support. This shitty people who accuse the casino when they're wrong are make it's worse and time consuming. Usually people ask to upload the evidence, but the thing is it can be faked or the user didn't show all of the part.IMO when the legit and popular casino already give an explanation about the problem, it's enough and no need to defend the accuser.",

      "body": "Well, those of us who have been here for a long time already know what happens, and we don't just believe the sobbing story of a newbie without proof. But this is a forum where free speech dominates and that has its advantages and disadvantages.Anyway, casinos are very profitable businesses and by pure statistics, with the customer base they have they are going to have complaints and false accusations, so tough shit, it's something they have to deal with. There have also been cases of scams or morally questionable actions on the part of casinos in some cases, and we have no a priori way of discerning them, so I think the thing is going to continue like this and that's it: with people who have broken the rules and have been caught inventing stories against casinos, and few other real cases of wrongdoing on the casinos' part.",

      "body": "I barely visit this board because of the shit you mentioned. These are the issues every time I see pop up on the first page of this board which makes the board less useful. I haven't seen an interesting scam accusation for a long time (that's good though lol). There's no other casino left that didn't receive an accusation here.Quote from: Hhampuz on December 26, 2022, 08:06:45 AMWhat gets me even more than this though, is when respected and veteran users of this forum seem to fall for it every time and \"demanding\" the bookie/casino to reveal their entire strategy of how they actually catch these guys. Whether nefarious or just stupid is beyond me.You are right in terms of the majority of the accusations here but it's also true that some casinos use this strategy as a weapon to confiscate users' money. You will never know who is speaking the truth unless strong proof is shared. If people don't demand strong proof, don't you think the weapon will be more strong eventually?",

      "body": "Sadly, some of those casino does entitled to be questioned and \"demanded\" to reveal their basis of their accusation --not their strategy-- because, like Little Mouse said, some ill-intentioned casino use \"you agree to our ToS\" and alike to get away from their wrongful accusation. One good example is err... a casino with fruit-slash-vegetable name attached to it that I recently attended, they finally tried to hide behind NDA to settle their issue with a customer raising their dispute here because --I can only assume-- they can't prove that their reason of banning is valid. And this outcome were achieved because the community requested a proof of their counter-accusation against the user.Another notorious case is err... that site with scale and two dice for their logo, where upon a long and hard cat-and-mouse, they suddenly withdrawn their decision and \"compensate\" the user for the inconvenience. This too achieved because they were asked for proof of their claim and unable to provide, the situation would probably ends differently with the victim losing even more if the forum didn't assist the issue.Although, there also cases where the accuser are clearly the wrong side here, yet had the audacity to demand more and more evidences although the representative of the casino had provided enough.Quote from: Woodie on December 27, 2022, 10:00:16 AM[...]Out of curiosity, why are some of the biggest names of the crypto gambling industry finding themselves in such, and you say they didn't pay you... If you have the evidence you can open a scam accusation against them to try get this resolved. It's... OP is being satirical, in response to the blooming of recent cases where people claimed being scammed by trusted casino like sportsbet or stake. OP is not actually currently being scammed by them",

      "body": "LOL.I guess I have never thought in this way. I used to think most casinos are doing stupid activities & always find out something in their favor to freeze users' accounts & confiscate their money. A few days earlier, I even had a thread created in the gambling discussion board on this issue-  Why every casino got bad habits?I thought most of the accusations must be true & casinos are the evil here. But seems like I was wrong. This is ridiculous how these sockpuppets are trying to defame the casinos.Quote from: Woodie on December 27, 2022, 10:00:16 AMOut of curiosity, why are some of the biggest names of the crypto gambling industry finding themselves in such, and you say they didn't pay you... If you have the evidence you can open a scam accusation against them to try get this resolved. Did you get OP wrong, by any chance?Nevertheless, everyone creates accusations with some screenshots. These can be faked as well. Their account may get frozen but the reason behind the freezing is more important which neither they share nor the casino (most of the times).",
