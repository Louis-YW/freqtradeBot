  "content": "Hi Guys!A quick question. Does it work to mix apw9 and apw9+ psu between s17 pro and t17+?Â I know that they look different in the chassi but Can I use both psu for each miner (S17PRO T17+) without risky to damage the miners.In that case, will be a quick solution before I order more ones.Thanks in advance!",
