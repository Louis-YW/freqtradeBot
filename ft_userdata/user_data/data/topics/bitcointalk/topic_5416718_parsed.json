  "content": "I often find messages on the forum from people who want to earn extra money on the Internet while their crypto investments are growing up. And in most cases, they don't have the skills for remote work or freelance work experience.Â  It seems to me that the community can give them some tips for more realistic perception of such earnings. I can say the following based on my experience:You need to understand, in the first place, that learning any skill takes time, and you won't have a quick income. Many fall into this trap, believing that they can earn money quickly on the Internet by taking a couple of courses. But you can try to start a freelance career. I would say, that has studied the skill at least at a basic level, you will be able to count on income in at least 6 months. But you have to work and develop your skills every day. It all depends on what you have a predisposition to. You can try to learn programming skills or become a quality assurance, a profession easier to enter. If you have an interest in design or illustration, you can try to become a logo designer (and start at a contest on 99design) or vector illustrator on stock (Shutterstock, Adobe stock, etc), and maybe a stock photographer too. Or get a job as a Google SERP tester. Or HR-recruiter.It all depends on you. It would be great to put together a list of remote additional earnings opportunities, describe your experience here, please, if you can advise something.",

      "body": "You definitely need to join some platforms with massive user base, where you will get noticed easily. I think each of the platform allows you to make a sales page / introduction page about you and your offered services. If you have a portfolio to show the work you have done before, and if it is good, you will definitely start to score one customer after another. Make sure to have good communication skills when dealing with customers and try to always meet their desired results, unless they are going far beyond of that you have agreed upon. Once you reach a level where you are having a constant stream of customers remember not to bite more than you can chew - meaning that do not grab all the orders coming your way. have good time management and complete them one by one. Good reviews will put you higher on the search list, also the amount of work done will do it. Good luck!Definitely define what you want to offer as a service",

Oh, yes, I had situation like this once. I took more orders than I could physically manage, working at a normal pace.
