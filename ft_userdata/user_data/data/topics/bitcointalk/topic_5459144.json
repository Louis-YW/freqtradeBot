      "body": "Maybe in a very weird way we could find a utility for something like this. For example having an indicator of what the private key was used for (eg. MyHotWallet). But as others mentioned you are reducing the security of the private key so here is a better idea: why don't you use a different encoding and change the algorithm itself?that means instead of modifying the key itself, you could just add extra bits on top of the untouched random 256-bit key to indicate the utility.You don't even have to reinvent the wheel, there is Bech32[1] encoding that is very suitable for this purpose. You just replace the HRP part with the string you want. It can contain between 1 to 83 US-ASCII characters then use the key bytes as the data part without modifying it at all. So your final key string would become something like this: MyFirstBitcoinAddress1{unchanged 256-bit encoded key} where 1 is the default separator.I used a version byte (=0) and the BIP350 (Bech32m)[2] in the following:Code:5JYkir7TsJ4L8bJroCuLgjxxNdbEUgvjVKdUgnwhDMFF5yM2dYuMyFirstBitcoinAddress1qvpkmem0ne8c5mc2mx69733mxcq206rfhwnln8g5p7javkv26f6dsqdk50w5JYkir7... is a randomly generated key without modification and second line MyFirs.... is the different encoding of the same exact key without any difference between the key bytes whatsoever.This has so many benefits:- It doesn't reduce key security- The restriction on the size of the \"string\" you use at the beginning is big enough (83 chars) to contain any note- You don't have to write that much code to guess the range like you did here, everything is pretty straight forward and you can use already existing Bech32 encoding libraries- The code and the result is neat and is easy to verify so the chance of bugs is minimal- The encoding is fast and has a checksum and error detection built in.- It can contain a version for future expansion of the algorithm[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki",

No one should ever use this.I DISAGREE! Even with 4 characters as you said, it's still perfectly safe to have a vanity WIF. Let's say there are really 11 million combination left to find the address, still with this it's enough security for me. Because when you have an address, obviously no body will know your private key, so they won't even know that you have a vanity-WIF that is vulnerable for attacks and has only 4 Characters AND they DONT even know the \"Words\" you used for Vanity-WIF. Are they in Capital letters? How many repeated words? Are they written in small letters etc etc, Unless someone decides to search manually 11 Million times in Blockchain searching for random balance address, but still it would take hundreds of years to manually loop 11 millions time and would most likely not possible because they need to exactly know your Vanity-Words that you used for your WIF to be able to manually search => There are millions of different words! AND they need to guess the correct word with the correct order. If they want to bruteforce the address, as i said they need to know that address actually has vanity WIF and its vanity-words, which is no way to know, so it's not possible and therefore it's definitely safe to have at least 4 random characters for vanity WIF.I find it a good idea to use Vanity-WIF, especially to manually remember the WIF, if its written with words we like to remember and not random shitty characters that if we lost we don't remember anything of it. Summary: It does indeed decrease the security of the key. BUT its still very safe to use. It;s like when you reveal your public key, you just reduced your security public key from 256 bits, to 128 bits. AND SO is with the vanity-wif!",
