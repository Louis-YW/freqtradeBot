Wallets like Electrum and Bluewallet.Quote from: unknowncustomer on June 28, 2023, 03:43:36 PMIf I reuse an address to receive bitcoin will it count as a second UTXO ?Yes. If you use an address to receive bitcoin two times and you want to spend the coins or part of the coins from first and second UTXO, it will have 2 inputs and the more the fee.To be able to spend from certain UTXOs of your address or of your other addresses, use a wallet that has coin control.",

What's the difference between output count and unspent output count ?There are two types of transaction outputs if we apply classification based on their status: unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and spent transaction outputs (as far as I know, this type didn't get a well-established acronym, but we can call it \"TXOs\" for short.) Your wallet shows only UTXOs in the \"Coins\" tab because it has corresponding private keys to them and manages all information necessary for transaction signing and broadcasting. On the other hand, TXOs have already been used and spent to the addresses to which your current wallet has no private key. It still may show these outputs in the transaction history, but it is mainly for user experience. Please note that not all wallets can show UTXOs as a separate list of selectable items: this feature is known as \"Coin control\" - a privacy-enhancing technique aimed at giving users more control over addresses and transactions.",

UTXOs are the bitcoin that you received and that you can spend. Quote from: unknowncustomer on June 29, 2023, 01:01:26 PMFees will be determined by UTXOsFee is determined by the UTXO count. Assuming you send bitcoin to someone, and the UTXO count is 3 (I mean the transaction input is 3 in the coin you are sending), that means you will pay more. The more the count the more the fee. But not only that, the more also the transaction output (the addresses you are sending to), the more the fee, but lesser in fee than to send each time to the addresses differently.

If it is native segwit, it is 294 sat. But why thinking about dust limit because the value is very small and not worth discussing. But some people use it for dust attack to trace certain coins.",

So I will have two utxos in the same address ?Your address may be associated with multiple transactions - incoming and outcoming - and all these transactions need to contain some information to be recognized by the network. The number of unspent transaction outputs depends on how many incoming transactions you have and how many of them have not been spent during other transactions. So, if you reuse an address, it may or may not contain additional UTXO since we take into account only unspent coins. For example, you receive 5 BTC in one transaction using your address X and later send it to address Y. As a result of such manipulations, you will have zero UTXOs associated with address X. If you use it again in another transaction to receive coins from address Z, your UTXO count will increase correspondingly.",

So I will have two utxos in the same address ? Think of your address as a physical wallet you carry your cash in. UTXOs are the paper bills you have in your wallet. Each bill is one UTXO. If you sell something and receive BTC in address #1, that's one UTXO. You receive your salary to the same address, UTXO #2. Your friend losses a bet and sends the amount to address #1 - UTXO #3.

For each transaction I make, I manually pick the inputs that best fit the purpose based on transaction fee and privacy (linking inputs together). If fees are low, I consolidate more and smaller inputs, if fees are high, I use as little inputs as possible.Maybe it's a good start to play around with fees on Testnet: get some coins, start Electrum with \"--testnet\" option, and create some transactions. Send some to yourself, learn how to use \"send to many\", send some back to the faucet, and see what happens to the fee and your Coins tab. On the Coins tab, manually select the inputs you want to use (the process is a bit different on the latest version of Electrum).",
