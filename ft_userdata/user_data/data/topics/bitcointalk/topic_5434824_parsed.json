I can't see any way to do it trustlessly for both the first buyer and all future buyers without electronics in the collectible, though.Assuming a constant Bitcoin price, there could be 2 types:(1) Low-value prefunded item: traditional way (trust the creator), cheap to manufacture, not too much risk if it gets wiped.(2) Higher-value prefunded item: include chip that generates randomness internally on-device, stores it inside itself and can sign a transaction, but not output the key in plaintext (very similar to what hardware wallets do). Since hardware wallets with this type of chip can be bought for as low as 50 bucks on sale and have much more functionality, I assume that the functions I describe should be possible with a very cheap circuit board and much less coding. It shouldn't add more than $50 to the 'collectible premium'.The only issue is when collectibles of the (1) type rise in value due to Bitcoin price increase. But at some point, the BTC value will exceed the 'collectible premium' you first paid for it anyway, so you won't lose anything from swiping it.I'm currently also thinking about a Bitcoin script that would somehow prevent multiple collectibles to be spent in a single transaction and maybe even somehow time-locks them relative to each other (e.g. only 1 per day). That shouldn't inconvenience collectors too much, while preventing the designer to steal more than 1 item before people start talking to each other and doing something against it. I do think it's too complicated for Bitcoin script, though.",

Most of these coins come with a certificate of authentication. instead of releasing random coins they can make preorders, buyer provides pub key and keeps partial priv.maker creates the maker issue a template that the buyer prints half key on, if they resell it make sure its with it. do a handwritten chain of ownership on the back(if wanted). if the holo is damaged its spent. the only thing is a piece of paper to keep track of that everyone will, and does. if the maker keeps all keys and get the single coin in hand again, they \"could\" sweep. a single coin.but never an entire batch.It's better than right now. they can all sweep. period.Multisig is too risky. disagreement.Split key generation would be user induced error.There's a reason I've invested so much time in the splitkey ecosphere.    It's BTCrilliant  I believe it was designed for this very scenario.  Other projects like VanityPool used the same concepts and have never had an event.From JLVS Github page https://github.com/JeanLucPons/VanitySearch#generate-a-vanity-address-for-a-third-party-using-split-keyGenerate a vanity address for a third party using split-keyIt is possible to generate a vanity address for a third party in a safe manner using split-key.For instance, Alice wants a nice prefix but does not have CPU power. Bob has the requested CPU power but cannot know the private key of Alice, Alice has to use a split-key.*Added Or a Customer wants to buy a physical but doesn't want the issuing company knowing the key!Step 1Alice generates a key pair on her computer then send the generated public key and the wanted prefix to Bob. It can be done by email, nothing is secret. Nevertheless, Alice has to keep safely the private key and not expose it.Code:VanitySearch.exe -s \"AliceSeed\" -kpPriv : L4U2Ca2wyo721n7j9nXM9oUWLzCj19nKtLeJuTXZP3AohW9wVgrHPub  : 03FC71AE1E88F143E8B05326FC9A83F4DAB93EA88FFEACD37465ED843FCC75AA81Note: The key pair is a standard SecpK1 key pair and can be generated with a third party software.Step 2Bob runs VanitySearch using the Alice's public key and the wanted prefix.Code:VanitySearch.exe -sp 03FC71AE1E88F143E8B05326FC9A83F4DAB93EA88FFEACD37465ED843FCC75AA81 -gpu -stop -o keyinfo.txt 1ALiceIt generates a keyinfo.txt file containing the partial private key.Code:PubAddress: 1ALicegohz9YgrLLa4ADCmam7X2Zr6xJZxPartialPriv: L2hbovuDd8nG4nxjDq1yd5qDsSQiG8xFsAFbHMcThqfjSP6WLg89Bob sends back this file to Alice. It can also be done by email. The partial private key does not allow anyone to guess the final Alice's private key.Step 3Alice can then reconstructs the final private key using her private key (the one generated in step 1) and the keyinfo.txt from Bob.Code:VanitySearch.exe -rp L4U2Ca2wyo721n7j9nXM9oUWLzCj19nKtLeJuTXZP3AohW9wVgrH keyinfo.txtPub Addr: 1ALicegohz9YgrLLa4ADCmam7X2Zr6xJZxPriv (WIF): p2pkh:L1NHFgT826hYNpNN2qd85S7F7cyZTEJ4QQeEinsCFzknt3nj9gqgPriv (HEX): 0x7BC226A19A1E9770D3B0584FF2CF89E5D43F0DC19076A7DE1943F284DA3FB2D0How it worksBasically the -sp (start public key) adds the specified starting public key (let's call it Q) to the starting keys of each threads. That means that when you search (using -sp), you do not search for addr(k.G) but for addr(kpart.G+Q) where k is the private key in the first case and kpart the \"partial private key\" in the second case. G is the SecpK1 generator point.Then the requester can reconstruct the final private key by doing kpart+ksecret (mod n) where kpart is the partial private key found by the searcher and ksecret is the private key of Q (Q=ksecret.G). This is the purpose of the -rp option.The searcher has found a match for addr(kpart.G+ksecret.G) without knowing ksecret so the requester has the wanted address addr(kpart.G+Q) and the corresponding private key kpart+ksecret (mod n). The searcher is not able to guess this final private key because he doesn't know ksecret (he knows only Q).Note: This explanation is simplified, it does not take care of symmetry and endomorphism optimizations but the idea is the same.You guys can reinvent the wheel or overcomplicate things all you want but this is the cheap effective solution. no complicated signature chains , no more trust in the other person or makers.just make a system based on split key generation. Anything else you can conjure up will be cost prohibitive or overthinking authoritative measures. It's been done before on physicals.

It works for the first owner of the collectible, but all future owners have to have complete trust that the two split key parties won't collude to steal the coin.Quote from: n0nce on January 22, 2023, 10:36:37 PMThe device could e.g. sign messages to show that the (correct) key is there. As well as signing transactions, of course, to spend the funds from that key.That's a neat solution. Until of course someone finds a vulnerability and tricks it in to signing a transaction when it isn't supposed to. Quote from: WhyFhy on January 22, 2023, 10:48:20 PMIt gives people a fighting chance to detect it rather than hundreds of people getting their life savings stolen at once.True, but it also gives a false sense of security. The creator of some split key collectible could quite easily generate both parts himself, and then pose as a third party seller who says they generated half the split key. Any downstream seller then falsely believes it needs collusion between two parties to steal their coins, when in reality they are at just as much risk as they are now.",

Sure; similar to any other hardware wallet (this would be a dumbed-down hardware wallet, in essence). But again, since those are sold dirt-cheap these days, even below the premium of these collectibles over their loaded value, it seems feasible. If they choose to use a smartcard chip, @tibu may have a business opportunity here.  Not vouching for the security of his devices, as I never assessed it or even tested one of those cards, but that just sprung to mind.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on January 23, 2023, 02:22:19 PMQuote from: WhyFhy on January 22, 2023, 10:48:20 PMIt gives people a fighting chance to detect it rather than hundreds of people getting their life savings stolen at once.True, but it also gives a false sense of security.

Any downstream seller then falsely believes it needs collusion between two parties to steal their coins, when in reality they are at just as much risk as they are now.He could also use this to impose a way higher premium (after-market prices..) or someone may just not be a daily Bitcointalk visitor. Collectibles as a general concept can be bought and stored for years or decades without 'checking on them' all the time. Imagine you're a big collector and suddenly you need to daily check that all the designers of all your Bitcoin collectibles are 'still trusted'. That can easily get out of hand.",

If they choose to use a smartcard chip, @tibu may have a business opportunity here. Difficult to say. A collectible producer obviously couldn't just take another company's tried and tested product and use it to start producing collectibles without risking running in to legal trouble. But if they instead had something specifically designed for them, then again it pushes the cost up and introduces a new device which has never been examined or tested by independent members of the community. I'm not sure the best solution to this which is both secure but also cheap.Quote from: n0nce on January 24, 2023, 12:23:35 AMImagine you're a big collector and suddenly you need to daily check that all the designers of all your Bitcoin collectibles are 'still trusted'. That can easily get out of hand.Absolutely. I'm not really the target market for such things, and I only have one or two such things that I picked up in person at various meets and merchants, but I would only ever self fund such a device.",

Until of course someone finds a vulnerability and tricks it in to signing a transaction when it isn't supposed to. I don't like to be the devil's advocate, however, a signed TX can be easily broadcasted anytime later. So no matter how smart the embedded device is, a previous owner can create and sign the transaction of spending the collectible's coins and... broadcast it years later. Or am I missing something?Because if I'm right it's no use to embed smarter and more expensive devices into collectibles, this kind of stealing problems can still happen.",
