      "body": "When you say you made an Electrum wallet, I'm guessing you connected it to your Trezor device?If so, then yes. You just need to save the 24 words phrase so if your device malfunctions, for example, you can always restore your wallet. There's no need for the wallet file.As for the receiving address, then you don't need to save it unless, you don't want to plug your device in each time you want to receive funds then in that case, making a watch-only wallet with your xPub would be a good idea.",

It’s better if you will just save your wallet address so that you can limit the access of your wallet for safety purposes. But you can always use new address every time you want to receive your Bitcoin for a better privacy of your holdings.Also, Make sure to make your trezor safe and don’t connect on untrusted website or computer that might give you risk for a possible phishing of your seed phrase. Nevertheless you are almost safe when using hardware wallet if you can protect properly your seedphrase. That’s what matter most.",

And there's no need to connect Trezor each time you receive Bitcoin when its more convenient to simply save the address instead. Well, at least that's what I am doing with my hardware wallet as I don't wanna go through hassle of getting it out of my secure place, then plugging it in etc every time I have to receive some Bitcoin. Another thing to think about is contingency plan in case something happens to you, so Bitcoin you have don't go to waste.",

      "body": "When you say you made an Electrum wallet, I hope that doesn't mean that your imported your Trezor seed into your Electrum wallet, does it? If you did that, you have basically taken all the security away that you would otherwise preserve if only your hardware wallet is used with your seed phrase. A Trezor can be connected and used successfully with Electrum without importing a seed.You don't need the Electrum's wallet file because you can't sign and broadcast any transactions without your Trezor connected. The transactions need to be signed with the corresponding private keys and those are only found on the HW. Electrum's wallet file doesn't have them, hence it isn't that important. You can still encrypt the wallet file making it inaccessible unless the Trezor wallet is also connected and unlocked. That would prevent someone loading Electrum, opening your wallet file in the client, and being able to see how many coins are in that wallet and derivation path.Quote from: Beparanf on December 04, 2022, 02:41:40 PMIt’s better if you will just save your wallet address so that you can limit the access of your wallet for safety purposes.

This additional protection in the form of an additional word/password should be unique and sufficiently complicated in terms of the number and type of characters to be resistant to brute force hacking. The passphrase protects the seed, but the unfixable extraction vulnerability doesn't just apply to the recovery phrase. It also applies to the PIN code that unlocks the device. A code can be saved on a microSD card that is required every time you want to unlock your hardware wallet. That provides extra protection for unlocking the Trezor T. Unfortunately, this mitigation option is not available for the old Trezor One, making the device less secure in case of physical hacks.",

Yeah, it's certainly not something that should concern the general community of Trezor One users. But if we combine that with a potential data leak in the future that every company with centralized servers can become a target of, then the information of who owns Trezor One hardware wallets coupled with info about where they live can prove to be quite valuable to some. Particularly to those who have knowledge about how to abuse it. Some people are going to say, you can always get subjected to a $5 wrench attack or get tortured to reveal the needed PINs and passwords. But keep in mind that not all groups might be willing to take it that far as to physically hurt or kill people. The consequences and punishments for stealing and breaking and entering are different than for hurting, breaking bones, and killing people.",

Like it or not, it is their responsibility to learn and manage their wallets if they want to be in control. If they are not comfortable with it, then their only option is to trust a third party to make sure their family can access their crypto in the future, which is probably not the best choice.With time, I think more and more people will get accustomed to it, just like people are familiar with 2FA or other layers of protection that currently exist. If you think about it, a password or 2FA can also be a problem for you if you forget or misplaced it, so the key is how to make sure you can access it in the future.",
