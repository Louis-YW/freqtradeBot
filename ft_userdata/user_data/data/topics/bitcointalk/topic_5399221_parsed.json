By that I mean that polls with such an extended period of time distort the results really, especially in an environment where the price for a BTC varied so much as shown above. Technically, it would be better to delimit the timeframe to a couple of weeks at most, and then, of course, people will state whatever they wish …Quote from: ajaxtempest on May 18, 2022, 04:56:30 PMNo need to reply here.

      "body": "The thing about conducting a survey, and looking at that data is it rarely is carried out correctly. It needs to be a fair test, which a lot ignore. For example, a survey being conducted for a number of years or even months on a volatile currency means you're going to get distorted results. It would be much better to run a monthly poll which is open for 30 days, the problem with that is you're unlikely to get enough people to vote to have any conclusive results, at least any that are worthwhile. I like the rule of at least 1000 people taking part, which mitigates natural variance, and you do get to see some sort of reliable trend. However, that does depend on the total pool available, for example if Bitcoin has 4 billion people using it, collecting information from a larger dataset than 1000, will always be beneficial. As you increase the dataset, as long as it's relatively randomly selected people participating, you should start to see more reliable data. You'll always have people submitting fake data, and that's the point of larger datasets to try, and also prevent that along with other things. However, running a survey over a few years on a volatile currency like Bitcoin, doesn't make much sense.",
