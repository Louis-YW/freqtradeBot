  "content": "These few days have been quite challenging because of the various limitations I had to surmount for me to be able to learn from and also enjoy this forum. I have had comments from friends and families in developing nations concerning these challenges and their response was that most of the challenges we face in emerging nations are non-exiting there. Hence, I wish to itemize some of the challenges I have personally faced being a member of this forum because of my location. And I would gladly ask members to give suggestions on how I can limit these challenges. -   Epileptic power supply: In my location there is electric power but its supply is unpredictable. Sometimes the power supply is rationed but there is no guarantee that you would have power even when it is your turn. The most annoying part of it is that sometimes you would be disconnected from the source because these corrupt power company officials want to exploit money from you. There are commercial phone charging businesses but charging a laptop there might be risky. Generators and fuel are expensive and very dangerous to use. The carbon monoxide emission from generators has killed many families in my location. Solar energy might be cool but are there other options? -   Poor Internet Supply: Sometimes due to work and family responsibilities, I use to prepare a work plan for the day. But it becomes very frustrating that when it is time to login into Bitcoin talk and learn and make a few contributions, there would be no internet connections. And the telecommunication company doesn’t give a damn about their poor service because no agency would hold them responsible for their poor services. Some of us still use the 3G network which is very slow and time-consuming. It’s so discouraging when you waste so much time waiting for a very slow network to respond. Carrying out research or findings takes a whole lot of time due to the slow internet. -   High Crime Rate: Most developing nations are ravaged by a high rate of crime and insecurity. Like in my locality there is a high rate of snatching of phones and other technological gadgets. Sometimes members in developing nations lose their phones and other gadget making them not active in the forum until they get a replacement. There are sometimes insufficient manpower and technology to fight crime in these countries.-   Unexposed and corrupt law enforcement agencies: Most of the police officials we have in my area are not aware of the happening in the Bitcoin space. They are not well informed or aware that an individual can get a moderate income from Bitcoin. Immediately they see a crypto wallet in your phone, they would assume that you are an internet fraudster. Hence, sometimes they use it as an opportunity to intimidate and extort money from Bitcoiners.-   High Rate of Unemployment: I have observed that the majority of members from developed nations have other sources of income apart from the forum. They can be able to afford the cost of data and other necessary gadgets that would make them very productive to the forum. But in most developing nation’s majority of the population are either unemployed or underemployed. Sometimes members of these growing economies might not have the financial backing to even subscribe to a data plan making them less productive. What are your thoughts?UpdatedSome Solutions to these problems.Some of the solutions are derived from the responses I got from this thread. I don't claim ownership of most of the uncommon solutions to the problem. QuoteEpileptic power supply: Unstable power supply can be tackled by seeking other sources of power such as good power banks that have a larger capacity, solar systems, or portable cheap generators. You should also ensure you buy phones with battery capacity as a priority. One can also charge phones in commercial businesses that offer phone or device charging services but you must ensure that the phone is protected. Don’t also focus on the number of posts you make. Use the limited time you have electric power to create a few quality posts instead of focusing on quantity. Two or three meaningful and quality posts a day is far better than spamming.  Poor Internet Supply: Ensure you buy 4G phones and check for the internet provider that has a strong network in your area. Using the internet when few people are using it might improve the quality of supply. Maybe late at night or early hours of the morning might be better. I have personally tried this solution and it is working perfectly. It can also be possible to pull resources together to buy satellite internet. Also seeking support from influential personalities such as Elon Musk would not be a bad idea (you will never know until you try). The community can write to him asking him to donate one of his devices for satellite internet for your community. The good news is that Starlink service would soon be available to some developing nations.High Crime Rate: Ensure you don’t use your phone in public places and always ensure that you keep it in a safe place. If possible you can get a smaller or cheaper phone that can be used to make and receive calls, while the other expensive or advanced phones that are used to access the forum can be left at home. Be cautious of your environment and if you must keep a late night, do it without your phone. It is also very important not to publicize your income or investment in Bitcoin. It is better to keep a low profile.Unexposed and corrupt law enforcement agencies: Create a private space in your phones and hide your wallets and other bitcoin-related applications. Ensure you don’t dress, behave, stay or hang out with internet fraudsters. It would not be a bad idea to start a bitcoin community in your locality and if possible the community can be registered and have identity cards. Public enlightenment about bitcoin would be able to expose these law enforcement agents to the operations of the bitcoin space.Although it might not be risky, report every attempt at blackmail and criminal acts, regardless of whether it comes from the police. Some law enforcement agents are trustworthy and not corrupt. The law court can also be impartial if a case of intimidation, exploitation, and abuse by law enforcement agencies is brought before it. Like in the case of Linus Williams Ifejika, aka Blord , that floored the Nigerian anti-corruption agency in court.  Don’t sell your votes, only vote for the right candidate during elections.High Rate of Unemployment: Seek other means of income. You can get a degree or a skill that can assist you in getting a job or becoming self-employed. Joining a signature campaign might be helpful financially. But it would be better to see the forum as a place of learning than a place of financial returns.",

      "body": "I only use a phone with bitcointalk while living in a fairly wealthy country just because it's easier to access and when people message me about topics, my messaging apps are on my phone so it makes sense to use bitcointalk from there a lot. Phones should generally be one of the cheapest things to charge too (they don't use much mains electric). You could also look for a portable charger if you can afford it (but one that holds a few phone charges). Is Internet continously unstable too? Is there no chance it improves in the late eaceninga early mornings if you could try doing things then (there's a chance it's worse at that time too though as fewer people might notice).You've not said why you're using bitcoin in public to attract the attention of enforcement teams, maybe you should stop using something quite so explicit around them if you can.The underemployment/unemployment is a hard one to solve though, you could try to grow here and start something (even just joining a signature campaign after you've ranked up a bit) but it might be better to see how others have managed to find things near you and if there are any avenues of well paid work you could look at (you haven't said what the average livable salary is there though)?I sense this topic is short of responses because of its length, you might want to try to write a bit less next time or make two or three topics to cover everything instead of the one.",

I have the same trouble either, even though in your case it sounds more intense. You should have a computer at home, so that if you get stolen, you can still access your bitcoin. Unless of course the thief knows you're a Bitcoin owner, and asks you to unlock the wallet. In that case, you're screwed; that's why you need mobile privacy. For example, I don't have any bitcoin application on my android, but I can normally spend bitcoin (using RTL via Tor).",

It's essentially another login on your android device but it looks like your normal phone (I think Apple has something similar too but I'm not sure). The difference between accessing your main space and private space is putting in a different pin. You can find your private space from your main space but no the other way round (and there's probably ways to hide it showing up on either too). Sometimes I find it quite handy for keeping apps in different places on my phone and use it for that - it's fast to load both areas but you can only use a fingerprint on the main one I think and there may be a second's delay while it loads up the other space (but if you've unlocked both in advance then the delay goes).",

      "body": "Just a few additions to consider before buying a powerbank. Take note of the Powers Bank's power output, their ports, and its battery capacity preferably the mAh recommendation by others. You should at the very least be aware of the power output of your laptop's charger because they vary in output depending on the type of laptop they supply power for. A typical office laptop needs between 40 and 60 watts, whereas most of gaming laptop uses around 230 watts overall. While it is technically feasible to charge your laptop with a lower power output, the longer charging time would be your issue. Your laptop will take longer to charge if the power bank has a lower wattage.As for the ports, they usually come with adapters that allows you to plug your laptop's own charger into the power bank. Plus, there shouldn't be much of a problem because, as far as I'm aware, new power banks supported USB type-C connectors (if you have one).Quote from: Die_empty on September 11, 2022, 01:16:18 PMHigh Crime Rate:..there is a high rate of snatching of phones and other technological gadgets....The best course of action, in my opinion, is to refrain from using your phone at all, especially in places with lots of people, like wet markets.

They are not well informed or aware that an individual can get a moderate income from Bitcoin. Immediately they see a crypto wallet in your phone, they would assume that you are an internet fraudster. Hence, sometimes they use it as an opportunity to intimidate and extort money from Bitcoiners.These are extremely genuine problems that can only be properly understood by people who have really experienced them. The fact that the majority of law enforcement personnel lack professionalism scares the very daylights out of me. Despite the rule stating police officers are not allowed to search people's phones, every young person in Nigeria is aware that it is unwise to debate with police officers over this. Those that did this did not survive to tell the tale. Here are some things I do to keep from standing out: I clean-shave, I dress nicely, I don't stay up late, and when I do, I leave my phone, which includes my Bitcoin app, at home. Finally, I make an effort to get to know some significant figures in the community since they may be needed if everything else fails.",
