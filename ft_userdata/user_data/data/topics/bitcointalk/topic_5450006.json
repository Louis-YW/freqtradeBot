  "content": "What happened: Sportsbet.io seized the funds on winnings on legally played account Scammers Profile Link: sportsbet.io Hi bitcointalk.Due to my country's gambling regulations I started good and reputable betting site search. Upon conversation with my friend I found that SPORTSBET is A+ betting office and after a short conversation my friend told me that nothing to worry about on that siteâ€™s payments. I opened an account depositÂ  at start , started betting , my luck turn over and I made some profits.Â  I continue betting with major leagues . Basketball eurocup , handball champions league , handball Europe cup. After some point I try to withdraw my funds. they said on support nothing to worry , first withdraw require a verification . I do everything they require on time . I send my selfie , ID , and selfie again.Â  After that verification , they want verification from me and after than thatÂ  they accuse me of multi account betting and want return my deposits( not WINNINGS )and close my account.What is the point of making bets when you only get your deposit back ? Is that fair way to approach a customer ? I am completely honest with them at start and they donâ€™t even bother to contact me .I have proof of every bet. I have proof of every conversation. Adding this to my topic .They simply do not want to pay my legitimate bets.They accuse me multi accounting and this is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of . Hope bitcointalk can help me to solve my situation .Many thanks Information: For their consideration I made depositsÂ  100 USDT for tryingÂ  , 250-300 USDT , then 1000 USDTmy sportsbet.io ID. : hakan1987my sportsbet.io mail adress : ha*****an@gmail.com ( I dont write my email completely )Payment Method:Â  USDT ( trc20 ) Proofs of the bets: https://i.hizliresim.com/l5771vn.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/eipbwhf.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/jcsgrgh.JPGAs you see on screenshots , eurocup men , handball champions league bets. Some won some lost. Live and prematch bets on halftime . When I won the bet they refuse to pay. When lost they took my winnings.",

Bookmakers like that one make a lot of money without needing to make up accusations against their customers.At least they want to refund your deposit.",

If you're sure you did nothing wrong and only have one account, might be what logfiles said above is one of the reason and it's a misunderstanding... and by misunderstanding I mean between you and your friend or family.Anyway, I'll recite the deep magic and summon sportsbet.io here so they can give us a better insight from their situation.Quote from: acroman08 on April 24, 2023, 03:24:13 PM[...]anyway, you can try and post on their ANN thread (ðŸš€-Sportsbet.io-ðŸš€ - Main sponsor of Southampton FC ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹)with a link to this thread, you might get a more detailed answer from them.I've did one better, see above.

As I seen on my answers to your support , I completely honestly give answer on my email . After people's answer's I checked the situation and my answers are below.- I use VPN service called 1.1.1.1 ( as can be found on appstore) to access site , the reason for this our government ban the betting sites so I should require VPN to access betting sites.- Did your friend make the same bets as you?Impossible , I made my bets according to my bet knowledge and I dont think anybody can be played like that. My friend never bets on basketball or handball , you can check every bet or everything about this . I also called and ask my friend about this too.- Do you have any close family member or friend who is also a user of Sportbet.io, and you share the same Wi-Fi network?I use sportsbet.io via my mobile phone , so this is not a probablity. Not living with my family, have gym club and home and both has wifi but I generally use Wifi- Is there any chance you used a VPN service when registering to the casinoYes I also registered with VPN- Did you register the account using the same device the friend who advised you used before to access sportsbet.io?This is highly unlikely but possible . I bought phone from the same guy who advised the site to me . But this is long time ago. This guy usually go abroad , as some may know in my country phones can be bought grey market or via apple , but due tax many people buy phones and get phones from their relatives or friends from abroad.Â I don't think this is a crime. I send my funds to him via bank transfer and also have proof of that .Â I will share this if required via DM to steve ( bank documents show adress and telephone info) - I am owner of known gym club in my country , people come and go for some job interviews ( in my country some interviews require physical tests before , so the guy who recommended me the site working for policemen interview ) I know him because of that reason.Adding the conversation via sportsbet.io https://i.hizliresim.com/6g3s7qy.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/cqy8brw.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/1hchwzb.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/4outnp0.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/n9n8h4j.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/qb6e0o4.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/541q9uk.JPGhttps://i.hizliresim.com/pvjic7h.JPG",

If what you described is as what I perceived, you buy products overseas without the box to avoid huge tax for the product, but the phone itself was never used before, it's still in a freshly new condition, just without the box.Quoting below for image partQuote from: hakan1987 on April 25, 2023, 01:38:56 PMAdding the conversation via sportsbet.io Edit: tidying up images",

I have seen 1.1.1.1 VPN service before, and it's a free service. The problem with most free VPN services is that abusers use them often, so eventually casinos like Sportsbet blacklist them and then next time you also register or visit the casino using the same VPN service or similar IP addresses, the system will automatically assume you are linked to other multiple accounts that used the same VPN to abuse the casinoYour intentions may have not been bad ones, but now the task is trying to prove to them that your account is not part of the multiple accounts.Before registering for a service, always ensure you read the terms of service to be sure if VPN use is prohibited or not. If you must use a VPN, try to use a good paid VPN service.@holydarkness could you please try reducing the size of the images for easier follow up so that one does not have to over scroll through huge image files.

I want to point out something. The T&C of most gambling companies detest the use of VPN because manipulation can easily be done with varying proxies. Then, there are some honest users whose countries prohibit from gambling online, if those users find a way to bypass their country's restrictions and find their ways to the gambling site. Should the casino treat them differently or they should be measured with the standard yardstick?I asked this because some casinos on knowing that your country prohibits gambling and you hide your ip to access their site, that automates them to confiscate both your deposit and winnings.",
