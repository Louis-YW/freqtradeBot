But what Craig is trying to do is to steal the ownership of the code, and if that happens it would be terrible for the code and for the community. As the owner of the main code, he would try to issue anyone involved in the development... Exchanges and other services will have to pay for using the word Bitcoin, and it will be madness. Just to be clear, he is not Satoshi, he is just trying to steal the ownership of Bitcoin to fuck up the project and the community.",

It's open source,  he wouldn't be stupid to destroy one of the attraction of Bitcoin and do you think the Government would allow such power in a single man?  Quote from: The Cryptovator on February 10, 2024, 08:47:35 PMHe might be arrested, and Bitcoin would collapse.

How can Bitcoin collapse if satoshi is arrested? Bitcoin is doing well without his presenceThe news would affect the price for sometime but it would recover and move on.satoshi can't fully influence it, If there is no acceptance to the changes in this source code it would end up like a fork. Bitcoin can only be centralized if 51% of hashpower is with a single body.  If satoshi want to centralized Bitcoin it most be accepted by this said percent and I doubt the community would. Imo So Satoshi appearance doesn't really have any significant effect on Bitcoin.",

Satoshi might reveal himself someday but I do not think it will happen anytime soon especially he has gone this long without revealing his true identity.Craig Wright has manipulated documents to appear as if he is Satoshi but he is simply inconsistent with his lies that I am sure the court will see right through him.To be honest, I think if Satoshi were to ever reveal himself, it might have a positive impact on the market itself. Since the founder is known, most people might put their trust into bitcoin more hence the increase in price. Satoshi’s identity is a mystery and it will stay that way for many years to come.",

It's pretty simple: the community would be broken when Satoshi arrest for some reasons. As a result, Bitcoin would collapse. I am not saying it will vanish, but that will impact Bitcoin massively. Let's say Satoshi just revealed himself and will not be arrested. Then he can influence Bitcoin directly. Imagine that Elon isn't Doge's creator, but he can influence Doge. So Satoshi is more powerful than Elon. It will definitely impact Bitcoin based on the Satoshi Movement.",

In all of Mr Wright's ramblings, I have never quite found him provide straightforward answers to direct questions thrown at him, such as why not move the original BTC to show he owns the earliest tokens. At least if he is able to move less than a dollar from the Satoshi wallet to prove he has control of it we may just them likely start to believe that he is possibly, the true founder. The things he states also don’t jive with the founding white paper in tone or ideology.  This man is just a narcissistic con man.",

I'm sure many people will take advantage of that and might bother the creators and founders, especially the government. I'm sure they will take legal action in order to take down bitcoin. That's how they will find their way to control bitcoin. So being anonymous and mysterious is the good thing that the creators and founder of bitcoin did, and it also serves as their security so they can still live peacefully. Yes, you can be popular if you decide to be known, but will you exchange your freedom and peaceful life just for popularity?

This don't really affect Bitcoin although it can put pressure on anything that has any traces of centralization.

It wouldn't change anything at all. It would just quench our curiosity about his identity and will answer a lot of our questions.
