Do you own those guides?Most of the guides and docs can be downloaded for free from their support.Not sure where you got the \"selling\" part from, looking at the website all the diagrams and materials are downloadable for free, they probably offer paid consultation of some sort which of course makes sense, they can't be doing that for free, whether they are legit or not is something I don't know, but I checked the website and the materials are free.With that said, the claim of being able to fix your miner is just absurd, all those pinouts and diagrams need someone who knows a lot about electronics and has previous experience fixing other circuit boards, someone with no background of that type will never be able to make use of all the info.",
