  "content": "O.B.O.L. [Open Bearer Onion Ledger]Abstract:The whole purpose of such device - a universal hot & cold hardware Bitcoin wallet - is to remove the necessity of phones and other devices, also making it suitable for every day use. If Bitcoin is going to succeed as a form of free money, it’s imperative to detach it from our tracking devices, and hopefully with some future Core updates - make it private and secure against quantum AI’s. Exactly what the free human race would need, to sustain their financial freedom for generations to come.Features:Uses the on-chain Bitcoin network to transact, as well as any second layer solution [lightning network], or any side chain solution [if ever] for micro transactions - the Core approves.It’s round and wearable, but not limited to. Personally I conceive it round, and worn on the wrist, pretty much like a watch - much how the modern digital version of obol [Bitcoin] money should look.It has a display screen, a camera, two confirmation buttons on either side [left-right], a charging port for its battery, a SIM slot [at the bottom] combined with a small switch which turns the antenna on and off - manually - for any internet or local connection. On the upper and lower side of the OBOL, are the charging port and antenna [and power] switch respectively.It has its own [open source] firmware, as well as an open source software, to control it and set its limits for daily use. When connected and put in use, it routes all the traffic through Tor, which is embedded to the device. No Tor, no transaction. Tor over VPN, can also be an option.Bitcoin only, there is no need for it to handle any other inferior coins. Bitcoin is freedom, all others are not.Compatibility with the current banking system via its software as an option[?]. This feature will be removed once the banking cartel has crashed, and all that remains is Bitcoin.I seek no personal benefit from this idea or the device itself, should it’s ever build and circulated, rather I find it extremely important that it just gets out there, by the people - and for the people. I cannot code, nor have the financial ability to pursue it myself, nor want to, to be honest. All I have and want to share in this thread, is my vision of the device. My technical back-round is very limited in understanding of how this device can come into fruition, yet, I’d be more than happy to discuss it here.Just my three sats. Thanks.",

If the device 'got hot' / online once, it has to be considered 'compromised' permanently (i.e. stolen seed) in the security model in which hardware wallets are interesting (because anything connecting to internet can get - and is thus considered - infected).So it could be a 2-part device with a 'Bitcoin smartwatch' and a separate hardware wallet that you wear on the other wrist or something. I do think this sounds quite cumbersome, though. I'd prefer a privacy-focused smartphone / PDA and a hardware wallet.

Your idea (the parts of it that are possible) could be built on this platform.

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 06, 2023, 09:47:58 AMHow does this device could be both hot and cold wallet at same time?I’m thinking that it needs to have more than one seed [hot-cold]. Perhaps multisig is also an option.Furthermore, we are talking about a time that Bitcoin has resolved its privacy issues and is quantum resistant proof.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 06, 2023, 09:47:58 AMHow will this device handle VPN or Tor blockade? Tor is the important part and embedded to the device, VPN is merely an option.That said, it has the handling software on the other end, for all such beauties.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 06, 2023, 09:47:58 AMDoes user need to change VPN/Tor configuration manually?VPN - if desired - obviously yes, Tor no.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMHowever, it's rather an individual's responsibility to remain private. This is the problem. How can the average Joe be trained to remain private?For most this is an impossible task - just consider the elderly, or people not technically versed.Bitcoin should be for everyone.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMAlso, people use smartphones all the time nowadays. The comfort is just too good. Aye. Again, that IS the problem.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMMaybe tracking is inevitable for the masses, which is the audience I presume you refer to.I’m hoping we can change that, yes.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMAnd you find it pretty wise to walk around with a wallet as a watch?Do you find it wise to walk around with a wallet full of cash?The answer is yes, that’s why you set limits via its software - in the example that someone tries to rob you.You would give up your daily limits, as you would give up the cash on you.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMThat requires from each bank to develop an app for that specific OS (as I assume it will have its own). I don't see any incentive from the banks' perspective.Good point. That’s why it has a question mark on the last feature.It doesn’t need to be compatible with the banks, in fact I would prefer that it isn’t.But in order to make it handy - at the beginning - banks should be allowed to follow the Bitcoin lead. Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 06, 2023, 11:09:17 AMNFC works more than well.As a protocol - sure does. I’m still divided on this tbh.Quote from: NotATether on January 06, 2023, 11:17:34 AMMaking it a wearable implies putting it on some sort of smartwatch which is not much better in terms of privacy than using your phone or PC.Emm, no. The whole thing needs to be as dumbed down as possible and very simple to use. Nothing “smart” about it.The battery, antenna and SIM, will need to be detached completely when not in use. Perhaps including a Faraday enclosure on the device too.Quote from: NotATether on January 06, 2023, 11:17:34 AMWhy not just use the conventional card for storage? Except instead of being connected to VISA or Mastercard, it's connected to this kind of ledger?As I already said, compatibility with the banking system is an option, and the more we discuss it - the more I drift away.Quote from: n0nce on January 07, 2023, 12:44:26 AMBasically a dumbed-down smartwatch with hardware privacy features (like turning off any antennas physically) and only very specific apps installed. That's possible.Yup.Quote from: n0nce on January 07, 2023, 12:44:26 AMWhat's not possible is having a cold and hot wallet in one device at the same time. Just because you can turn off wireless, doesn't mean it suddenly 'gets cold'. If the device 'got hot' / online once, it has to be considered 'compromised' permanently (i.e. stolen seed) in the security model in which hardware wallets are interesting (because anything connecting to internet can get - and is thus considered - infected).I think I’ve answered this above.Quote from: n0nce on January 07, 2023, 12:44:26 AMSo it could be a 2-part device with a 'Bitcoin smartwatch' and a separate hardware wallet that you wear on the other wrist or something.I dislike the term “smart”. Why two part though - one OBOL device and its controlling software - on another device [laptop, tablet].Quote from: n0nce on January 07, 2023, 12:44:26 AMI do think this sounds quite cumbersome, though. It needs to be elegant, but yes, I’m not aware how you can fit all the features in such a small device.

Perhaps you can do the same with OBOL, and instead of having it as a watch, you can put it in your pocket too.
