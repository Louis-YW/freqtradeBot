Also there is question of quality of miner and how long will it last. Most expensive miner would be the one which stops working after couple of months.Any suggestions?",

You can also wait for the next wave about t19 in Bitmain which offers a cheap price. Also, use this tool to find those units with possible big profitability just change your electricity rate to 0- https://www.asicminervalue.com/efficiency/sha-256",

For example, s9 series was indestructible but s9k was awful, also s17 series had a bad rep. Are there any models/series of miners  nowadays that have a high failure rate and should be avoided?You already mention what are those units with bad reputations and actually, most of the high failure rates are s17 and t17 series mostly loose heatsink and short circuit are the reasons why they get high failure rates.I think fewer failure rates are s19 but I can't confirm because Bitmain produces s17/t17 more than the s19 series.",

Most expensive miner would be the one which stops working after couple of months.Any suggestions?I would direct you to shop.canaan.ioThey have a large choice of new gear.It is already in the USA.It has a 360 day warranty.The a1166 which I own is about 1388 usd and does 81thIt is likely a good choice for your needs.I do not get a commission from them for linking it to you.https://shop.canaan.io/products/avalon-miner-a1166-pro-81t-3400w?VariantsId=100123400 watts and 81th. about 42watts efficiency. cost of 1388 plus shipping.I will mention canaan and I may do an affiliate deal in the future but we are yet to do it.I would likely set it up with my business account a1 hashrate llc2022https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3482040. yet to do that.right now we are redesigning our Clifton NJ  mine I have a lot of gear offline at the moment.",

If you see those miners on the marketplace they are used units Bitmain is no longer producing old units like s17/t17. If you found them on the marketplace those are not brandnew and some of them are not 100% working. There are many reasons why people still buy them he might be a newbie, cheap or to learn about mining or maybe they know how to repair them and make a profit.",

Its just that i have not owned anything aside from bitmain gear so wasnt sure about longevity of other miners from other companies. If miner lasts at least a year i will be in profit, ofc ideally it should last 2.5 years in average. Also i dont have to sell what i mined, i can wait for years untill the right price. Also it would be good if spare parts were easy to obtain in case something needs to be replaced.  Only other thing i have to consider is a crazy diff increase.Avalons seem to be the cheapest atm so i guess they would be a good pick. Only problem is im from Europe so a unit of a1166 81th that is priced atm 1337$ will cost me close to 2100$ after shipping and vat.",
