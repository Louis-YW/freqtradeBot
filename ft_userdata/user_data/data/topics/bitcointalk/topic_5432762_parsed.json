I work at Upbarak and my service provider gives 60% payment to my account before the work has been done. I never see volatility causing a problem with them.If you have random daily payments I don't think volatility is a big issue. Because in the case of BTC there are usually no such big dumps on a daily basis that you have to count a lot of losses. Another thing is, you can keep your funds in a stablecoin and convert it to BTC on payment day, reducing your risk.",

As a result, money is circulating. In that case, I believe you should maintain your business profits in crypto since it is volatile. As a result, you are not losing money on your initial investment. Your business will be unaffected if the cryptocurrency market falls. So, yes, you can accept cryptocurrency payments in this manner. The rest is up to you.",

But you must consider making your price change in DCA so that even if the price of Bitcoin dropped it won't affect your payment amount since you are charging per dollar cost but receiving payment in bitcoin. And also you should try not to hold your bitcoin for the long term since bitcoin is highly volatile and it price can drop or raise at regular intervals. This way you will have some hedge against volatility.",

Adopting bitcoin or crytpo can actually make you double your profit if you are able to hold onto it for a certain amount of time. But it will also cost you over time if you don't have the extra budget to finance the business. Anyway you don't need to hold your bitcoin or crypto after receiving payment, I mean you can instantly convert them to fiat in just a few moments but it just depends on what your adoption goals are.I think crypto payment options will be more and more popular in the future and the demand for these payment options will increase. Your first step might be to adopt it now rather than waiting any longer, it will put your business ahead of others in terms of payment options.",

Accepting bitcoin in your business will boost and maximize your future profits. Just don’t be bother with its current value and instead, accumulate more of it. Surely, you will gain huge amount of profits when time comes that bitcoin value will hit its new all time high, but that will only happen if you are highly determined to consider bitcoin as your long term investments. As bitcoin is best for long term investment more than any other cryptocurrency.",

But now if I look at cryptocurrencies it comes with high volatility, and I have doubts whether accepting Bitcoin will be profitable for my business. So lets ignore the volatility of the market and consider the positive impact accepting Bitcoin as an addition means for payment will bring to your business. Firstly you'll be attracting a new market audiences that are crypto minded which brings about more sales for your product and increase the revenue that you're generating on your page.You aren't investing so you shouldn't be that concerned about the volatility of Bitcoin, you're running a business as such your capital should always be your number one priority then next to the profits therefore you can always trade the Bitcoin received to stablecoin or fiats. This can be done automatically through some service providers or you do it personally immediately you receive the coins. What I think you should be most concerned about is if Facebook permit the accepting of Bitcoin as a means of payment (assuming you're doing it officially on the site) so as to prevent them shutting your page down and you losing all your customer as a result.",

If he is worried about volatility but still want to accept crypto, maybe he can go for stable coins. The volatility in btc is still here and won't go away anytime soon, so he should really consider his options on this move.If he doesn't want to lose but still want to accept btc, he can always convert this to his fiat once received but it would be a tedious work for him.The OP needs to contemplate on why he is doing this move, is it just because he wants to be in and say to his customers that he is accepting btc or does he believe in btc as a good alternative in payment method that he can offer to his clients?",
