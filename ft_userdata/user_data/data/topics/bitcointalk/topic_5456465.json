  "content": "Hey everyone, as the title describes I'm looking for something like vanitygen that generates not only the private key but also a seed of 12, or 24 words length if necessary also with passphrase.Important is also that everything runs with a Nvidia RTX 3XXX / 4XXX and creates multiple formats, BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE...I had found something on Github which is already very nice with GUI:https://github.com/adrijano/Bitcoin-wallet-crackerEven if it is actually a Bitcoin cracker, something like this is also suitable for generating wallets and the pattern like \"1Love\" can be found via search.If you can write the whole thing automatically into a file or directly as CSV with columns, that would be perfect.Maybe there is already something in the direction, a GUI is nice but not necessarily necessary, the seeds and passphrase I find more important.",

      "body": "I think what you are trying to find is something like vanitygen, except that it searches mnemonics instead of private keys. More specifically, you want something that will generate a mnemonic phrase such one of the first addresses in the derivation path matches the pattern, given an optional passphrase, a derivation path and a pattern.",
