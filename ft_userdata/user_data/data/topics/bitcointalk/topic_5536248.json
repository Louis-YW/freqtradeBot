  "content": "This is a British Hodl slogan, which I think is both funny and quite true.It especially refers to countries with high GDP, if you live in USA or UK, don't think that holding 0,01 BTC will make you very rich in the future. Today a whole bitcoin already costs more than the average annual salary. So, for the first part, getting to 1 bitcoin may be difficult but I believe it's a good goal. The one I like the most is the second part: you buy bitcoin, hold it and shut the fuck up. If the price goes down, if rates go up, if the economy, if blah blah blah blah, you keep accumulating bitcoin and shut the fuck up. The third has been proven true for the past 16 years, and all indications are that it will continue to be true.I believe that if you follow the first two hints, the third statement will be true. What do you think?",

Which is what makes it a necessity for those who can afford buying 1bitcoin today to stop hesitating because if you look at the price history of bitcoin from Inception anyone would agree that the price we have today would be double or more in the next two decades in the future, something fiat can't do because it uas no scarcity or limit for print.For those of us who can't afford having 1btc we just keep accumulating and building our portfolio with what our annual salary can make do.and shut the fuck up",

It's not my only thing, I mix it up a bit, but bitcoin's definitely a big piece of the puzzle for me. Patience is the name of the game here.",

Compared to my friends who have better lifestyle.What are your plans? To continue your lifestyle and hold 1 Bitcoin maybe till it reaches 1 million dollar? I think that (it's just my opinion) it's not a good idea to hold 1 Bitcoin if your lifestyle is still the same like working 9-5 job and having a frugal lifestyle. It might be a good idea to convert that Bitcoin to cash and start a business like become an influencer if you can or open a small bakery or something like that. This way, you'll create a business that will generate more money than your job does or you'll also work your job and get additional income from your small business. This way, you'll easily collect 1 Bitcoin again (and more than that) and you'll have more financial freedom than before.",

Today a whole bitcoin already costs more than the average annual salary. 0,01 BTC and its cost is small with people in developed and high income countries but with people who are living in developing countries, third world, and have low income, it's too much and perhaps big capital with them.Get richer, in my opinion is with ROI, and you will get same ROI by investing in either 0,01 BTC or 1 BTC. The profit in $ would be different by differences in initial capitals but ROIs are the same.With poor people, they will still get richer by investing in 0,01 BTC because it is big initial investment capital with them, so profit from it would be big with them too.",

Rich yeah I can see it, but I doubt the \"incredibly\" part  That depends on the returns you believe you can get with Bitcoin. If you go with Saylor’s bull case, that’s $50M per bitcoin; the base case is $13M. It won’t be enough to buy you an island, a private jet, and a yacht, but in any developed country, with over $10M in net worth, you’ll be in the top 1%.",
