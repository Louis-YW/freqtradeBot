I'm more looking for where to discuss things like this.Well, for starters you can request to move your thread[1] to the dedicated section of the forum[2] where discussion about the Armory wallet happens (the official Armory website[3] in their Support page also takes you to that specific forum). Additionally you can also try to contact the developers over their IRC channel on Freenode: #bitcoin-armory. If you don't have an IRC client installed you can just use a web client[4] to try to talk with someone that may had a problem similar to yours.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5265053.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=97.0[3] https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/contact/[4] https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-armory",
