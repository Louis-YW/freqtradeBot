Theres something this kennth okonkwo(, the former LP presidential spokes person) in his statement, he said Quotethat INEC never release an original copy of the total 176 thousand poling unit of the 2023 presidential election. this already shows all what they are hiding. the whole Nigeria system is corrupt even the judges who are supposed to act as head to the country have been blind folded by corruption. I wonder how the country will be with Tinibu as president in the next 4year that's if he agrees to leave or stay for another 4 year.Here's a recap of how things has gone in the last 3 month since he resumes office, Removal of fuel subsidy which was said to help government save 1 trillion monthly and later resulting to high cost of petrol in the country.Approval of student loan, which has actually made pubic and state university to increase school fees and now, school fees all over Nigeria university is has gone above what a common man can afford.More hardship in the economy with price of food tremendously increasing everyday Signed 2023 Electricity Bill into Law which every state are now required to provide electricity for it's members. this increase in the electricity tariff again even when theres no steady light in Nigeria.we are supposed to experience a change in every new government that comes in play. but in Nigeria every new government comes with new ideas that further increase the hardship of the common man. they no longer care if what they do affects the public because there's no one to stop them. We can only hope on God now, if not Nigeria has gone  state of no repair. let's hope and wait for the 4 year of Tinibu jagaba to see where it all leads.

Nigeria system of leadership is corrupt and one of the problem of this country is judiciary. obi going to court for me was a wast of time and money. because I know very well that , going to court will yield no fruit. because money have covered the mouth of our judges and they can not say the truth anymore.people I was looking at to help poor Nigerians was (NLC ) Nigeria labour congress. NLC are the hope of  common Nigerians now,. but if NLC should make a mistake not to stand on the poor Nigerians,  it means that, this country will suffer in the next 8 years..but sometimes I begin to ask, if we should take the law on our hands and get it right one's in this country. or we wait, suffer and watch this people.",

Even if Atiku or Peter Obi won the election, Nigeria is still corrupt. If the knowledge Nigeria politicians diverted to corruption is diverted to improving economy, Nigeria would be a better country by now.

For this year own, people wey talk say dem no gree been go court for redress and as them go court, court ask them say make dem provide evidences wey nullify the election or wey go concretize their claims. As Peter Obi and Atiku of LP and PDP, respectively, take provide them case and evidences, court talk say e no dey enough argument to change its stance. So dem squash them. And now dem don forward am go appeal. Na the essence of democracy be that. If no be anarchy you wan do, e dey normal and needful make dem do this tribunal, regardless.",

We just get different choice of leaders for different reasons wey dey known to us but wetin dey more important to us na to put the interest of the country at heart.

But I will not be surprised if the ending is also not as good just as the beginning.This is always the view of a typical Nigerian person, we always expect the worse, so that when it comes we don’t get shocked and surprised  about it. But I always put my hopes on a positive side even though it keeps showing that nothing is lighter at the end of the tunnel yet, we just keep believing and hoping things will change one time. People dey really go through a lot for this country, I just pray say things go better soon.",

Everyone would always feel injustice in the judiciary if victory was not on their favour.If the tribunal was not concluded, there wouldn't had been a room furthering the case to the supreme court by the oppositions of the  the elected ruling party (APC).Instead, it is necessary to ask if the judiciary of today is a sentimental body that has come to give judgements according to its personal interests or they still considers whom justice is due to?",

Let's be sincere with ourselves, our endurance is getting out of hand and we are adapting to low standard of life at the gain of those messing up public funds. We should not see people in tribunal as waste of time, it is a call to awaken the sleeping giant to take back their land for it to flourish. Even if we know the height of corruption in our country, it is high time individuals stand up to fight for the rebirth of our country and get things moving smoothly.

Please let's drop our own opinion on this.https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2023/07/04/assessing-president-tinubus-first-month-in-officeMy brother, the tribunal was very necessary. Ordinarily we understand that INEC has been bought by the powers that be, no doubt but it was necessary for us to challenge the sham of election that was conducted. I understand that people are disappointed by the declaration of tribunal judgement, but this are the huddle's we face as developing Democracy, we will get there eventually. If you read the history of American democracy, you will see that at some point in time, they faced what we are currently facing, but they continued as a people to persevere till they got it right . So it will take time for us to get it perfect to a large extent.What we need to do as a people is to continue to form a United force, just the way a lot of people did for Peter Obi during the last election. A formidable force against tyranny is what they are always afraid of, because they know that it will be a threat to their capitalism.",

His ruling for 8years go be on how em play em card well to bribe the INEC body to declare him winner for the given election. As Tinubu d so, em go rule us for 8 years and nothing d stop am so. We can only be praying to God make God keep us alive till the end of his 8 years tenure. Wetin be my concern till that time comes be sae, make more hardship no grow pass as em do so or make our economy no fall than expected as a dollar rate against naira go come reach 3k naira by that time.  As em d so, the judiciary don fail us woefully. They are now easily controlled by the government. They no d carry the matter of the masses for their head again.

Despite the irregularities that have swallowed our elections system, I still believe that election of a candidate needs to go through thorough scrutiny because if an election is conducted and a winner is being declared and the opponent feels that their were election malpractice and chose to go to tribunal it will make the candidate and the voters to be clarified on how the election process went about.Despite the fact that our elections processes are being compromised sometimes but going to contest the outcome in the tribunal can really justify the accuracy of the election process.",
