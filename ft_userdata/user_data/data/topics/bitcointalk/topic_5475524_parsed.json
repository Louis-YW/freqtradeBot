  "content": "IS there a list or can people post legit companies they have dealt with on this forum?I was looking to purchase from Shenzhen Jingang Zhuoyue Technology Co., Ltd. linked to ydminer.com , Maria email is fareast008@ydminer.com. searched names of company, reviews, crypto address lookup, etc....https://ydminer.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.9014153.0.0.4f093e5fqAHvZNThere are some good and bad reviews but not enough to green light my purchase. Says they been around 11yrs, seems to be a lack of reviews for doing business that long, and lack of any recent reviews.Anyone have history with this company?I dealt with a few or companies, but like to only deal with bigger companies apexto and letine, but letine sent me s 19 pro, instead of s19j pro, sales person just kept saying they would fix it some how but we couldnt agree on a resolution, so i just stopped using them.Thanks.",

If you're looking to buy GPUs, no reason to import them from China imho. If you're interested in ASIC mining equipment these days you can buy from BITMAIN directly as they have stock on site. You'll still have to pay customs if you buy from a Chinese reseller so I don't see the reason to take the risk.",

You SHOULD care because not all crypto coins are the same and they all have different value. Considering where you've posted, you should be looking for Bitcoin miners. Anything else is an altcoin aka crapcoin miner and questions about them belong in the altcoin areas, not here.That said, the only safe way to buy a miner is direct from the manufacturer or an Authorized reseller which will be listed on the manufacturers website - period.Any other source risks being scammed or at best not having a warranty because the reseller is not an authorized one.",
