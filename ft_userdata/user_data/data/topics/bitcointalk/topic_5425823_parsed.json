  "content": "The government of Nigeria is set to place bitcoin and other crypto currencies on taxation, come next year. This is part of the country's finance bill 2022 set to be approved. The country's finance minister Ahmed Zainab discussed that the taxation will help regulate digital assets and enhance e-commerce growth.Recall that the country's apex Bank placed a ban on transactions involving crypto currencies in February 2021. The ban lead to various other banks closing or freezing the accounts of people involved in crypto. The move lead to the current government falling out with the investors in the country.Moreover, the ban didn't stop its citizens from trading in bitcoin . This has most of the time been done through the P2P transactions on exchanges. The continuous obsession on crypto lead the incumbent vice president to the idea that the country will be better off regulating it rather than banning.April 2022 the country's security Exchange Commission pushed towards the move to its regulation, stating that a licenced virtual assets service provider must be secured any entity that wishes to run a crypto services within the country. The country has since witness the government leaning towards crypto currency. This has been shown by their partnership with Binance exchange in September this year. It has also offered scholarships to some selected citizens to study blockchain.My doubts over this recent moves are:1. Does this means the government is considering the adoption of bitcoin and other crypto currencies?2. How has the other countries placed on crypto taxation faired so far?3. Will its regulation helps speeds up its adoption by people within the country?Benjamindad. ComChannels TV",

Does this means the government is considering the adoption of bitcoin and other crypto currencies? May or May not be! This is a data gathering phase. Nigerian government wants to understand how many people uses cryptocurrency or what is the volume. Based on this data, they will forecast potential tax collection. If that amount excites the government, they will probably legally adopt it. Quote2. How has the other countries placed on crypto taxation faired so far?In my country, it is scaring off people due to 30% direct taxation rate without any opportunity for writing off the losses. Quote3. Will its regulation helps speeds up its adoption by people within the country?Depends on multiple factors! If the tax rate is low and there is a legal framework available, then it will help in adoption. Otherwise it will just scare people out of the market.",

ComIt is a very good move by the Nigerian Government but the objectives spelled out by the agency to adopt the digital currency is not favourable as for me or in my point of view. Nigerians government never and ever to create anything to provide jobs but for their personal gain. All those objectives are spelled out because of cryptocurrency then they are planning to heavily tax the bitcoiners that will be using their exchange platforms.then p2p will be the major transaction approach in the country.",

Does this means the government is considering the adoption of bitcoin and other crypto currencies?Possibly, They are viewing Bitcoin as potential source of profit through tax in the long term which means Nigerian government has high hope on Bitcoin that it will be boom soon that can be interpret as they are open for Bitcoin adoption in general. They will not gonna waste time to create a law for regulating it if they are not open about it.Quote from: Zaguru12 on December 05, 2022, 10:06:42 AM2. How has the other countries placed on crypto taxation faired so far?Other countries charge insane tax especially those who shows disapproval on the Bitcoin adoption but most of the country has a normal tax percentage on crypto. In my country, Bitcoin still doesn’t have tax because our government doesn’t care about its existence. Quote from: Zaguru12 on December 05, 2022, 10:06:42 AM3. Will its regulation helps speeds up its adoption by people within the country?Speeds up adoption? It depends on how the government will promote Bitcoin when they finally charge taxes. I’m sure people will avoid investing on Bitcoin if the government charge insane amount of tax like what happened on India.",

Just because crypto is not regulated by law it doesn't mean that the government can't force you to pay taxes on the profits you made, many have called for this, saying that the government doesn't care about coins and then wake up to find letters from the IRS equivalent, as the profit you make is still profit and profit is taxable everywhere.Quote from: Zaguru12 on December 05, 2022, 10:06:42 AM1. Does this means the government is considering the adoption of bitcoin and other crypto currencies?2. How has the other countries placed on crypto taxation faired so far?3. Will its regulation helps speeds up its adoption by people within the country?1. Tens of countries have established specific taxes on cryptocurrency gains yet are not moving an inch towards adoptions and have no plans on doing so.2. It depends from county to country, in the ones where people pay their taxes they pay taxes on crypto gains also, in the ones where tax avoidance is a way of life and the citizens split their time between work and figuring way how not to pay of course it's not working that great. So it's impossible to have the same effect in Nigeria and in the US for example.3. Nobody knows, n one extreme scenario it might actually drive a few to stop dealing with the moment the equivalent of the IRS there starts digging and inviting active traders to have a talk and take their money.The best thing is to ask yourself what are you going to do, are you going to declare all profits down to a penny and pay all the taxes or not?Ask a few friends and if the result is a unanimous NO, then this will of course have no effect whatsoever. And if the government sees that nobody pays, then it might restrict it even more.",

Taxing the product isn't the same as taxing the transaction. There's obviously VAT, but it's paid whether you use cash, credit, or bitcoin. It doesn't make sense to collect more taxes from one currency than another; the medium of exchange the customer will use to the merchant is none of the government's business, as long as they pay the corresponded products' taxes.",

This apart from the VAT on the product or service in question.This would be very cumbersome to control and would force people to carry some control software.Imagine how difficult it is to control by hand that you have a bitcoin bought at various prices and you go and pay for a coffee, the supermarket, a meal, the bus, etc. with Bitcoin. At each time you pay the price would be different. That is why many of us advocate the establishment of a minimum exemption, which at some point there has been talk that could be $200, below which there would be no legal obligation to report transactions, but I see it difficult, because when you buy a coffee you might not have to report it but the coffee shop does have to report each sale, and with the ever increasing collection eagerness of the various states I think it will come to nothing.",

But the states want you to declare every sale to charge you capital gains in their case. If instead of $16k you bought at $1k they will want to tax you for almost everything you spend. Just think that the EU is planning to treat all transactions with KYC, but whether they could if it is approved in the end is another matter. But I don't even know why I'm explaining this to you, since I think you know all about it. If what you are aiming at is an ideal world in which most transactions are done P2P and escape the state, as I think Satoshi conceived, I think that will never happen.

If you sell me something and I pay you in Bitcoin, there is no intermediary, but we must both legally declare the transaction.

It's trivial for a taxer who does a little analysis to figure out if you're evading VAT with cash transactions. But, I don't understand how he can figure out how many Bitcoin transactions you've done. How can he ensure you aren't lying to him? To put it this way: what can the government do if certain merchants decide to declare most (if not all) of their Bitcoin transactions as \"cash transactions\".",

In the perfect scenario of those people in the government, the e-Naira would have replaced Bitcoin completely in their country to the point nobody would use Bitcoin anymore, so they had no reason to tax transactions. They realize they are dealing with something they can't touch, as politicians.

Some of the shedy businesses they engage with banks will eventually stop people move to bitcoin. The devaluation of the local fiat against exchange currencies which is something bitcoin will address easily isn't preferred by some individuals in government since they benefit from it. Some people are also ill informed that it and thinks it will replace fiat. Which is very wrong.Although I will prefer its regulation than banning but how will the do it.Moreso I am quite delight that a country like Nigeria facing inflation or ending towards recession again is looking towards bitcoin.
