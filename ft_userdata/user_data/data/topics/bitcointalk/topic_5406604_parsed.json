Thank you.Politics is without doubt a dirty game, a game of tricks which indeed means you've got to be a very good lier to hide your motives while archiving the goals.Although there are certain times when the truth is let out and I'll quote Putin on one sad one;“I have decided to conduct a special military operation,”I guess this is one truth with all the chaos we have in Ukraine and the world today. The goal remains simple though, to protect the closest Ukrainian states and Russia from a regime!",
