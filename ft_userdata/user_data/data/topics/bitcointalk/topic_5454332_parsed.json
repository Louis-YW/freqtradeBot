The terrible reputations they're assigning to bitcoin are the least they can do to slow its adoption. Even crimes that were prevalent prior to bitcoin are now being attributed to it, which was not suppose to be so.

I think the quarrel will make Bitcoin very famous to the extent that both opponents will have no other option than to submit to Bitcoin. Allow the quarrel to continue since, in my opinion, it is only increasing the popularity of bitcoin and increasing public awareness of it. And as bitcoin enthusiasts, what we need to do is make it clear to people that bitcoin has nothing to do with the negative connotations that have been associated to it, and to tell them that it is also a reliable means to save money.",

Had bitcoin been a coin that its price could be manipulated by a central body the government will have accepted it. But its decentralization is a big problem to the government. The government will love to have control and also make changes to things on the network just like how the interest rate of banks are fluctuated by them, but with bitcoin you need consensus before implementing any proposal. As for banks it will definitely limit the charges they charge people using fiat like stamp duty and such if bitcoin is been used. Not to talk of unnecessary charges when trying to convert from one currency to another. So the only problem this two have with bitcoin is the fact that it can’t be tamed or controlled by them",

The government can't just approve and embrace Bitcoin with open hands because they are afraid of it. It's a trait of their financial system; it gives the citizens financial freedom and control over their wealth.The bank is afraid and will be racist toward Bitcoin because it is taking food from their table. If more people embrace Bitcoin and take away all their deposits from the banking sector, the banks won't have what to use for their lending services, what they can charge users for transaction fees, and every other means by which they are earning from their customers. If you are to be any of the aforementioned parties, will you gladly embrace what seems negative to your business?",

And they can't believe that a technology was thought out exceptionally well to be above their control; the regulation has been delaying for years, it pisses them off to see citizens escaping the taxes they get from banks. How long will the public be held back from doing what they want, maybe they don't understand bitcoin yet. The government is powerful yes, but bitcoin is always a step ahead.

I think the quarrel will make Bitcoin very famous to the extent that both opponents will have no other option than to submit to Bitcoin. The simplest answer is because BTC is freedom from control.Governments and banks somehow imply a degree of control financially. There is this association whenever we hear these words in which a certain good would be regulated and controlled in a way depending to their liking. This is exactly on why BTC was created in order to have the freedom of transactions anywhere. It frees itself from the regulation and control of banks and the government in which BTC is used under the blockchain for transactions.",

Good thing, as of now not all governments and regulatory bodies have the same perspective on Bitcoin.  Some are opening their yes and embracing this new technology which they think is very helpful to their economy.",

I think, their difference base on the differences in ideology, control over monetary systems, regulatory concerns, and the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's decentralized nature challenges the traditional control exerted by governments and banks over financial systems. Governments and banks worry about potential illicit activities facilitated through cryptocurrencies and the volatility of Bitcoin's price. On the other hand, Bitcoin enthusiasts believe in the importance of financial freedom and view Bitcoin as way to reduce reliance on traditional financial institutions.",

I think it is a big win for the government because they have succeeded in painting bitcoin black in the eyes of people even though not everyone believes in their lies of calling bitcoin evil because of their inability to have total  control over bitcoin users and regulate the transactions made by them.Personally,  I also think the government can only limit people from using bitcoin by not adopting it but they can't force her citizens not to do transactions if they are wise enough to speak out on what they want and how they can't be regulated on how they should spend their money. The government can only submit to bitcoin and allow everyone to use bitcoin if they find a way to monitor the transactions of all users which is not possible or the value of fiat which is generally accepted by the government is equal to zero which I don't think can be possible except that the government will still find it difficult to generally accept bitcoin rather they will keep spreading rumours on how bitcoin is used by criminals, drug dealers and money launderers as if all this evil acts has not been done using fiat currency which is the most accessible and well known currency all over the world.",

It is just a matter of time recently I saw a news on bitcoin magazine on Instagram quoting a post from Twitter talking about the US presidential candidate \"Robert Kennedy Jr to become the first presidential campaign in history to accept Bitcoin lightning payment. So your assumption that government and banks will NEVER agree with Bitcoin is wrong. The fact is bitcoin violated the definition of government, According to a Russian- American political scientist, David Easton, defined government as an agency that derives the will and affairs of a state. Which means the government is supposed have absolute control over everything but Bitcoin is the opposite of that ideology. I believe Bitcoin will be accepted by the government and submit to it as far as we are consistent with Bitcoin",

When people transact bitcoins from the place where the tax is determined, the tax will automatically be deducted according to that percentage. So in this case I see that Bitcoin transactions are definitely profitable for the government. Assuming bitcoin is legal in your country, the government will tax it at 35%, then if you trade bitcoins from your country, you will deduct 35%, so in this case the government will have a profit here. But Bitcoin cannot be regulated by the government because Bitcoin is decentralized and completely out of government control. Because of this disadvantage, the government considers Bitcoin dangerous.",
