Everything is always credit card or paypal or what not.It's good to see some new area opening up for bitcoin payments! Let's hope the price is the same as when you pay with alternative fiat providers.When I checked for flights/accommodation payable with crypto I always had the feeling there is some kind of markup compared to other payment options, which then of course loses the incentive to use it after all.",

The part that says its data only and doesnt come with a number seems intriguing, but also puzzling.Given that it lacks a number, Im unsure of why it would be less expensive. But I appreciate you bringing it up since its an important thing to think about. Its comparable to possessing a door's key but not knowing the address of the door.Despite this, I still think its best to purchase a sim from an online store because they might have even better deals and dont impose a fee for transactions like bitcoin. Bitcoin is unquestionably a potent instrument, but when it comes to e-sims, it might not be the best option. Nevertheless, I still endorse the use of bitcoin in many other situations.",

I have been using e-sim in my phone and it's like you know that no one can take out the physical sim card and misuse it at all. It's a pain relief to be very honest. After Apple's move to e-sim for all it's models in US, it might be implemented to other countries as well. Are they even accepting other cryptos or just BTC?",

They give a great service, but the title is kind of misleading because you are not buying directly with bitcoin, they have an agreement with eSIM Go, as with a lot of companies and they get paid after conversion to fiat.It is like the person who has an card issued by an exchange that he loads with bitcoin and pays in shops after conversion to fiat. You could also say that you are paying with bitcoin when technically speaking you are not, what you are doing is changing bitcoin to fiat in order to be able to pay.",

I also switched to E-sim 2 months ago and it's really convenient and enhances the level of security, I believe this trend will be widely adopted soon. But in short, the purpose of this news is to say that the use of bitcoin as a means of payment is increasing day by day and used in every industry. It's another win for mass bitcoin adoption.",

My issue with eSIMs is just that a lot of phones don't support it, especially if we're talking about older models. I'm also wondering how it works in terms of local legislations. I mean, my country is pretty neat because you can literally buy a SIM card at a typical supermarket, and there are zero requirements on showing your ID or whatever. But I've noticed that it's quite different in many other countries, and you do need an ID to which the phone number gets registered, as well as some other data sometimes. Another matter is that Bitcoin payments also aren't legal all around the world, so I'm amazed by 140 supported countries but also wondering whether it's all actually legal in all those countries. It's also a shame if one can only buy data, but not the SIM.",

I googled about it and found out a few cons. Those who have used it can help me further to establish whether they are good or bad. The first thing I found out is that data based e-sim has a higher cost as in the per GB transfer is more expensive than a normal sim. The next thing I found out is that the roaming option is more limited than a normal sim. By roaming option, I meant the packages. The last was technical difficulties wherein I used might face multiple issues while getting it activated. If anyone here has used an e-sim then do quote me with a reply to my questions.",

But what Bitrefill has done is a benchmark or illustration for eSIM companies to implement the same system. Making it easier for travelers to use services like this certainly has a positive impact. In the future, I hope that it will not only focus on eSIM but that 140 countries will expand to the transportation payment sector, rental housing, etc.",

E-SIM will only provide the most convenience to travelers as not all money moves in all countries but almost all countries where bitcoin is legal (in countries where it is illegal but secretly used) travelers can realize using a Bitcoin e-SIM. As this journey has started in 140 countries it will definitely be successful because in this modern age people are always busy with modern thinking and Bitcoin. And I think free transactions will impose the greatest benefits and become popular.",
