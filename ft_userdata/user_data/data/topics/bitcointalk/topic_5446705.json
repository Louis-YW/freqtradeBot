Would you wait and try to get the most BTC possible or select early payout to get this behind you?The earlier the better on which you could assure that those coins would be on your own hands rather than into theirs.Whenever the price do make out some increase then you are that confident that you are making that money on your own and not into those people or org who had been holding those MT.GOx funds. Early repayment would be the best choice anytime of the day.Despite of the allocation which it is really been halved with fiat and your btc of the rest then i would really be preferring whichever comes first.What matter most is that you do get a hold of those which you do owned.",

There have been numerous FUDs on this over the years and yet there never was a dump happening because there was no refund that happened in the first place. The latest that I heard was that the refund will finally take place within March. March is almost over and nothing's happening yet. But there was also news that it will be moved to July to September. I think I will choose early payout.",

Would you wait and try to get the most BTC possible or select early payout to get this behind you?You will not get a clear answer to this question, and some may choose to get cash now and have logical reasons such as:Investment in Bitcoin was purely serendipitous.Does not believe in the future value of Bitcoin.Doubts that he will get anything in the future.Changes may occur in the future that make waiting a long time.Needs cash now.Buys Bitcoin at the current price and invests it instead of waiting for a long time (a bird in the hand, not 10 in the tree)Doesn't like stress or being in a long process.you will get many logical reasons form the same person, given that the reasons above may differ from one person to another, and we cannot blame someone for choosing one of these things.",

Then at least could buying 2x more Bitcoin once the bear market arrived. For sure the early payment (especially sold at a discount) wouldn't be as much as the full payment, but unless the latter is twice as much, selling around $50K would have been ideal!",

Thos eligible for their refund are probably feeling drained out already with this so IMHO, they just want to take anything as soon as possible.",

It’s closer to 15% of your BTC back. I wish it were 50%, but that isn’t going to happen. Even at a 15% return rate, it’s still a significantly higher USD amount than was lost so it’s hard to be too upset about it. I probably would’ve spent the money on silver or god knows what else over the last 10 years, so it’s a bit of a bittersweet return of funds. Not sure where you heard that 50% number, but it’s wildly incorrect.",

Seems it’s a larger mess than MtGox and it’ll probably be 5-10 years.Wasnt really that familiar on how funds been stole out on Mt.Gox on which it was able to have this kind of chance for its users to get it back on what they have lost.If this is also can be seen on FTX then for surethose people who had been affected would be expecting something like this on what happened on Gox to but of course everything would really still remain speculative and presumption.Regarding on the question if ever have the chance on getting your coins or payment back then i would definitely be going after on something as soon as possible or if ever its possible on doing so.Its yours and you do have the right and it is really that a very long time before it do reached up into this state.",

Would you wait and try to get the most BTC possible or select early payout to get this behind you?Better to get it as much as possible because you dont know on what issues would be thrown up next which would be in resulting into some possible delay once again which would might take for years and if everit would come to worst it wouldnt really be released out in the end.This is why if ever there's a chance or opportunity on which you could really be able to get your coins back whether it would be on Bitcoinor fiat form then i would definitely be longing on recieving those as much as soon as possible.There's no way for me to have those second thoughts on holding and waiting out further.Once that claim button is clear up then i would be having no doubt on getting neither partial or much better if it would be in full.",

That $1000 becomes more like $325 or so.I guess that is because there is no stable coins yet during the era of Mt.Gox and the most popular coin back in time was only Bitcoin so it's no brainer that many people will invest on it. During the FTX collapse, stable coins are already hot. People use this mainly to safeguard some of their crypto profits and do other things. No wonder why many people are using it. The only bad side of using it is like you said, it is affected by the inflation and its value will only decline in the long run.Getting half is better but that is if FTX will repay its investors. Mt.Gox on the other hand is doing a great job there because they are now crediting the lost BTC of their customers. As for the OP's poll, I think I will go for an early re-payment because I urgently need the money.",

Well there is hope if Solana becomes popular again. I think they hold like 10% of the entire market cap of Solana. Since its still trading at $20 there is hope it can make its way into the $50-$100 range. If we get into the $100 range then this would be their largest holding valued at $4B.The rest of the tokens like SRM or FTX I dont think they will be worth much. Even if they start to liquidate them, the price will go down because the supply is just too large. However Solana in a strong bull market might be possible to liquidate all their holdings if done slowly.Then we might see 50 cents on the dollar. But who knows.",
