There was a suspect who got arrested and his funds seized (they didn't mention how much). I couldn't find any updates about the case but the article also mentions the hacker used BISQ and Monero so I don't see someone who's that careful using a CEX like Bitfinex.[1] https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/97819.html",

If your fund has been stolen and it has been moved to that address, it means that the fund has been deposited to bitfinex. That's all. Also when these stolen fund reaches the exchange, there is no way one can further trace them. As the hacker may exchange them with any altcoins or multiple altcoins and then withdraw those altcoins from the exchanges. So now there is no point monitoring that address, even if belongs to the hacker (in this case of course its an bitfinex address and not the hacker's address)At the time of writing this address contains 2801 BTC and there are many transactions happening every few miuntes also proof that this is not a hacker's address.",

And, even if crypto assets are to be seized, there is anyway little to no chance to get it back, since such transactions are impossible to be legally tracked (even if money path is obvious, it may turn out that this path is legally unproven, same things happen with fiats as well).",
