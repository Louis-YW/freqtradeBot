As far as I know, a similar US law was issued in the past, but the amount in question was 10.000$.However, my question relates to situation in Europe, not in US.If any has legal knowledge, I'd like to know if you can leave the country (any European country) and enter in another (European) country while carrying with you a wallet containing BTC worth of more than 10.000 euros, without declaring it. Should a BTC wallet be declared at custom office? And what if that wallet is a software wallet... a mobile wallet? What happens if you don't declare it? They can't see that you have an app on your mobile phone, which is a BTC wallet, right? Even if a custom officer would be too zealous and search travelers' phones, looking for crypto wallets (which I highly doubt), a user can always just delete de app and reinstall it once arrived at destination, right? And there simply restore the wallet.I don't know... is this illegal? Is it legal? Has anyone encountered with such situation? I am trying to understand how law works (or should work) in such cases. As far as I know, since a country does not accept BTC as legal tender, nobody should declare any crypto wallet he has on his phone nor if it is a hardware wallet as, in front of the State, he is not carrying money with him.

Otherwise folks would have to declare their investment bank accounts.I think they might be able to make a case if you were to carry physical bitcoins or paper wallets.

For example, you can import into France without declaring an amount not exceeding 10,000 euros. This includes not only cash in euros, but also all cash in any currency.As far as I know, the \"Ten Thousand Rule\" applies to all EU countries; however, when entering the EU, it is advisable to clarify the procedure for transporting cash for a particular country.There is a law in Europe that states: \"Any natural person entering or leaving the EU and carrying cash of a value of €10,000 or more is required to declare that amount to the competent authorities of the Member State through which he/she is entering or leaving the EU.\"But given that there is currently no single law regulating cryptocurrencies in Europe, I believe that the contents of a Bitcoin wallet do not need to be declared.",

But, honestly, what do you think the outcome would be in case someone (caught by a customs officer with an undeclared BTC wallet holding more than the equivalent of 10.000E) would try to have this debate with the customs officer?  It's hard to imagine the custom officer would have the necessary knowledge or the will to understand that, in fact, you don't physically have BTC, but you only poses private keys which allow you move some coins, if you want to.Quote from: HeRetiK on February 01, 2023, 11:41:52 AMIt is also worth noting that when shares and securities are mentioned as \"cash or equivalent assets\" that have to be declared, they are referring to the physical certificates.

However, this is what I found about European Union Cash Controls:QuoteAs part of the EU’s efforts to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism, all travellers entering or leaving EU territory are already obliged to complete a cash declaration when carrying EUR 10 000 or more (or equivalent in other currencies, bonds, shares or travellers’ cheques). Customs authorities are empowered to check persons, their luggage and their means of transport. They are also empowered to detain undeclared cash. [...]1) The definition of ‘cash’ in the rules will be extended to include certain other valuable items.This means that as of that date, you must lodge a cash declaration if you are carrying EUR 10 000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) or more in value of one or more of the following items included under the new definition of cash, when entering or leaving the EU:    Banknotes and coins (including currency now out of general circulation but that can still be exchanged in a financial institution or central bank),    Bearer negotiable instruments such as cheques, travellers’ cheques, promissory notes and money orders,    Gold coins with a gold content of at least 90 %,    Gold bars, nuggets or clumps with a gold content of at least 99.5 %.(The part about gold bars may be also an answer for the example given by LoyceV about that Italian smuggling gold bars.)From what I see, there is no reference to cryptocurrency.However, even if there would be a reference inside the law (a law which I / we can't find at the moment) for being coerced to declare if you own BTC worth of more than 10.000E -- this would only raise more questions in my head: what happens if you have a wallet with BTC worth of -- let's say -- 8000E (thus you don't declare it when leaving the country) and, when you reach your destination, BTC price soars and your wallet is worth of more than 10.000E without you even thinking about it? They'll simply confiscate your money which value more than 10.000E due to a sudden price growth?",

      "body": "@LeGaulois: I think it's like Heretik wrote: the local/national regulations can differ in details from the EU regulations, but must at least implement the restrictions of these. In this case, the local French law could be more severe than the EU regulation. However, it's possible that you're right (which would be a good thing) because just the customs regulations are one of the pillars of the EU as a customs union, and thus it's possible that they have to be completely harmonized (and thus, perhaps, a local court punishing you for not declaring your BTC could be overruled by an European one which considers this rule to be not compliant with the European one).I saw, however, that also the Spanish customs site has a wider definition of the mediums of exchange which must be declared (Source):QuoteSe consideran medios de pago:a) El papel moneda y la moneda metálica, nacionales o extranjeros.b) Los cheques bancarios al portador denominados en cualquier moneda.c) Cualquier otro medio físico, incluidos los electrónicos, concebidos para ser utilizado como medio de pago al portador.The bold passage means \"every physical asset, included electronic ones, conceived to be used as payment means.\"From my understanding, this includes more than the two items mentioned in Annex I of the EU regulation (basically, gold coins/bars and prepaid cards). It could include, for example, \"physical\" bitcoins.Quote from: HeRetiK on February 01, 2023, 07:06:17 PMNote that digital currency may not necessarily mean cryptocurrency.That's true, yes. Note that the EU has a quite strict definition of the term \"e-money\", but not \"digital money/currency\". E-money is always tied to fiat.

It's perfectly normal to have (at least) one in each pocket =)))Quote from: HeRetiK on February 01, 2023, 07:06:17 PMThere goes my plan trafficking McDonalds coupons for fast food arbitrage.Fast food arbitrage? =))) Now that's an appealing idea I may try once!.Quote from: LeGaulois on February 01, 2023, 06:30:35 PMDoesn't matter a lot because the countries don't decide. They have to obey to the european rules. Countries are just the puppets of EUAnd eu says https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/carry/carrying-cash/index_fr.htmIn a justice court, you will win by saying you respected the EU rules instead the local ones.Yup, that's right. It's possible they did not update the website after last update made by European Union. Besides, the French website mentioned digital currency, not cryptocurrency... anyway this could be a debate about semantics. In any case, it seems there is no specification for declaring crypto at the border...",

Should a BTC wallet be declared at custom office? And what if that wallet is a software wallet... a mobile wallet? What happens if you don't declare it? They can't see that you have an app on your mobile phone, which is a BTC wallet, right? Even if a custom officer would be too zealous and search travelers' phones, looking for crypto wallets (which I highly doubt), a user can always just delete de app and reinstall it once arrived at destination, right? And there simply restore the wallet.I don't know... is this illegal? Is it legal? Has anyone encountered with such situation? I am trying to understand how law works (or should work) in such cases. As far as I know, since a country does not accept BTC as legal tender, nobody should declare any crypto wallet he has on his phone nor if it is a hardware wallet as, in front of the State, he is not carrying money with him. Maybe I'm wrong though.Topic is self-moderated for avoiding spam.There is no doubt that the officer will decide your situation, he will have all power to create problems for you if he wants.My suggestion is that  you should not carry more than 0.4 BTC (aprox 10k euros) in your mobile phone.If you are walking with your live savings in your hardware wallet, you need to hide the main seed using a passphrase.https://www.ledger.com/academy/passphrase-an-advanced-security-featureJust avoid problems for yourself.Quote from: franky1 on February 02, 2023, 01:42:45 AMits about \"intention to spend\"EG you dont declare your debit bank card because no one intends to spend their entire life savings in 2 weeks. Debit and cards are not supposed to be declared, not because there is no \"will\" to spend, but because the law only obligate you to declare your cash.Only cash is supposed to be declared. QuoteAny person travelling with cash, gold, cheques or other equivalent cash with a total value of 10,000 euros must declare this to the competent customs office. This applies to travel within the European Union orally and on questioning. For journeys to non-European countries, this must be done in writing in advance.https://www.owlaw.com/german-customs-law/42609-fine-10000-euros-cash-when-travelling-to-germany/#:~:text=Any%20person%20travelling%20with%20cash%2C%20gold%2C%20cheques%20or,this%20must%20be%20done%20in%20writing%20in%20advance.It is not related to your will to spend it, you should declare if you are carrying.This law we can see in most countries in the world.",

      "body": "Quote from: d5000 on February 01, 2023, 08:30:57 PMI saw, however, that also the Spanish customs site has a wider definition of the mediums of exchange which must be declared (Source):QuoteSe consideran medios de pago:a) El papel moneda y la moneda metálica, nacionales o extranjeros.b) Los cheques bancarios al portador denominados en cualquier moneda.c) Cualquier otro medio físico, incluidos los electrónicos, concebidos para ser utilizado como medio de pago al portador.The bold passage means \"every physical asset, included electronic ones, conceived to be used as payment means.\"I see this as a bit exaggerated, because according to the literal meaning, I should declare if I carry a debit card associated to an account where I have $1M. But all the payments made with the card are registered, so I don't see much sense. Besides there is a trick to get around this. I carry a debit card associated with an account where I only have $0.30. But when I arrive in the country I make an instant transfer from a savings account at the same bank for $20k.Quote from: LoyceV on January 31, 2023, 05:16:29 PMA more fundamental question is: do you carry Bitcoin? One could argue you don't carry it: Bitcoin doesn't exist on an address, it exists only on the blockchain. How is that different than bringing my online banking credentials, which allows me to transfer more than €10,000?I think this is the crux of the matter, but at the time of a trial. At the border an agent can get you in trouble. If I have €1M in Bitcoin I don't really carry it, in the same way that if I have €1M in P&G shares I don't either, even though I can arrive in another country, click to sell them in an instant and have the money in my account available to spend or withdraw in ATMs (little by little obviously because there are withdrawal limits).The thing is that unless the police suspect you for some reason, the seeds are very easy to hide and they will not find them. Instead of writing them down on a piece of paper, which is the typical thing they would look for if they suspected you, you could take a couple of books in your suitcase and have the seeds written on different pages.",

Anyway, most important is to know what the law says. And even if the law would say \"yes, declare crypto amounts greater than 10.000E\" it's still a gray situation. Look at it in this way:you have an online wallet with more than 10.000E worth of BTC; as it is an online wallet, you don't have it with you. But you can still spend this amount in the country where you travel, right?you have a mobile wallet with more than 10.000E worth of BTC; (1) you don't declare it as you believe no custom officer would ever check your phone: if this happens (meaning your phone will not be checked) then you are free to spend the money; (2) you delete it and reinstall it once you are inside the destination country: again, nobody can stop you from spending; (3) you save wallet.dat and upload it on your email then delete the wallet: once you reach your destination you are free to spend as much as you want; (4) you delete and restore the wallet using a pass phrase etc.In all above cases you are able to cross any border with more than 10.000E in BTC even if the law would say you must declare if you have such amount.Now think about this: again, let's suppose the law coerces you to declare big amounts. And you declare you have 15.000E in BTC. What will happen? Or what happens if you actually have 15.000E fiat? Or 20.000E? Do they confiscate what's over 10.000E? Would they confiscate your BTC too (what's over 10.000E)?Then about this: you have BTC worth of 9000E and the law says to declare if you have over 10.000E. In this case you don't declare anything, as you have only 9000E. But while you are in the new country BTC doubles and suddenly you have 18.000E. So you spend 18.000E maybe on some valuable physical goods and you are questioned upon returning: \"how did you buy these since you had under 10.000E? Did you have more than 10.000E in BTC and you didn't declare?\" -- and so on. Can you justify the provenience of the goods simply by saying that \"BTC price doubled so I suddenly had more than 10.000 although on departure I had less\"?Finally, what if someone sends you BTC worth of 50.000E and you buy goods and, again, you are stopped when returning and questioned how you were able to buy the goods. What happens if you say you received this amount through a Bitcoin transaction? Will you be considered a criminal for being able to receive (and spend) such a big amount?So you see, even if a law would say you should declare crypto amounts greater than 10.000E (and, so far, we did not find any such law), things are still in a gray area. You may easily avoid the law but even in cases where you would not avoid it you may look shady (take the case where you have 9000E in BTC and BTC price soars; you buy goods which value more than 10.000E then you are questioned how you were able to buy them since you did not declare anything upon departure, as you had less than 10.000E in BTC back then).",
