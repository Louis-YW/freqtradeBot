It is entirely different from blockchain which is an open ledger where bitcoin are stored.Bitcoin is registered and stored on the blockchain, it is called an open ledger. I do not think it should be called database like those when referring to where data of a company or an organization is stored.",

If you want to learn more about the wallet file, i would recommend the next article:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet",

There are dozens of database structures and architectures in existence throughout all forms of technology.\"wallet.dat\" is a specific file used for data storage by the Bitcoin Core wallet (and other wallets that are based off of the original Bitcoin Core design). It contains information specific to a single instance of the software such as private keys, addresses, and unspent transaction outputs.Currently, when a block is solved more than ONE bitcoin comes into existence.  Instead, 6.25 bitcoins are created by the solo miner or mining pool that creates the block. Those bitcoins can then be split up and shared (by sending them with a transaction) to one or more participants in a mining pool.  In either case (creating 6.25 Bitcoins in a new block, or receiving 1 bitcoin in a transaction) the data is stored the same way.  It is represented in the blockchain as a transaction within a block, and it can additionally be represented in any form that a wallet software creator might want to within the wallet's storage (for example as an unspent output tracked with Bitcoin Core.",

From there, the data stored depends on the record type and is just a bunch of different objects serialized. You will have to look at each object's serialization methods to figure that out.BerkeleyDB is a key-value database so libraries for it provide access to that directly. For SQLite, the database is a single table with two columns, the first named \"key\" and the second \"value\".There is no file that stores your Bitcoins.Furthermore, when you mine a block (you don't mine a bitcoin), that block sits in your node's mempool (chainstate) and is broadcasted to other nodes. If it's not broadcasted, it doesn't exist on the blockchain and you got no block reward.",
