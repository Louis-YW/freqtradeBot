That’s because there’s no single person or entity behind the use of Tornado Cash, an open-source tool.US just hit another mixer, the ethereum mixer Tornado cash.What is interesting about this is that the service is actually a piece of code, which can be run locally or in another server.https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-classic-ui-is-now-open-source-4b542b705a97",

I have not read all of the news, however, there are some people in social media who said that this is the first time a smart contract has been sanctioned. This implies that there is is a ban on interacting with the smart contract. In any case, the solution will certainly be to fork Tornado Cash hehehe.Also, this sanction will be a problem because it can be used against anyone. What if I use Tornado Cash then send those coins I mixed to Binance, FTX and Coinbase hot wallets?",

If you using a bad privacy mixer, they will know the address is came from a mixer and even you're using a good mixer, they will know you're concealing your transaction.However since Chipmixer is also a centralized mixer, I'm worried since it's possible if Chipmixer get shutdown, or it's possible Chipmixer will only available on Tor network?

Or does it need collective cooperation (protocol management) like Wasabi/coinJoin?In general, privacy is something that needs value, and I do not think that it is easy or cheap to hide identity from governments or countries that allocate resources to track you. Therefore, hiding identity in crptocurrencies will be more difficult in the future unless current technologies develop.The biggest danger is the use of centralized cryptocurrencies, which give the developer the possibility to freeze access to your funds.",

Many popular centralized crypto exchanges already have certain taint algorithms in place even without this newest attack on privacy. Depending on how they look at things, funds that originate from mixers, coinjoins, and gambling platforms are/could be considered as dirty and unwanted. Check out [Blacklist] of unreliable, 'taint proclaiming' Bitcoin services / exchanges or What Do Centralized Exchanges Consider as Taint for more information.

If a site is down, you can't access it no matter what browser you use. It's not a browser thing. Google can blacklist ChipMixer or any other service from showing up in their search results. You can test that yourself. Type and search for \"ChipMixer\" and see what results you are shown. The sites recommended to you are fake phishing sites, but Google doesn't care. But despite it not showing up in search results, you can still open https://chipmixer.com/ with Google Chrome just fine.
