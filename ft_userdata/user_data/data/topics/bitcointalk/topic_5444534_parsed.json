  "content": "Is street gambling safe?   Actually, this is an easy one and it all depends on the place and who you play with. Almost all of the streets here have people piling up to bet on games like blackjack, lucky nine, and baccarat. Fights actually broke out since the place where the games take place is only on the streets where there is actually no authorities like security guards or moderator for the games. One of my friends actually gets hospitalized because of his winning and he got on one of his opponent's heads after the game, his opponent and his companions hit him on his face with a baseball bat.    Does it prove that street gambling is not safe? Yes, it might but it all depends on the players. Will u play your bet with people you know are no good? No right? Maybe we can't really say until it happens but how about the chance that you can get yourself harmed, I'm not saying that don't play street games or don't bet on street gambling what I'm saying is please do choose who you play with wisely.   Spreading awareness is what at least we can do to help others, if ever you're watching some street games and you feel something's up call some authorities already because you might catch fire as well.",

You never can tell you it is that you're betting against which means your life could be at risk and also since there's no way for you to hide your identity that could also lead to the risk of you being followed back to your place and later getting robbed. If you look closely you will see that the people that usually engage in street gambling are either thugs or people that takes hard drugs ( at least that's how it is in my country ). And because the risk is just too high I won't even consider going anywhere near it.",

      "body": "Street gambling is the worst type of gambling ever; it's dangerous, it's risky, and it can cost one's life. There is no one who will be completely happy about losing to an opponent, no matter who the competitor is; even if he or she is a religious leader, no one will ever feel happy about losing in a game. Once one starts losing, the mode of the loser will definitely begin to change, which can result in anything at any point in time, and you, the winner, can even be accused of cheating since there is no machine to detect or explain the rules. The truth of the matter is, street gambling is for thug-knowing people, and the one with a higher ground will always win because if you win them, your life is at risk.",

After all, the organizers of this kind of gambling rely on income in any scenario, so such a risk is not justified.",

They come and win huge prizes occasionally because it is all a fucking act. Then some real person sees that and thinks “if this dumb fuck can win this I can too!” Of course it never happens because they make the game harder immediately when you decide to play.I wouldn’t even get too close to them. Someone may just steal something from you. It is way too dangerous.",

You may know these people but you never really know what they are up to when the games become serious and heated. It's all good and fun when bets are small but it takes a turn when the amount escalates hehe. If you have to play with other people then better do it at a house where the owner can also mediate.",

If not then you might be at a disadvantage as you might be the victim just like what the OP has describe. So before you place a bet or gamble you should not the risk involved and also the players and the people surrounding you in a street game. Played a lot of street games in my youth, but I will say that I was never a victim because I never play alone, I mean I have my friends who cover my back as well just in case, you know, some individuals don't accept that you beat them in whatever game they want. Even playing basketball with money involved is very tense here.",

Fortunately, I was able to get out that place because street gambling there always ended up on a bad situation, so its not safe in my place but maybe in other places. street gambling are more ok and traditional to them. Authorities are also against this one, just make sure to call them secretly or else you will be in trouble as well.",

Yes it was, but the current generation is introduced to gambling from the internet. Talking about safety, street gambling is not safe at all as we are in a place where we do not know others. There was a bad experience in a place where I lived long time ago, it was a time when a dealer get caught of cheating and the dealer was killed eventually because he was ganged up on by the angry gamblers. It proves that street gambling is not safe for both dealers and gamblers, it is no longer popular nowadays and even if it is still available in some places, better to avoid it.",
