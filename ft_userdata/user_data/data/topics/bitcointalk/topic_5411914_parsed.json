I assume that means withdrawals and deposits could be done in that currency or another exchange was required (either with the exchange or peer to peer) to get something that could be moved off it.I wonder if this is what lead to paypal's disliking of cryptocurrency and bitcoin too, if theft started to spike as PayPal was/is reversible in a way bitcoin isn't.",

It does seem to be the first one, it's just that 'new' is normally said when something already exists. The price is unbelievably low, it's hard to realize how much Bitcoin truly moved forward over these years. I wonder how many people from those days still have something in Bitcoin that they bought or got during such low prices. I, unfortunately, joined the market much later, and then took a while to realize that Bitcoin is truly valuable.",

I, unfortunately, joined the market much later, and then took a while to realize that Bitcoin is truly valuable.about how many there are I also don't know the exact data, but there must be someone who hasn't sold it yet. I found an address that has around 429 BTC bitcoins in 2010 and last March there was a move by sending all bitcoins to a new address. this proves that there are still many and there are BTC Holders from the past. https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/17QBWJCGV4QbQhLbhcS7d9yB2S7DPLf4N9Bitcoin was worthless in the past, but very valuable now. who could hold it up until now would gain a tremendous advantage.",

Bitcoin has come a long way from the really early days, to today, the early-ish days and a lot has changed within over a decade; the Bitcoin network however, has remained more or less the same.I would merit you, but I got only one smerit left and I'm saving that, as a reserve.Quote from: mk4 on September 02, 2022, 03:08:40 PMBesides the mining part, I just find it weird and bizarre how I'd have almost the same exact response to someone asking me \"why Bitcoin\"; knowing that this response was from 13 years ago.I don't find it weird at all. Bitcoin was unpopular and had zero market value then. So those who got into it had to have a real reason to do so, one which would more often than not, resonate to the actual purpose of Bitcoin, which I believe you share.Majority getting in now, see that lots of people got profits and they want some too. If the government can still subpoena them through the centralized exchanges they use or they have no privacy, or do they own the keys to the coins, doesn't matter at all.",

It's just the fact that the post on the screenshot was a bit too close to what I would exactly say when asked about the same question. I know the general idea would be mostly the same, but I just expected a bit more variation compared to a response from 2009. I'd say more of 'uncanny' than 'weird'.",

Great minds they say...Quote from: kryptqnick on September 02, 2022, 04:03:09 PMI wonder how many people from those days still have something in Bitcoin that they bought or got during such low prices.A handful or less.Many would have already sold even before Bitcoin hit $100, many more would have panick sold at a loss and some would have made huge profits holding on to $20k or maybe $60k.The chances of holding all through the high prices we've seen over the last 5 years are quite slim. Don't have a estimate, but it would be a very low number.",

The cooperation, exchange of ideas that flowed among members and their willingness to do more showed what was able to sustain bitcoin despite the attacks from those who doubted and the media. If early members were not that committed, am sure bitcoin would not have gotten to where it is today. Thank you Ratimov for sharing this.",

Crazy how time flies so fast, and the number of helpful tools integrated in exchanges to help traders on their activities is also increasing too. Back in 2014, the only trading platform I knew is Localbitcoins, and it's extremely hard to get a deal as most of the sellers are from far away. I genuinely believed that Localbitcoins is the first and primary means of trading coins back then since it was peer to peer, but I was wrong. You learn something new everyday.",

Sometimes memories like this can bring good motivation to think more positively in the future. At that time I even preferred to be paid in dollars rather than bitcoin. because I didn't know that bitcoin would be as valuable as it is now. even though the bitcoin paid option already existed at that time. I'm sure someone here has experienced the same thing. who used to hunt for dollars on the internet with paid advertising click services hahahaha. bitter memories. if time could be turned back. then first I would prefer to be paid with BTC and hold it hahahaha",
