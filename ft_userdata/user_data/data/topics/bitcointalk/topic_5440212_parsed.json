The answer is simply \"no\" because Satoshi developed the Bitcoin protocol and launched the network. The protocol does not allow Satoshi or anyone else to change or control the network, and this is the essence of the idea that no one would be able to control the network or any other central authority, otherwise he would not have had all this reliability.On the other hand, the protocol is open source, and anyone can change it as they wish and launch a new project. There are actually several projects developed using the same protocol.",

Satoshi has no control over bitcoin network. This. Developers publish source code for projects in order for independent researchers to check for things like back doors or possible malicious code. This in addition to wanting the best talent on earth to be able to improve code without restrictions. It is these reasons that led to satoshi making Bitcoin open source so that it could be trusted and improved by all those willing to do so.",

      "body": "Unless, hundreds of users have missed it, then nope he hasn't put a backdoor in it. As has been mentioned above by some users, open source means it's ready to view by anyone. However, that doesn't mean it's automatically safe which I believe some users might be confusing. Just because something is open source, doesn't mean it has backdoors, and when it comes to thousands of lines of code, it could potentially be missed.Do, I think that's the case for Bitcoin? Nah. There's been too many peer reviews of it, however do consider in the future that just because something is popular, and open source doesn't necessarily mean it's safe. Ideally, anything you use you'd verify the code yourself, but I understand not everyone has that technical ability, so you go to next best thing, and loko for someone who you trust that has reviewed it. Quote from: Zanab247 on February 17, 2023, 05:48:57 PMThat is why Satoshi Nakamoto still remain the founder of BTC because, he still have the ability to appear and change things that will attract different countries to adopt BTC or to be part of the benefits of BTC by making BTC teams more active in spreading the positive news about Bitcoin to the world. I guess, Satoshi Nakamoto still know what is happening with Bitcoin in the world Because, the main reason he or they created Bitcoin is to go round the world to eliminate delay in transaction.That entirely depends on the hypothetical changes. If Satoshi has a different vision to the vast majority of the community, we don't have to follow his deviation. That's the beauty of Bitcoin, and one of the key fundamentals that Satoshi created. The freedom to choose.",

Impossible for a multitude of reasons- the code is open source, if Satoshi would have planted that he would have taken the risk of somebody discovering it and taking advantage before him- the code has changed a lot and he had no way to know that the part which allowed him to come back and the attack would be kept and not modified- there is a bit of consensus on the idea that Satoshi wasn't a full or expert programmer, so again it would have been near impossible for him to hide from a lot of people who were probably at least the same if not more experienced than himSo, leaving a backdoor for 13 years in an open-source code wouldn't have been the brightest idea, not to mention the blowback when that would have been discovered.Imagine this would have happened in the first month, everyone would have just dropped the project and never touched it again.Quote from: tread93 on February 17, 2023, 05:19:23 PMI guess I’m just curious how many security measures are set in place to prevent things like that from every happening.One, the code is there for everyone to look at it, and with that much $ involved there will be thousands analyzing it, but also you can't do anything other than this.",

Satoshi has no control over bitcoin network. Thats what he meant on which he do assume out that if Satoshi do know something that he could make out some changes if he wanted to and would really be tending to do something like possible reverse transactions or even trying out to access a particular wallet or everything that do really connects out about security.Its true that Bitcoin is an open source and if there's something like this about possible exploits then it had been long time been detected and been fixed out but much sure once this one do pop out then confidence and trust would really be no longer the same before it was been known if ever this one happens.Its better not to make these kind of doubts and assumptions to have no stress.",

There is no chance of this being true since this will require that every single person reviewing the code missed the backdoor or they were somehow coerced to ignore it, now if this is not enough for you then the solution is also easy, you can learn how to code and then check the code yourself, this way you can be completely sure this is the case and there is nothing like this on the code, now if you do not want to do this you will have no option but to trust on the judgment and skill of those which actually went through the problem of doing this.",

You're trying to bring a suggestion on weather the inventor of bitcoin which is Satoshi has a way he can manipulate things a d change the program to work to his taste since he created bitcoin, but maybe you're yet to understand what it means when it been said that bitcoin nodes where interconnected to each other, which means what you have here is what others will have as well all over the world, which means bitcoin transactions can not be altered, because blockchain is immutable, there's a program set in place that him (Satoshi) can not alter because that have a well structured program and protocol consensus they follows and validate same data with everyone connected to the nodes.",

Maybe it's just content that can be set up in such a way. But the point is that without any knowledge of Bitcoin if I were in that position I would take the same choice of $100. The reason is quite simple we can use $100 immediately, have physical possession and even at school we have been taught about the value and use of this money. So I won't blame him for not choosing Bitcoin it's just that when a content creator comes to someone who knows the value of Bitcoin and $100 it's clear he will choose Bitcoin.",
