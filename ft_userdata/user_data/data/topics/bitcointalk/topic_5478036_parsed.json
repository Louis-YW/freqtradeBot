Simply copy the entire text and paste it into translate.google.com, or you can try some extensions that enable you to translate only the highlighted text, which should not break the overall page layout.",

I'm having trouble finding one.The first solution to this problem is by switching to Microsoft Edge browser. It will allow you to automatically translate the whole page but if you're  a Chrome user and you want a similar solution to work on Chrome then the most efficient solution for this issue is to install an extension which will auto translate the text for you. DeepL for Chrome extension is available and it works like a charm for me. I actually don't use auto-translation a lot but in a few websites I use translation to understand the topics in depth.",

I'm having trouble finding one. Google translator is the best option,  but for saving the words or sentences you have already written there, you can easily save these phrases somewhere in your notepad or the Microsoft Word document. In this way, when you open your PC, you can just copy the next file and start your file again. I'm also using Google Translate whenever I don't understand some questions, etc. Then, in the same way, store these files in some other place, and when I am on my PC, I just open it again and start my work there. Although there are many other websites through which you can get the translated phrase, which can help you a lot,.",
