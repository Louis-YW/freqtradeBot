  "content": "It is quite absurd how investors and traders will just jump at the prospect of new coin circulating the market. It's quite unfortunate how this newly issued token( Luna) promptly plunges over the weekend with a knee jerk reaction. The volume of Luna 2.0 dropped about 66% in a day as tokens worth over $130 million exchanged hands before it experienced an upsurge. Terra's revival plan was to deliver new Luna tokens to holders of the project's now vastly depreciated UST stable coin and also to hodlers of existing tokens. According to coinmarketcap data, this tokens were issued at $17.8 and sped up to $19.53 on May 28th. But unsurprisingly enough, as at May 30th, barely 48hrs later, it nosedived over 70%.   https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi9mKnaxpb4AhUhgs4BHV6hCbwQFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw01QhOFYYX1A9ExSwY_DpT3",

If that is so, the price drop should be expected since some of the investors should have known better that the whole idea itself is failed, so they just cashed out any leftovers they have.Apparently, if there are still people who are embracing the Luna 2.0, I won't call them absurd, instead, I can safely assume that they are just purely gambling.

Can't blame investors, people are not sure what future is there for the new luna, if there was going to be huge community support like the previous luna or not. Not to mention the credibility of the terra luna was in question. I think most importantly, investors realize terra luna was not a community-driven coin as they thought it to be, Do Kwon and his close friends have influence over community opinion.",

It is difficult to change the perception of investors and traders if they no longer believe in the ability of the team to develop the project, so that ultimately crashes are inevitable. But anyway we don't know what will happen to Luna and Terra in the future despite all the troubles they are going through right now. Miracles are something we don't know when it will come, maybe most people who hope this project will succeed again are those who believe in miracles.",

This is what I was thinking, this Luna team just created their ver 2.0, just to give hope to its old holders but will have the same fate in the market. But who can really sue these luna team? They practically screwed a lot of lives. Or it is the people themselves who bought into this are to be blamed by their fate. They chose this project, so no one forced them to buy this crap project.",

The Luna 2.0 was very volatile when it was launched, it increased from around $18 to almost $20, but later decreased the hour it was launched to $3.4. The price has been very volatile and any price move in bitcoin will be more on Luna 2.0 than even on other altcoins with good marketcap. From around $6, it went up to $12 last week Monday or so, bitcoin only increased from $30100 to $32400. What if bitcoin price plummet to $25000, Luna 2.0 price likely would have gone below $1.
