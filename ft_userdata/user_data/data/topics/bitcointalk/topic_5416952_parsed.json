  "content": "Historically, DOGE price behavior has tracked sentiments in Musk’s tweets about the memecoin. While largely positive, with some tweets sending the memecoin rocketing by 20% to 85%, other tweets have resulted in bearish price behavior.In Feb. 2021, the price of DOGE fell 20% following Musk’s criticism that the memecoin was concentrated in the hands of a few followers.Following the Burnt Hair announcement, DOGE is uncharacteristically down 0.4%, as even the billionaire’s bullish tweet could not rouse it from its bearish slumber. At press time the price is $0.06.According to Be[In]Crypto’s recent DOGE technical analysis, the memecoin could see a bullish breakout within the week after initially falling to $0.051.DOGE could see a more long-term rally following an update to its Core software later this year, and then again in March 2023.(Source: Beincrypto)",

For sure he needs more profit that's why he goes back promoting doge again.For now will see some constant changes to the doge since I want to ride what Elon Musk doing at the moment. Also for new players of doge be careful not to hodl to much since whenever Musk start to manipulate for sure he is the one who will dump it once Doge price rise up for more.",

About the memecoin it may grow but honestly its overvalued since 2020 cause even the creator itself no longer growing it, only the influencers are playing with Doge, Shib and shit more in their free time.",

He's all for the hype and he understands his influence that can bring to the market but if it's about showing his balls of accepting dogecoin for selling his Tesla's as an example, he can't do that.

So not surprised that he is promoting Doge again for his new cologne. Elon Musk is definitely an influential person, not because of his huge wealth but also being a smart and wise entrepreneur. To the extent of becoming a greedy person he has now become. But I must say, this man is really intended for Dogecoin, as he has no effect on bitcoin. So this is not surprising really if he will hype again Dogecoin and make its price bullish instantly bullish, but just like the old times, once the hype is gone, Dogecoin’s price will certainly drop again and stay less valuable.",

I can still imagine how those Dogecoin lovers before put all their money in this coin and boom, when Elon is gone, the price of Dogecoin also stops increasing. So maybe this will be a lesson for everyone especially for Elon’s fanatics, always invest in a reputable coin to avoid huge losses, and I think all the coins that are hyped by Elon are definitely not reputable at all.",
