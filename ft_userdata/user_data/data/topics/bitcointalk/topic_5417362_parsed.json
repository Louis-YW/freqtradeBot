  "content": "I came across this interesting article in Bitcoin magazine. It further shows that bitcoin is for everyone, irrespective of what you do. You can never go wrong with bitcoin and this people who have been considered \"conservative\" are leading the way. Here is a summaryThese traditional Catholic nuns are a monastic order who follow St. Benedict’s rule and buy, receive and hold bitcoin in cold storage on behalf of their monastery. They survive on self-sufficiency and financial support from around the world — they have nuns from Mexico, England, Germany, the Netherlands and Lithuania — making bitcoin their ideal money.Father Bartulica is the Catholic priest at the monastery set up the sisters with hardware wallets and taught them how to send, receive and get on the path toward financial sovereignty. He is on a mission to convert local Catholic parishes to a bitcoin standard.Through generous bitcoin donations made in 2017. These donations allowed the Benedictines to build a church for the ages without the burden of debt financing.According to one of the nuns, Mother Cecilia \"We have had such beautiful success with several very large bitcoin donations to help build this house of prayer. If I were someone who had means, I would want to assist in making tangible goods, not something that is slapped up to last for 50 years; something that’s going to last, something that will be passed down from generation to generation, to last a thousand years, this beautiful monument to God’s glory\"This is their website where they accept bitcoin",

Why not just consider bitcoin as a currency/asset just like fiat money, gold, silver or basically which we recognise as valuable exchangeable asset?Whether it’s Church, temple, educational fees, corporate fees or salaries we have seen bitcoin everywhere these days. Obviously happy to hear that some church or some institution started to accept bitcoin but ground reality should be kept normal. With modern era we must  say by now bitcoin is really normal monetary system otherwise we will always be surprised / excited by such news. We should be but not in a way that it’s something new.",

      "body": "There's no barrier to engaging bitcoin for the use of religious progress, growth and development since it's the same digital currency everyone believed to be decentralized and acceptable for payment, church can also invest to say, hold and effectively utilize the findings realised from bitcoin and its not an offence, bitcoin can also serve them as an asset for the church and am excited that the church already have a good number of it nuns who are bitcoin friendly to deep into supporting the church with their donations in bitcoin, but i will also suggest they make use of a multisig wallet like electrum which could have more than two co-signers having access, since this is a church that has a number of people and board members involved.",

Well, I don't see anything wrong with it, that's not even an issue, considering the fact that Bitcoin has yet to reach global adoption and there are still a lot of anti-Bitcoin group of people. This kind of news is something of an evidence and a slap in the face for the people who are against this innovation.Again, this is not an issue. In fact let's just be happy and appreciate what these religious group has done so far.",

During that time not much of donations received, and 0.44btc was found in the wallet which was valued to be $60. Later more churches around the world started to accept cryptocurrency donation.First Church to accept bitcoinSt. John's is 'world's first Catholic church to accept bitcoin'Here it is well advanced and executed in a well planned manner. More churches adding bitcoin donation access gives way for anonymous donations. Also churches used to receive a good sum of funds. Usage of cryptocurrency will make everything transparent to the public.",

Bitcoin is more than a coin. It is a foundation of blockchain industry, of cryptocurrency market and is leading the adoption of cryptocurrency.Adoption has been achieved after many years and achievements have been touched gradually but very sustainably. Now it can not be reverted to 10 years ago and from now the adoption for Bitcoin will only be increased, a lot more.",

It shows that for other people who are hiding behind religious reasons and being hostile towards bitcoin and give the excuse of their age are just looking for excuses. This story defeats the ideology that religious people are not accomodating to new ideas and innovations.",

These donations allowed the Benedictines to build a church for the ages without the burden of debt financing.This means that they are receiving a good amount of bitcoin on just donations alone. I never knew that at this day and age a lot of people are still believing in churches and are willing to donate to them. For me this is just another use of bitcoin and nothing much, and it doesn't surprise me anymore. Over time, more and more people will be realizing that bitcoin is accepted by a lot of people so long as you have huge amounts of it. For sure, the nuns aren't receiving what they need in spot prices for the materials and the labor, but still pretty good deal nonetheless.",

Bitcoin is a currency so I don't see why people feel religious people are exempted from it. The benefit is what matters a lot,if people should notice this then they will prefer it over the fiat currency. I have also seen a case where bitcoin was used to fund a church project during the harvest .",

Pretty cool to see forward-thinking bosses still insist their brood remain up to date (or even ahead of the curve).To note though, they didn't actually use Bitcoin to build, but as a method to accept financial support for the building of that church.Cool story, and the type that I always like to read, so thanks!",
