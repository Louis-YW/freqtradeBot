After you make your transaction, if something is wrong with Dogecoin network, you can lose your money after a few minutes and you don't have to wait for about 6 hours or 8 hours to lose your fund.",

Bitcoin full nodes validate those transactions and check whether they belongs to a longest chain.Miners and nodes do not count as third party in this context.The white paper referred to third parties in the financial system, like central points that the transaction has to pass through. Those central points have full autonomy over the transaction and can perform acts against the wishes of the buyer or seller. Even when not selling those third parties has full access to the funds any of the other parties have in their custody. Such parties do not exist in Bitcoin.Miners are scattered all over the world and there is no single point of failure where your Bitcoin has to pass through, so no single miner can affect the outcome of your transaction. They also only come into play during a transaction, not before it after.",

Let me tell, in my country, Bitcoin has made more millionaires and made Gen Z financially free and independent than any other source of income. From the psychological view people who hold Bitcoin are more happier than those who don't . The prospect alone of your assets increasing in value if you hold for long term is the reason. Bitcoin has lead young people in my country to self development in Blockchain development, cryptocurrency education, software engineering, community development and management, and cyber security.",

If the number of users increases, the fees will increase and the person will need more time to wait, or at least pay higher fees. It is true that Bitcoin is being developed to increase scalability, but we are still in the growth phase.Bitcoin offers an option for those who do not want to trust a third party and conduct transactions directly between the sender and the recipient without the need to fully trust an intermediary service, with the ability to verify everything yourself and have complete control over your money, even if a third party tries to confiscate it.",

Cryptocurrency has problems with adoption level, and, I think, there will be moe troubles with adoption due to the fact that anonymous currency can't be legally accepted as property. Legal status, unfortunately, is not only the state of being legal/illegal, but also protection of belongings by law, and this step is impossible in case of crypto due to high anonymity level.",

It's even more exciting to know that bitcoin transactions are cost effective and with a very good transaction speed compared to fiat. All this \"too good to be true\" benefits will be superb if everyone,  both old and young , educated and uneducated and even the government will accept cryptocurrency.  This way, bitcoin will not only be an investment (which is still very good), making payments via the cryptocurrency exchange will be effective. I had a similar experience.  I had an urgent transaction to do some time ago yet I couldn't do the transaction because the bank had some network problems all day. Then it occurred to me that I can actually make payment from my bitcoin wallet but guess what, the supposed beneficiary won't accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment because he doesn't have a bitcoin wallet and has a little knowledge of how cryptocurrency works.",

And I would like to add that to the fact that bitcoin has been very helpful aslo in terms of use as an investment means intact this has even been the most popular means of it use because of its ability to retain and accumulate overtime. Well as for the case of its use as a means to defraud people I think bitcoin has also had a fair share of that too because most cases and reason bitcoin isn't allowed in some countries is because of the claims of it been use as a means of all sort of evil stuffs like fraud and I think this is normal as human must definitely use it for its two sided purpose which is evil and good because its actually a currency.",

Bank transaction has failed there customers several times maybe because of network or something else,another example: people collecting money from ATM machine can testify to this, sometimes you will need this money urgently at that particular time but getting to the bank seeing the queue and population not only that the ATM machine will disappoint you, I have been in this situation before where my card got swallowed by the ATM machine. There was a time my country was suffering from money scarcity due to the changing of old naira notes and to get access to your own money was a problem but I can testify people who got bitcoin sold there bitcoin and they lived there normal lives despite the economic situation at that time.I feel it doesn’t fit in having to compare or place side by side the bitcoin innovation and the ATM machine. Coming to talk about queues, the machine having to trap your card and the possibility of a transaction declined or failure.The ATM is a machine that dispenses, make transfers, pay bills and new models can even collect deposits.Not like bitcoin which is a currency that functions on a blockchain network. They don’t come together! The other dispenses money (fiat) while the other is money in itself.Again, bitcoin has come to cut through time and space with regards to its nature of transacting and doesn’t necessarily require a third party in making these debit/credit facility possible but, in the phase of acceptability, we most times still need to convert our precious Sats to fiat currencies before it could be accepted by merchants for exchange of products and services.Hence, I can categorically tell you that, in the phase of fiat scarcity in Nigeria at the time, bitcoin users were very much affected as, you still have to convert these bitcoins to fiat to make it usable with merchants that accept bitcoins not readily available. Doing this, drags you down the lane of going through the slow and limit restricted transactions that was the case at that time.",
