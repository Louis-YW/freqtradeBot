So it will become new BNB, ADA, DOT, SOL, AVAX, TRX, ATOM and dozen more? Smart contract platform based on POS consensus. Man its not like they are about to create something new. That they solve problem that was never solved before. They just solve a problem that only they had. There are many cheap and fast SC platforms.What was the advantage of eth over dozens of other projects was high decentralization thanks to POW at the expense of higher transaction costs. Now it will be just like other POS coins. Nevertheless, it may increase project value in long term (years) but its not guaranteed. Whats much more probable is that the \"buy rumours sell the facts\" will come true again and we will see massive dump (for months). Just like ADA released its product (after 5 years of pumping based on promises) in SEP 2021 (?) and was one of the biggest loosers of this bear market.",

We would not know, it's not happening yet. We are just speculating here. It will depend on how the market will react after the merge. You are looking at just the whales but what about the retail investors and those who have been clinging to their Ethereum for a long time and expecting something far greater will happen? We have different opinions about this and I have been seeing bad and good reactions in different people. IMO, I will keep my Ethereum no matter what happens because I can still see it as being one of the top contenders in the crypto industry.",

When we were waiting for them to solve this high gas fee has passed and as such most good and quality projects have adopted to other options out their which are the bsc, Sol, Trx, Polygon etc. Eth will be scars and more valuable if they can give us something different again rather than what we are seeing on other smartchain.",

I am a number one believer of ethereum, and i believe that after the high gas fee on ethereum network resolve ethereum will surely rise, there are so many reason why ethereum is always rank #2 on CMC even if there are a lot of network that is very low on transaction fee they are still rank next to ethereum it is simply because many people still trust on ethereum than others.",

ETH is the first pioneer of smart contracts where many quality Tokens are built on the ETH network, while others just follow what ETH is doing by minimizing fees for transactions.So after this merger ETH has been able to solve the problems that have existed so far, of course this is a positive impact considering that most people who use the ETH network are just whales but now everyone can follow.",

Do you think that this merge is not the only reason why Ethereum is hype these days? Even Bitcoin is dumping while the merge will just change the protocol of Ethereum to PoS which will make it prone to manipulation. Give me a solid argument on how will ETH will gonna beat all odds of dumping this market by just a simple merger? They might be an improvement on overall performance of ETH but still ETH blockchain is still inferior to other new blockchain in terms of TPS and transaction fee.Where will the new demand will come from while ETH is already existing and hype for so many years? I don’t see any game changing improvement of ETH that will end this bear market.",

But for staking, it's only for people with a lot of ETH because it requires a lot of ETH. But we can try to benefit from other means.

I think you need to do your research. 1. The merge does not scale Ethereum, it moves it to POS. 2. POS funds are not unlocked at the merge, that will happen a year from now.3. Sharding is on the roadmap for completion by 2032 and this sharding is for data used by L2s, not for transactions. The hype surrounding the merge has peaked and we have entered a sell the news scenario. I am pivoting into MATIC and ICP, projects that actually scale for real world use. You won't ever catch me paying 500 usd transaction fees on Ethereum again now that there are better alternatives.",

That actually has the sense but we can't assume also that the pump will continue as the corrections seem inevitable as well. It is for now we have seen the surge, price moving high together with Bitcoin and I don't just think about it solely because of the merge - as I consider this a usual scenario. In fact, the market doesn't just live in bear season, recovers will come in time. That can be a market coincidence, I see this event become a tool to market recovery and people seem hopeful for the upcoming days as it was getting closer.",

Years of issues with a higher fees, and if they are able to solve this problem especially with the merging, most probably we will see a significant change with ETH and that demand might really increase over time. Right now we are seeing a good pump with ETH and its price is able to reach the $2k mark again though there's a pullback but I think this is just temporary, and the trend will continue once we saw the success of the merging. Many are hyping the market right now actually, not just with ETH but most of the good coins. Lucky to those who bought ETH at the price of $1k before, they made a good profit already.",
