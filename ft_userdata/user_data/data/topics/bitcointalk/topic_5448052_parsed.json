Front and center of these updates is the shift of the Maximum Fair Price (MFP) from being based on Bitcoin to now being pegged to the US Dollar (USD). This change is significant, aiming to bring more stability and clarity to the MFP system, particularly in the context of the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.https://blog.clore.ai/understanding-maximum-fair-price-mfp-on-the-clore-blockchain-the-shift-to-usd-5bb4e4d79f57",

This update brings several exciting new features and improvements:Changelog:-You can now use the flight sheet in hive as a background job. If someone rents your server, the flight sheet will be unset to prevent interference with the user's workload. After the rental period, the flight sheet will automatically reset.Important Note: If you have a machine on Clore with the flight sheet disabled, and it's running on v5.1, you can enable it. Clore will auto-kill the flight sheet in a few seconds if needed. If your machine is not on v5.1, do not enable the flight sheet.- We have resolved issues related to overclocking to ensure smoother performance.- When rented, the system ensures that the hosting provider sets a default power limit, core, and memory clock offset to prevent any potential issues for clients.Additionally, all new machines will receive backend v5.1. Machines currently running v4 and v5 will be automatically updated to v5.1, so no action is needed on your part.We have also updated our README: https://gitlab.com/cloreai-public/hosting/-/blob/main/readme.md?ref_type=headsAlso: please note that we have temporarily turned off Clore Auto Mining. We are working on bringing it back with much better functionality soon.",
