A customer has a specific need for testing and once it works, if they can get it to work, then they can do it differently.But for now, it needs to be 1 address.Mycelium used to work that way, but for some reason when I imported my key when I sent the change went to a different address. And you can't even import into the iphone version. I could give the 2 people who have iphones cheap android devices if needed if it still did it.Yes, I know I am trying to fix a problem that should not exist, but for testing sanding the funds from A -> B -> A while working on issues is just easier then A -> B -> C -> D and so on. As I said, eventually if it makes it past the lab testing stage it will do it.-Dave",

How about freezing other addresses and then since electrum allows you to make a choice of whether you will want a separate addresses for each change or using the originating addresses for change.  You can change that by going to tools- preference- transaction tab  (this has been moved to fee selection window) and then switch off the use of separate address for change. Then since the other original address are freeze with coin control the change can possible go back to the that address left unfreeze. You can try it and see maybe it could work",

No just a regular private key, the issue I was having was that I just imported a key into an existing wallet. Now that I created a wallet with just the 1 private key it works. The people who had existing wallets will just have to open the testing one or their live one. This is what happens when I try to figure out a simple thing before coffee and then it becomes more difficult then it has to be.-Dave",

Yeah, that's not going to work for the purpose you mentioned in the OP. As you surely realized after drinking your coffee, the wallet you imported your private key into is probably a standard wallet with a seed loaded into Electrum, allowing it to create change addresses unless you turn off that option manually from the settings.",

The only repercussion on doing this is you can’t do RBF on your transactions for whatever reason. But this is the feature you are looking for judging your explanation.",

I mean, maybe they are looking to solve a problem that doesn't need solving that way because there are other better ways to go about it.Goes back to what I said, they took over a project with some really crappy code and instead of starting from scratch they are trying to fix it.Short (but still long) version. They want to repair BATMs they want to have the ability to send BTC from any of the techs phones and receive to the same address. At least that is the theory. This way it all stays in a loop for now and the only cost is TX fees. It's for the short to medium term.For now, the problem is accounting. Where did DaveF send the funds? Where did the change go? Pmalek was supposed to get $50 in BTC from the machine what address did it go to? This way at least all the funds stay in that loop.The plan in the long term is for the home office to be running an app that has the master public key for all the phones so it can monitor what went where and so on.For now, they have this mess.Here is the kicker....THEY ARE NOT A CRYPTO COMPANY...THEY HAVE JUST ABOUT NO IDEA HOW CRYPTO WORKS. But, they have been repairing ATMs and self checkout kiosks and Slot machines and the like for years so they figured this should be an easy fit. <cut to laughter, they said easy HAHAHAHAH>They took over a small company that was doing BATM repair but just the assets, the staff all left as of Sept 30th. So the Tech / Hardware side is close enough to fake it. The other stuff, yeah not so much. And instead of hiring someone they just deal with me and a couple of other IT support people and ask questions like they did, which I then passed on to the forum. -Dave",
