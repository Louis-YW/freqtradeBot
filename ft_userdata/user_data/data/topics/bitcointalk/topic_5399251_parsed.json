After trying to reach the support I haven't received any reply for a several days:But still, the fact that support does not respond for several days does not mean that the site is a scam. Some well-known exchanges that have been operating on the market for years are also famous for their poor support and respond to tickers for a very long time, for example, the same Bittrex or poloniex was once famous for it.Therefore, although I am inclined to believe that you are right that CriptoDebit.com is a scam, but still long responses from technical support are not yet an indicator of a scam. In any case, I want everything to end well for you and you can withdraw your funds from this dubious service.Agreed, anyway, I knew what I was doing and was be ready to such situation  I just can't find enough info about the site.PS. If the support will reply and I'll get a virtual card – I will absolutely update the thread.",
