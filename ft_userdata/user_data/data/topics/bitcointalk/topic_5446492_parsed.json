  "content": "Good day moderators, top-ranked members, and my cohort buddies, I am here to announce that I have triumphantly opened a new business for my wife but first I want to tell those that have not yet invested in Bitcoin and those that have no other investment outside Bitcoin. Now I have lean to have more than one investment, it's never advised to have only one investment because in case one of the investment slide to the ground, the other investment can help to put together another, and if someone has only one way of getting money he can't handle some little money situation that's why I have decided to open a fish üêü üç£ ¬†farm for my wife. This Bitcoin talk forum has helped me in so many ways by learning more about bitcoin and how to pay bills with bitcoin and all that, so before I do not have any other means of getting money except my work and bitcoin investment, so now I opened a fish farm. The reason why I chose a fish farm business for my wife is that I don't see any stress in fish farming except for feeding and water changes. And these are the pictures of the fish farm. my wife fish farmI have achieved a lot through Bitcoin and if am not mistaken this is the 3rd time bitcoin has helped me, 1, I paid hospital bills with bitcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437892.msg61701220#msg617012202, I renovated my parent's house with the profits I made through Bitcoin. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444820.msg61909719#msg619097193, and now I have opened a fish üêü ¬†farm from some sales I made through bitcoin.",

      "body": "There have been many achievements that you have done with Bitcoin. But my question is, what are some of the Bitcoin investments you have made to earn some passive income with Bitcoin? Are you an active trader or do some investments that refer to the crypto ecosystem (not only on Bitcoin). Real things like this that are assisted by bitcoin, are a strong incentive for others to know what you are doing. Maybe many of your friends are asking how you did all that. Paying hospital bills from Bitcoin income, renovating your house from Bitcoin income and the latest now is building a Fish Farming Business for your wife using Bitcoin profits. It would be quite amazing if you explained it in detail, and whether you would accept Bitcoin payments in the fish farming business.",

That's a good idea, as important is to do DCA in BTC, diversifying of investment is also as important. This will open new ways for you to earn money like if you grow more then you can use BTC as payment method which in return will give you more profits maybe loss but in long term that will be beneficial for both of you. Because businesses have some types like short term and long term, i do not know what's the demand of fish in your region but if its high then you should consider to do it for long term and in long term, BTC as payment could give you more benefits. I read, how you use BTC for renovating your parent's house and to pay medical fees, that is so encouraging, i also want to add some of my events in which BTC helped me a lot like in my studies to meet my own personal expenses sometimes i can bear the expenses of my home too. I know that's not that much but it helped my alot.",

I think we need to share more positive stories about btc with real life, and see how it is solving problems for many people in different places. Perhaps newcomers need to see these and not be skeptical of the risk they are taking on themselves.For me BTC over the years has changed not only living conditions but also knowledge as it helps me understand the economy better, as well as realize that life is sometimes complicated and difficult. It's just a useful lesson we need to learn.",

      "body": "Congratulations on this milestone mate. This is a good achievement indeed. You made a good decision in doing this investment. Just like the saying that says \"do not carry all your eggs in one basket\" you did exactly like that by taking into consideration agriculture as an investment from the profits of bitcoin. As an agriculturist by profession, I have of recent talked talked to youths into agriculture about bitcoin and they have keyed into it some are currently accepting bitcoin as means of payment while some are still learning about it. I have also advised some youths too to key into agriculture production with their bitcoin profits as I did in my own fish farm and some are currently working on it.I am so glad to have seen this post. It gives me joy that members here are proud of their agricultural investment. I hope you will make available bitcoin payment as a means of transaction for purchasing of fish from your farm upon maturity and point of sales.",

Because some women don't like to involve themselves in such business that will not make them to look good on the time. Well, if BTC is legal tender in that environment, I will advise you to tell your wife to accept BTC as a payment so that it will attract more bitcoiners to follow her to purchase fish from her and to also attract other people to have interest in BTC. Don't forget to also teach your wife how to invest in BTC, so that she will not be saving the money in the bank than to invest them in BTC.",

Also I think it will be great if you gave us a back story of your success like are you a crypto trader or did you buy bitcoin in 2016? Your account is relatively new, and judging by the things you say you have been able to do with bitcoin tells me you‚Äôre not a newbie.

And if your wife's business is successful and generates a lot of profit, you can increase your bitcoin purchases and take advantage of new business goals.and to cultivate catfish there must be a market, there must be a place where the products are disposed of, have you ever thought of that. And when it comes to risks, hatcheries have the biggest risk because the risk of fish death is much higher depending on the care so that the catfish stay healthy and not sick.I pray that your catfish farming business with your wife will be successful and provide good profits and don't give up easily, keep getting up and keep trying until your goals are achieved.",

From what I know, you'd still need an ample amount of knowledge regarding water chemistry, aqua veterinary, and pipe fitting. Not to mention the need for marketing and maintaining a good supply of fish on your local for your business to become profitable in the long run.",

However, since it is a notable advise not to invest all of one's eggs into one basket, and for that reason you have chosen fish farming as your \"Plan B\", I was expecting maybe you will say you adopt or wish to adopt Bitcoin as a means of payment for your small fish farming business. But you never said anything of such @ O.P., as that would have been a very good initiative.",

I will also say that I am happy if it was through this forum that you were able to learn that aspect of building wealth.QuoteThe reason why I chose a fish farm business for my wife is that I don't see any stress in fish farming except for feeding and water changes. That's not really true. If you don't manage your fish farm so well, there can be a high rate of mortality (fingerlings dieing) in your farm. That's one challenge. Another challenge is that if you are not lucky to buy the first breeds of fingerlings to be hashed, you may end up buying the second stage which doesn't show a very fast growth like the first stage would.Thirdly, you need to always take note of their growth almost every month, to¬† separate the fast growing ones from the smallest ones, otherwise the big ones will eat up the small fish.Also, you need to protect the farm so that the predator doesn't intrude and eat up your fish, which can result in losses.You have to know the type of feed to give them and at what stage to change their feed; otherwise, you may not get the best growth for those fish.You need frequent supplies of water to keep up with the routine change of water since it's not an earthen pond.handling a fish farm requires enough attention and not just as easy as you assumed, I wish you success.",
