Do you think Mendoza is strong enough to beat the current champion?He is capable of beating Tszyu remember he is the one who handed Fundora his first by technical knockout, Mendoza has fast hands good movement in the ring, and packs power on both hands, this is not an easy fight for Tszyu and this could be his biggest challenge to date/But I'm pretty sure Tszyu can handle the pressure here and will eventually win by a split decision he is more technical and more powerful between the two, this is an exciting fight and should not be missed.",

But obviously, Jermell opted to fight Canelo and for more money. It's supposedly Charlo defending his belt against Tim and then Charlo got hand injuries and so the scheduled fight has been postponed for a long time and it's good as I have said that he is now a full champion not just a interim belt holder.And since the fight is to be on his hometown Australia again, it can boost his confidence to really perform to his fans just like what he did against Tony Harrison. Hopefully though there will be no home decision if the fight is close and gets to the judges score card as it still fresh on how Jeff Horn won over Manny Pacquiao when others saw that the legendary Pacman won that fight clearly.",

I mean, there are only a handful of boxers who managed to beat Pacman during his prime. From what I remember, it's just Marquez, Mayweather, and Erik Morales – those were legit defeats. He did lose to Bradley, but that one was kinda controversial in my book, although Manny did manage to redeem himself in the rematch.Now, as for this upcoming fight, I think I'm gonna be rooting for Tszyu to take the win. Not just 'cause he's fighting in his home turf, but because I genuinely think he's the better fighter. It's kinda like the opposite of the Pacman vs. Horn fight we always bring up.",

I mean Tim is already tough, good solid puncher, can take punch as well, has the stamina to last full 12 rounds and his fundamentals and technicals are not that bad.Mendoza is also a decent boxer, not mediocre, on any given night might pull some upset win.But I guess Tim is ready here and obviously wanted to face Charlo next. So mostly this is a tune up for Tim again as he is waiting for Jermell Charlo for a long time and after Mell's lost to Canelo for sure he will go back to 154 lbs and claim his belt again.",

Though I don’t think Mendoza can knock out Tszyu and maybe Tszyu can bring a big game on this and will win via knock out, that is what more exciting here and as expected Tszyu is still the favorite here.",

My vote's going to Tszyu on this one – that makes it 3-1 now.I agree that this is only a warm-up because you cannot just rush to fight every difficult boxer in your weight division since you have the belt and you just simply wait for challengers because they would come to you and get the belt from you. it seems to me that this is an easy money and easy fight for Tszyu as well because he is not fighting against a hard puncher nor a knockout artist, all he needs to do is keep his stamina efficient throughout the rounds and avoid some power punches as much as possible and always counter it with some solid punches. that would be easy for him and will earn himself another easy win.",

They could make Tszyu a big favorite, but that's kinda expected, right? He's the champ, and he's fighting in his home country. Honestly, I don't know much about Mendoza as a boxer, but your post has piqued my curiosity. I might just check out how he managed to win against Fundora. Until then, I'll hold off on casting my vote.",

And I do like Tim's attitude though, I mean he wants to be the next great Australian boxer like his father but making his own name at 154 lbs. Hopefully though, if ever he beats Mendoza, Jermell Charlo will give Tim his deserved shot at the other belts he held, although not sure if the other organizations has stripped him of his other super welterweight belt.",

So, I'd say he's definitely a KO artist. Plus, if you check out his last two fights, both ended in knockouts.Now, when it comes to Mendoza, he can also fit the KO artist category, with 16 KOs in 22 wins. It seems like Mendoza might not pose a significant threat to Tszyu. After all, Tszyu's got some serious boxing skills, and you can clearly see his ring IQ in action. He's the kind of fighter who believes he doesn't have to win by KO every time; what matters most is getting that win.",

He will have to work very hard and try to outslugged his opponent, in a hard and grind fight that's why I would say that Mendoza is tailor made for Tim here and it will show his talent. But he shouldn't underestimate Mendoza as well, he could be very well ready on what Tim will give him in this fight. So mental preparation is already very important here. Charlo even predicted that Tim will win and by knockout, but eventually this is what the fans are wanting to see, Charlo that lost to Canelo going back to claim the WBO belt as he was stripped already. However, WBC doesn't follow what the WBO did here, so Charlo still has the belt and so if Tszyu wins here, definitely the fans are going to clamour for them to fight each other. After all, Tim is the mandatory challenger for Charlo and they were supposed to fight a couple months back.",

It's not directly related, but it's kinda like how we all interpret things differently, so we might not necessarily agree.Now, speaking of heavy favorites, it's pretty obvious that Tszyu is the one in this case. However, that doesn't automatically guarantee his victory. Remember, odds can be deceiving. Sometimes they're overvalued, and that's exactly why the public can easily fall into the trap.",
