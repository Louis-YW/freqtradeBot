You can either sell for profit now and proceed to purchase when and if the price drops again; as you said yourself, you're afraid that Bitcoin will fall back to $17,000. The risk with this option lies in the event that Bitcoin never crashes to such a low point and you may be susceptible to repurchasing Bitcoin at a much higher price.On the other hand, you can proceed to hold your Bitcoin and stop bothering about volatility and the prices in general, and wait until its price reaches a level that personally satisfies you. The latter option may require months or even years to achieve a decent yield, while the first one may allow you to slowly build up revenue through trading, provided that things go your way at least.",

If you are really a long term investor then youll set aside the temptation to sell off some of your profit, remember that bitcoin is far from ATH and we can always speculate that it will surpass that at one point. So better just do dca and youll be good. Dont mind these pump and dump event, just generally do whats suited for you as a long term investor and not just a trader.",

We have to wait for the right time.",

You should also be clear with yourself about your goals when it comes to profiting from investing in Bitcoin, i.e. whether you will be satisfied with a small profit or will you still wait for a much higher price than the one that is today.At the end of the day, if you are really afraid that the price will fall again, maybe you should sell part of it and keep the rest for some more profitable days.",

Now you see that fund left that you won't mind losing, now reinvest that into the market and go on with your daily activities without caring what happens to that fund or the market entirely. The only reason you're this worried about your investment when the market hasn't even started is because you over Invested and now scared of losing that money.Long term investment should be long term and not getting distracted by any small price movement of the market. Since you want to invest for long term, do as I say above and things will be easier for you. Also go get a Job if you don't have one so you can meet up your day to day needs while leaving your seed (investment) to mature properly.",

It is understood that the market is likely to get stronger later, the market was in a bearish position for a long time but now the market is again in an upward position.

You have only recently come to the forum and were only going to learn about bitcoin and maybe buy it. It is obvious to assume that even if you tried to buy bitcoin, it is unlikely that you bought a lot for a large amount. Now that we consider your profit, is it worth it to buy at a good price and sell today to get only a few dozen?As far as I understood from your attitude in the past, you are ready to be a holder. For some time, cultivate the will in yourself not to look in or check your wallet account, and set yourself a deadline.Although you may be satisfied with a small profit in such a short time, you are still the master of your actions.",

You can invest by buying bitcoins at very low prices. You bought between $17,000 and now stands at $22,000. Even if you have a share of profit here, you forget about this profit and hold on to your investment. The market may not return to $17,000 again.You hold onto your bitcoins for the future. Bitcoin market is going to get better very soon. The market was in a dumping condition for a long time now the market is temporarily pumping. You don't stop here. You hold your investment tightly until bitcoin new ATH is generated. Very soon the market will form a new record where you can make enough profit.",
