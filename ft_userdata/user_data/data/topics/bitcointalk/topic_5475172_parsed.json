For clarity's sake, Hamas is a Sunni Islamist political and military organization that is in control of the Gaza Strip. Wars are not declared by public opinion. I have never seen any country where the citizens are asked to come and vote on war issues. The planning and execution of the attack on Israel was kept secret from the public, so the majority of people in Gaza knew nothing about the attack on Israel by Hamas so you cannot generalise that Palestinians supported the attack on Israel. I don't think anybody would blame an average citizen for the war in Gaza.I think think we have s that thirteen hostages which include Thirteen Israeli citizens and 11 foreign nationals have been released today as part of the process to release about 50 women and children Israeli hostages. I think this is the first stage towards a peaceful resolution of this problem. There is no need for name calling or accusation regarding the war, this way need to stop. We have had enough death, it is time to stop the killing and seek for peace.",

You should stop watching propaganda \"news\" and read a history book sometime.Hamas isn't some foreign force coming from another country or planet to fight its war in other people's homes!!!! Hamas is the Palestinians who have been getting killed for the past 70+ years. People who have had their children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. murdered by the Israeli terrorists. They are forced to pick up arms at some point and try to defend their homes against the invaders.When any bloodthirsty organization keeps murdering people, there is always resistance forming against them. Whether it is 1940's and resistance is forming in Europe against the invading Nazis or it is the past 70 years and resistance is forming in Palestine against the invading Zionists.They are all the same in nature. The only difference is that the propaganda outlets have been introducing the Palestinian resistance against invasion and genocide with an ugly face. And in the past month they are trying to tell those who know nothing of history that the genocide of Palestinians is happening for the first time and it is all because Hamas attacked first! They never tell you that Palestinians were being murdered by the Israeli terrorists for decades. They never tell you that for example there were no Hamas in the 80's when Israeli terrorists slaughtered 6000 innocent people in Sabra and Shatila where they even killed animals so that no living thing is left there!",

So even if they did not plan to do any of this, they seem to be very happy and showing much enthusiasm for it to continue to happen.

If you looked you would know who's side you should be, Israel stole that land from the Palestinians anyway so how the hell are you not siding with the oppressed.

Clearly this isn't about preventing terrorism, that is just the excuse Israel uses to carry out an ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.This has been the strategy of this terrorist organization from the start. They knew early on that they are hated globally so they tried to reduce that hatred by dropping a bomb (metaphorically) in the media and while everyone was busy debunking that nonsense they committed more horrifying crimes against humanity.For example in early days they dropped the bomb about Hams having beheaded children and while the entire mainstream media was busy debunking that clear bullshit AI generated picture, the Israeli terrorists were actually burning Palestinian children by dropping napalm, phosphorous bombs on them.Same with the bullshit they started about hospitals and while again the world was busy debunking that, the Israeli terrorists attacked a dozen other hospitals and medical centers murdering more and more innocent civilians.Guess what. Even now that they've been defeated and were forced to accept a ceasefire and release the hostages they were torturing in their prisons for years (some for nearly 10 years) these terrorists have pulled out of Gaza but started murdering Palestinians in West Bank!The bottom line is that the ethnically cleansing of Palestinians will not end until the terrorist organization is dismantled. The silver lining is that the days of the Zionist regime are numbered and the more innocent blood they shed the closer they get to that inevitable demise.",

Having said that I believe that every country in this world owes it's citizens the  right of protection, so if an external force attacks them in their territories, they have the right to defend and respond in equal terms. So on that I can not blame the IDF for responding to the killings and threats on their citizens, because if they don't greater calamity from the enemy can befall on them. Only it's very unfortunate that in the process of driving their enemies, innocent citizens of Palestine, are victims of their defense mechanism.
