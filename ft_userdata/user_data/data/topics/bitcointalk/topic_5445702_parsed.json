So what do I do now that the money is legal in my hand?You are the ones who would be making out a decision whether you would be telling your wife that you are the ones who do took the money and tell her the truth that you would be using it on trading or you would really be just playing along on what you had started and never ever confess that you did such act. In speaking about trading then it wouldnt really be an assurance that you would really be able to grow that $200specially when you are still a noob. We know that trading is never been that simple which anyone could end up profitable overnight.It would be taking a long time and lots of efforts and time you would be needingto spend to make yourself that able to be called as a trader. It would be lots of trial and error which you would really be able to experience.",

      "body": "So you dont have a job?  Did you rely on your wife's money?In trading, there should be a stable source of income that can be sustained if ever you will lose trading.  Because in trading, there is no guarantee to make a profit, it could be one day you will gain profit or it could easily wipe out your wallet. The $200 capital is quite good for new traders, but only if this amount can afford to them to lose.I recommend finding an exchange that has copy trading which easily for you to follow the trend of the most progressive traders, AFAIK, eToro exchange has this kind of feature but $200 isn't a good start there.So good luck if you really try it out but make sure you have a backup plan.",

Remember, it's important to realize that trading isn't a straightforward process of buying low and selling high because you'll be competing with other individuals who are more intelligent, corporations that possess greater access to valuable information, and people who have more experience, connections, or wealth than you.And if you're an average Joe with no day job and are planning to use your wife's money to trade without a clear understanding of what you're doing, it's likely that your decision will cause more harm than good.I maybe harsh, but come on, sometimes we do need some reality check.",

Where you can double your money, but there are also chances of losing your money.Always put money into cryptocurrency trading that you don't need when you need it.So that you don't have to sell your assets at a loss in times of need.At $200 you can trade but you will have to wait a long time to get profit.Because it is obvious that the more capital you invest, the more profit you will get, and if any business is started with less capital, it will take a lot of time to get more profit.And you need to be more careful in trading with borrowed money because any wrong trade can make you lose money.",

You don't know how to trade yet and you've taken 200 bucks from her without informing her.Outside of family matters, if it's only between you and your wife, the mum shouldn't intervene with whatever you do with both's money. Whether you take hers or she takes yours, what's important is both of you are giving consent to each other or at least giving each other the idea on what you'll do with the money.",

Better to ask your wife if its ok to borrow here money instead of getting it. Anyway, trading can be very risky but with your knowledge, making profit out of that money are also possible. Futures can be the best option but since you are still a newbie, try to learn it first for a week and do your research first. Watch some trading vlog in Youtube, and google the indicators, that can be a big help for you.",

As trading is subject to market risks, that is you have enough chance to make loss as well as profits, but as you have used your wife’s money, so when you will make loss, she will also suffer through it. Moreover if you are a beginner at trading, then I would suggest to have theoretical knowledge at first. Do proper research on when does the price of a particular coin increase, which factors affect the price, and how can you minimise the risks involved. After mastering or learning these, it’s advised to use real money for trading. I won’t say anything more, rest decision is upto you. Wishing you all the best for your trading future.",
