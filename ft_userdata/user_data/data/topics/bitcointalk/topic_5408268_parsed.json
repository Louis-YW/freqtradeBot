  "content": "Hi guys.  I have bought many coin the past with metamask. I have an iphone and a desktop on mac.  I have used both firefox in the past and recenty chrome to buy coins.  the past few days I have beeng getting the Ipfs gateways is down error and whenever I go to buy the coins it doesn'st \"flash the confirm\" sign for me to ok the purcahse of the coin.  Its not the custom coin address and the slippage is plenty high. I go into pancake swap on my mac and take a picture of the qr code with the walllet connect blue wave logo.  the bnb balance wil show up on the metamask.  there is enough of a baance to buy the coins but the confirm coin won't come up? I would prefer not to relaod the app entirely as I would have to reload all the custome little altcoins over again.  any ideas? thanks.",
