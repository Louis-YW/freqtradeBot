Bitcoin is the most important asset in crypto and we're excited to do our part to enable faster/cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Will take some time to integrate so please be patient.I am a trader and what I have noticed about OKX and Binance lightning network integration is that I hardly use altcoins to make transaction on these exchanges if I want to send part of my trading fund across exchanges and also if a friend want to accept it as payment and not want to send it directly on my noncustodial wallet. The fee is always very cheap and the transaction is fast.Do not hold your coins on exchanges, I am only talking about my trading fund and trading fund profit (if I have). Not your key not your coin.I am not a Coinbase users, but I think this would be helpful for Coinbase users as well.",
