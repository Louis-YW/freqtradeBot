Surely he will still post about the progress and development of the exchange. He will be like the new ELON shills. But he mentioned he will explore defi so expect some pumps on alts that will be touch by him.Expect some more launchpad projects that will enter binance as new ceo will likely drive the price as it goes down by more than 10%",

I remember a case about Arthur Hayes, everything will become a thing of the past over time. And above all, after the news of this event, we don't feel this clearly enough to cause FUD, perhaps all agreements will soon be exposed.It is possible that the process of transferring power in the crypto market is gradually undergoing innovation, as during the development process we have also witnessed the birth of many new products to replace old products, and this time It is unlikely that Binance will continue to maintain their position.",

If he is pleaded guilty, he might have taken responsibility for others actions and not only his. Binance is a big company with different departments and branches. So, he is not the only one making decisions. But lets see how Binance will be managed with the new CEO. And Remember, Elon resigned as CEO of twitter but we hardly talk about the new CEO cos we still feel like Elon controls twitter.",

I can't even imaging how careless a CEO would perform when their company is one of the top exchanges in the world, having a very excellent reputation and trust worthy. It reminds us once more that no exchange is worthy of holding your coins for you, but rather just use them according to their name as an exchange and nothing more.http://",

Well, with the remarkable background of the new leader and CEO, we can still have confidence that Binance will remain strong and still in the right direction. I was certain that Mr. Teng as the new CEO knows the best thing to do in order to avoid such issues again. Might CZ be at fault for not anticipating the situation but his contribution is huge enough that every Binance user will forget.",

With the help of this new binance CEO, it will help the team to eliminate many court case that is affecting the binance for their users not to invest more money on binance than to wait for the court case to be eliminate from the court before they can have full confident to increase their capital in binance.Richard Teng  will surely introduce his own policy that will attract more users to see more improvement in some altcoins that will give investors some suitable profits to earn in the binance.",

Currencies or Binance Launchpad will change the prices of altcoins.As the position of binance CEO falls on Richard Teng, if CZ decides pulling the string of power behind the scene, then the new CEO will be a figurehead as you said. It's quite hard for a business executive to involuntarily vacates his office, and not try to influence his authority from the background, they'll reason that the business is their sweat and won't like for any other person except them to make major decisions. In such situations if the new CEO defies orders from above, that could be the beginning of the end for the company. Hopefully the transition will go smoothly, where CZ will stay on advisory level, so binance can still maintain it's top level exchange that we know and trust.",

No large company is lead by a single person but Changpeng Zhao was the front face for binance. As the SEC got involved in the running of not only the Binance US but the overall corp, they needed some scapegoat to go clean. Normally we say SEC put some conditions which the binance complied which included the resignation of CZ. But it reality SEC is a corrupt institution that extorts and just wanted money from Binance and put up the resignation as face saving. CZ could still be involved in binance and can't rule out them selling their share of BNB to get out of this headache.",

I have huge expectation with new Binance CEO Richard Teng will make Binance have good progress in the future and not make the same mistake like CZ, he keep make his exchange away from money laundering and never find problem with SEC Commission. I think Binance still most trusted global exchange although CZ have sacked from CEO but I doubt he has function behind Binance operation although he was not CEO again.",

Kraken is in soup once again, not sure which exchange will be the next target but it doesn't affect CZ as he still holds large swathes in Binance. We the common people should be more careful than ever and shouldn't fall for the trap. Anyways CZ stepping down is best for Binance after being involved in such activities.",
