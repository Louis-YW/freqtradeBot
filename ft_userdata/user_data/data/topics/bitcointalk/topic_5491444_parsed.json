Just to take a vacation and enjoy the country's friendliness towards bitcoin. And don't worry about crime in El Salvador. because it seems that their president, Nayib Bukele, has made the country much safer from crime during the period he was president. And fortunately he was re-elected as president there. Even though it is not completely free from crime, the crime rate there seems to be decreasing based on news reports spread on the internet.And yes, I also heard that tourism in the country has increased interest or visitors after adopting bitcoin as a legal means of payment. So I hope there is someone here who has visited there. or at least have the desire to go there. And want to share the story here.",

It seems that no one has been to El Salvador in this forum, that would be a really awesome thing if someone would share their travel experience. I haven't even seen yet any people that are from that country too, no one shared their experience yet as an El Salvadorian so it's still a mystery to me and it's weird that we haven't seen any kind of interaction from them in the forum too, by now there should be some people in that country that would stumble across this forum by chance since bitcoin is a big deal there already right?",

El Salvador is still a country with one of the highest crime rate and it's not only about crime, criminals there are brutal killers who torture people. I personally wouldn't risk it, doesn't worth for me.By the way, I saw Cointelegraph's video about that a year ago and would love to share it:",

Because they are not Bitcoin investors and hodlers so with legal tender, they are forced to accept & receive bitcoins while they don't want it.If their bussiness is small, their budget for bussiness operation with volatile price of Bitcoin.

Still, it’s nice to know that there is a step towards adaptation of bitcoin somewhere in the world.",

Soon I have heard that they are also interested in giving people the options to invest in the coins with exciting investment plans. So yes we need to praise El Salvador for their bold decisions.",

Personal experience will be different from videos because everyone will have a unique experience. El Salvador also has different regions which might also bring diverse exposure for different tourists. I will not also want to visit El Salvador because of its malfunctioning legal system which has led to the incarceration of many innocent people who didn't receive fair trials. Such a trip will also be expensive for me and I don't want to spend my Bitcoin for now because it's my investment.",

However, do not live in the belief that you will be able to pay with Bitcoin wherever you want just because it is \"legal tender\", things are not exactly what they seem. Younger people who have an entrepreneurial spirit have accepted Bitcoin, while the older ones still prefer to do business with the US dollar, which has been the official currency in that country for more than 20 years anyway. Sometimes it seems to me that some people think that El Salvador is the only place (country) in the world where Bitcoin can be spent in a physical store, but in fact in many countries where Bitcoin is not \"legal tender\" there may be more people who accept Bitcoin than in El Salvador.",

This country continues to show rapid progress and is perhaps one of the countries that many people are interested in visiting.",

I would’ve loved to pay for my hotel stay in bitcoin, but the hotel couldn’t find its POS device. I’d love to pay my rent in bitcoin, but my landlord thought otherwise.

I tried to pay for every single thing with Bitcoin, or satoshis — small amounts of Bitcoin. The information I got.QuoteAs a result, and unsurprisingly, my experience using Bitcoin varies wildly. From Bitcoin maximalist coffee shops running Lightning full nodes to cash-in-hand street merchants on volcano trails who literally cannot access the internet, El Salvador has certainly put a spell on “magic internet money.” I hope this article sheds light on the experience of paying in Bitcoin across the country: an investigative report, light-hearted entertainment, and maybe a handy guide for your trip to spend satoshis in Bitcoin Country.This is to complete the information that needs to be seen: What it’s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador.",

The general theme was that most people don't use bitcoin and they don't use the wallet provided by the government, but some hold bitcoin and treat it like an investment, or a piggy bank. It's not one or the other way round, so people who are enthusiastic about the use of bitcoin in the country are obviously wrong, but people who say there's no use and bitcoin has failed are also wrong. It's an unpopular form of payment, but a popular form of investment. Also, you can pay using lighting in a lot of places.
