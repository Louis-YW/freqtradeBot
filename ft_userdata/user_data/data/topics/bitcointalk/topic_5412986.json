This is a scam website and I wouldn't trust anything I read there including random volume!First thing I noticed is they have fake scam mixer in second place with blendar.com domain, and same thing is for CryptoMixer that leads to suspicious domain cryptomixer-io.net.It's probably the same thing with all other mixing websites they listed.Domain is coming from Ukraine, Sumskaya Oblast :QuoteDomain Name: best-bitcoin-mixer.ioRegistry Domain ID: 8c4f31d1a4144bbcb40f7fff79a9ed08-DONUTSRegistrar WHOIS Server: http://whois.iisp.comRegistrar URL: http://www.nicenic.netUpdated Date: 2022-01-29T00:25:10ZCreation Date: 2022-01-24T00:24:17ZRegistry Expiry Date: 2023-01-24T00:24:17ZRegistrar: NICENIC INTERNATIONAL GROUP CO., LIMITEDhttps://www.whois.com/whois/best-bitcoin-mixer.io",

Anyone who get fooled by this results in search page if will not research properly will become one of those scam victims, worst will blame the legit mixer because of their stupidity. While in the other hand, current legit mixers had almost zero visibility in the search result page using these kind of keywords. The thread[1] regarding trusted mixers shows in the 2nd page which is a bit disappointed, but not surprised considering this forum software is too outdated and not SEO friendly.[1] 2022 List Bitcoin Mixers Bitcoin Tumblers Websites",

And he didn't fail in the trap since he finally used the official Chipmixer's website.As for his problem with CM, which is not one, as the dudes explained to him, is a problem of understanding.Here he opened a topic to ask if the volume is accurateQuote from: PX-Z on September 09, 2022, 01:49:17 PMThat's because I've never SEO'ed the page, unlike scammers like AtoBmixer who bombarded google. The topic ranks well in some countries, but is nowhere to be found in others (like my location) Quote from: The Cryptovator on September 09, 2022, 07:36:07 PMThe use of a mixer is to obfuscate the transaction, not to hide the fact you used a mixer.Quote from: Apocollapse on September 09, 2022, 01:56:15 PM no Wasabi and Chipmixer are included on the listbecause he can't scam playing with Wasabi",

That's the problem of Google SERP old blackhat SEO still works look I already check it on Ahrefs backlinks checker and most of the backlinks are low quality.And you will be noticed most of the backlinks and anchor text under hyperlinks target the keyword \"best bitcoin mixers\" it ranks in the top 2 on the SERP if you add 2022, it also targets other keywords but those keywords are not yet rank to the top. I'm sure it was just built for Churn and burn so later if Google/Penguin update finds out that they manipulate the Google rankings they are automatically outranked and removed from the Google SERP. It doesn't even have a cookie policy and privacy policy which is obvious it was built for scamming purposes.I hope OP does not own the website because he put the link above it will also help to rank up on Google having backlinks here on the forum has a big impact on SEO and I'm sure the owner of the website has lots of experienced in Blackhat SEO using GSA.",

I don't know how blackhat seo works yet but obviously the domain name is really a big factor on this. The keywords used and domain name are exactly the same plus some seo works behind and it comes up a good result on the search page.Legit services like chipmixer and other really should work on their seo too to avoid search results like this.",

There is no ads shows searching using that keyword too. The result is pure SEO tricks and the use of exact the same keyword for domain name.
