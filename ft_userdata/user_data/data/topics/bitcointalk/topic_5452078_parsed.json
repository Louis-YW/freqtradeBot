I would always suggest using a hardware wallet where funds are supposed to be kept safe.  If there is any problem in using hardware wallet then you can use some mobile wallets with more security. You can use Electrum wallet or Mycelium wallet considering the security aspect. These wallets are very secure so hopefully you can keep your bitcoin safe in these wallets.",

But Electrum is the best wallet ever. But this high fee rate in the transaction process is the problem now. Op please don't keep your coins in the exchange platforms but in the wallet.",

If you decide to use a hot wallet, it is one of the three that you have installed. I would trust Electrum, in my opinion, it is the safest wallet as well as the easiest to use, Mycelium is also a good choice but stays away from Trustwallet as it is a closed source, not trusted. But no matter which wallet, your bitcoin is safe or not largely depends on you, not entirely on the type of wallet. If you don't take good care of your seed phrase, then even using a hardware wallet cannot guarantee the safety of your bitcoins. As a newbie, you should spend more time learning about security than thinking about profits.",

Electrum would work as a temporary one for now if you have no funds or still planning to buy, but if you can, buy a hardware wallet immediately. Honestly, I would've probably recommended you to read up on Bitcoin, exchanges, and wallets first before telling you to proceed with your buy orders, but since that's past, we can only go for the next best option temporarily. Honestly, you're doing fine so far, keep using electrum and don't store your coins in exchanges (in this case kucoin), and buy a hardware wallet if you actually can. Also start planning up a plan, maybe DCA as a recommendation since it's a long term investment.",

I don't know what exactly your phone unit model but there are some mobile phones that have a security feature where you can store your wallet securely and safely like Samsung where they have a hidden folder protected by Knox. All my crypto wallets are installed on that Knox-secured folder copy pasting does not work on cross-profile(Or copying data from the secured folder to your personal folder but it works on vice versa) which is safe if you are doing some activity in your phone while your wallet is in a secured folder. If your phone is not Samsung then I think installing a Kaspersky will help you protect your device from any viruses and malware attacks also it blocks some phishing sites but not all phishing based on my experienced so you still need to learn how to avoid those phishing sites.",

I personally use non-custodial wallet, which is secure, despite reports of the exchange's security being breached. Wallet recommendations vary based on the user's level of experience. Following the high gas fees, trust wallet is probably a good option. I would also recommend Binance wallets for quick trade because it is ranked top on the and is well-known in the market.

If you purchase and require shipping to your area, you may pay an additional $10 shipping fee. We can see it is not cheap but not expensive compared to the value that bitcoin will bring us. I know many people will say they don't have money, don't have a lot of bitcoins, and that buying hardware wallets is a waste.

I bought Bitcoin from kucoin, so far it's in kucoinThis is more of a question you could ask in the Beginners & Help section of the Bitcointalk forum but I will gladly answer your question:First of all, do not trust Trustwallet. Ironically, since it is closed-source, it is not a wallet you can trust. Furthermore, it is a wallet which is owned by an exchange; Binance.Do not keep your coins in a third party wallet which can take them away from you at any time for any reason. This goes for all centralized exchanges. Kucoin and Binance included.Mycelium and Electrum are both good wallets but I myself prefer Electrum. And I think most Bitcoiners on this forum would probably say the same thing. Although if you really value your security you should invest in a good hardware wallet, instead. That is the safest and best option currently on the market.",
