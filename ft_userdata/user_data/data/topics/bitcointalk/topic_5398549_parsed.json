Besides the obvious altcoins, I expect BAT and native tokens from investment platforms like Nexo, Crypto.com and Celsius (if Celsius overcomes the reliability issue with customers regards the recent rumours of funds not being safe and delays on withdrawls which caused the CEL token to crash beyond the normal bear market fluctuations and the platform to lose more than 1$ billion dollars in cashouts).",

I meant you must need to realize the fact that when you are seeing the market right now and almost all of coins were dumping so hard caused by the chaos created by terra luna. This being said when the bullish trend will come and you may see so many people are in the hype to buy almost all of coins available in the market except scam token. In my opinion if you must also aware that if picking those during the bearish market will become the best thing to be done.",

BSC is the second big network from ETH network so I think BNB would be a good investment after bear market.",

Expect that those coins will be carried once Bitcoin gains its momentum on the road on another bullish trend.However, our decision should only be decided by ourselves. It's risky to follow others' advice but nothing wrong to refer to those. There's no such thing that we can predict what will happen next that's why even putting money on a coin with potential and real fundamentals, we don't know what will happen next.Buy the dip, buy a much more dip, buy a more dip, dip, dip, let's be careful deciding when to make another entry.",

Some will continue and some will not be able to make it through the long bear season, not to mention the market is always evolving and there will be a lot of new projects coming out to compete. Best to hold bitcoin and ethereum can add BNB because over time only ethereum is the only altcoin that can stand and grow, bnb is probably the new alt like the others but with the support of the binance exchange, I don't think it will be phased out any time soon.",

The token like sandbox and ape may recover again as fast as possible other than the rest in your list.

I mean it has a good community to begin with and the devs and the people behind are very conscious to every suggestions and comments.And as you have said, they have been slowly starting to be integrated to other other networks, so that is a big boost already and a blue print that it could remain in the crypto sphere and survived this bear market.",
