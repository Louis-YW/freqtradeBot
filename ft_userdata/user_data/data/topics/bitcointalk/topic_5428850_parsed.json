      "body": "As the world moves more and more into the digital economy, it is not surprising that cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly popular means of payment. Although there are still skeptics, we are convinced that cryptocurrency is the future of payments for business and everyday use.There are several reasons why we believe this is true. First, cryptocurrency is safe. When you make a payment with cryptocurrency, it is almost impossible for someone to steal your information or hack into your account. This is a huge advantage for businesses that are always at risk of cyber-attacks.Another reason we think cryptocurrency is the way of the future is because of its speed and efficiency. Traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, can take days or even weeks to process a transaction. With cryptocurrency, payments can be processed in just seconds. This efficiency is critical for businesses that need to move quickly.Finally, we believe that over time, cryptocurrency will become more popular and more people will start using it. We are already seeing big companies like microsoft or Shopify start accepting bitcoin as payment, and this trend will continue. As more people become familiar with cryptocurrency and how it works, they are more likely to use it themselves as consumers and businesses.So if you're not already aware of the cryptocurrency revolution, we encourage you to pay attention! Cryptocurrency is the future of payments, and businesses need to be ready for it.Connect the passimpay payment service and accept cryptocurrency for your goods or services. It only takes a couple of minutes to connect via API - passimpay.io",

      "body": "Passimpay's main goal is to improve payment acceptance and take business to the next level by accepting cryptocurrency as payment. Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years, and that's no surprise. They are decentralized - meaning that transactions can be made, without the help of intermediaries such as banks. This makes them much faster and safer than traditional payment methods. Cryptocurrency transactions tend to be cheaper than traditional ones, making them an attractive option for businesses looking to reduce overhead costs.Passimpay is committed to helping businesses take advantage of these benefits by providing a secure platform for accepting cryptocurrency payments. Our team understands the importance of security when dealing with customer data, so we've made security a top priority so that your data always remains in safe hands. We also provide detailed analytics so you can easily track your payments and make informed decisions about how best to manage your finances.😎",

      "body": "Enterprises often experience difficulties with international payments, which in turn, complicates some business processes.One of the main problems of international payments is currency fluctuations. Exchange rates can change quickly and unexpectedly, which means that by the time a payment arrives at its destination, its value may be lower than expected. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to keep an eye on exchange rates and, if possible, use forward contracts or options to lock in an exchange rate for future payments.When transferring cryptocurrency with Passimpay, the exchange rate is fixed. The funds are transferred instantly from account to account.Another problem is the hidden fees and commissions associated with international payments. Banks often charge hefty fees for processing foreign transactions, which can quickly increase if you make frequent payments.At Passimpay, the withdrawal fee for companies is floating but never exceeds 3.5%.Make profitable payments and transfers worldwide, instantly and securely",
