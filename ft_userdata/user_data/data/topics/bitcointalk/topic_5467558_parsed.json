After a more than a year, bitcoin will increase more and reach all-time-high. I do not think we need to read any article about it, it is what we all know on this forum.

      "body": "It would be an anomaly if the price of bitcoin doesn't rise even before and after the halving. It would be the first time it would ever happen, but then this is not going to happen because history always repeats itself. The first bitcoin halving event was on November 28, 2012, bitcoin price rose up to $12.3. In the second bitcoin halving on July 9, 2016, the price increased to $680 and in the third halving on May 11, 2020 bitcoin's price increased to $8,590. You can see that historical evidences. Since that time the interest of the public and institutions in bitcoin has grown. Therefore, we will see a gradual increase in the price of Bitcoin before, during and after the halving in 2024. * www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/* coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-is-bitcoin-halving/",

In this regard I think it is most likely that we will have a bull run after halving and the price will go over $100K. After that I am not sure of anything and given what has happened this cycle I do not trust much of any prediction I see, because there are so many things that can happen that can influence the price and that we cannot foresee a priori, that no matter how much data is taken into consideration and how many charts are drawn, for me they have a low reliability.",

Everyone accumulate bitcoin and so many other currencies because they know that whenever increase occur as a result of halving their holded coins will automatically increase to permit fruitful results to its holders.As previously we experienced that during and after halving the price was so good that everyone take benefit from it therefore buy asset that you can and let wait some months.",

So if this halving is to happen next year, how much are we expecting at first? $70k in the first week? Or $100k?I'm asking because the expectations are very high on this upcoming halving, from the over hyped event it seems we're expecting something more than $70k.I believe similar thing was said to happen this year sometime last year, which didn't, what if we don't have the expected halving come next year?",

Just look at the last halving, we went as low as $3k if I'm not mistaken, but ended up with a bull run of $69k. So most likely if we are going to look at a new all time high, it should be $70k++ as a good starting point.",

I didn't see any moment in my entire crypto journey where BTC got to run higher after halving was done and that's because institutions know very well that people start buying huge chunks of BTC staking their everything just before the halving, and hope that the price will rise. Then these big giants testify the patience of average investors where mostly sell off and move out of the markets, and after few months of halving, BTC skyrockets.",

The new price will probably be witnessed around mid 2025 since the bull run is at its peak almost a year after the halving period has occurred. The only thing that can affect this from repeating it self is some conditions surrounding the market like exchange news and other regulations which could also have there own impact on the the market too",

Im also considering on stashing some altcoins too in my bag on which it would really be that having the potential on additional add up on the time that the market would really be kicking in.We are all anticipating for such event on which it would really be just that normal that positivity and being optimistic which these things would take play.",

I remember during the last Halving where they expected prices to rise when the halving occurred but in fact it happened after 1 year later. Even so, Halving is always the most anticipated moment because it occurs once every 4 years.On the other hand, a strong push for growth related to demand will certainly be something that can cause an increase in the price of Bitcoin. However, it is difficult to predict whether Bitcoin will print a new ATH before the Halving or after the Halving. But the most important thing is that we have Bitcoin in our portfolio, even though the increase will occur after the Halving, we can enjoy the profits that come our way.",

A little or a lot of halving will have an impact on the price of Bitcoin. We can see, that before Halving Bitcoin did experience a sharp decline because many people wanted the price of Bitcoin to be cheaper. But when Halving has occurred the price starts to crawl up and reaches the new ATH. When the 4th Halving in 2024 occurs it will reach a new ATH of around $100k more and this will be my main target next year. Those who are able to survive and not panic about the decline in Bitcoin price, will get comparable benefits.

Also, last year's dump all the way to the $15K zone was the first time Bitcoin dropped below a Previous bull run's all time, which was $20K thanks to the Luna Collapse, FTX collapse and so many different exchanges and projects filling for bankruptcies.So there is always a first time for everything.
