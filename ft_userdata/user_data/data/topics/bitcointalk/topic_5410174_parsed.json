Staking of Ethereum is a good option to generate passive income but we need minimum 32 ETH to qualify for staking which everybody can not afford. It will be interesting to see if ETHW continues working as competitor of Ethereum like ETC and performs to the expectations of its investors then it could be cheaper option for staking. Currently it is listed on coinmarketcap and being traded on many exchanges.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-pow/markets/",

These projects that we are talking about such as btc, eth, etc so forth are all projects that are old and started back when you simply released the project and that was it, these days people literally sell their created tokens for funds to build projects so I do not think that you really need to compare ETH to anything else.If it becomes POS then it becomes POS, it will be supporting smart contracts if they say it will and there is absolutely no other reason to doubt it and do not need to compare it to anything else.",

We saw that in the failed LUNA project where every projects built on the old LUNA migrated with to the new one after it was launched. The difference is just that LUNA created a new blockchain which isn't the case in this ethereum 2.Migration into a new smart contract can happen once they succeed on this migration, this is already expected and probably this can be a good reason for the price pump especially with ETH. There’s a lot of projects now that shows interest to do the migration, and probably ETH pushed this through because they also know that other projects will support this migration.",

It will not change anything other than consensus that being used by ethereum blockchain and so when it goes to the POS and nothing happened with all of smartcontracts that already built in ethereum blockchain. It seems like that if you didn't also understand meaning of this thread as well. If the fork will come and then it will not also change the smartcontract.",
