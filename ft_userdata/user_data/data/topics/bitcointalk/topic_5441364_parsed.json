Obviously banning signature isn't a bad idea since the user is abusing his signature space for scam attempted, apparently trying to trick the unwary user.

For example, help in unbanning or getting a rank. I have not yet seen a single case when someone would decide to proclaim himself a representative of the administration.I don't know any sane person that will want to patronise a painted account. I checked the user's profile and saw that they were already tagged in previous years. At the moment, they've only got just one tag for this act of claiming they're an admin. So, chances of anyone falling for farlack's antics is highly infinitesimal. Thank you for disrupting them more.QuoteInterestingly, such misrepresentation and abuse of the signature should be somehow punished? If not a ban, then disabling the signature, for life.I think the tags are enormous enough for warning the community. That account is already destroyed even without banning it.",
