The administration never tolerates cases of plagiarism, and I do not remember that anyone was able to lift the ban except in a few cases where plagiarism occurred a period of time ago and that the member has proven throughout that period that he is a good member and the group benefits from his presence and that he stopped these practices.After five years, did you remember that you had a banned account that you wanted to recover? This seems a little strange if you are supposed to have turned the page on the past and been preoccupied with other work, especially since you can benefit from the forum in countries where you need to register a membership or log in.What I really think is that over the past five years you have failed to promote a new account due to the difficulty of doing so. So I thought maybe you can recover the banned account.",

In general, proof of the impartiality of the imprisoned member could have taken place immediately after activating the attendance in 2018. According to what I understood, it was plagiarized by numerous publications, and not a one-time mistake.Checking op's posts, I found that he almost publishes a similar topic every year. Do you really think he has better luck this year?In any case, I support you in suggesting lifting the ban on the member and keeping the ban in the signature space display.",

When I say objective, that does not include excuses like \"I'm very sorry\", that's what everyone says in such a situation. Also with all empathy for the disease you are talking about, honestly, that doesn't sound like an argument, more like you're expecting alms.As far as I can see, you are not a bounty hunter, maybe you spammed a little more with your Telegram promotion.

If you created, won't it be nice you bump the topic so that the moderators would have points to base their judgement. You would not be unbanned based how long you have been banned or based on sympathy.

And bitcointalk community is no different as a community of academia's from different works of life and that's why Theymos and others frown badly against any act of plagiarism, so the forum don't degenerate to a copy and paste series.

Often times, people make mistake and get punished just as you got banned. At least you have learned a good lesson, so if the ban gets lifted, you will only use your account when you are in the right state of mind. You could also write more reasons why you think your account should be given a second chance and what lead you to commiting plagerism.",

Your chance is zero.You can not wait 5 or 10 years and come back to say you are deserved a second chance.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 03:57:17 PMThere's been no policy change. redsn0w wasn't permanently banned due to several factors which made me think that permabanning him would be a net negative for the forum. Nobody is banned strictly because of \"the rules\"; it's always handled case-by-case, but almost always, plagiarists deserve to be permabanned.If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.Quote from: hilariousandco on October 25, 2018, 02:10:02 PMSecond chances can be given and you can argue that the punishment is harsh, but at the moment the rules are pretty clear that if you're caught plagiarising then it's a permaban. Once we start making exceptions for people it just opens up a huge can of worms and then everyone else who's had a ban will come out of the woodwork and complain it's not fair to them and people who are banned in the future will use this case as an example why they should be given another chance. PM theymos or cyrus and make your case to them and maybe they will remove it. I'm not against second chances but there needs to be some consistency so it's fair to all. Hopefully signature bans could be issued in cases like this instead and people can keep their accounts, but at the moment I just wish people would stop plagiarising content so these bans aren't even needed in the first place and it's truly a sad state of affairs that they are.",
