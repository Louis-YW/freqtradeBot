And i don't think at the first hand that he will become president because due to this motive or aim he will never be supported by other political leaders but maybe by few.But mostly political leaders do not wants it. Because all they want is less talks on BTC related issues in their offices. The reasons we all aware of like money laundering etc but still, this is just his wishes to do when he will become one but untill then we should avoid such imaginations.",

Hopefully, though, the Democrats won't choose to be represented by an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. Also, him winning the elections will be a huge disaster for my country (Ukraine).I think he's talking about Bitcoin because a Republican contestant, DeSantis, is building his campaign largely on being pro-Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin tax-exempt from capital gains is a great promise, but backing the USD with Bitcoin sounds a bit crazy to me, but he says he would start at 1% (and not all of that is even going to Bitcoin), with annual increases, so it's more of a wordplay than anything serious.",

Integrating Bitcoin into the monetary policy of a financially strong and politically influential nation like the US is a big boast of bitcoin. He said the dollars will be backed by bitcoin, gold, and silver gradually. He also promised to make the US bitcoin-friendly through tax exemptions and fewer regulations. We have had some US presidential hopefuls proposing policies to make Bitcoin popular if they become president and the majority of them are Republicans. This news alone is good for Bitcoin and we keep hoping that any of them wins. I have not heard Trump's current views about bitcoin after he called it a scam. Maybe his views have changed after all his predictions failed.",

Still, he isn't the only political figure that supports crypto, so that's the good part here but I believe it will be very bullish for crypto if someone like Kennedy made it to the presidential election and wins.",

A stroke of genius or a risky jump into the uncharted seas of smart money management?I agree with the idea behind the effort, which is to bring about stability, stop inflation, and make the U.S. dollar more important around the world. Changes from Bitcoin to dollars wo't be taxed as capital gains, which will also help more people use digital currencies.Yet, cognitive conflict looms large. Skepticism keeps asking me about how fragile Bitcoin is. Can it really hold up the economy of the world?
