  "content": "Hello. I use litecoincash-qt wallet for hive mining. Sometimes the computer restarts, I have set the wallet to start automatically, but for Hive mining to work, the password must be entered. I'm looking for a way to do this automatically. I found a suitable command here : https://hive.litecoinca.sh/rpc/It is written like this: litecoincash-cli walletpassphrasehiveonly \"my pass phrase\"It took me a long time to figure out that in order for the litecoincash-sli module to work, you need to start a daemon (litecoincashd.exe). I start the daemon but it creates another folder, and then the command I send no longer works with my wallet. I tried not to start litecoincash-qt.exe , start daemon , and then \"litecoincash-cli walletpassphrasehiveonly\" working. But then I don't have the program open. Basically, if litecoincash-qt is started, then I can't start the daemon. Without daemon command not working. if I point the daemon to a folder it says it can't see it. This is because during this time litecoincas-qt is working with her. I don't know what to do.I have work with litecoincash-qt. How to put password when program is starting?",
