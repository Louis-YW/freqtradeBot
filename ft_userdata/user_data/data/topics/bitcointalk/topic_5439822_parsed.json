Bitcoin keep putting food on our tableIn my opinion, investment still makes a lot of sense if the assets invested are clearly assets that are liked by many people, for example like Bitcoin. Because besides you can still trade it to find your daily profit, you can also invest Bitcoin for the long term in the hope of bigger profits. Even though maybe you prefer small profits that look more certain because you can enjoy them right away.",

There's no need to try to make big profits if it's too hard for you, but try to make multiple profits on each trade, and don't be greedy.But it's better if they find work offline and try to invest in bitcoin to prepare for their future so that when the time comes for bitcoin to increase in price, they can sell the bitcoin and make a profit. If they don't have the money to invest in bitcoin, it will be difficult for them, so it might be better if they can get a job and earn a salary to start investing in bitcoin.",

But trading bitcoin and fiat back and fourth, believing that you can generate income by that is no more different than believing you can live off gambling.Quote from: PrivacyG on February 14, 2023, 11:22:29 AMImagine you think you can not claim too many Satoshis daily from Bitcoin faucets today and in one decade a Satoshi is worth $1.Actually, a lot more. Giving away 5 BTC is the equivalent of giving away $100,000. If we take today's faucets that don't send more than 1000 sats per click, each sat should be around $100 in 2033 (which, in my opinion sounds a lot more crazier than the former).",

I believe that he had good belief in future of Bitcoin but perhaps he did not imagine Bitcoin will have value like $60,000. His faucet is iconic part of Bitcoin history.QuoteImagine you think you can not claim too many Satoshis daily from Bitcoin faucets today and in one decade a Satoshi is worth $1.I don't believe one satoshi will become $1 in next decade.If it becomes $1 in 2033, the global economy will be in hell and I don't want to be part of it.

It is just like a gambler who depends solely on gambling to survive. Bitcoin trading is no guaranteed way to make money that can sustain you and your family. People who trade are always advised to seek to have other sources of income to assist and help them to avoid always wanting to sell some bitcoins (because how can you keep bitcoins in such situation), and for the times when things get rough. Bitcoin trading or investment should not be your only source of livelihood.",

You are only pertaining here to Bitcoin trading. In fact, there are many ways to earn Bitcoin and not just in Bitcoin, but cryptocurrency in general. Thinking that you can only earn thru Bitcoin trading is bad IMO. Freelancing and accept Bitcoin as a payment is one way, faucets is another one (though not worth it) etc. There are many ways. As for us here in our home, a percentage of our monthly income comes thru crypto (thru freelancing).Quote from: Blisszi on February 14, 2023, 10:33:28 AMbut now that the price is down I know most of us that this has being the only means of livelihood, is being tough to meet up the current hardship in the land.No for me.This only affects people who has Bitcoin as their only income source. For me, I still have a main job aside from my freelancing job which I'm paid thru Bitcoin. Did it affect me? Yes, but not to the point where I feel that I'm having a hard time coping up with the expenses because of what happened to the whole crypto market.Quote from: Blisszi on February 14, 2023, 10:33:28 AMBitcoin should do well again I pray do that we can have plenty people in what we doThere's nothing wrong in praying so just continue what you're doing.

It is better to see Bitcoin as an investment or a side job and not a full time source of income. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme like some so called crypto experts have projected it to be, rather it is a long term investment that needs a lot of patience and fearlessness.

Now look at it, bitcoin has become so demanding that they can not just give it away. Even faucets would take your time, few ad clicks, few downloads and stuff like that to generate the revenue and then give you some 2-10 satoshi's. In addition, these sites are also not running for very long these days. They will make quick profits and just go away with the revenue without even paying their users. That hard it has become over the period of time. Now to get the bitcoins you have to compare it with the payments / salaries that are paid for your skills. For the work that you were doing normally to earn fiat. That's why it cant just fee the families! Now it needs to be earned before one can enjoy it.",
