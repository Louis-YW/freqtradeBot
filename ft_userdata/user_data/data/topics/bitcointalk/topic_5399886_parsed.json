I've seen threads on coins doing well while we were still seemingly in a bear market (such as aave and axs) - not that I consider us to be in a bear year yet - and I think we could also see this quite a bit again too.I think alt coins have had shorter cycles when compared to btc too (like a <1 year cycle litecoin used to have).",

I think waiting for Bitcoin price changes in 4 years is necessary, the problem I see in the analysis that is happening now is the opposite, in the past almost all types of crypto flew, now they don't, My thinking is that investors will only target 1-5 types of Altcoins in a phenomenon that occurs every 4 years, except Bitcoin, the reason is simple: Altcoins are currently listed in the crypto market thousands, compared to 2009 or 2017, most likely investors don't want to take risks, they only focus on certain altcoins plus investors are busy creating their own coins, in the end investors break up, each defending their own home, with events like this that make some Altcoins die, without any other investors coming in, investors who have big vaults, that's the kind of coins that fly.Bottom line: investors are many, but they are broke and busy defending their own home due to so many reborn cryptos.",

Quote from: piebeyb on May 23, 2022, 07:10:49 PMthis is just my speculation as we saw a few years earlier where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies didn't have many investors, rich people or big companies put their money into bitcoinBecause of this, I was confused and thinking it could be different this times too, but it is like what happened in the past want to happen again. Do not be surprised if you see a massive bull market in 2024/2025.

We all know that there is halving, the most important event in our history and the future price movement still is based n this process. Of course, we can argue that bitcoin's historical data is fairly young as compare to traditional financial markets so it's hard to identify cycles.

That would be something we need to work for though, it is not going to be something easy and we are not going to be making a ton of money easily by just waiting.We need to get in, we need to buy more, if not you then the person next to you, without the market buying more bitcoin then how could it go up?

I still expect weâll see upward pressure after halvings as a result of the four year cycle, just no massive bubbles (only regular bubbles). I think a $120K price target in 2025 is a reasonable one given the recent market behavior. Might seem underwhelming, but itâs still a x4 from here in 3 years.",
