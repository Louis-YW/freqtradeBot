For seeing this attempt exist again maybe its will be good for a scam victim to move on the casino which scam them also stop seeking for possible refund everywhere since they might step on wrong person then again became a scam victim for second time around.",

Unfortunately the forums don't take down the scam, it keeps them hanging around the forum and running their signature campaign.I can guess anyone who recently came to the forum and wanted to solve their problem with the scam site is someone who wasn't in the forum before. So they know the site outside and they are referred to bitcointalk to solve the problem because there is a representative here. If gamblers knew how bad the reputation that casino is in the eyes of forum users then I believe they would never deposit any amount to that casino.",

It's a shame the forum don't moderate these kinds of scams, as they are clearly doing the community a disservice. What we can say to the community is, always be careful and check the reputation of a casino before sending money to them.",

The people that are too lazy to do any sort of websearch on a platform. They see an ad on a trustworthy platform and will make a deposit because they trust the platform they saw the ad on. Shame on the platform, but shame on the user who didn't research as well. So, IMO having a public discussion about a scammy platform is a good thing.
