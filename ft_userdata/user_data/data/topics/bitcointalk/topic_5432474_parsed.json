      "body": "Nobody can predict that far to the future. Too many variables to consider starting from mining equipment, electricity/energy cost, Bitcoin price, etc. For example, if we found a new way to generate electricity at a low cost, and there is a new device/quantum device that can do calculations at exponential speed to an existing rig, that number you consider insane might be nothing for them. So, people will just keep mining without any care.Or, the opposite happens. Electricity becomes more expensive, no more cheap rig is found, BTC tank heavy, nobody no longer uses it and so the difficulty is so low that you can mine with CPU again. I think this is unlikely but I won't be surprised if difficulty falls in the future if the profit becomes too small for small-medium mining farms. At the end of the day, the market will correct itself. If mining becomes too difficult difficulty will get lower, when profit increases more people will mine again, and so on. If you plan to mine BTC right now, consider buying them instead if you can't play the long game or has cheap electricity. It is probably not worth the trouble to set up a rig if profit is your goal.

The fact that you are old enough to sign up for the form and ask such a question suggests that you need to be a supercentenarian to witness it,  out of the nearly 8B population we have right now, studies show that there is between 300 and 350 supercentenarian, in other terms, 1 in 1000 centenarians (people who live up to 100 years) will get to 110, and to be centenarians the chances are 1 in 1000, so it's extremely unlikely for any of us to be there in a 100 years from now.Now that we got the human race life span stuff out of the way, the answer to your question is \"nobody knows\", everything will be determined by the VALUE extracted by miners, even the comment above that says Quoteit will likely become very low considering that competition to mine for block rewards will no longer be necessary when 21million bitcoins have been minedcould be wrong, when all the 21M BTC are mined, BTC could very well be trading at say 100M dollars each, if we were to assume that transaction fees are 5% of the total block reward, today it's 0.3125 which is about $5000 + $100,000 for the block reward = $105,000. in 2123 the total fees could be 0.1 BTC per block so at 100M that's 10,000,000$ per block, which even after accounting for inflation still beats the now \"105,000\", even with BTC trading at 10M still beats it.We also don't know how adopted BTC will be, if the protocol is changed and BTC becomes a means of payment for daily usage, maybe the block size will increase and we would have millions of transactions that all add up to make a large sum of fees, maybe it just becomes a store of value that doesn't move much and the total fees won't add up to a fraction of what they are now and thus only 1-2% of the total hashrate is sustained, you can't even imagine what is going to happen next year when the rewards drop by 50%, let alone predict difficulty in 100 years.But one thing to keep in mind is that there will always be someone willing to mine BTC, even if the block reward was only enough to buy a bottle of milk, 2 folks with their old CPUs would be mining it, in fact, even if power bill exceeds the rewards people would still mine it just to sustain the blockchain which they invested in, we could even have on-demand mining, say nobody broadcasts any transaction for 24 hours, nobody mines no blocks, miners see pending transactions, they turn their gears on, just to mine that transaction into a block and turn off their rigs again, some difficulty rules will need to be adjusted if we get to that stage, but sure thing is, anything is possible when a 100 years had passed.And since we don't know how things are going to be in 100 years from now, it's best to assume that the young generation then will figure out what to do to the protocol to keep it in the best shape and adjust their environment, one thing I know for sure is, it's not our problem to worry about.",

Nobody can predict what bitcoin could be after 100 years because we all know how the economy might turn to sometimes it maybe the bitcoin price may pump up in the next 100 years or dump.",

Still I was seeing that Bitcoin mining difficulty is all time high of previous records that sits at 35.36 Trillion Hashes and that is too much insane. It is uncertain to say how Bitcoin will be in the coming days, moreover, it is not at all possible to say how the position of Bitcoin will be in the world after 100 years.In the future we will get next  halving2024 halving, block rewards 3.125 BTC100 years later we will get(Not me because I can't alive till 2123 )2124 halving, block rewards 0.00000009 BTCSo it can be easily estimated that after 100 years from today if Bitcoin survives then the circulation supply and total supply will be equal.  It is difficult to say whether there will be mining at all.  However, if the price of Bitcoin does not increase, then mining will not be possible at all.  Moreover, the next generation of 100 years will be more technology dependent than the current generation, so they will discover the techniques that benefit the mining sector.",

Even though i know that bitcoin mining reward is tie to the price at whichever point if not bitcoin mining have received a big positive boost in the last year where bitcoin mining harsh rates made an all time high of 158 harsh rate per second which was a record high in 2022 but because of the drop in the price of bitcoin and cost of running mining operation have made bitcoin miners to suffer from the result of low rewards due to bitcoin price drop.Quote from: Ucy on December 31, 2022, 03:59:45 PMIf Bitcoin mining difficulty is proportional to hashing power ..it will likely become very low considering that competition to mine for block rewards will no longer be necessary when 21million bitcoins have been minedBitcoin mining is gradually transforming into renewable energy to support energy and environmental coexistence which is one of the major set back against the proof of work Algorithm. But with the latest mining equipment and devices, bitcoin mining in the coming years will be lucrative and more advanced as the quest for bitcoin scalability continues more and more Bitcoin miners will come into the operation and contribute to the bitcoin network abd share the rewards which will make more room for competition that will allow advance development to the entire bitcoin mining sector and global adoption.",

You can check the hash chart, get the growth rate per half decade  and get the ratio of growth between the two sample and calculate from there then calculate the difficulty on the derived hash power.  I think with the improvement of technology, and assuming of mass adoption, the difficulty will increase because of many miners participating in mining tx fees given that it is profitable to mine tx fee .  Given that tx fee does not suffice, we can see a possibility of huge decline in difficulty due to less hashing power mining blocks.",
