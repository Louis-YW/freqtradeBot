That will make it easier to keep boosting the qubit count.

Under a generic model of random noise for (controlled) rotation gates, we prove that the algorithm does not factor integers of the form pq when the noise exceeds a vanishingly small level in terms of n - the number of bits of the integer to be factored, where p and q are from a well-defined set of primes of positive density. We further prove that with probability 1−o(1) over random prime pairs (p,q), Shor's factoring algorithm does not factor numbers of the form pq, with the same level of random noise present.",

That is, it needs noise levels of the order 2-n. The same is true for ECDLP. Good luck achieving noise level 2-256.It is very easy to figure out why that happens. We start with qubits which are independent, each representing only 1 bit of information. But before reaching the final result it is not yet clear which of the 2n possibilities are the correct ones. So midway of the quantum computation, qubits have to represent 22n states at the same time. This enormous amount of information vanishes with any noise present.Read the last sentence in this section https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm#Physical_implementation.",

      "body": "I personally ignore most quantum computation because quantum computing is overhyped. Think about it. Quantum computing promises exceptional speedup for some specific problems. Reversible computing promises moderate speedup for all problems. It is important to get better at computing everything and also to try to get an exceptional speedup for specific tasks. But quantum computing has been overwhelmingly hyped while few have heard of reversible computing. This is not good since the old strategy of simply shrinking transistors and making everything smaller is not going to work any more. This means that we will need another strategy for improving performance in computation, and partially reversible computation is a part of the solution. Heck, even things that are pretty much impossible like antimatter engines that can propel people to the speed of light are hyped much more than reversible computation. The reason for this is psychological rather than a result of any deficiency of the promises of reversible computation. People are unwilling to accept that the laws of physics may not always make computation easier and in order to compute within the laws of physics and saenergy, one must make tradeoffs between energy efficiency per bit operation and time/space. And the word 'reversible' sounds less magical than the word 'quantum', and people cannot accept that.For this reason, I am going to ignore any news about quantum computation.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
