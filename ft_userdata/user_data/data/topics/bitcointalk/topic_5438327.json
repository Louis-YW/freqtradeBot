  "content": "Edit: This elaboration seems important as I have repeated myself quite often to people that have concluded (somehow as I did not say this in the OP) that the primary and only purpose of this board is to be anti-gambling, a support group for self-admitted problem gamblers. This is far from accurate and is not at all the primary/sole purpose of the Gambling Awareness board.Some purposes of this board can include:1. Discussing the factual negative sides of gambling generally, a side that is currently not possible to be discussed anywhere in the gambling board without your thread being locked due to \"signature spam\" that is apparently prevalent in these kinds of topics (solution: signatures disabled in this new sub-forum so that all discussion is non-incentivized and genuine).2. To house the abundance of unique topics relating to gambling awareness, some examples include the long list I've provided in this thread (There are well over 30 topics listed below). You can not possibly merge all of these unique topics into one sticky topic (as some people have suggested is enough)3. To provide food for thought for people who do regularly gamble when reading other peoples experiences and posts in the wide variety of topics that stem from the points above.4. Ultimately, to balance the scale of the bitcointalk gambling forum. Right now, casinos have 100% dominance in the scale that is \"pro gambling\" and \"anti gambling\". This balance can be set to about 75% pro gambling and 25% anti gambling (via awareness NOT by pure anti-gambling discussion).- There are probably many more positives that will arise over time than the above. These are just some examples.To those who have repeated \"it will just be full of signature spammers\" - I have stated multiple times (including in the original OP) that signatures would be disabled to solve this problem.Key takeaways:- Signature spam problem will be resolved as signatures will be disabled in the board.- There are many topics other than \"stop gambling\" or \"be aware of the dangers of gambling\" which is why one sticky topic labeling the dangers of gambling is not enough to fulfill the same purposes that a dedicated board would.- This board is not designed to be a support group for self-admitted problem gamblers and it is not designed to \"put an end\" to people gambling. The purposes stated above are only some of what could be included/some of the purposes of the board and do not relate to this falsely perceived objective.Original post:Hello everyone. Recently, I made this topic:How much time do you think you have spent gambling?The next day it was locked. I asked a moderator and didn't receive a response as to why it was locked however I asked another member who said that it's possible that it's due to signature spam that occurs with these types of threads. This has lead to my idea of creating a Gambling Awareness sub-board under the Gambling forum, optionally with signatures disabled to prevent signature spam (also as it would be kind of ironic having posters there who mostly have gambling signatures due to the current signature campaign market).I've already found a lot of other topics with the theme of responsible gambling/gambling awareness. Please note that all of these threads are locked for further discussion. Why? A guess is signature spam. I don't know the official reason. This list is only scratching the surface based on my searches.signs of gambling addictionIs gambling attracted to emotion or luckYour betting budgetDo you limit your gambling time?Be a Responsible GamblerWeekly/monthly financial statements, which do you prefer?

Gambling addiction is prevalent everywhere and I can see it very clearly in some peoples post. It's quite sad and I do wonder how many coins are lost to these establishments every year from members of this forum alone.I've added a poll. Though I do not believe this is really a debate but rather what is right or wrong and I think that the votes might have some sway (for reasons undisclosed). Either way, I think it is wrong to push gambling so hard without any counter measures such as awareness to prevent people from losing control. If admins agree then this board should be a no brainer.I am not looking to piss anyone/any party off with this thread. I have seen gambling addiction in my life, I am seeing the signs of it more and more here by more and more members. That is my only motive. I am not anti-gambling but I am pro responsible gambling.",

Awareness is not default nor is this suggestion designed to \"make people quit gambling and seek help\". I didn't mention that anywhere. Browsing this section and reading posts by other gamblers who admit their problem and show regret can stop someone else from following the same path. Just in my thread alone, people were showing signs of reflection in their posts. In other threads, you can see this common theme. Someone is more likely to identify unhealthy behavior if they see other people having experienced it or are experiencing it and becoming aware of it. Right now, all you have is constant endorsement with absolutely zero awareness. You have to keep in mind too that a lot of users here might even be under the age of 18, and all it would take is one story about someone else's unhealthy gambling habit to make them think twice about gambling if they are doing the same thing. Right now, there is no avenue for any of the aforementioned. Actually, any avenue/topic that was created has been locked. So any form of awareness is non-existent in the board.Quote from: Apocollapse on February 06, 2023, 07:50:53 AMGambling awareness board without signature enable, I predict the section would be dead similar like Ivory Tower section lol.Who cares if it is dead or not? That is not the point. The point is to have the area there to be able to create an avenue of awareness. Whether it is active or not is beside the point. I personally believe that it will be active even with signatures disabled. As someone who has seen gambling negatively effect a lot of people, I for one will actively participate in discussion there and create food for thought that will (hopefully) help people identify their problems (if they have one) and correct any unhealthy behavior if they believe it exists in their lives.Quote from: Apocollapse on February 06, 2023, 07:50:53 AMThe funny thing is almost of all thread about addictions are created by user wear gambling signature, if they have a problem about gambling they must avoid gambling including joining a gambling campaign.

Quote from: Apocollapse on February 06, 2023, 07:50:53 AMSomeone have created similar suggestion before Gambling discussion board needs a child board?, everyone disagree about it.This thread that you linked does not even relate to this suggestion. That suggestion was about adding sub-boards for the gambling discussion board to cater for other commonly discussed topics. None of which related to gambling awareness.Quote from: acroman08 on February 06, 2023, 07:51:12 AMI think the gambling discussion board is perfectly fine for it. that board is very broad and a lot of things can be talked about under it as long as it has something to do with gambling or whatever is allowed to be posted on it. I don't really think adding another sub-board in the gambling board is necessary. also, I have a feeling that if \"Gambling Awareness board\" is created and the signature campaign is disabled it'll just become a dead board.All gambling awareness related topics are closed by default for the assumed reason of signature spam. I provided a big list of these topics. So right now, the discussion is technically not allowed in the gambling board, it can not be talked about because the thread is likely to be locked. Because of this, it's fine if the board is dead, as long as there is an easy place for people to see the other side of gambling easily. Right now, it's not possible to see it at all.",

The reason they are locked is due to signature spam, repeated posts as you said though if signatures are disallowed then that should eliminate the problem and thus there should be no reason to lock them. If repeated posts continue, use the report button like everywhere else in the forum. The point for the board is to raise awareness of the effects of gambling. Especially those who are losing/have lost control. Responsible gambling campaigns are not the focus of the board. Awareness will come from peoples' experience. Experience is endless and why I believe that even with signatures disabled, there will be discussion. I don't think anyone can officially say whether or not there will be discussion, by the way. According to those threads that I posted there is plenty of discussion, mostly relating to personal experience.Even if there is no constant discussion, the board serves as an easy-to-access resource to see the other side of the coin of gambling. Even if the board only includes the locked threads that I listed and they remained locked with no additional posts being made, this will still serve as a positive resource/initiative to gambling awareness, based on the posts I have read in those threads.",

I think your opinion is spot on. Not just because it aligns with mine either, but because it just makes a lot more sense to me reading this than the reasoning in previous posts. No signatures - Cool! That will reduce/eliminate any chance of spam. At the end of the day it's about awareness, it's a serious topic, there is no need for incentivized posting.",

      "body": "I voted yes, on principle.. but re-reading the question, I'm not sure a sub is necessary. I'd prefer maybe 1 thread with resources on gambling addiction to be stickied under the gambling board itself, and any such discussions of gambling addicts recovering might also be fine being posted under the same board. Although, one might debate whether anyone with a gambling problem who is trying to stop should be anywhere near the Gambling section, or any sub of it. But putting these things under a sub might bury them more. Addicts aren't always out looking for a way to stop, but seeing a sticky in the board they're addicted to might help remind some that gambling addiction is real, with maybe some signs that they're going too far. But on some level, they have to want to help themselves, before they get anything out of any helpful resources.. overall, I'm all for bringing light to this subject in some fashion.edit: spacing.. and bolded lmao",

Who are you to say that no one will post just because there is no signature visible? Do you hold a crystal ball?Your third comment in bold is again a comment you can not make. Who are you to conclude that everyone works the same psychologically?Your fourth comment is not even \"jokes aside\". It is an idiotic and sarcastic comment made to try and validate your points. People can openly discuss the negative effects of bitcoin in the bitcoin discussion forum, as people already do. In the gambling discussion board, all related topics are locked and discussion can not continue after a thread is locked. These types of discussions that you mention can be made in the bitcoin discussion board and the topics will not be locked because the discussion is valid. You really need to stop talking as if you know everything. It's extremely irritating.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on February 07, 2023, 02:43:28 AMQuote from: Mate2237 on February 06, 2023, 09:40:56 PMHow will it possible to disable signature from the board?

The point of an entire board is because there are many topics surrounding gambling awareness. It's not just about addicts talking about stopping gambling as everyone seems to be thinking here. It's about everything surrounding the negatives that come with gambling, how it impacts lives on an individual scale, and as said earlier, individual experience, which is unlimited and why a whole board would be appropriate.

There's no need for a separate board. However in saying that, it is a feature of Bitcoin and it probably does/will deserve its own sub-board one day. That is another topic though and I don't think that \"fairness\" has anything to do with either topics having their own sub-board because both of the topics are in two different realms and have nothing to do with each other. If I was suggesting that we have a board to discuss taproot then yes it would be fair to say that it is \"unfair\" that a board of lightning network isn't added as well. That's not the case though.Quote from: Husires on February 06, 2023, 08:22:01 PMI rarely visit that board, so I don't know how the situation is, but with the increase in signature campaigns related to gambling (more than 60% of paid ads in the gambling forum), I expect that the percentage of spam will be high in that board, so creating a sub-board will only increase the problem.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on February 06, 2023, 07:18:23 PMQuote from: Apocollapse on February 06, 2023, 07:50:53 AMThe funny thing is almost of all thread about addictions are created by user wear gambling signature, if they have a problem about gambling they must avoid gambling including joining a gambling campaign. ...I would support OP's suggestion if I thought such a section wouldn't be a haven for sig/bounty spammers, but I have a feeling that's precisely what it'd turn into. Â Maybe if posters weren't allowed to display their signature or avatar....This is already addressed in the OP. Signatures in this board will be disabled to prevent signature spam as this is the reason why these kinds of topics are (seemingly) locked in the gambling discussion board to-date.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on February 06, 2023, 07:18:23 PMQuote from: Apocollapse on February 06, 2023, 07:50:53 AMThe funny thing is almost of all thread about addictions are created by user wear gambling signature, if they have a problem about gambling they must avoid gambling including joining a gambling campaign. ...it would work but even then I think problem gamblers should seek out other places to talk about recovering from their affliction. Â Bitcointalk just isn't the right place to have a devoted section for that.Problem gamblers are not going to seek out a place to talk to other gamblers with a problem. No gambler wants to even admit they have a problem or are in denial. The point of the board is to raise that initial awareness and start the reflection process. Even if this board was created just with the topics that were locked, a gambler can go there and see other people reflecting and maybe relate to someones experience or a person who has admitted they have a problem and think \"oh, hey wait a minute, this sounds like me and this person admits they have a problem, maybe I do to?\" (for example). It's food for thought and it would be a responsible move for bitcointalk to not just promote gambling but also house a board that raises awareness via other peoples' experiences. BitcoinTalk doesn't seem like the right place to have a section devoted to that only because it is so heavily sponsored by gambling. That's definitely not the way to look at it though. This suggestion is about making a change for the better in a place where the balance is clearly tipped so heavily in the wrong direction - being promoting and endorsing gambling 100% and suppressing discussion about its proven negative effects, and the impact it can have on people both inside and outside of this community.",

At best, this information is worth being one point included in a \"prevention\" sticky thread in the gambling awareness board. I will make that thread and include this information if the board is added. It is definitely not a viable alternative to a dedicated board to gambling awareness though in my opinion nor a good reason to scrap this idea.It seems that people are confused between awareness and prevention/quitting. They're totally different topics. I guess distinguishing this is another good topic for the gambling awareness board if it were to come true. Again - This idea is not to stop people from gambling, only the individual themselves can do that. The board does not seek to influence behavior, it seeks raise awareness of the negative effects of gambling, which currently those boards not only don't do, but lock all threads relating to the subject (which in my opinion is irresponsible, even if it is due to signature posting).",
