  "content": "Building a community is never easy and needs a lot of strategy and tools. Recently we find Crew3 interesting to attract potential users to become active community members. We have not started to use this tool immensely but it seems useful for new users to complete tasks to get rewards and become active community members and thus contributors. How many of you have used Crew3 before and is this useful for both project owners and most users ? Please let me know. By the way, I am with FireDAO team, in charge of the global community. Please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiry.",

However, like any tool, it should be used according to the specific needs and goals of your project. In general, using Crew3 can be beneficial for project owners, as it allows them to create tasks and rewards for community members, which can encourage their activity and participation. Users can benefit from this as they can be rewarded for completing tasks and become more active members of the community.",

However, the success of any tool ultimately depends on how well it is implemented and integrated into the overall community development strategy. It is also important to continue gathering feedback from community members to ensure that the tool meets their needs and expectations.Whether Crew3 is useful for project owners and most users, it may vary depending on the particular project and community. It will be useful to explore how Crew3 can be customized to meet the unique needs of your community and project.",

It seems the era of having bitcointalk social bounty is surpass by this kind by easily participating on the platform. Before I am joining a lots of social campaign, and now this is the trend and more appreciated since nft  are included on the process for completing task. Its like an automated bounty manager have secured it for cross checking via blockchain and smart contract.",

Community engagement and increasing the community base can be done in just a few steps. All you need to do is to decide how to start and the rest is taken care by them. It is a good tool and if you are planning to use it then you can go ahead and give it a try.",

We've seen how bounty programs generate social campaigns and how much participants spam them.",

I don't know exactly what crew3's criteria are for deploying their quests on their site, but they often publish all sorts of large and well-known projects, such as for example SUI. If the project has no budget, no big investors, it is unlikely they can attract the community on such sites.",

Why SuiSwap for instance have a very large community is because of the promise to airdrop Sui to all the participants based on their XP points that will eventually be converted to Sui points. Other projects can decide to reward only the top 20, top 50, top 100, or top 1000. I won't want to join such campaign if I have no chance of getting a reward.",

I am thinking about a bigger picture and every project owner should know what they really want before choosing any promotion tool. The common problem with all platforms is that how many users can actually be turned into active community member.  We have tried many ways and are still looking for better ways to do the job. Please let me know if you have any good advice. You are more than welcome.",

Please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiry. A tool for building a community would only be effective if the said tool was actually used in whatever community you want to build your own in. I'd highly suggest scouring over it (or any other tool similar) and see how much of an audience base there actually is before deciding whether to use it as a foundation for your community or not. It's like how telegram wasn't exactly popular back then but exploded into popularity with crypto projects popping up here and there, and now communities can easily build their own telegram group, and people who want to join can easily find it and have ease of use with it. Personally idk what crew3 is, but from what I've seen about it's features it looks pretty good in terms of actively building up community engagement.",
