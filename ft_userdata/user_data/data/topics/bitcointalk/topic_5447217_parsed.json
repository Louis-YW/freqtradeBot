  "content": "Quote from:  Webmixer [Altcointalk ANN] Discussion in [Rus] • [Romanian] • [Filipino] • [French] • [German] • [Pidgin] • /en/faq/][FAQ]/en/]/en/][banned mixer] is a reliable tool created to anonymize BTC. Intuitive interface with 3 mix modes, .Mixer, Precise, Max Anonymity. thanks to which you receive purified coins from various exchanges. We do not keep logs + provide letters of guarantee, so your level of anonymity is 100%. .➥ No registration, no logs / all data is encoded.➥ Immediate auto-delete of client data / data on requests for mixing gets erased in 168 hours.➥ The only proof of cleaning in our service is a letter of guarantee, which stays with you.After your coins arrive in our props, your coins are split into random parts and sent to the biggest stock exchanges. You receive back purified BTC (depending on the mix mode you chose). You receive either coins from our clients who took advantage of the “max anonymity” mode, or you receive bitcoins sent from exchanges. These coins are unlinkable and resistant to all deanonymization tools. ➥ To start clearing, you need your incoming transaction to have 1 network confirmation. ➥ The timing depends on the mode you choose, but usually it takes from 2 to 6 hours.➥ Incoming address is valid for 7 days (168 hours). All payments made after this time will be ignored.➥ We charge from 1% to 5% of the amount + 0,0007 BTC➥ The maximum amount varies depending on the mode you choose - 1 or 50 BTC.➥ The minimum clearing amount is 0.001 BTC, all amounts below the minimum will be considered donations.____________________  /en/contacts/]    /]",

      "body": "It seems there are no interest so far, the April fool took all the spotlight LOLAnyway, you need to come up with aggressive plan and solid marketing strategy.1. Your ANN does not look attractive right now, sorry it's the truth. I see you have a copper membership which means I am assuming you are in the process of creating a nice ANN thread with graphics. It will create higher attention.2. Mixer advertisement is highly dependable in marketing campaign the competition is high too. To cope with your competitions you need to plan for an advertising too. I can help you with this if you want. Feel free to check my service page.. I am helping some of the competitive mixers to build their brand awareness such as Sinbad, Yo!mix and today we just relaunched Mixero. Feel free to check their budget, brand awareness.Depending on your budget I can present you a highly desirable campaign to stay out of the competition.3. And lastly, a mixer means creating a solid trust in the community. We can discuss about it and set up a strategy to take the brand ahead. Looking forward to have a discussion with you and work together to build the brand. I am sure with years of experience I have in the forum, will bring huge value to your brand.Welcome to the forum by the way.Cheers,",

We will definitely listen to your advice and suggestions.I'll tell you more than that. We want to win over the local inhabitant by not aggressive/pushy marketing.

We would be grateful if you could point out any mistakes. We do have representatives from the Russian region in our service. So there may be some mistakes or misunderstandings. But we try to avoid them as much as possible. As for the statement that the mixer is the best - before we started working, we studied the market, carried out test transactions, observed the quality of our \"competitors\". That's why we decided not to be modest in the title. I am sure that you will soon be convinced of this.We have been on the market for over two years for a little bit of other services. And on the forums of our specialty, for the peace of mind of mixer users, we have made a mandatory deposit multiplied by several times. Of course, this should not affect your opinion of our service in any way. But, perhaps, the positive impact that in a few years of work for us there was not a single complaint, what can boast of what not many.",

Also, thanks for the typo.I am just curious.The idea could be good, but why the telegram bot, though?Don't you think this can put you and the user privacy in great danger, knowing that telegram can submit whatever information they are required to any law enforcement folks?Let's take a slightly broader look at the problem. As a rule, people who use Telegram use VPNs and disposable phone numbers. And many have an idea of how to take care of their own anonymity. However, it is also worth noting how telegram has responded to requests from special services. I'll leave a footnote about that [1]*And now let's have a closer look at our surroundings:Yomix - Ddos-guard (waf and hosting), which is fully controlled by the special services of the Russian Federation and gives out all the information on the first request.Sinbad - CloudFlare (waf leading logs of visits, ip addresses, fingerprint, where have gone to the site, etc.). All these statistics and logs are kindly shared with the US Secret Service.bitcointalk also stands on Cloudflare....Not to mention the fact that every internet and mobile operator will also provide any information on request.  I think that telegram is a much less dangerous place against this background. [1]*On March 20, 2018, the Russian Supreme Court ruled that the FSB's demand to provide keys to decrypt Telegram's correspondence was legal. On the same day, Roskomnadzor notified Telegram to comply with the law's requirements to provide information to the Federal Security Service of Russia. If Telegram fails to provide encryption keys to the FSS within 15 days, it may be blocked in Russia. The creator of the messenger stated his refusal to give encryption keys for Telegram correspondence to the FSB.",
