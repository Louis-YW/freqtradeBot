I was not aware they would tax a stamp so muchSorry I'm late to this discussion - the stamp itself appears to be attached to a credit-card size memento while the collectability is there are just 2071 units on offer (the 2071 caught my eye   Are the items numbered? 2067 would be a cool serial to add to the collection) and the website selling the item is touting there is also an NFT that is included in the package, so it's not just a stamp, hence the Euro Customs (probably) considers it to be e.g. a physical thing, not a stamp per-Se.https://www.emiratespostshop.ae/product/projects-of-the-50th/QuoteThe NFT stamp card is a high-quality credit card-sized plastic card with a thickness of 0.8mm made of a 5-layer composite structure of FSC certified (eco-friendly and sustainable) printed paper with a chip layer and a blocking barrier for security purposes....There are 2071 NFT stamps issued in this design.The price is out of my range, but it's an interesting collectable.",
