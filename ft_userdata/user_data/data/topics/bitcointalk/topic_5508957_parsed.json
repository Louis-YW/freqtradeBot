  "content": "Picking a couple of random quotes from random people in another thread.Quote from: franky1 on September 11, 2024, 02:59:44 PM....to me hobby miners are not professional miners contracted into mining as a full time task. they just play around when the time is right. they are more likely to jump to crapcoins that are sha-PoW when times are bad for btc profit. and market buy btc when its cheaper to buy coin rather then pay electric at a losshobby miners dont do business plans of a 2 year budget, prepaid.. hobby miners are more short term dipping in and out when the time is right...Quote from: dzungmobile on September 11, 2024, 02:49:21 PMThey can be hobby miners if they have already been in this Bitcoin mining industry long enough, get enough profit and have enough deep budget. I mean they are rich enough to mine bitcoins as their hobbies without any worry on what's happening now and next couple of months because they can spend bills from their deep pockets.They don't mind facts are going on at the moment and near future, consider mining as hobby but eventually they get profit because after several months, market rally helps them to automatic harvest profit. Several months is only example, their waiting time for profit harvest can be different depends on different phases of market.I have a different view in that hobby miners don't really care about the cost of mining (or do not care that much) or what the value of BTC is.It's not a 'side hustle' it's not a 2nd job. I am never going to make any money riding motorcycles it's a hobby. I see hobby miners as the same, they like the mining tech, they like playing around, and as long as they don't loose the house payment buying and tinkering with miners it's not a big deal.What I would call 'home miners' are people looking to make a profit, be it mining out of their basement / garage / whatever. Just wondering how other people view things like this. It's more semantics, but when someone says 'hobby' miner to me I see something different then 'home' miner. And if we are having a discussion we can wind up thinking the other person is thinking something else.Self moderated to prevent spam.-Dave",

I think that there are people who consider mining a hobby. In as much as we know that there are a lot of cost involved in setting up a mining rig even if it is a small one, there a people who by virtue of their geographical location and other factors are already at an advantage that enables to afford to mine as a hobby. For example people who live in areas where the cost of electricity or energy is lower than in other places. In addition, people who live in areas where mining equipment like the ASICs are cheaper that in other areas.",

For example, a hobby with riding a motorcycle requires expenses for purchasing a motorcycle, equipment, fuel, maintenance and repair, etc. Hobby mining, in my understanding, is when a passionate bitcoin enthusiast does it for the pleasure of assembling, setting up and operating miners, as well as for the sake of contributing to the development (support of the BTC-network) of bitcoin. Any profit received is a secondary bonus and is in no way an incentive.This is how I understand hobby mining.",

Though here on the forum, I have really come across a couple of persons who as very much supporters of decentralisation and definitely bitcoin too. Most bitcoiners love the bitcoin network so much that they run node just to play around. However as for mining for a hobby it's going to be more like a too way thing. For the very first one which is obvious, one could be a hobby miner by probably not gaining a thing because of costs like maintenance and electricity.On the other hand, no one said it's wrong to make some profits with mining as your hobby since your hobby is basically what you love doing. Let's not forget that electricity costs is one of the biggest reasons hobby miners aren't as much as those running nodes for fun are. So I think if a miner is basically putting back his earned profits in paying for electricity and maintenance bills with a tiny fraction of the net profit left then he could be called a fun or hobby miner.",

If I will have big farms of solar panels or wind power generators and I will have free electricity, then I will definitely buy some rigs and will give BTC mining a try. If it turns out to be okay as my hobby,, like it should be fun, mind refreshing then I will go for it. But this will be fun for some time only once the rigs are set and the setup is running It won't be a fun or a hobby then we have to find another hobby haha.",

You can use ASICs, and contribute to 2^70 chainwork on testnet4, and 2^75 chainwork on testnet3, or you can use just your CPU, and mine all blocks with minimal difficulty.QuoteI am never going to make any money riding motorcycles it's a hobby.Sometimes, there is a difference, because for example by mining and selling some ALTs, which were CPU-mineable, I earned 0.01 BTC. And I think it is quite impressive, if you consider, that all of it was done only with CPUs.But obviously, more often than not, I mined many chains, which were not at all profitable, and I treated them more or less like testnets.QuoteIt's more semantics, but when someone says 'hobby' miner to me I see something different then 'home' miner.Well, I consider myself both a hobby miner, and a home miner, because if you use just your CPUs, then you don't have to worry that much about your hardware. Then, you just use, what you already have, and for example use 10% of your CPU power, to add some Proof of Work to some things, just to apply some simple hashcash-like antispam on that.Another example of a hobby mining is transaction mining, for example: https://mempool.space/tx/000000000fdf0c619cd8e0d512c7e2c0da5a5808e60f12f1e0d01522d2986a51And also, if you tweak (r,s) pairs of DER signatures, then by a little bit of mining, you can save some real satoshis, by making your transaction just a little bit smaller. To do that, you can for example CPU-mine R-value of the public key, and then, tweak s-value, with a fixed R-value. In this way, by doing something like 2^32+2^32=2^33 operations, you can strip 8 bytes.",

There are two sides to the idea of ​​hobby mining that u bring up. Some may do it for enjoyment and some may do it to benefit from it. I don't think mining can be expected to benefit from this if it is considered a hobby. Hobbies are a different matter. We spend a lot of money to fulfill the pleasures of the mind but we don't get any benefit from it but we get enough pleasure from it. The pleasure of this hobby does not give us money but we spend enough money to get this pleasure.If u are mining bitcoin for fun I can't agree because bitcoin mining can never be fun. It would be wrong to say that BTC mining is a hobby, because doing Bitcoin mining means expecting benefits from it, which is why it cannot be a hobby mine. When u do bitcoin mining, u monitor the market yourself, if the price goes up, you feel happy and if the price goes down, you feel a little sad, so the idea of ​​hobby mining with bitcoin mining does not seem logical to me.On the other hand, those who have taken up mining as a hobby say that they are actually doing it with the intention of making a profit rather than enjoying it.I think entertainment should involve you in something like playing games, various sports, traveling, etc. From which you will personally find joy.",
