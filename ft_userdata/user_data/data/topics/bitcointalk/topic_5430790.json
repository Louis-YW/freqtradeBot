  "content": "Hi,I would like to know if there is query allowing at install Bitcoin Core with for example only the genesis block, its next three blocks and the last three blocks.I know, one can use prune in order to have a minimum of 550 blocks corresponding to 550Mb. However, this feature was available since 2014-2015.Quote-prune= Reduce storage requirements by enabling pruning (deleting) of old blocks. This allows the pruneblockchain RPC to be called to delete specific blocks, and enables automatic pruning of old blocks if a target size in MiB is provided. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, 550 = automatically prune block files to stay under the specified target size in MiB)",

      "body": "Unfortunately, there's no RPC or command line option that can do that.On the other hand, pruning is still available in the latest version but it will not satisfy your requirements since the minimum size is still quite high.Plus it will still have to download and verify all of the blocks while pruning the older ones.",
