  "content": "Hi,Recently I began to wonder if crypto trading couldn't be perceived as gambling by its pure form. I know that we have here enthusiasts of crypto trading but I hope we can take it cool and try to think of it reasonably. Having this conversation might be helpful not only for beginners but also for more advanced traders. By saying that I mean people who trade longer, not necessarily who gain more profit.First of all, I must say that by no means am I trying to state here one and only truth. This post is rather a bunch of my own thoughts which I would like to share and develop.The question arose when I was trading during one of my daily session and it was neither good nor bad as for the closing balance sheet. The problem was that I was using my limited knowledge and at that point all I was doing was like trying to find something elusive. I knew it was there but couldn't really predict anything. The best metaphor I can find is pretending to be a doctor and curing people without having a clue about medicine. What it implies is that you can't be a good doctor without studying huge amounts of material and reviewing multiple case studies. Before you reach a certain level, you can easily hurt people or hurt your wallet.This is where I come to the conclusion that for most of people who trade, trading is just a gamble. Sometimes they win, and this is where legends are born most of the times. Sometimes they lose, what happens more often. In general we are lured by huge and rapid wealth and such desires are addictive, especially if you succeeded a couple of times. Only few are determined enough to reach a level of proficiency before losing it all - money, hope and a touch of reality.It sounds depressive as I read it but this is how I see this.",

One thing about gambling is that you can lose all your money just at ones, but trading helps by making the loss to be gradual and the end result can support your trade or position opened in a way unrealized loss could become profit.What I just know in trading is that you should not look for amount of profit you are not willing to lose, it is very important. But there is more to trading which would be very helpful, but if not known, then trading is gambling for such people and the result can be a big loss.",

Can trading be likened to gambling and how so? I believe people who still think trading is/are part of gambling, are beginners in crypto trading. probably almost all trades.a novice trader buys and places buy or sell orders with their guesses. not use analytical techniques or even more complicated trading techniques. like placing a bet in a casino, not even seeing a chance to win.in the past, that's what I did. after studying and knowing more.

A good number of people have no clue how to play soccer, which would make them outmatched in this competition. Likewise, the same goes for cryptocurrency trading, not everyone is capable of it, no matter how much you learn. If you decide to dive into the world of cryptocurrencies, then you need to understand that they hold a fair share of risk involved. There are reasons to be optimistic about them, and there are reasons to be weary. If you're interested in trading cryptocurrencies, then you should always do your research and never invest more than you can afford. Some people have made incredible amounts of money by doing so; others have lost it all. Speculating can lead to big gains, but it can also lead to big losses – don't fall prey to hype and buzzwords in your efforts to play the market.",

Although it cannot be denied that you will release capital here, it depends on what you can afford to lose because its value in the market fluctuates most of the time. It means that if you can loss a big one at discretion if it's a small one, and vice versa, just simple as that.",

In trading most of them just buy because they think it's a low price and they sell when they have a profit, some go for leverage which it's petty easy to do, of course 1000x times harder to make money out of it but the reality is that you can place any sort of trade (and lose money) far easier than a lot of sports bets.Shitcoin trading is gambling, end of it, they have zero reasons to look like anything else, at least with a match there is no way that if Buterin holds a banner with Barcelona during the game the result will change, with crypto one imbecile or one fake rumor and you have a 20% swing in minutes, and no TA will ever mage to predict that.",

This is where the importance of learning to analyze which is done continuously to improve our ability to trade and not many people can do this.We can minimize the risk in trading by just doing continuous research and acquiring skills and enough understanding about the basics and important knowledge about trading as well as technical analysis. While gambling, we are mostly relying on our luck. Trading could be like gambling if we will risk our funds with zero knowledge about what we are doing and without enough information about the coin that we're going to trade. Trading is risky but with continuous learning, we can deal with all the risks that we might face. If you rely solely on luck, I'm afraid you will lose your moment of profit because what you do in the market will cost you. That's what you will get if you trade without analysis and based solely on luck. Indeed there will be times when you can get lucky but that does not guarantee you will always be lucky. Maybe if the results of your analysis still make you hesitate but you still want to enter the market and try it with a little capital, I think it's still acceptable. And if you can accept the risk of losing money on the trade, you can trade, even if you are gambling.",

And guess what we do the same in trading also.The only major difference is the risk factor involved in both the scenarios.In case of trading the risk is minimal, whereas in gambling the risk is high and so do the profits.So coming back to the question asked by OP, if the risk factors in the trade is high, then it’s nothing but gambling.there is another difference in my opinion. once a gambler has made a bet, he will have no control over the assets at stake in the casino.but in trading, the control of the asset is always with the trader. however, the outcome of the trade is never known when it comes to buying the asset. but traders can hold assets and not accept losses. it's as you mentioned regarding the risk of trading which is less than gambling.the trader has complete control of the asset, wants to sell at a loss, or remains to wait to grow again until it gives a return.",
