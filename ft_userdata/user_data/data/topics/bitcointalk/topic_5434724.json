  "content": "I took advantage of the recent Black Friday deal and bought myself a Trezor One hardware wallet. I am planning to use it for certain activities in the future, and I have transferred a part of my bitcoin portfolio to it.But I have noticed something strange working with the Trezor Suite. It doesn't recognize each click of the mouse for some reason. For example, when I enter my PIN code into the software, I often have to click on the numbers 2 or 3 times before Trezor Suite accepts them. It's the same thing when I browse around the settings or perform other actions in the software. Multiple clicks are often needed. Otherwise, nothing happens. The hardware device itself works perfectly fine. I have been and still am a Ledger user for years and have never experienced the same glitches in Ledger Live. Therefore, I can rule out any issues with my laptop's hardware or software. I see no point in uninstalling and reinstalling Trezor Suite because I have never used an older version of it. It's the first time I have installed it on this machine. Has anyone encountered something similar, and how did you fix it? I will get in touch with Trezor support unless I find out what is wrong. Also, there are no problems with my mouse because it works correctly with other apps.",

I didn't notice issues with other apps because I was working with Ledger Live at the time as well. I will pay more attention to it next time. It has already happened a few times. I might try a different mouse first. The person who created that reddit thread mentioned removing their USB mouse and that seemed to fix the issues. I will try using the Suite with the touchpad only to see what happens.",

It is possible that the mouse software conflicts with Trezor Suite, which caused these troubles with the need to double-click. Try using this app with other mouse models or use the touchpad when working with crypto currencies on Trezor Suite.Quote from: Pmalek on January 15, 2023, 08:51:47 AMQuote from: jackg on January 14, 2023, 07:13:10 PMI don't think I've had this problem before myself but I also don't think I'd notice if I did.

Here the question is not only comfort, but also the safety of your funds. Bitcoins can't be lost that easily. You can't make a mistake and add an additional character to a bitcoin address because that would make it invalid. There is a checksum in the end. You also can't send the same coins twice because each UTXO needs to be verified, checked on the hardware wallet, and signed. Therefore, we can't have a situation where the software doesn't recognize my first click on the send button forcing me to click it again after which the transaction is made twice. Making a mistake with copying the wrong address is also out of the question because I check everything multiple times on the app and the hardware wallet.The bug doesn't seem to affect entries made with the keyboard. So when I enter the transaction fees, they get accepted immediately. It's the same thing when unlocking my hidden wallets with passphrases. The problem is only with the mouse clicks.",

I will definitely talk to the support but I am not that worried. Other people are already experiencing it when you think about it. Maybe not on such a wide scale, but it happens. If you take a look at the reddit thread that OmegaStarScream posted, you have two people there confirming the mouse was the culprit for the issues. There are surely others and probably cases that don't get made public.Quote from: AverageGlabella on January 15, 2023, 04:38:53 PM...and I would be afraid that in the future if you decide to change the pin code that you could make a mistake and lock yourself out. (hopefully you have your seed printed out to avoid this) The wallet's memory can always be wiped and reset to factory settings even if that happened. That would get rid of the PIN and I could enter a new one. I have multiple copies of my seed and passphrases scattered around. I thought I had an old mouse lying somewhere, but I must have thrown it into the trash. I can't test the software's behavior with a different mouse at the moment.There is something else I just remembered about this particular mouse. One of my laptops won't start if it's connected to a USB plug during booting. The picture doesn't appear on the screen and the fans act up. When I unplug it, everything calms down and the laptop boots up after a few seconds. Interestingly, this only affects that particular computer. I have a few other devices I use for different task and the mouse doesn't affect them at all.",

On rare occasions, it just decided to stop booting up unless disconnect my power first. Tried to see if anyone has the same issue on that motherboard but it seems that it only affects a minority of us. Hard to figure out what the issue is if it's hard to control the test environment, especially when it is never consistent. My gut feeling tells me that your mouse is probably fine, it's your laptop that is unique. CMIIW.",
