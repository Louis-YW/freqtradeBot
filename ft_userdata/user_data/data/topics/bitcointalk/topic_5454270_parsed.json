  "content": "Hi folks,Currently I'm trying to gain access to an old wallet of mine of which I saved the mnemonic. Problem is, when I try to import the words into Electrum it shows a total balance of 0 even though I know I transferred funds into one of the addresses a couple of years ago and they are still there when I check on any Blockchain explorers.The address I'm looking for is a P2PKH (starts with \"1.....\").So after trying a few things I ended up using BTCRecover (the one by 3rdIteration https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover) and it is able to find a match between my seed and the expected address.Code:python seedrecovery.py --addrs $MY_ADDRESS --mnemonic $MY_MNEMONIC --wallet-type bip39 --addr-limit 10Initial seed guess has a valid checksum (0.39% chance).Phase 1/4: up to 2 mistakes, excluding entirely different seed words.Wallet Type: btcrseed.WalletBIP39Using 8 worker threadsWill try 23,680 passwords, ETA 1 seconds ...***MATCHING SEED FOUND***, Matched on Address at derivation path: m/84'/0'/0'/0/0Search CompleteSo I'm a bit confused now as to what am I missing or forgetting. Why does BTCRecover always find a match but when I go to Electrum I can't seem to find anything?Is it the derivation path? I tried both m/84' and m/44' to no avail.In summary:Expected behaviour: importing my seed should grant me access to my fundsCurrent behaviour: seed won't even display the expected set of addresses when imported into EthereumEnvironment:- OS: OSX 13- Seed: BIP39- Wallet software: Electrum 4.4.3- BTCRecover 1.11.0",

Maybe, the address you are looking for has been generated on a different derivation path. Did you try clicking on \"Detect existing accounts\"? I generated the seed phrase around April 2021 using a Ledger Nano S that I still have access to, both mnemonic and PIN code.I also tried to use the device import the wallet into Electrum (New wallet > Use hardware device) using all three suggested derivation paths (p2pkh, p2wkph-p2sh and p2wpkh) without any luck. The Ledger app shows different addresses as well.Detecting existing accounts says that no accounts were found.To make matters more interesting, I found another funded address (let's call it A#2) I used to initially test the wallet and BTCRecover says that the seed matches this address on m/84'/0'/0'/0/1. As far as I understand, this would mean A#2 is the address subsequent to A#1 I mentioned in my OP. How can it be? Since m/84' means Native SegWit.",

The single quotes are not optional. You can begin again via file > new/restore. Just an addendum for anyone else who stumbles here:The reason why you have to select \"P2PKH\" as the script type even though you also have to enter the p2wpkh derivation path of 84' is because when you decide a seed phrase, it is turned into a master private key and the first few bytes of this MPK correspond to a script type - eg for P2PKH, it's xprv, for P2WPKH it's zprv, and there's a ton of other prefixes for the MPK on SLIP-0132: https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0132.mdWhen you are deriving any addresses and keys, you are actually hashing the prefix along with the rest of the key, and that's why the addresses look so different from when you use the default script settings for the particular derivation path you've chosen.The prefix actually has a name for it, it's called extended version bytes.When restoring a seed phrase, you also have to remember what extended version bytes and derivation path your old wallet was using. For an open source wallet, it's possible just by looking at the source code.It is my opinion that I believe seed phrases should carry a non-standard and optional 13th word that simply encodes two flags multiple bits wide each, the first indicating which pair of extended version bytes to use, and the second which derivation prefix to use (44', 49', 84', m/0', whatever). A SLIP can then be submitted that standardized all of these combinations of bits, and it becomes a sort of universal standard in Bitcoin and prevent issues like the one in the OP from happening.",

I have vage memories that you can convert a yprv, zprv or corresponding ypub, zpub into a xprv and xpub respectively and still get the same keys and public addresses derived from that converted xprv or xpub.I stumbled accross this because Bitcoin Core can only use the xprv and xpub representation of the Extended Master Private Key or Extended Master Public Key for use with descriptors. You can of course specify with such Core descriptors what kind of script type and derivation path should be used to derive keys and addresses.Definitely needs more learning, understanding and experiments with it for me.",
