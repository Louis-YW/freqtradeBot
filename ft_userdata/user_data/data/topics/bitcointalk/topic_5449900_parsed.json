He was limited from placing bets immediately, due to having raised several red flags upon registration and when he filled a ticket to inquire about limits we asked him to withdraw the money, before we even asked him for verification. This is because we have seen people lie about their location hundreds of times and knew that we were going to spend needless time on him continuing to pretend he was somewhere else. At no time has he not been permitted to withdraw the balance of his account. He is welcome to it any time. The reason the account was suspended yesterday, is because we spent 5 days with him going back and forth with him on support ticket, asking for verifications and him coming up with excuses not to send them. We don't have time for that so now he can email us when he is ready to either withdraw his funds or verify his location. How is that \"falling victim\" to us? We want and have wanted nothing more than to pay this player and be done with him, but he thinks he can just talk us into believing he is in a permitted region. That is not going to happen. As stated, we are happy to post the full support ticket conversation, with the player's permission, which will confirm all of this. This thread is pointless and needs to die. No one with any sense would think there is a scam here. If the player wants to withdraw his funds, he can email us. If the player wants to verify his location, he can email us. OP, please do one of these so we can all move on.",

Nice to read this response from the Bitcoin team this will to a large extent dictate what direction our discussions on the issue will take going forward, and  I don't think ops will have any issue with providing KYC documents for verifications since that is clearly stated in the casino T&C. I think instead of ops complaining here why not try to cooperate with the security team to get his issues resolved since he already opened multiple same tickets, I guess the security team are in the best position to attend to ops issues.",
