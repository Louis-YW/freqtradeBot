The difference here is that, in your Screenshot, the person might end up losing the money while in my country's case, the might end up losing his or her freedom. The confusing thing here in that notice is how they're relating crypto to fraud or scam. Any rational behind that assertion?",

They cite that it’s to protect investors from fraud & scams but really, it’s likely that they just want to stop the crypto on ramp. They do not want people moving their funds from the bank because it might make the bank insolvent if enough people try to do it. We will see this a lot I think over the next few years.

One thing is sure though, I have been here longer enough to know how crypto bear market always feels like, I won't be manipulated by these news, either good or bad I am ready to stand my ground, they are doing this to kill the little courage left on some holders, if you fall for it that's on you. The fear index is showing 39/100 this morning, it is not enough for them, maybe Bitcoin will dip down to 20,000 we don't know but it's better to avoid these news and focus on if the dips happen will I be able to DCA into Bitcoin again? You will do good if you prepare for any possible future events, it's way better than letting news affect you.",

Besides, how will you get a loan if you don't have a bank account? Here, where I live, I guess 90% of people have some kind of loan from the bank, whether it's because they bought a house, an apartment or a car that way.Banks will not disappear just like that, because regardless of the existence of Bitcoin, it is still only one alternative that has been accepted by very few people if we take into account global data. As for the policies of banks towards clients who invest in cryptocurrencies, this is nothing new, because not all banks are equal when it comes to this - and we have already seen many times that they often know to change their rules. If we just look back and remember Jamie Dimon and his views on Bitcoin, then it is clear that these are very fickle people who think one thing today and another tomorrow.But as already mentioned, it is possible that they are just playing a double game and trying to scare their clients and cause a price drop - although I doubt that they will succeed.",

That is why other institutions continue to just attack cryptocurrencies in practice. To be honest, such concerns are nothing new to us.

It's my money so let me use it the way I want. This is the problem with every bank. As long as they are dealing with something they can control, they are happy. The moment you choose something that they have no control over, they will flip. And as this is in the US, I don't think customer protection is the main concern here. There have been many non-crypto-related scams before, what have they done about that? Nothing.They want to suppress cryptocurrency or more specifically Bitcoin. They have no control over Bitcoin and that makes them scared. They can't control people like they used to do with traditional money. So they will go after Bitcoin with everything they have up their sleeve. Don't be surprised if they do. That has been their plan for ages. Slowly but surely they will come after everything related to Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Well, the agenda is to discourage people from using cryptocurrency as it is. They will try to give whoever tries to embrace cryptocurrency the impression that is a scam to discourage them from embracing it. Then get the governments to control it or only accept those it they can control since it is very useful .    If the one who controls the world needs to enslave people or have them depend on him,  he introduces some diseases and sell them the cure/drugs. Or fill their community with thieves and get them surveil themselves with devices they control.  This is basically how the World is made to enslave itself or lose its freedomThe scammers & fraudsters mostly attack their victims via centralized space and technology. They can be stopped but are allowed until the goal of the architect is achieved. The one who controls the world actually uses them to achieve his goal.One of the ways the scammers (which include non-humans) attack is to monitor the online and offline world for people interested in cryptocurrency. Then they spam them with scams that can make the victims lose money. It may interest you to know that they monitor their victims through the tech built by ad companies like Google to know their interest, by for example, listening to their conversations on the internet and in real world. It's a very sophisticated surveillance system that is spread across the world. And is part of the Matrix.In the future we hope to use decentralized solutions to minimize the issue. One the solutions is to get people transact more with reputable and/or verified anonymous users in Crypto space. It also will be possible to tag scam transactions/addresses/coins (with proofs of scams) on True Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin so people don't accept them.",

This could have a damaging effect on crypto if many more banks start enforcing this type of policy, because at the end of the day many people need the liquidity of being able to convert to fiat currency and that is one of the biggest benefits required for it to be successful. I wonder if they got wind of some regulatory changes that could be coming up, or they're tired of not being able to squeeze more out of their customers who are transferring funds around without the obscene fees that these banks charge. However there will be a small percentage of customers who are falling for scams and it's impossible to get the money returned compared to regular banking networks.",
