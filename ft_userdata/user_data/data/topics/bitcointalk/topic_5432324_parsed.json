  "content": "QuoteThe startup, Caden Inc., operates an app by the same name that helps users download their data from apps and services—whether that’s Amazon.com Inc. or Airbnb Inc. —into a personal “vault.” Users who consent to share that data for advertising purposes can earn a cut of the revenue that the app generates from it. They also can access personal analytics based on that data. The idea of giving consumers a cut of whatever brands might pay to reach them isn’t new, but it has been reinvigorated as outside companies have found it harder to harvest and share so-called third-party data. The digital ad industry has been seeking new sources of the consumer data that guides online marketing efforts as traditional tracking techniques have come under pressure. A new Apple policy last year requires apps to ask permission to track users, for example, permission that many people have declined to give. Would you share personal your data to an ad company for a pay? The data will be used for advertising purposes where you can earn a cut of the revenue that the app generates from it. This data would include- what you buy or watch on your mobile device. For instance, a user could consent to sharing his ride-share history so advertisers could create segments of people who ride a certain amount. That would eventually pay consumers up to $50 a month. Can you do it? Could this be considered as a passive income?News Source",

I think they are making it more easier for scammers to illicit their work and no more privacy as many people will will go for money instead of their privacy and safety.",

How many times have you browsed a website and then seen ads relevant to what you were searching for earlier? Advertisers are paying tremendous amounts of money to reach consumers, and we're willingly providing them with our personal information, free of charge. I'm not supporting the featured start-up company, but I'm mostly mentioning that it's something we already provide to huge corporations for free. Making a few bucks for something we already do doesn't sound too bad. However, I understand your concern that people would be willing to sell themselves for a few dollars.",

It's why you should just monetize it as well. The negative side however is yet to come. This revenue sharing from the app they make is not a new idea anymore there had been many crypto projects attempting like with thier browsers like Brave Browser (BAT). Besides collecting your browsing and buying habits, they also ask for KYC like it's not enough. Sooner these guys may ask for thier Security ID.",
