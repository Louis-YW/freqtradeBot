  "content": "Ey! For those noots out there, I just discovered that nootropicsnowph[1] is accepting bitcoin payments[2] which is a plus for people who are lazy enough to trade their BTC to PHP in Binance. Hindi ko pa personally na try kasi sa lazada ako bumili ng product nila, lately ko lang naman na may btc payment pala, pero baka sa susunod na order ko try ko yung BTC payments.Sa dami ng shits sa school, need ko ng boost for focus and mental endurance kaya nag opt-in ako mag take ng noopept. But of course, need pa rin ng proper sleep, clean foods, saka good sleep para ma optimize yung effect nung stimulant.[1] https://nootropicsnowph.com[2] https://nootropicsnowph.com/faqs/#1553095128962-cbabf2f0-39e4PS.

They are mainly used to enhance your cognitive functions, which means you can use it for additional boost to stay focus for a longer period of time lalo na sa mga boring stuff or any academic activities that requires your time and effort para matapos yung gawain nang tuloy-tuloy.Quote from: samcrypto on September 05, 2022, 11:51:45 PMand good thing nagaaccept sila ng BTC.And that's pretty surprising especially for OTC drugs. I am not pretty sure pero may nabasa lang ako na madalas daw hindi FDA registered yung supplements na binebenta sa internet, so I assume na baka dahil don kaya rin sila nag opt-in tumaggap ng BTC payments. But at least, I have found an online shop in our country accepting crypto -- hindi nga lang mainstream haha",

Well, back to school na nga at dagdag stress na naman ito panigurado.Â  I am also not familiar with this product pero it's good that there are merchants starting to view and accept BTC as an alternative payment to their products/services. Though medyo niche yung market ng website na ito since it focuses on \"brain productivity\", the fact still remains that they accept crypto as payment.Hopefully may mga big merchants na dito sa bansa ang tumanggap na ng cryptocurrency as payment. Medyo hassle + may fees if you convert your BTCs to cash sa mga local exchanges if gusto natin bumili ng mga products, unlike if may gateway directly in purchasing something using cryptocurrencies.",

Like talaga bang ma clear yung mind mo at magiging focused sa kong anong ginagawa mo at pro active din yung mind? From the scale of 1-10.- recommend ba syang gamitin pra sa mga taong nasa graveyard shift?Kasi, I am currently in a WFH setup and contractor ako sa isang funding company at need ko maging proactive all throughout my whole shift. Kadalasan kasi nawawala na ako sa focus kapag 1am na lol.At good thing my Bitcoin payments din, ayos na ayos. Pwede na dumiretso from wallet to wallet without converting it to gcash.",

      "body": "@OasismanAfter a month of using it, I can say that Noopept isn't for me kasi kabaliktaran yung nangyayari haha. Usually I feel extremely lethargic after 10-20 minutes. Some say mataas daw yung dosage ko na 30mg for a beginner like me na dapat 10 mg lang for starters. But it doesn't stop me from trying other noots out there, meron pang modafinil na OTC din sa nootropicsnowph na oorderin ko kapag may extra ulit kasi may kamahalan yung modafinil.Just remember that not all nootropics works for everyone else, madalas trial and error. So my take would be is for you to research even further.Aside sa nootropicsph, meron ding nootropicsdepot na nag aaccept ng bitcoin payments. Ang kaibahan lang, international company tong nootropicsdepot kaya sure na mas matagal yung delivery time.- https://support.nootropicsdepot.com/article/36-accepted-forms-of-payment",

So my take would be is for you to research even further.Alright, thank you sa tips bro. The same lang talaga lahat ng mga drugs, naka depende talaga sa katawan ng tao yung effects at side effects nya. I made a short research about nootropics and modafinil, and I guess modafinil is what most people were using as smart drugs. However, my mga side effects din pala talaga as expected, and yung pinaka ayaw ko na side effect ay yung headaches. Pero, I t-try ko parin one of these days or maybe next month when I have budget na din lol. Kasi medyo mahal nga yung Modafinil ðŸ˜…Thanks again bro.",
