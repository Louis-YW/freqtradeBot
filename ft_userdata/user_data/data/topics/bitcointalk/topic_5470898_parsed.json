I get that it may not be for people like me who has nothing to do with things like these, but at the end of the day some people are excited about it and that's more than enough for them.I believe that the best thing we could do right now regarding this situation would be just ignoring all the improvements and just focus on not having any beta issues, I am sure that they have done all the tests they need to do and will keep doing it until the last second but it is not going to be easy to find every single issue, sometimes when there are upgrades like this it ends up being a little bit harder and that causes a bit of trouble. I think it should be a tough deal and can't be really considered all that great easily, it has to be something that would result with an issue that's not going to be easy at all in the end.",

These are mostly helpful to big players or even high frequency traders where milliseconds matter a lot between a profit or loss.Isn't this like the 2 or 3 time Kucoin tries to relaunch their platform. At one point it was even called KuMex. This is more like Kucoin Futures 3.0",

KuCoin has been working on updates and improvements to their platform, so it's worth checking out the changes they've made.

If you are indeed waiting for users experience, you may have to wait till next year when halving begins. The reason is that even if users were to use this new features, it wouldn't make any difference between this and the old one because the workload is the same, the same users and the same coin, little to no stress. The only way you can determine all the features listed above is when the traders stressed the future exchange and that cannot happen now in bear market, we have to wait for bull run to test the scalability.Quote from: Dunamisx on October 20, 2023, 02:16:14 PMI would admit that this thread is supposed to be on exchanges board for proper discussion since kucoin itself is an exchange, i don't use the exchange but if the improvements aimed were fully implemented accordingly, then this is going to bring for more use of this exchange from the crypto communities, what the people want are improved services over time, and with these nee features, they are going to also record some recent changes as improvement towards the use of their exchange. I'm of the suggestion that it should be move to trading discussion, as the discussion is more specific on the future trading but anyone the OP decide is fine.Kucoin use to be every trader favorite because of altcoins they listed, big exchange like Binance and Okx don't give this opportunity to retail traders and small money bag but the mandatory verification sent lots of traders packing to another exchange. The good thing about the future is down is very difficult to see people complain about their downtime in futures. Binance literally had downtime many time when they launch their futures but kucoin hasn't for ones that I can remember.I don't know why they updated this now, or probably they are getting ready for bull run, who knows if they are expecting twice number of users from the last bull run.",
