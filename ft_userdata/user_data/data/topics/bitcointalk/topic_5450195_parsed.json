  "content": "What Happened: In Facebook I saw someone Promoting fake SUI Airdrop And Presale link and they are trapping users to scam with the newbies. Their Presale Price is 70000 SUI for 1 Eth. It's a Purely scam and they are also offering airdrop. When you reffer someone you get 100 SUI and the minimum withdraw is 500 SUI . They will not pay surely and they are just promoting this scam site by airdrop campaign.Remind that SUI isn't giving any airdrop to their community and they are just offering an IEO in OKX, BYBIT and Kucoin Exchange where you need to earn ticket to participate.Scam Website Link:https://ico.suinetwork.app/Scam Website Archive Link: https://archive.ph/05lgNScam Presale Address:0xf2e4f6282b6147Cb66ABc18fDbd3F694cc01ddaETheir minimum buy is 0.1 ETH and Maximum 10 Eth. I think they already stole a huge amount of Ethereum from the users as their wallet balance is still 9.529496118732971875 ETH. Also they have transferred a huge amount of Eth from that address already. Their fake token Contact address is 0x2F9A8b57B29E12a226590fF36c4B9729D4f779bf and their total supply is 10,000,000,000 SUI. Official SUI token wasn't developed on Ethereum Blockchain.The matter of worry is that many people are losing their funds by falling into this trap and many users are promoting this scam site by joining fake airdrop.So we must be aware of them and must be safe. Should research before joining any Presale.",

A friend sent me this airdrop link some days ago to copy my binance edu wallet address telling me he has registered  already  and  gave  me the link to follow the same method as he did. I was furious as to what was happening because if truly there is an airdrop by sui through binance, there is every tendency that binance would be the official announcer of the airdrop.  When i checked,  their was nothing of such nature so i had to discard the information as it was not real.Thanks.",

Even if you report it for several times, they might take action of taking it down but still, these scammers will just rinse and repeat.",

Atleast, we have been on this space for quite a long time now to decipher any scam be it here, telegram, social media or else where. I personally can never fall for it but there are some that are not smart enough to know and understand as they are of no experience. He newbies are likely the ones prone to these type of scam as they have no idea how the system works since they are new onboard the system. So they are likely to fall for it if they do not ask questions about it to enlightening their level of understanding.",
