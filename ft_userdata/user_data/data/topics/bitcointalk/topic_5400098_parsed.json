      "body": "Seems you were tagged due to identity fraud as collateral. And now you are promoting a Spoof mail service which is another fraud. Any legit person doesn't need to use Spoof mail at all. Spoof mail is often used to scam others. So stop promoting fraud services around the forum. Guys before you deal with OP please read his feedback. Likely you would be deceived.",
