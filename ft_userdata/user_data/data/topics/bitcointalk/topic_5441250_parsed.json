The greatest problem we're facing here in Nigeria is corruption and Peter Obi happens to be among the very few Nigerian politicians not indicted by any security agency for corruption.For me I believe he will do better but the problem is, will they (the cabal) allow justice to prevail?",

Obi would have found it difficult to have a competent cabinet, because he has not built a team like Tinubu, Tinubu will not struggle to make appointment, because he has political sons that are capable to turn Nigeria to true giant of Africa. I still advice Obi to use his obidient movement to get more states Governor in the coming election. Until he has more state Governors and sustain the obidient movement he will never be president. Atiku, past records are still fresh in the mind of Nigerians, especially he's Brothers, no one trust Atiku with the future and treasure of the nation. He Will never be Nigeria president. This was he last chance",

This was he last chance You used the exact phrase that many people used to predict that Peter Obi wouldn't get any votes because he lacks a political structure in the nation before the election. After the election, they were shocked by what transpired in the election, of how Obi had received the majority of the votes in most of the states.A victory under a capable leader merits celebration. But, when a bad leader prevails, everyone becomes agonized. Is that not what we have observed so far after Tinubu was declared the winner of the presidential election in Nigeria by INEC? Don't you think there would have been a huge celebration everywhere if Obi had been declared the winner of the Nigerian presidential election?In all of this presidential discussion, let's not be overly sentimental. The presidential election this year exposed the INEC's lack of proficiency. Let's see how INEC defends itself in the tribunal by not announcing the 2023 presidential election using the BVAS result",
