Profits dont increase everyday, only net profit or loss might change.In any day when the markets are open, you have to sell for the profit at a higher price than buying price. So the best strategy is to have patience till the higher price is reached and then sell, but to do that you need to have bought at lower price. Remember that more the number of altcoins more is the risk you will have to carry. Dont look at the entire portfolio at a glance, instead if you are trying to trade everyday, you will lose money.",

Investors who stick it out through the bear market will find themselves in a better position to make money during a bull market. Either way, investors shouldn't ignore this period just because it's been a hard time. This is a chance to learn how markets behave in extended down trends. I'm confident that the lessons learned from this bear market will guide you to better decision-making in the future.",

Scalping trade is the best way to get profit for now but i think that you didn't aware with the futures trade which is very risky for you to do that. I suggest you try to stake your token if you didn't even use it to trade. That will give you regular profit rather than only seeing your portfolios goes up and down without getting any profit. Scalping was the beststaking valuable coins or putting for example your btc to flexible or fixed savings, if you are just waiting for the market to recover. scalping is also good if you know the strategies to get as much profit as you can. don't get involve in futures if you have no idea about this type of trading. you can easily get liquidated and lose all your profits. for staking, choose your coins wisely. assess if the coin will recover or increase its price once btc starts to rise. it means, coins with good use case and active application in the market would be a good start to check out.",

Why it's the hardest? Because it's very volatile and the market is unknown at these times, it may be the hardest for many but it's easy for some real traders. But as a matter of fact, many traders are losing instead of profiting and that's why it's also hard. So, if you want the easiest, it will require you long patience and that's through holding and buying more.",

That's very true, you choose the project to invest in, but bear markets are annoying because we always see our assets just go down or stay here. We can only wait for it all, the bear market will definitely end.Monitor the project you are invested with. Some projects loses their value when the market is down and sometimes they were not able to recover. So when there is a chance to get profit thru trading better sell them and just buy back once the market recovers. It's good to support a project provided we study their capabilities to withstand the bear season.",

You need to be careful with the desire for it, it makes one vulnerable to scam. I have so many private messages on Twitter with advice on strategy to make profit from this bearish market, who shares such strategy to people free? No one. The risk is just to high for any short term, the best I can give is to buy the bottom of most top coins and look credible startup to invest inThere will always be a problem in identifying startups that are genuine for investment. Currently, there are more than 200,000 cryptocurrencies listed on Coinmarketcap, and of course it is not possible to be sure of the reliability of most of them, even those that were launched a long time ago.Achieving a constant profit on a regular basis is by adopting the least risky methods, and this is by investing in currencies known in the bear periods. Caution remains a must for those who invest large amounts of money in one currency with the aim of making profit in the short term.",

But since you are able to see that when your portfolio is in gain or loss, I suggest you take advantage of it. Sell when you are up and buy again when it is down.Also, you can hold on token/crypto that is safe for long term investment. So that even if you hodl for a long time you know that one day it will eventually gain you good profit.",

Just for investor want to hold in long term, but for trader with short term keep scalping are the best choose for them. Not easy try earn profit with scalping this bear time, we can't predicting about bitcoin suddenly going down although have reach good price.",

As well as that, have you tried staking stablecoins, I think that is also a very good method of profiting from this bear market.
