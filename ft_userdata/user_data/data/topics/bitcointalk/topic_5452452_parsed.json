Also, what you are promoting is a referral program, correct? And what token will you give to everyone who can refer a friend to your telegram official channel? is this token one of the top 100? maybe later the token has no value or its liquidity in the market is low. Your post is a bit not informative or detailed, so my questions are as follows.",

As benalexis12 said, you didn't shared a lot of infos in your post OP.You know well, as everyone here, that Telegram groups are often capable of the best and the worst, and too regularly, of the worst only: scams are frequent on these groups, and distrust is therefore often necessary.Is this a group dedicated to cryptos in general or only to a single token? Is the purpose of this post to attract new users in order to simulate community activity to promote a new token?What is the token you are talking about for the Welcome bonus?",

      "body": "So you are offering a Ponzi scheme, whereby the user invites his friends and therefore they will automatically trust your group because of their trust in that member and suddenly everything disappears?Making any user qualified for the bonus is something strange, so restrictions must be placed such as performing a specific task, a specific deposit, or something, but now it is a little suspicious.The reputation of these groups is not good here, so it is better to post everything publicly with an address to donate to you.",
