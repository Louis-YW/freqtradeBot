  "content": "With the persistent De valuation in the value of the Naira on the exchange market,  over the years the Nigeria naira has constantly lost its value to the united state dollar, which is a global exchange currency perimeter, and the lingering negative impact on the economy and it impact the value of goods and services in the Nigeria internal microeconomic and the values of both currencies have led to a hike in the price of goods and services within Nigeria. -A lot of efforts have been put in place to salvage the already worsening situation of the naira against the value of the dollar, in Nigeria, we have the official price of a dollar to naira according to CBN to be ₦460.54 vs $1 but we all know the fact that the central bank or any other commercial banks does not have the availability of this currency so it exchange is bearly minimum. -So the only option is to source for alternatives sources to get the dollars and that brings you down to the black market, who's the CBN call currency speculators and perceived as the enemy of the revival of the value of the traditional currency,  at the black market, we all know how much the value is on Binance exchange as at this morning the value of $1=₦741.23 so that is a big difference from the government recorded price. -so the question is, is it justifiable for the CBN to use anti-graft agencies such as the EFCC to arrest currency speculators/p2p Exchange? -What is the rule of speculators in the outcome of the value of any asset a case study of the 9ja ₦ vs $.",

      "body": "The margin between the CBN rate and the parallel (black) market rate before was very close, but Nigerians that are demanding for United States dollars are increasing and the rate they are demanding for foreign currencies in general is increasing. Nigerians have more been dependent on imports more than they export and this is depleting the foreign reserve.Because of that, the CBN have tried all means possible to inconvenient Nigerians, example is the naira master cards that Nigerians can use to make over $3000 or maybe more international transactions before in the past, but it was later reduced by CBN to $100. Later, CBN makes it impossible for Nigerians to use naira master card for international purchases and services. Although, you can go to bank and request for a dollar card. But like me, I have not even done that up till now. I believe people making international purchases using card might have reduced because if this. This is one that I know, but a means CBN is looking for ways to reduce requests for foreign currencies.The CBN tried all other ways to inconvenient Nigerians but not increase the dollar exchange rate to the amount it supposed to be, therefore decreasing the value of naira not up to the price it supposed to reduced it to. But in the parallel market that is determined by how people are (demanding for) or trading naira to dollar and other foreign currencies, the demand for the foreign currencies is higher than the CBN prices for them. CBN only tried to manipulate the price, but the demand price is what people are going for. The higher the demand the higher the price.To protect the foreign reserve depletion and to pay workers salary, the government through the CBN do reduce the value of naira, but if the demand for foreign currencies is what that is reducing it, the CBN will like it inorder to protect the foreign reserve. The demand may continue to increase, but this will increase the dollar price too and the foreign reserve depletion will reduce.",

A serving house of rep member explained how the CBN governor can make one rich overnight by tampering with the ₦ to $ price in the parallel market during a live TV show on Brekete TV one time. In his statements, he confirmed that the CBN and the government have a role to play in the parallel market in order to profit from it. Because this is unknown to the general public, we can't entirely blame the speculators/p2p exchanges for their exorbitant prices based on the $ rate.",

This has been known to everyone because during this past election where they distributed dollars it happen that I was their, they were given $100 note, I then said this is not up fifty thousand Naira (#50,000) they started looking at me as a criminal. I calculated it based on CBN rate for them so that I can buy it from them to make some profit, they said the price is more than what I was saying. Can this difference be solved, what if the CBN decide to increase their price reference to the Black Market our Naira will be in a total mess.",

The CBN don't have control over the Dollar market outside it's banks operative, I'd they want the Naira not to be devalued over the Dollar then they should put up some efforts to increase the economy of the country. Sanctions and price impose to the people is never going to work and it has never worked in any where. the best fight against any foreign currency is for the country to increase in productivity and reduce exportation by doing so the demand for the foreign currency will reduce which will in turns reduce it's price. Back to your question regarding if the government through EFCC is going to arrest currency speculator in P2P, My answer is No, although their is nothing which this government can't get warrant over, but it will really be unwise for the government to take that step, how many P2P exchange will they have to visit in other for them to achieve that?",

Other factors like high importation rate, economic crisis, government policies dey also affect the naira-dollar rate.

The thing here is that the CBN is not doing anything to help the situation. They did not do anything when the price of the black market rate was gradually shifting from the CBN's rate, so the only solution they can provide now is to make dollars available to citizens who need them (for business) so they do not have to buy them from currency speculators/P2P. This is a business avenue for the speculators and one cannot really tell the difficulty they undergo to get the dollar they exchange.But the thing here is that some folks who are selling dollars in the black market are making a huge profit, but it will be bitter when you're buying. Why I said this is because if one has a relative living in the US and is opportune to receive dollars from them, they can sell them on the black market for $1/#740 instead of selling them for $1/#460 to the bank.",

CBN banning currencies has alot to do with the currency speculators, even now you can see that crypto dollars is higher than the normal dollars and all this does have it's effect on on the general market. Naturally people will tend to what to trade in crypto so they can get more Naira for their dollars, it's just that simple. I agree with you on the cashless policy being a possible panacea to restoring the naira's lost value but then the policy failed again just like the e naira is failing and every other monetary policy of the current CBN regime is failing, the problem with the Nigeria nairas value is domestic and if the naira most regains its value it must start first at the local market and the rate of inflation need to really be cut down and that will require government direct involvement in the pricing of good and services within the economy.Once there is a price control it will become easier for the CBN to make and implement any monetary policy they intend to such as the cashless policy and the e naira drive.My fear now is that, hope the anti graft agency will not start putting eyes on cryptocurrency traders in Nigeria in time to come, because from the finamcial news i have being watching on channel tv, it seems cryptocurrency trading volume is increasingly high lately and bitcoin is at the center of things and if the CBN could go after local currency speculators, its like possible there will also pay attention to other forex exchange commodities such as cryptocurrencies.

Sometimes na we dey shoot ourselves for leg, even though CNB policy no for be the solution to our Naira devaluation but e fit give am small strength and we fit dey use that one work for the main time.With the rate of Nigerians going into crypto trading, the rate supposed increase normally and I dey believe say very soon, the crypto traders go be the next target, make we dey watch how things go unfold, right now crypto trading dey get free pass but when the government go come for them, na war e go be. People dey think say cryptocurrency trading no dey get any influence for the forex market especially dollar rate but it's now one of the major influencers on the market, abi una never hear about crypto dollar rates?",
