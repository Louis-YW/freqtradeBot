Regulated, but KYC isn't enforced. It's like a whole new ball game. I wonder what kind of 'government' they've got running the show – maybe a 'decentralized government' where rules are more flexible? Words are cheap. 'No KYC', 'decentralized', 'custodial', and the like are terms easily used to mislead people and gain trust. Under their terms and conditions, you indeed cannot find KYC, but you can find 'personal data' and 'personal information'. Specifically, it says: \"...we will collect minimal personal identification, only as much as required to protect the security of your funds, such as to prove your identity to reclaim ownership should account access be lost.\"Also, I'm a little bit confused. Is this exchange based in Hong Kong but licensed or registered in George Town, Cayman Islands? It seems it was only just a couple of months ago when the first cryptocurrency exchange secured a Hong Kong license to offer trading to retail investors. And this is operating since 2019? I hope OP clarifies.",

Specifically, it says: \"...we will collect minimal personal identification, only as much as required to protect the security of your funds, such as to prove your identity to reclaim ownership should account access be lost.\"That's quite misleading because, in reality, they do impose KYC checks. They just don't announce it upfront to attract users to the exchange. For those of us who have been in the crypto space for a while, it's easy to spot red flags like that. It's good that we have this forum so we can voice our opinions if there's a post promoting a certain exchange, but it doesn't seem to match what it's claiming.This might actually tempt those who are desperate to use the exchange because they either want to hide their identity or don't have the necessary documents for verification. But there's always an inherent risk in using such exchanges. Hopefully, they'll be able to handle it if things don't meet their expectations, as they were already warned and aware of the risks from the start.",

Can you withdraw this $30, or are they discounts on trading fees, and do they enable you to withdraw it without verifying the identity?

We can be quite certain that the Hong Kong regulators are presently looking at them now hehehe. It might be okay to trade there if you are also okay if they begin enforcing KYC. However, if you are not then this might be a trap for your cryptocoins.",

      "body": "I posted earlier and deleted it, sorry if I confused a mod. Created an account to post on this thread.I can post my full experience, but to summarize; I have seen Bitcoke mentioned in posts exactly like OP recently on other social media. I have been in the space a while and know better. After doing way too little research, I deposited way more than I should have (30% portfolio lol..) and then could not access my account after trying to log back in.I quickly convinced myself it was a scam, and after trying to do more in-depth research I was certain. The wallet activity didn't look like that of an active exchange to me either. I was convinced I had lost my money. But support eventually responded saying that 2FA was broken so they disabled it for me. I then initiated a withdrawal and simply did my best to prod the platform to see what else I could learn, and there were many red flags in my mind. One example of a flag is all but the most basic features are locked behind KYC, but the KYC page is broken and support's first response was \"Our site doesn't require KYC\".They actually gave my money back though... I couldn't believe it. The withdrawal actually went through (albeit slowly). But I am still 100% convinced it is a sketchy front, ponzi scheme, or scam one way or another, though I can't prove it given I got my money back. So I would recommend staying tf away from Bitcoke. I can provide full detail of my experience and observations in a reply if anyone wants, but for now I need to go to sleep.Don't be like me. Be careful, ACTUALLY do research, don't start with large amounts to unknown parties, and probably just avoid CEXs all together.",
