  "content": "While searching online, I found this article published in 2020, which states that miners in Iran must sell everything they earn through channels subject to the authority of the Central Bank of Iran. I did not know anything about this subject, and I do not believe that there are miners who use these channels or that any mining company can work under this pressure. At the same time, miners in Iran will suffer from these pressures if one of them is discovered.In this article, there is an explanation that each miner will have a legal share of what it earns, determined according to the energy consumed, and that the Ministry of Energy is the one who will determine that value.Iran is experiencing great economic difficulties since Western sanctions prevent it from using the dollar, and therefore it is looking for alternatives that facilitate international trade exchanges. However, by implementing these laws, this may put pressure on miners, and they will not accept to sell their profits under duress.Is there anyone knowledgeable about this topic?",

I had published the same topic in my local board and got some useful information regarding the mining situation in Iran. I will try to summarize it: Iran has enormous energy resources and can establish mining centers if work is done to establish appropriate infrastructure. Of course, Iran did not work on this and did not think about regulating the sector, since it is like many other countries that refuse to join the bandwagon of technology. This led to the emergence of many miners carrying out their activities in secret, which caused an impact on the electricity distribution networks (successive outages, limited flow...), which forced the state to try to contain the matter through the legislation mentioned in the OP.At the same time, Iran is afraid of completely legalizing crypto activities for fear that this will be used to finance separatist groups on its borders, such as the Kurds. Therefore, Iran does not want to completely ban mining in order to benefit from its resources used later for bypassing western sanctions, and at the same time it does not want crypto to be used in activities hostile to it.",

Could it be that one of the reasons why Iran is making policies to regulate the activities of miners is to limit the use of Bitcoin by the Kurdish rebels? Stopping or limiting these transnational separatist groups from receiving funds from cryptocurrency will be very difficult because of the decentralized nature of the currency.

Therefore, the system of government is based on dictatorship and the passing of rulings is through repression if consensus does not succeed.Even without western sanctions imposed on Iran, do not expect that life will be easy or that control over money movements will be normal. The Iranian regime has internal enemies who feed from enemies abroad. That is, the Iranian issue is not the only thing that creates hostilities, because disputes with its neighbors in the region are based on sectarian and ethnic backgrounds.The government in Iran knows that citizens will not hesitate to use any means to avoid falling under international sanctions. So I don't think Iran would want to let it get out of her hands.",

They are also constantly exposed to bombing and harassment from the Turkish government, which does not want them near its lands. So practically mining there is almost impossible.",

You will have to regulate what power the neighborhood will consume. It could be upto 30% of the power you can generate. By this, the your rate of electricity consumption will not raise an eyebrows. The impact in the business will be high cost of power supply or maintenance while using generators. The best is to find an environment where your rate of power consumption is not a problem, provided you can pay for the power.Are you sure about what you are offering?In any place, records are kept of the electricity consumed if it is used by different users, and no one will allow the installation of powerful generators in a residential area.Did you hear the noise of these installations?You greatly increase investments in additional equipment that does not provide profit.",

Even if you steal electricity, this will also cause inspections. Mining farms do not occupy huge areas, and they are easy to hide, but constant and stable electricity consumption is very difficult to hide.The problem with mining devices is noise, not electricity consumption. No matter how much you try to reduce the noise, the sound of mining devices is still loud and it is difficult to hide it if you are in an apartment or a confined place. It is possible in this simple way to reveal your location.You can listen to the sound of these devices in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yyquzJdexsMining of some altcoins can be done using graphics cards and therefore it is impossible to be tracked by electricity consumption.If we take the Antminer S19 as an example, the electricity consumption is 3250W. some home appliances such as the cooktop and central AC system need between 3000-4000 W. Therefore, if you are in a large apartment, you will consume this amount of electricity.",
