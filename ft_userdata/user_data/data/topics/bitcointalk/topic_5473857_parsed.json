The app contains ads and we never know if there is any malware programmed in the app. If it was published on iOS then we could have trusted it but anyone can put up the app on google play store without any scrutiny.As a method of precaution, i would advise not to download this app unless we see some really good feedback about it.",

Specially if you are really keen on this games, no need to download any suspicious apps or what not.Just go with the old and traditional way, read and learn and then practice it in the casino itself. You can even ask the dealer on how everything is and for sure they are all going to help anyone to play and get hook on this card games.",

Even though it's in the Playstore, it doesn't rule out the possibility that there is malware trying to exploit cellphone data. So anyone needs to be careful, especially beginners, and always have safer alternative options. The casino already provides Blackjack games and we only need to go there without the hassle of downloading applications that fill up our cellphone memory.",

What else will the app have access to on your device?",

What they are just after is their pocket and benefit they would derive while leaving their followers or fan base to deal with whatever would spring up as a result of their engagement with what they have promoted via their handle.",

Is this app a casino that let you play blackjack with real money or just a simulation app for blackjack beginner since you mention about detailed analysis.
