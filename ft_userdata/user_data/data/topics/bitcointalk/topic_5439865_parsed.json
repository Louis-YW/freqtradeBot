Now many projects insert this acronym in their names or descriptions, just to draw attention to themselves, but in fact, they have nothing to do with AI. The project trades on one DEX, in a small pair with micro liquidity, there are hundreds of such projects every day, but no project has brought investors a large profit over time. GEMs always appear on centralized platforms, not DEXs.",

I don't think it's anything good in the context of trying to obtain real popularity or traction really, seems like just a really rather dumb way for you to get banned and reported to Elon and get your account banned. I don't even think you need \"assistance\" when it comes to raiding in the first place, I reckon there are a few services out there that offer them, probably in a much more higher quality than what this bot can do atm. Can't also deny that this just seems to be riding on the coattails of the AI boom.",
