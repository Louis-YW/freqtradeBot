  "content": "Good day, all, So, there was news recently about the rise in Ethereum's Gas rising to 72 GWEI on the 26th of September, 2023, and I decided to research it.  I believe we all know what the term \"Gas\" is on Ethereum's network. For those who don't,  it is simply the fee per transaction on the network. Gas price is determined by demand and supply in the market and may fluctuate depending on the network congestion and complicatedness of transactions.  Now, the causes of the increase include;The deployment of Curve Finances native stablecoin. This had been long awaited by the Defi community.  The crvUSD attracted a lot of liquidity and actions to its platform,  thereby increasing the demand for GAS.However, it was later redeployed shortly after deployment and added pressure to the network.Another thing was the release of \" stoner cats\" NFTs on the network. It led to a lot of demands from collectors and lovers who rushed to buy them before they sold out. This increased competition for block space and drove up the gas fees for everyone.And then, the ongoing memecoin trading frenzy that started with the run of PEPE and continued with other tokens. Transactions took place on uniswap and accounted for 34% of all fees paid on the network in the last week.This was what I could gather during my research, you can also read more here;https://bitcoinist.com/https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator",

Upon checking on how much the gas fees are, it is not that much as of now unlike to what you've said. While for coinmarketcap, I have checked the fees and it's like this.Quote from: coinmarketcap.comSlow/Standard ~24 gwei 165 secsFast ~69 gwei 45 secsQuote from: Bitco55 on September 26, 2023, 11:41:16 AM Now, the causes of the increase include;At most times, it's always that the network is clogged and that's why the fees are that much. The other day, it was on bitcoin and that's due to ordinals.",

We still have liquidity of $36,388,774.11, while some wrapped tokens may have higher liquidity than that.",

Recently, crypto activity has increased with the birth of meme coins, one of which, like the one you OP, was developed on the Ethereum network. One thing that is certain is that traders have to spend a lot of money to pay transaction fees compared to the number of original transactions carried out on the Ethereum blockchain.",

Traders are well aware of this. It depends on us whether we choose to conduct our transactions at high fees or wait for GAS fees to decrease. GAS fees have been quite low for several months now, but they are likely to increase during a bull run when transaction volumes rise. However, for the time being, GAS fees remain within the normal range and are affordable.",

They don't really care because as we already know, lots of platforms are being made to counter this issue and they even made their own network with the lowest fees but still they remain behind against Ethereum. Throughout the years this has been the problem for Ethereum users but not its owner and those who don't really find a problem with the large amount of transaction fees because they are rich and also transacting huge amounts of ETH as well which made them blind to that kind of transaction fees.",

This has been a pain for such a long time because I have been in terrible situations in the past when I needed to withdraw and the gas price was very high, i understand it doesn't remain high throughout the year but it should have been fixed long time ago at the time of migration to POS, but unfortunately it's still a major issue which drives away the users and if this continues then people will opt for other options which are available in the market rather that paying exorbitant gas fees.",

This is not new anymore and ETH can’t make any solution to address this issue and I think we have to deal with that higher fees not until ETH develop something new to make it cheaper again. There are cases before where the transacted amount is just a small one and yet they paid a huge fees for that transaction so I agree that you should double check it before you proceed. After all the updates with ETH, they can’t still meet the expectation of many which is to have a cheaper fee and a faster transaction, let’s see how the fees affect the ETH itself.",

Like in Bitcoin's transaction fees, there is a time that is also high and that is not a worrying part. I don't think it was hard to become patient and wait for the gas fee to drop but if you are badly needed for it, then make no choice but to pay the gas fee. Well, the Ethereum gas fee has already been high for several years already. Unlike before, we can just pay $1 but these days, $10 is quite normal.",
