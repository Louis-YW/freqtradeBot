Some are also retweets of what other people said.  Not sure how to interpret what Elon wrote and what the requirements for an account to be deleted are.He said accounts with no tweets will be deleted. Hal's account has tweets. The other requirement is no log ins for years. Unless someone from Hal's family logs into his Twitter account from time to time, that could be a reason for account deletion. We will have to see whether both conditions must be met for a Twitter account to be deleted or if one of them is enough.",

We don't know when somebody decides he wants to check Hal's awake hours or writing style or whatever... let's not waste what we can easily keep.Quote from: ImThour on December 09, 2022, 09:17:55 AMSince I am not so big of a Twitter user, I had to check your image for Hal's Twitter handle (of the many accounts called Hal Finney, heh).But imho a much better approach is to archive this as text so people can also search in it. And I think/hope that this will do the job: Archive of Hal Finney's tweets and replies",

Media and communities put a lot of pressure on Elon about why he supported Bitcoin but his vision for Tesla is green production.I know Bitcoin is not environmental damage as much as media accused it but maybe Elon chose an easier way to response to media attack on Tesla. It can be considered that his support for Bitcoin is not loyal but it does not mean he does not like Bitcoin.",

If people who know the basics of mathematics and know how to read say that 0.14% of the world's total energy consumption falls on Bitcoin mining and that more than 50% comes from renewable sources, then Bitcoin is greener than a company that does not want it.I will repeat once again that his actions have caused great damage to Bitcoin, and that it is not at all clear to me that so many people still support him as some kind of crypto messiah.

In respect to account preservation, I think there should some considerations to blue ticked accounts which owners are no more but their impart is  still felt in the world or rather, as earlier said by one, Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on December 10, 2022, 03:10:45 PMPlatforms always have archival data so they can revert their decision on account ban or deletion easily. Blue ticked account should be archived for data and information preservation which will help in the future to restore if any information is needed about any account holder who is no more.   Nevertheless, if possible, Elon musk should mark a special day for blue ticked account that are no more i.e a kind of tweet remembrance day for such account holders that in one way or the other have created or inspired many into being who they are in their various walks of life. This I think can be done so as to remember their memory down lane. It will also boast tweeter reputation.",
