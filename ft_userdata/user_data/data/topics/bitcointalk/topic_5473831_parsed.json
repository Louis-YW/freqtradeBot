It requires some spending and this is now the format of airdrops.",

So you should follow them on their official social media like Twitter as they usually put their announcement there.But just be careful though, as scammers also had this kind of knowledge and so they will create a similar websites with celestia or any other projects that will airdrop soon and then asking you to connect your wallet. Do not do that as the criminals will scoop every tokens from you and drain everything.",

The best strategy I've seen so far is to be a part of a community where latest information about such events / announcements are posted by other members. This way you won't be a lot if you're active as there are most eyes on new opportunities and announcements as they become available. You should get onnit asap as more drops might be on the way —see zksync and layerzero (heavily rumored in recent times).",

That's sad that if your allocated TIA has already redistributed to the eligible participants who have been claiming their tokens. There are so many websites to know the potential projects that may do another airdrop. I will mention somedropstabCryptorankThese websites will give you information regarding what potential projects that may do airdrop in the future. It must be noted that if you must put VC who backed the project as the main concern. It's caused by any legit airdrops will always be backed by the big parties and venture capital. I think that majority of people agree with this. It's caused by any projects backed by binance labs will always be doing airdrop.",

Usually they are posting it especially the upcoming. Theres a tier of received airdrop from tia but almost all have the same equal tokens with the lowest tier I think 163 tokens of tia before it was only 50 tia but increase 3x.",
