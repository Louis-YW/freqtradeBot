Both listening and non-listening connections can be up to 125 by default. I don't find a reason to change that.Quote from: decryptit on November 29, 2022, 05:41:59 PMDo you set up rpc info?

I couldn't get it to work with my Ledger. It keeps giving me error.Quote from: BitMaxz on November 29, 2022, 07:28:42 PMLedger already has some guides on connecting your Bitcoin core full node to your ledger device why not read the documentation on how to set up your Bitcoin.conf file?Here's the link below.- https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017551659-Setting-up-your-Bitcoin-full-node?docs=trueBased on the documentation you still need ledger live and satstack to connect it to Bitcoin core and it's currently experimental but I guess it would work.I have read their stuff but it doesn't expand into what to put in the .conf file. I figured out to set the rpc server login info in there but still didn't work. I also tried connecting my ledger to my Bitcoin Machine aka Umbrel and same thing, didn't work",
