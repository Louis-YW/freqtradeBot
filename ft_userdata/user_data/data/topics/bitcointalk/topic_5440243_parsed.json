  "content": "Sumber : ForbesThe altcoin in the AI ​​category actually hasn't had time to trend back to its full potential in 2022. Meanwhile, other Altcoin categories seem to have experienced their trending ups and downs in 2022.As an example of an altcoin category that has experienced popularity (trending) in 2022 is the Metaverse category. Metaverse coins are very popular in 2022. Some even experienced a pretty good and fast increase. Metaverse coins that were trending but still have strong trading volume are examples like- Apecoin (APE)- Internet Computer (ICP)- Theta Network (THETA)- The Sandbox (SAND)- Axie Infinity (AXS)And many more like GALA etc.Source : coinmarketcapAnd still in 2022 we have also seen altcoins in the crypto wallet category such as TrustWallet (TWT) and Safepal (SFP) and others experiencing trending again, even if only briefly. And it happened during the FTX Bankruptcy so that many people moved their assets from the exchange to their personal Wallet. And altcoins in the wallet category are also affected (positively) and are experiencing an increase. Furthermore, the altcoin for the Fan Token category also experienced its season (trending) before and during the Fifa World Cup.And it seems that the AI ​​and Big Data categories haven't had time to get their season (trending) back in 2022. Even though AI technology has become increasingly popular. Maybe in 2023 it will be the season (trending)?The following are the top 10 AI and Big Data Altcoin categories by trading volume- The Graph (GRT)- SingularityNET (AGIX)- Render Token (RNDR)- Oasis Network (ROSE)- Fetch.ai (FET)- Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)- iExec RLC (RLC)- Artificial Liquid Intelegence (ALI)- Numeraire (NMR)- dKargo (DKA)Sourch: CoinmarketcapAnd actually I created this thread on Local (Indonesia) and have had an interesting and informative discussion. but I also expected a wider discussion from global users so I decided to translate it into English.Let's discuss and share insights and information about Altcoins in the AI ​​and Big data category. which seems to have started trending in 2023.and have you invested in altcoins in the AI ​​category?and what coins have you held or are you still reviewing for altcoins in the AI ​​and Big data categories?-------original topic before translated: Akankah Altcoin kategori AI & Big data populer kembali di 2023?",

They did fund raise in 2017 and 2018 bull run, required bounty hunters to pay $5 or $15 to KYC and be eligible for bounty payments. Their distribution was delayed many years and at distribution time, the token blasted off to more than $400.Today $ICP price is about $7 that looks very cheap but I'd not like to buy them before the end of bear market.",

And I include it as an example of an altcoin project that went viral in 2022, namely the games and metaverse category. I even said other categories like Fan tokens and others.and for the AI ​​and big data categories you can see in the next paragraph I include the names in pictures directly from CMC. you can see and read it after the paragraph. I made some edits because it turns out that the altcoins in the AI ​​category which are currently in the top 10 are different from last month. so I re-edited it with the latest update from CMC.so the list of AI tokens in this topic will be slightly different than in my original topic on a local board.",

Meanwhile, other Altcoin categories seem to have experienced their trending ups and downs in 2022.They have already become popular. The AI project is in the center of discussion right now, and in general the whole topic of artificial intelligence is trending right now. Many projects related to artificial intelligence, which were launched quite a long time ago, 3-4 years ago, are now growing well, giving thousands of percent profit. Now this hype is only gaining momentum. I'm sure by the time the new bull run comes, the category of these coins could give solid growth.",

Just a few months after the NFT hype was gone, here comes a new kind of industry that is becoming more popular in the crypto industry. The AI coin hype has just began and expect more projects that are related to AI to emerge in the next months. Some might be successful (maybe around 5 at most will be), and most of them will be just a scam coin, dead coin, and some projects will just rug pull it's customers.Me investing in altcoins under AI category? I might try, but for short term only and will sell it as it goes up. When I will do my research, I will try and research these existing coins that are related to AI.",

Not without reason, this happened because big people like Elon Musk and also institutions like Microsoft started to pay attention to AI.Quote from: Uruhara on February 18, 2023, 03:16:35 AMhave you invested in altcoins in the AI ​​category?I have invested in SingularityNET (AGIX) some time ago, nothing is more promising than that token in my opinion, why not buy The Graph (GRT)? buying $GRT is too risky because the market capitalization is too big.Quote from: Uruhara on February 18, 2023, 03:16:35 AMwhat coins have you held or are you still reviewing for altcoins in the AI ​​and Big data categories?I didn't hold my SingularityNET (AGIX) anymore a few days ago, I thought it was time for me to take profit, no hype lasts forever, so it would be better to just take advantage of the momentum.",

But in actuality, the term ai is really being used for so many things and connecting it to the market, there should really be a big usage on it.Looking at that, we can all say that it's just all market and stuff and that's why it's not going to be a permanent thing. Nothing against with those projects that are focusing in ai but, at first most of them are only looking at their benefits through the market.",

There were several videos about it that it favors political party. But google though had also launched thier own AI to compete the chatGPT. With this progress, there is a chance that AI fully bring the bull market while all other altcoins are also updating its roadmaps like the Filecoin and Chainlink. We are in the right time to actually get a ride of these AI tokens so its up to you. These are the short term kind of investment that before the bull run will be over you have to dump yours as quick as possible because this is also the first that will plunge.",

      "body": "Generally, artificial intelligence is currently becoming the interest of the masses. The recent ChatGPT hype, Google with its Bard, and Bing with the integration of ChatGPT. It is expected that many businesses will try to utilize it or they also can participate in it to tighten up the competition. When we are talking about cryptocurrency, one must wonder, in specifically what purposes cryptocurrency or a token are beneficially significant in the attempt at AI advancement. Contrasted to the popular one I addressed above, they did not even require any token or coin. Crypto is having a bad connotation due to its past history, some of us are aware of how it is being utilized for worthless purposes. So, I think there will be many cryptos that will incorporate AI hype or popularities, but, for practical vision, it has a less significant effect on the main aspect of AI.",

Thanks to the success of ChatGPT, opportunists have now flocked into another way of marketing their useless tokens and hope that people will get easily swayed because of what ChatGPT is doing.

I am worrying about the newest trend of likely dead projects want to revise themselves and their products from previous failed products to AI products. I am very doubtful that those companies will be able to make good AI products for society.

I don't think AI's like ChatGPT would come out or even if it did, it probably wouldn't boom out since Microsoft recently announced the integration of it to their new Bing, which provided a lot.
