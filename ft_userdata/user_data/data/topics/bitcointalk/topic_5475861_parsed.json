I do have one altcoin that I have tested I just discovered I will have $6,200,000 lol I will buy an entire coastal line with such amount in my local currency.",

Theres a lot of comparison with altcoins and its a good content for social twitter creators to boost their engagement especially when theres a paid for that. But regarding this tool, its really helpful for possible prediction outcome in case their tokens pumped to their comparison one.",

Its OK to gather information from different sources, like this crypto app that OP shared, so we can broaden our knowledge about making decisions regarding profitable altcoins. Only bitcoin, stands at the top followed by top altcoins, the rest altcoins needs special speculations and analysis because of their high risks. So any helpful tips to guess their swings is recommended by me.",

However, predicting Bitcoin is difficult and sometimes impossible in the short term, let alone these altcoins with low volumes.See the trading volume chart below.",

You just divide the marketcap of the coin that you want the size of, into the size it already is, whatever the result is, you multiply that with the price the coin is right now.So if a coin is 1 dollar, and you take example a 5 dollar marketcap coin as example to reach, and you have 1 dollar marketcap, that means when the marketcap becomes 5 dollars, then the price will be 5 dollars. Calculating this is quite easy, and writing the algorithms for a website like this easy as well. This means there are two possibilities, it's either not a very good website and everyone will ignore, or people missed out on such an easy concept to build that might be liked.",

Also we need to understand that it does not give us the overall expectations but a guess of what could probably occurs in time coming. The site is good to use and make our own financial decisions.",

It's handy when coins aren't even listed yet and they are under $1M marketcap.It's reasonable for many new tokens to reach $1M so i counted what would be my exit prices. That was actually making me lots of money when ever i wasn't buying a instant rug pull.When i wanted to shill my bags i used to say that this has better fundamentals then coin A, and just pointing out that if it would have 1/5 marketcap of coin A, it would be worth N",

This will boost altcoin lovers to do the experiment and get excited though, although we know that this isn't 100% reliable and accurate, but just speculations that can somehow turn into reality if the market favors them. And for those newly recruited altcoin enthusiasts, they will be more selective with the altcoins they're going to hold as this tool could be helpful at some point.However, the best tool not to fall on altcoin investments is our own knowledge and skills in the crypto market. Keep doing DYOR so we will be updated on the market events and will be aware on those altcoins that need to be avoided and need to pursue investing. This site is probably just for fun and a little bit of knowledge acquisition, so we don't need to completely rely on it for future predictions and choice of investments.",
