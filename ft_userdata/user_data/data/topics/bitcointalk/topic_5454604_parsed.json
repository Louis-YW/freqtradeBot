  "content": "For those, Who Don't know who Roger Ver is,Mr. Roger Ver is An early adopter of the first digital currency, he integrated Bitcoin payments into Memorydealers.com, allowing customers to make payments in Bitcoin. By moving to collect Bitcoin in its earliest days, when each coin was valued at under $1, Ver amassed a total collection of more than 400,000 bitcoins by some estimates. In the process of spreading the word about Bitcoin, it's likely that Ver reduced his collection through payments and funding projects.Ver's financial support helped a number of popular Bitcoin projects and startups launch. He was an early investor in the now-defunct BitInstant, the company founded by Bitcoin millionaire and ex-convict Charlie Shrem.Ver was also an early investor in a number of related blockchain projects, including Kraken, purse.io, Blockchain.com, and Ripple. In 2012, Ver launched Bitcoinstore.com, offering thousands of items for sale with customers allowed to transact in Bitcoin.[1]In 2017, Roger Ver Turned Into Bitcoin Cash.Yesterday, This guy did not talk about Bitcoin Cash But about Ethereum. He said, “Even though Ethereum doesn’t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.” [2]What's wrong with Mr. Roger ver? Did Vuterin Start Paying him to vouch for ETH? What is your thought?

Just wish the media would finally stop referring to him as \"Bitcoin Jesus.\" As other mentioned with Bitcoin Cash, he's already expended all the goodwill he may have had with the community by trying to con people into believing BCH was Bitcoin. Its not, he lost the hash war and his coin is always on the precipice of a 51% attack. Admittedly I like that it has low fees but most exchanges require several confirmations before they will credit your account with it and its simply not a \"store of value.\"",

That guy is a true investor and businessman and he has nothing to do with Bitcoin. If any crypto-currency is useful for him he will turn into it and give up on Bitcoin. His decision of moving from Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash proved the thing that the guy is not a Bitcoin enthusiast but a businessman who invests in all those projects that allow him to earn enough profits.He's only done a good thing by adopting Bitcoin in its early days but I'm sure he's already sold most of his holdings in year 2013-2014, and now when he knows that he hasn't enough of the crypto-currency in his holdings, he turned into other projects. This time going with ETH proves that his holdings are mostly in that crypto-currency and he would love it to reach all time high in this coming bull market.I don't think that Buterin has any thing with this guy, he's doing it to gain profits because he's most probably holding thousands of ETH right now and he wants to earn as much profit from the holdings as he possibly can. I'm also thinking that the guy might favor Bitcoin cash once again in future because he definitely holds many units of that digital currency as well.",

He used to be a well-known bitcoin evangelist.  It was even called Bitcoin - Jesus.  However, in 2017, Roger Ver, along with Jihan Wu, organized an aggressive attack on the Bitcoin network.  They (Roger Ver and Jihan Wu) promoted an alternative cryptocurrency - Bitcoin Cash, claiming that it is the real Bitcoin.  However, this was a blatant lie.  Also during this time, the Bitcoin network was being spammed with small transactions, which slowed it down.  In the fall of 2017, the price of Bitcoin Cash reached 0.5 BTC.  This was the end result of this scam.  After that, the price of Bitcoin Cash dropped.  I don't know why Roger Ver is now promoting the Ethereum coin.  As far as I know, they have a very good personal relationship with Vitalik Buterin.",

I and anyone who has a smarter job in life certainly don't care what he promotes at the moment, because we know that he supports anyone who pays enough. What we do know is that he is a simple traitor, and also not very intelligent when he thought that he and his little communists could destroy Bitcoin with their useless fork. With these new statements, it only shows how much he understands what he's talking about, because that shitcoin he's talking about is an ordinary inflated story that's worth even less after it moved to POS.",

Would you mind if I call him a scammer? Because he tried to make, people believe that Bitcoin Cash is Real Bitcoin. People with such a mindset cannot be trusted at all. A guy who tries to manipulate others and guide them to the wrong path for his own profit is not a true investor or a businessman. It proved that he didn't understand what is he talking about. A Coin/Token which doesn't have a limit of supply and no proof of work, How can it be a front-runner in driving worldwide adoption? ETH is a centralized coin. ETH developers can increase its supply to infinite. How are people supposed to trust ETH?",

Let's say Roger talks about a coin that has a supply limit and proof of work where they cannot create a coin out of thin air. It's not like there are no coins like Bitcoin. Take Litecoin for example; he could have vouch for that. But, No. He is not holding any Litecoin. So there is no profit touching for Litecoin. The same thing goes for Bitcoin as well. I don't think he owns more than a few Satoshi since 2016. Now he started talking shit and the media covers his shit talk.",
