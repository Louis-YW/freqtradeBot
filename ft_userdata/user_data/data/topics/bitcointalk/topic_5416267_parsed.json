But it could likely be a self-made one and able to to scam people just like fake gambling site. All of the fake sites that belongs to scammers these days have SSL or TLS certificate and are secure, but they can be used to scam and this likely might be another one of them. As for me, the site do not have any qualification that I can use to recommend it than being a scam site that people should avoid.Quote from: michellee on October 07, 2022, 06:09:33 AMIf it were a site that had just launched, I would be impressed by how I could see the number of bitcoins already won by some people at the bottom of the site.

First things first you didn't have a good introduction and as far as I can see about the site, it's not that bad but the record or let me call it the data about bet is the same from 1x to 3x and the bettors are all in order which makes me getting suspicious about the site. After some checking, didn't see any terms and conditions, rules and regulations or even the FAQ of the site. Not that I am saying that the site is a scam but it is better to be safe than sorry. As stated in previous post that even a scam site have ssl or tsl certificate that the site is secured as I have created a thread about ssl vs tsl with sources.",

If you're suggesting people to play into this site I think you have to not make such kind of claims because these are definitely impossible  plus this is a brand new site, it's not easy to trust at first glance and I think it should be better see some withdrawals or much better some official topic with official representative",

Whose fool would really be buying on that?He might believe that there are lots of fools who do really believe on easy money making or profits on gambling space.People on this forum arent that dumb. hehe",

I can only see two usernames there but their avatar are clearly not the same, was that only an example?This is what I was looking for also. Because you need at least the terms and conditions, so every player knows what to comply.Because if not, no reference is found if someone got any issue, and they don't know what to do.The casino also can confiscate the funds from the player without any reference of their violation because they don't have the list.If the OP won big here, well, we can't say if he is just promoting their site or he is indeed a player on this site. For now, it is better to take precautions as they have important features lacking.",
