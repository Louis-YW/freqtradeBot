  "content": "[banned mixer] Mixer Review Program #2Bitcointalk username: Igebotz The website overview:This is my first review of this project and my first visit; the UI/UX design is extremely nice, easy to browse, and the option to change between dark and white mode is what initially draws my attention. Because the other mixers I use do not have this option, you have a +1 edge.Mixing experience#Mix 1Browser used: Mozilla Firefox Browserversion: 118.0.1 ( old version)system: 64-bitsecurity level: BasicReceiving address(s): 1Amount mixed: 0.003BTCservice fees: 1.76%order ID: VAGL4GVP-6HL***Delay time. 59mins#mix 2Browser used: Brave Browserversion: Version 118.0.2088.57system: 64-bitsecurity level: PremiumReceiving address(s): 1Amount mixed:  0.003BTCservice fees: 5%Order ID: 9OJ66AOD-3WM***Delay time. 1hr:30minsThe process runs smoothly on both browsers, as I had no issues with the site while using these browsers with VPN, but where I had some issues, which is not something I would have done if I wasn't an experienced user, I would have moved on to the next available mixer that didn't require me to set up my own mix manually. I'm the type of user who wants whatever I'm paying for to be set up automatically without my intervention (and perhaps an edit button for those who prefer to put it up manually). If I'm paying for the premium service, I expect the system to recommend the ideal mixing time and anonymity level for what I'm paying for rather than requiring me to set it up manually. What's the point of paying for Premium if I can still choose my own level of anonymity? As previously said, a newbie with little experience will ultimately hit a roadblock here.Letter of GuarantorThe way it's been placed is similar to other mixers I've used, and the way it's been placed, one may easily forget to download it; it should be programmed in such a way that downloading it is mandatory before starting to mix. If you want to be the champion in this field, you must do things differently from your competition.Mixing feesThe premium 5% fees is unusually high; most mixers' higher max is 2.5% - 3%. My current mixer charges a maximum of 2.5%, so why should I pay 5% for your premium service when I am able to pay half that fee elsewhere? What distinguishes your premium service from the competition? This is an honest question, and I need to be convinced of the need to pay 5% for your premium service.FAQI'm not a native English speaker, but I could tell right away that there was a grammatical issue since the original sentence makes no sense. The one that has been fixed should be updated.Quote from:  tumblerAfter the creation of the order, you will see the minimum and maximum amount for the transaction, which is from 0.001 up to 10 BTC. In case you sent us less than the minimum, that would be concerned that a donation considered as a donation. In case you would like to mix a higher amount, please feel free to contact us through the support form, and we will answer you as soon as possible. Support.I got into some minor trouble and chatted with support, it took them some time to respond back after I submitted my letter of guarantor for verification, and when they finally responded, he/she stayed up with me and was very helpful and made everything very clear to me, i got my initial deposit below the minimal deposit back despite a mistake on my end, i input the wrong digit despite it being clearly stated that a deposit below the minimal will be considered as a donation. I'm not sure why you guys didn't follow through on that; I was delighted to get my coin back, but rules are rules, and if you don't have the courage to follow them, don't make them in the first place. That's my princpleConclusion/recommendationThe site is quick and simple to use, and aside from a few minor issues that I raised, the mixer market is fiercely competitive, and you don't want to leave any stone unattended. Take into account any recommendations and concerns offered.  I'll try it again in a month and then provide honest feedback on Project ANN.",
