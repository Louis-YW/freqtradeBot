Does the forum belong to any particular person or group of persons?The forum was created by Satoshi Nakamoto[1]Quote from: Steph91 on January 17, 2023, 01:31:29 PM2. Do we have Ceo, forum Manager, or Director?There is an admin who was handed over managerial rights at the time satoshi was leaving the forum, that is theymos[2].Here is a useful quote from theymos directly:Quote from: theymos on April 09, 2019, 05:05:22 AMIt's surprising how well-documented history can become totally forgotten... Satoshi created the forum on Nov 22, 2009, and was head administrator until almost 2011. Then Sirius was head administrator until 2012, which is when I took over.Cobra also owns the bitcointalk.org domain name. I consider the forum to be basically owned by or at least dedicated to the Bitcoin community, though; I don't call anyone an owner of the forum....Cobra is now fully in charge of Bitcoin.org and theymos controls this forum's domain[3].[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=35[3] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5241347.msg54243783#msg54243783- Jay -",

I don't also know who controls the activities that happen here.Please I want to clear my curiosity,What particular sort of activities you are talking about here? Like if we say about any changes to the forum then it's handled by @theymos and appointment of moderators/merit sources is also his task as he is the administrator of the forum.So he is the main person on the forum if you are looking for such information but if you see post deleted or any moderation work then it's the job of moderator who you can see under each board where they have been appointed so as to reduce the spam on forum.Then there are global moderator like @mprep who handles bans on the forum and other works but if you ask for the main person then it's @theymos.Quote from: Solosanz on January 17, 2023, 02:03:11 PMAlthough Bitcointalk is created by Satoshi, I think he doesn't have any access anymore considering he's already leave this forum since long time ago.His account was locked by @theymos back in the days so as to avoid any other person abusing the account and the username satoshi is also not allowed to be used on forum with some other keywords as well by him.",

I'm just surprised that no one has Said anything about the search engines to the OP.I'm expecting to see more turgid/ constructive inquisitions next time... Welcome Steph.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
