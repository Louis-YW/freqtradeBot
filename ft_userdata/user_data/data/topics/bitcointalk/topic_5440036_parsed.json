Chances are that he only hasn't been caught yet as it doesn't make sense at all to join bounty campaign with 1 account only since everyone else is cheating.Quote from: Solosanz on February 16, 2023, 09:28:46 AMI don't really understand why he need to use multiple telegram accounts because he's not always using a same telegram account to apply bounty campaigns. He is probably doing that so he can join more Telegram campaigns, as they usually ask from you to update your name with the project's name, like in the case of the latest bounty campaign he joined.  Quote from: Bitcoinking99 on February 11, 2023, 09:08:48 AM1.

There is no interest in any other part, so I doubt that he will even move from that board. I am sure they use all of their time on the bounties too without any to actually browse outside that place.

I myself spend almost no time in the international altcoin/bounty forum section and I'm probably way too naive when it comes to these users. Each bounty spammer probably has 10 different accounts in the same campaign.I guess the accounts that are finally caught by you guys are probably just the tip of the iceberg.Quote from: bullrun2020bro on February 16, 2023, 10:29:43 AMMaybe only if someone tags his account and uses my post as reference, and then we gonna hear the same old story how its his brother/mother/aunt account etc.Haha, yea the classic story that in the end it was the fault of a family member, a friend or the dog that ran over the keyboard.",

This kind of account does not have a contribution to the forum's discussions there are thousands of new discussions in a month I'm sure there are discussions that will suit his interest, it's ok to be a bounty hunter as long at least 1/4 of your posts in a week are on participating in discussions.Bounty managers should lay out a rule that they only hire Junior account or participate in discussion at least twice a week, there's too many cheaters in the bounty section and they disregard forum rules.",

It might make sense to get users who really don't care about anything other than just bounties and altcoin, and that should be they goal of being in the forum.
