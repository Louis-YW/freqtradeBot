  "content": "I heard about https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cropty.droid from my friend... I tried it and this is what I noticed:- it restores access to funds if you forget the password. - you can send tokens by mobile phone number, QR code, and even nickname! No more confusion with public addresses…- Cropty.com allows you to pay network fees in the currency you send. I mean when you send USDT through the Binance network, you don't need BNB, like in other wallets. Pay fees in USDT. There is no need to buy native tokens to pay fees – how do you think it’s useful?- you can borrow USDT against your crypto instead of selling it. I managed borrowing at 9% APR and use funds any time I want– I created also my own public page to receive donations by a link. - about price alerts: If you set the token's target price app can notify you when it's reached- Oh, it was nice that you can mark your favorite tokens and you will see them first in the tokens list. I work in a team to search for new bundles, it seems like a really promising wallet. I advise you to download",

This is an application for storing and transferring cryptocurrencies, the peculiarity of which is that its operator (custodian) manages the addresses of users or has access to their private keys.My guess is that this wallet is custodial because you pay a fee in the currency you send so that funds are not spent from a pool of all funds, but from separate private keys that your operator manages, since he has access to your private keys initiallyIn addition, custodian customers are required to complete the identity verification (KYC) process.",

I don't think i have ever seen this combo before (usually a wallet is either custodial and centralised or non-custodial and decentralised), but i'm not saying that this combination is a good one...

It goes without saying that any transmission of sensitive data should be done over a secure connection. If you would transmit sensitive data over a non-ssl connection, it would be bad (very bad). The problem is (and remains) the fact that sensitive information is stored by the company that released this app (which is default for a custodial wallet). It means the user has to put his/her complete trust in said company, since said company could just as well rob the user without any technical hinderance.Now, i get the feeling you're either the owner or payed by the owner to promote this wallet. I wish you the best of luck. I'm not picking a fight, but i'm merely stating that this is, in fact, a custodial wallet and that people have to be carefull when using such wallet (or, for that matter, any new wallet, especially a closed source one).I hope you're working for an honest company, and i you are, i wish you all the best... I won't be using your services, but i don't think that should be a problem for you",

That's like the main point of a wallet, you want complete control. I'd prefer to rely on myself, than some lowly skilled technical support that will be reading off of a script anyhow. They aren't going to be able to help with loss of funds, and they'll have cookie cutter solutions, which you can entirely avoid by using a different wallet. They'll basically only help with issues related to their specific software, which can be avoided in the first place, and is probably over complicated compared to alternatives, which allow complete control. As a hot wallet it might be okay, but even then there's better alternatives out there in my opinion. Plus, learning to set the right transaction fee, and manage the ins, and outs of your finances is actually recommended compare to a system that simplifies it too much.",

Any seed phrase generated? I tested the wallet but the information I saw already pissed me off more. They keep the private key for you? No. If you have issue will be when you will know that you do not have your private key, the private key is not for you but for them and they have control over your coins. It is custodial. It is centralized.You can register without identity verification, but it is still a custodial  and a wallet.When there are many reputed noncustodial wallets that I can use for holding, why need a custodial wallet. People will always be people, they have ignorance and they are not making proper research.",

They pay the network fee with the native coin and charge you using another token. That's exactly how centralized exchanges work. Quote from: Polina Noir on November 07, 2022, 02:52:51 PMthe transaction will not freezeThere is no guarantee that they won't freeze your transactions. As already mentioned above by other users, they have full control over your fund and can do everything with that. It's possible that they ask you to verify your identity at any time. I haven't tried the wallet in question, but its seems to be same as other custodial wallets. They are the real owner of the fund and instead show you a number as your balance.",
