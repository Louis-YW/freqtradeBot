Does such kind of rotation of holdings guarantee it's safe from hackers or scammers?",

      "body": "It is less about the address itself, and more about the precautions taken through how the coins are being stored. For anyone holding a significant amount in the long term, it should be a no brainer to use cold storage as opposed to wallets that are connected to a server or have access to the internet. A paper private key/seed, pk/seed on an encrypted external device or hardware wallets are probably the first options that could serve to be safe enough.The step before a safe wallet however, is a safe system. Windows vs. Linux, Linux. A new account or system that is not a daily driver, one that is known to be safe. Next. The network level. Knowing that the network is free from vulnerability is another, more complex precaution to take.Checking these three boxes will limit vulnerabilities down to the end user. No mistakes, no loss. Quite a few community members and myself have been discussing and voting for the topic to be added to a separate board to help with improving security and privacy in the Meta board. I recommend those and others interested in the topic to check out the discussion here and if interested in voting, visiting the community vote here.Rotating the wallet may improve privacy, or provide a level of protection in a world where bruteforcing actually becomes possible (not really a problem at the moment). Ultimately it is superseded by the precautions listed above.The other kind of security is physical. Ensuring that the wallet can't be breached offline, or has offline risk, is also an important thing to consider.",

Moving your coin from one wallet to another periodically will just affect your privacy because when you’re were DCAing there is high chance that it was done on different addresses and by moving them to another wallet you’re actually consolidating them, now a move done periodically will only raise alarm to hackers since everything can be seen publicly. The first point of security is having a cold wallet either by buying a hardware wallet or if you have the knowledge by setting it up your self on airgapped device this will actually reduce the scammers online getting access to your wallet keys or seeds. The seeds which should be stored totally offline is one area where I will advise the use of a multi sig wallet, this way you back the seeds properly and at different locations as such if one of the seeds gets exposed the scammer wouldn’t be able to spend from it. You can set up the a 2-of-3 multi sig wallet and back it up as suggested below, this way you don’t need to have two or more wallets (although in some cases is still not bad, especially if you’re using a hardware wallet and the fund is large, split it into two separate hardware wallets from two different prominent companies) Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 31, 2023, 10:55:51 PMIf you want to increase the security of your wallet, you can go for multisig. Although, it is very useful for multiple users purposes. For individual, we have suggested 2-of-3 multisig wallet several times on this forum with the appropriate backups like this:Seed 1, MPK 2Seed 2, MPK 3Seed 3, MPK 1Backups in different locations. If you lose one of the backups, you can still use the other two to recover your wallet.",

And there are simple reasons for it: Scammers do not try to break into your wallet but use attack techniques which aim towards one's distraction and human flaws: social engineering, phishing, personification of oficial agents, etc. So it is not suitable to talk about scammers in this context.Hackers will always to to get your private key, so it is not about moving your coins around periodically, it is rather about keeping them in a cold wallet, passphrases and divide the satothis in different cold wallets. So the hackers will have no chance to get their hands on your satoshis remotely. Moving your satoshis around in a periodic way could only erode your privacy, because any paying attention to your transactions on the blockchain will eventually see the partner and identify many of your addresses and even those you may use to deposit into exchanges.",

This will only give you a false sense of security, to keep your BTC's safe you have to use extra layers of security like multisig or adding a passphrase to your seed phrase, you should also use a hardware wallet or create your own airgapped wallet, but sending your funds from one wallet to another is not a method of security, except one wallet was compromised.",

The whales or you can say high roller investors always prefer to keep their Bitcoin into multiple wallets and all of those wallets are cold wallets which never get to see internet again until the investors devices to make them online in order to convert their Bitcoin in fiat.Even without any rotation their Bitcoin are safe from hackers and I'm pretty sure that hackers don't really focus a lot on the wallets that have low amount of Bitcoin because it will be a troublesome job for them to hack such wallets. In fact hacking of a Bitcoin wallet isn't an easy task for any level of hacker. The investors are mostly well aware about hackers and that's why they try their best to have all security measures at first before investing in Bitcoin.",

Hackers steal coins by spreading malware across the Internet, hoping that eventually it will reach a crypto holder.
