You can see the standard options for mining in this calculator. Single mining of the DYNEX coin is more profitable than dual mining. I would not buy this video card now. Low profit and the video card is already outdated. If you have cheap electricity, then you can build a mining farm for experience. But I do not want to buy now video cards weaker than RTX3060.https://hashrate.no/gpus/1660s",

The Zilliqa coin is the same coin as hundreds of many other coins. Buying this coin means taking a big risk.Mining reduces risks if you buy equipment at a price that is less than the average prices in the equipment market, but you must have cheap electricity.",

Plans for the future -> buy more newer cards  Here is the correct opinion.I am not ready to buy Intel video cards now, because there are very few of them in mining and the developers first optimize most of the miners for the 3000 and 4000 series of Nvidia, and then for the rest of the video cards. Nvidia owners have more opportunities to mine new coins.",

It allows you to diversify your mining efforts and potentially earn more from multiple sources.Maybe, as for how good the GTX 1660 Super is for multiple coin mining, because different coins have different mining requirements and some may be better suited for certain graphics cards than others. Finally, if you have got a great opportunity with the GTX 1660 Super at such a low price point. With some research and careful planning, you could definitely make a good profit from mining multiple coins on these cards.",
