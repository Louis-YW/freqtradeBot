  "content": "Hello All, I recently went all in with a group who wanted to mine bitcoin. I bought the mining containers (4) and they were supposed to provide the land, transformers and equipment to get started. When the price of bitcoin dropped, the other guys went a different direction. Now, I am thinking I have two options, either A: Find others whom would like to partner ( Need someone with used miners and land w/ Cheap electricity) or sell all our equipment at a liquidation price. Anyone that can provide any solutions, offers or any opportunities I am open to listen. I just didn't want new equipment sitting without being connected. Also, If someone is in the market for miners, reach out. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jt0f8ppz0hnojt9/AAA13ZEgFquTQYeko5oKuVCja?dl=0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOgNlJSdusE",

      "body": "I saw a Reddit post recently with more or less the same question, was it you? If yes, be very careful, this subreddit if just full of shitty scammers.Otherwise finding someone who already has the land, the ASICs, and cheap electricity, may be difficult insofar as someone who already own all these things, has probably already all he needs regarding the equipment. +the fact that 4 containers is still a big budget to fill them and make them profitable. Especially with a halving coming in less than a year...You might try posting an ad here, who knows, maybe someone would be interested: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=75.0In any case, I hope that you will find a solution, and that you won't have too many financial losses. Choosing your partners is definitely the most complicated part of a successful business, I find it crazy to engage in a mining project and be scared by a drop in the price of Bitcoin..",

      "body": "Yes. I posted in Reddit. I assumed community groups would be the best place to post and find miners whom may be in the market for to buy containers. Although the situation happened, I am hopeful that I will find a way to offload the inventory although it would be a loss. As for myself, I really don't know an awful lot about Bitcoin, I only got involved on the strength of a recommendation from someone that wanted to partner. When the coin dropped they went in a completely different direction.  If there are any additional groups, our community forums recommended or even paid advertising please share information. I appreciate your reply and your kind words.",
