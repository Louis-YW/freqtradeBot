So indeed economic conditions of the location matters in a great extent,  when it comes to mining and more also the governmental behaviour and policy is what drive the sector most,  this is because of the amount of policies and tax responsibilities that will be placed on such businesses.",

The electricity bill in some countries is more expensive, and I believe some people too who do mining on a large scale end up paying tax to the government, and if the tax is high, that means it will really not be a very profitable business in that country, plus the cost of maintenance for one's mining equipment.",

Electricity bill will drive you out of business especially  if it is not done on an industrial scale. Individual miners may not be able to afford the equipment and space needed for mining. For me, there are several reasons why mining is increasingly becoming unprofitable and the first reason is that the bitcoin network hashrate has nearly doubled in the last year and is rapidly increasing. Secondly, carrying out maintenance on the mining rig also cost money as well. For example, every year old antminers will be surpassed by new and improved antminers. I guess smart miners are already selling off their hardware having had a taste of the rising mining difficulty and an expectation next halving of mining rewards. Lastly, miners lose their mining revenue after each halving.",

As far as I can remember, most suggestions related to mining do assume that users have cheap access to electricity, but not limited to renewable energy. Renewable energy does have some benefits and miners might profit more from it in the long run, but the cost to build one or gain access to it is quite difficult.",

So an unstable economy will have a significant impact on mining profit or in order to continue it. But if you are already doing it and making a good profit, then you can fight the unstable economy/inflation. There are places where this is the main problem. The cost won't let you start or the profit you make won't be able to keep up with the cost. In situations like this, we are better off just buying and HODLing for a longer period of time. It only costs the value of how much you want to buy. Why go through all the complications when you can just buy, sit back and watch?",

In the last couple of years, electricity prices have skyrocketed 100% or even more in many EU countries:QuoteKey findings about energy prices in Europe:    From the first half of 2021 to October 2022, household electricity prices had risen 114% on average.    In the same period, the household gas prices had risen 214% on average.     Estonia had experienced the steepest increase in energy prices overall with household prices for electricity and natural gas rising 323% and 559% respectively.Source: https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/energy-prices-europeSo, the Europeans are paying the so called \"war tax\" which was introduced without asking for their approval.",

It supposed to be entire global economy because Bitcoin is decentralized and it changes the value every where and at every corner of the world in similar ratio. Not a dime up and down. I am not saying this factor is not valid, I am just saying this is about the entire global economic changes.

Although such numbers referred to the combination of hosting and proprietary mining, the cost of production was somewhat aligned with what Argo disclosed for December 2022.https://theminermag.com/home/nydig-galaxy-ramp-up-bitcoin-mining-revenue/I think that large miners with a cost price of 9-14 thousand dollars per bitcoin are doing very well in this market.",
