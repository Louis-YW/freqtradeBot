They got tested and failed.So please don't say PoS is the problem. It was the shit idea and shit fundamentals behind it that failed.This is the difference between altcoins and shitcoins",

      "body": "PoS definitely going to cut the GPU middle man in the PoW of ETH and help to increase its price. The reason behind it is very simple to understand. Miners of PoW have to pay for electricity as well as to cash out their ETH just got it to fiat to cover the ROI cost. Result of it, ETH couldn't have a high price since PoW miners of ETH always want to sell the coin. Enough fiat after ROI turns to reinvest in the new GPU rigs, net profit right away for GPU manufacturers and resellers, scalpers but the risk push to the miners. And then the process starts again. With PoS, the GPU middle man won't have a pie in this new network. Now you can mine ETH directly with your own ETH -> the money stay in ETH! Less risk for the PoS miners, less chance of them doing the cut loss while under the stress of having to cover ROI. ETH more likely becomes a long-term investment for everyone, both holders/miners in this case. This is why people speculated that with the PoS, ETH's price more easily goes up, better buying it now when PoS testnet wasn't merged with mainnet yet.",

But I'm sure that being at the top of the market makes it stronger and will have its great run as it leaves PoW. I have trust on the development team of Ethereum. Vitalik is no longer a billionaire and I guess that he's going to do everything they can to push up the value of his holdings which is mostly in Ethereum. Right now, as what we can see on its continuous drop. This is a great opportunity that we can take heed before it recovers. ETH is just one of it so settle all the technicalities and get some on your position.",

However, this has nothing to do with the fork, it's just that the entire cryptocurrency market is in a bearish market.Everything indicates that the trend is towards PoS. However, whether the change from PoW to PoS will have a positive impact on the Ethereum price depends mainly on whether the transaction fee price drops. If the amount of the fee remains unchanged, I do not think the fork will have any impact on the Ethereum price.",
