      "body": "The more the market capitalization of a coin, the lesser the market manipulation of the coin.Let us take bitcoin as an example, owned by many people in the world and also having a market capitalization of over $500 billion now. To manipulate a coin like that, I mean to manipulate a coin like bitcoin, it would be difficult.A coin that is just listed on exchanges, or that is control mostly by whales, like 40 to 70% or more controlled by whales. Such coins can be manipulated. That is why it is good to go for good coins like bitcoin that is difficult to manipulate.Quote from: cafter on April 18, 2023, 07:56:24 AMbut after all they also predict by trend lines and indicators? why trend lines matters?Indicators and other things used for technical analysis are good because traders use them and they have better accuracy. This does not mean that you should 100% believe on indicators because they can also fail, although many professional traders are using them and showing satisfying results.",

They can be pro institutional investors or they can be stupid institutional investors. Like Terra, Voyager, 3Arrows Capital and more. You can not say institutional investors are always right with their methods and decisions.Trend lines are important because we know a trend is a friend. Furthermore, when you use trend lines, you are simplifying things for your view but it is wider and more general than using too many technical indicators.Good investors will focus on fundamentals first, then trend lines.",

In a real trading environment the trend lines and indicators matter a lot, without those you will be trading blindly and that will cause more losses. The news is full of propaganda and trusting them with closed eyes isn't a good choice.Many institutions are following the indicators, but they are also doing the game of manipulation by tying up with news channels and sites, to make others believe in a coin that they own. These tactics will work with the coins whose market cap is not so high. Whales and other big investors and hedge funds are known for manipulating the market. But, if you choose better coins with a proper plan, and working strategies then you can earn from the manipulated markets. Hedging works best in such scenarios, and if applied correctly you'll earn enough profit in short term.",

No doubt that this has been one of the best approaches and ways that they can do in the market to make it move and manipulate it. It has been done years ago and truly effective to make such movement if they have to. They're making it look like they're conducting a study to the market and the behavior of everybody through negative/positive news that they release through the media.",

They will not insert their manipulation technique when market is doing good since their attacks will never work as this one will get buried by hypes covered up by good events happen at that time. So mostly they trigger this up when the market is not in good shape to trigger up something bad which is more beneficial to those manipulator. We see this trend line happen and it repeatedly happen for so many times, so instead of freaking out on situation like this its better to ride them up to gain something in return.",

Â By using a variety of tools and strategies, traders can make almost accurate results but take note, it isn't 100% have a guarantee. I think it's generally an ideal decision if you invest and wait for the market with a long-term investment strategy that takes into account a range of factors, including fundamental analysis, market news, and technical indicators, rather than relying solely on short-term trends or attempting to profit from market manipulation.

People make mistakes by using 15-min, 30-min, 1-hour charts to find trend lines. I don't say what they draw are not trend lines but those lines are for short term, short term trend lines. Hence, if they rely on those lines and let their position opens too long, those things won't match each other and their position will no longer be benefited by the trend line they draw and use.",
