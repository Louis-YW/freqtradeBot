Usually it should be rootMost of what I heard from other users who bought used units experienced the same thing there might be something on the firmware it might loaded with modified firmware or malware that possibly has a locked pool and password so regardless of how many times you change the pool and password it would only reset back to original pool and password.If you haven't tried to flash the unit try it first it might fix the issue you can also use the upgrading tool to update the unit.",

The high-performance mode will not be triggered if your miner is hot. You should cool down the miner a bit.Try to increase the fan speed of your miner at 90% to test if it can help to drop down the temp and trigger the high-performance mode.",
