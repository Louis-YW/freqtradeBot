  "content": "Hi Guys,Simple question;What are the best BTC and LTC (Ant) miners to use as home heater and make them low noise?Right know;I have 2 Antminer L3+ with Blissz Firmware mining @ 250 MH using 340-50 watt with fans super silent (6-7% something?)Temps are very good but the heat is still (very) nice. Great! A perfect space heater!Too bad the nice working Blissz fw is having a mining fee precentage it mines now and then...So my question;- Is there somthing like Blissz fw I can use and do the same settings without the fee mining?- Are the more (ant) Miners BTC-LTC who can do the same trick with other FW?  examp.  say  Antminer S9 @ 4 TH @ 320-350 TH super silent?  or Avalon?  Or something other silent settings -you- use?I don't care about super efficient high power...I need to heat my home, with electricity, simple...Mining works great As i find out sofar and not only burning power to heat, butt make some POW coins Idea = cheap Antminers L3, S9 to convert to silent Home miners with use of other FW. (and maybe change of fans to Noctua)But what are good (other) FW with full miner control?  (fans, freq, voltage, etc?) Let me know what you are using for full control L3 or S9?  what is the power use? How silent are they? @ how much TH?",

I had a few old S3/S4/S5 and the only way you could make those quiet there was this pencil mod trick and what it basically did was increase resistance of a few resistors and undervolted the hash boards so you could under clock in your settings and it ran much cooler. No idea if it still works on the current gen of Antminer.",
