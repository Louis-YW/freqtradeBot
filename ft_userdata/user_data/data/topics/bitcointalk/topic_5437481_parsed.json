      "body": "Hey everyone! So this announcement is regarding clarification of tokenomics that some people misunderstood and started making FUD.FloraChain ecosystem has 2 different tokens that are - \"Flora coin\" and \"Flora Yield Token\".✅ Flora coin (FLORA) is the native currency of Flora Blockchain that can be mined using Proof of Work. Flora coin has max supply of 50m and Flora coin doesn't have any presale, seedsale or any kind of tokensale, it is fairly mined by PoW miners - 5 coins per block. 10% of the supply is mined in the genesis block that will be used as staking & farming rewards, browser rewards, developer grants etc.✅ Flora Yield Token (FYT) is a different token of Flora Ecosystem that serves a different purpose in the ecosystem. FYT is not a coin but an ERC20 standard token so it cannot be mined by PoW. FYT is used in Flora Yield Protocol that lets people stake FYT and earn USDT rewards. FYT will have a presale on Gempad and it will help growing Flora coin and Flora Ecosystem.If you have any questions then write in our official groups and we will answer.",

      "body": "We are pleased to announce that we have successfully listed our Flora Yield Token (FYT) presale on Gempad. FYT contract has been audited by Gempad. Below is the details of the token contract and tokensale information. 🔥 Gempad Presale Link: https://gempad.app/presale/0x440983b917262917066EEBD4c66C1Ea0Ef478AF2?chainId=56 🔥 Token Contract Address: https://bscscan.com/address/0x77F2BE773CA0887ba2b3Ef8344C8CF13C98d8ca7🔹 Presale Type: Fair Launch🔹 Allocation: 20,000 FYT🔹 Softcap: 10 BNB🔹 Liquidity: 80% (locked for 6 months)🔹 Presale Start Time: 10-Feb-2023 8:00 PM (UTC)🔹 Presale End Time: 12-Feb-2023 8:00 PM (UTC)🔹 Pancakeswap Listing: 12-Feb-2023 9:00 PM (UTC)Excessive tokens have been locked in Gempad with vesting schedule.✅ At the beginning only FYT buyers will be eligible to participate in staking pool to earn USDT. Remaining funds after providing liquidity (around 20%) raised in presale will be deposited into the staking pool as reward for stakers to kickstart the pool.NOTE: FYT has different utility than our mainnet coin which is Flora coin. There is no sale for Flora coin and as this is a true PoW chain, only miners will be able to mine and bring Flora coins into the market. Partnership Update: We will be soon partnering with Gempad and Gempad will integrate and support our chain on their platform which will allow upcoming project joining our chain to conduct sales on Gempad. Stay tuned for more updates. Thank you and have a great day!",

We will be starting our mainnet from tomorrow and we request all the pools owner willing to host our chain and miners to prepare for mining. Below is the details of our FloraChain. 💠 Countdown For Mainnet: https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20230205T18&p0=776&msg=FloraChain+Mainnet+Launch&font=slab&csz=1 You can download official node client softwares and source codes of Flora mainnet and be prepared for mining. Genesis file will be shared at launch time.✅ Github: https://github.com/FloraChainOfficial/go-flora✅ Source Codes: https://d.florachain.org/go-flora/source_code.zip✅ Windows Client: https[Suspicious link removed]✅ Linux Client: https://d.florachain.org/go-flora/flora🔹 Metamask Configuration 🔹🔸 Network name: Flora Mainnet🔸 RPC URL: https://rpc.florascan.io/🔸 Chain ID: 10500🔸 Currency symbol: FLR🔸 Block explorer URL: https://florascan.io/⚠️ FYI: Flora is a true PoW chain. Only miners will be able to mine Flora coins (FLR) and bring it into the marketplace. There is no presale or tokensale for Flora mainnet coins. The Token sale conducted by the team is for Flora Yield Token (FYT) which was earlier concept of SparkFi. Both tokens got different utility in this project. For more information please read our whitepaper.🔥 Upcoming update for miners 🔥☑️ Beta version of our wallet will be released in this month. The wallet will be available for Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android. ☑️ Bridge will be released after FYT sale gets over and listing in Pancakeswap. This will give enough time to mine Flora coins (approximately 10 to 15 days period) and generate enough liquidity to send it to BSC network and vice versa transaction.☑️ Market price per Flora coin will be decided by the team after looking at the mining difficulty and network cost. Based on which 25%-50% increment will be done on the base price before listing Flora coin in Pancakeswap. ☑️ Team will provide liquidity with small fraction of Flora Coin from premine to set the base price in Pancakeswap. After that it will be upto the miners to list their coins and trade it. ☑️ Until Flora coin get listed in Tier 2 exchange we will list our coin in all the DEX. Also team will open a farming pair for Flora coin, for example FLR-FYT  LP on Pancakeswap for which user will be eligible to earn USDT as rewards. This step has been taken to bring value to Flora Coin and FYT and also for boosting liquidity of both tokens. This will open a Bilateral Trade between FYT investors and Flora Coin miners. More updates will be announced soon. If you have any queries please ask team rather than creating FUD without reading announcements and making own assumptions. Also Request you to support this project.",
