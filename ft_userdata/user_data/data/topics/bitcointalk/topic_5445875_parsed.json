  "content": "The news coming from Indian exchanger, WazirX who has more than 3,91,000 operative crypto accounts throughout India. WazirX has monitored thousands of accounts recently and flagged accounts that are thought to be associated with the criminal activities. In the shocking news, the funds which are getting sent and bought are mostly related to criminal activities from foreign or domestic routes. WazirX has shown prompt response on blocking these accounts when they received notices from Law Enforcement Agencies either foreign and Indian LEA. There were more than 400 LEA reports, and the fraud money involved is amounting to around $390 million. That's a big amount in circulation that has now been tagged as fraudulent money. It makes us think, crypto is now one of the favorite currencies/assets for criminals and they would utilize any channel they want to suffice their purpose. Follow the detailed report on the same through the following news. QuoteCrypto exchange WazirX said that it has blacklisted more than 2,431 accounts before verifying transactions that were deemed unlawful from October last year to March 2023.According to a report released by WaxirX on Tuesday, as many as 431 requests were received from law enforcement agencies (LEA), against a total transaction volume of $390 million on the platform during this period. Forty-six requests were from foreign LEAs and 385 requests from Indian LEAs, it said.WazirX said it has engaged in more than 3,96,126 user interactions during this period. \"This report covers an overview of initiatives that the company took during the months of October 2022 to March 2023 to safeguard users in the virtual digital asset (VDA) ecosystem,\" it said, adding, \"It also includes details on requests for user data, content, and account restrictions by Indian and Foreign law enforcement agencies.\"All of these requests pertained to matters related to account-blocking, suspected criminal proceedings, investigation, and information was sought from WazirX as to whether such accused had dealt in crypto through our platform.The crypto exchange said it promptly provided all information as sought, and added, \"our compliance rate in record timeliness and accuracy was 100 per cent\". Apart from that, blocking of over 2,431 accounts was also initiated based on our internal transaction monitoring process and/or directives from the LEAs.All requests received from Indian, as well as foreign enforcement agencies, were related to investigations from suspected criminal proceedings.\"Suspension/Blocking of a user's account is subject to our terms and conditions i.e., when there is a violation of policies, deficient or suspicious KYC, or if we notice our platform is being used for illegal activities, we suspend/block the account of the user,\" the report said.WaxirX on monitoring abnormal transactionsWaxirX said it also has systems to monitor abnormal transactions done by users, flag their related accounts and identify other suspicious behaviour so that these transactions can be reported to LEA if deemed fit. \"Our compliance rate has been 100% for providing information/records to LEAs and also for abiding by their directives,\" it said.The recommended statutory Turnaround Time (TAT) for responding to LEA requests is up to 72 hours from the time a request is received. However, with the help of efficient communication channels, WazirX clocked an average TAT as miniscule as 25 minutes for sending the first cut reply.Some of the Indian and foreign law enforcement agencies that WazirX has worked with during this period are the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Directorate of Enforcement, State Cyber Crime Cells, Odisha Vigilance Department, Special Task Force, Bhopal Police, WB Police, Maharashtra Police, Crime Branch, Toronto Police Department, Police Department Dortmund, New York County District Attorney, Burlington Police, and California Police Department, Florida Police, among others.Crypto Exchange WazirX blacklists accounts",

They are investigating crime for quotas or what as it's a bit too much of a coincidence and way to convinient!Quote\"our compliance rate in record timeliness and accuracy was 100 per cent\".Yeah right, I can smell it from here that 100% and it ain't accuracy! And this is one of the news that besides the charade about protecting customers via KYC or enforcing laws and catching a criminal is showing how much they are invested in the surveillance of exchanges and how demanding they are of crypto uses while when it comes to the ones ruining whole exchanges and losing customers money are still not even on the run but spending their time comfortable in their homes and laughing of law enforcement.You have grown more hair than in your pic or you've changed addresses, you're going to spend days trying to make them understand it's still you and they drive you to the point of requesting blood samples to release $1000. When they run with your money, suddenly nobody has a clue who these law-abiding people were or how they operated for so long.",

It they made mistakes, you can have a second chance from appeal but if they intentionally do it, no chance.Exchanges are not transparent with their criteria to block your account. They simply tell you that they have internal criteria for that.",

Sorry for anyone who lost money on FTX and with FTT token but before their collapses, very little people considered FTX is a bad exchange.Customer support is only helpful for you if they don't want to scam you. If they plan to scam users, they will build up their 'honeypots' including good customer support and later will make rug pull to scam exit.Sometimes, they will not give you details why they block your account but just with general information like you broke their ToS and according to Compliance agreement to use their service, they have rights to terminate your account.How many users will bring them to court? Not many.",
