I do own crypto but I would like to know the problems that Irish and Dutch people face when it comes to crypto.Any comment would be welcome!Many thanks in advance!As far as I know, the Netherlands has a population of only 17 million people. Now, regarding this country's handling of cryptocurrency, it has had restrictive cryptocurrency regulations.This in my opinion has a big impact on crypto businessesthere is in the Netherlands, and even among crypto enthusiasts of course. In addition to this, their government did this for AML which is often implemented.",

If these two countries allow bitcoin/crypto as a tradable commodity asset for me that's more than enough.Unless you intend to develop a cryptocurrency business and obviously you have to pay attention to the regulations of the country you want to go to and you also have to pay attention to how that country enforces rules and taxes in this industry.Quote from: MoonCornelia on April 04, 2023, 11:32:04 AMI am considering moving to one of these two countries because of a job offer! I do own crypto but I would like to know the problems that Irish and Dutch people face when it comes to crypto.I tried to browse the internet and try to find out how the two countries treat crypto and it turns out that the Netherlands is one of the countries that are friendly to crypto, thus allowing you to continue to be in trading for the foreseeable future.To be clearer, you can read the several sources that I have listed, but for Ireland there may be a number of things that you should learn, as the sources that I have attached below?1. https://getgoldenvisa.com/crypto-friendly-countries2. https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/ireland/",

XGO is employing a number of shills to reply in different threads lying to people how great the service is yet it barely has any online presence.Read through this thread, and you will know why you can't such a service that used shills.",

I do own crypto but I would like to know the problems that Irish and Dutch people face when it comes to crypto.Both countries ireland and the netherlands have different laws regarding crypto that's for sure, maybe @ancafe has told you a little about the laws that apply in ireland.While crypto developments in the Netherlands, you can discuss here, because Bitcointalk has a Dutch locale where you can get a lot of information about crypto.Dutch Locale: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=79.0There you can find anything you want about crypto, such as: markets, mining and other development news related to crypto, especially the Dutch region.My advice is if you want to move to a country between the two, choose one, choose the Netherlands, so you don't miss any information about crypto and you can discuss it here.",

It's important to understand the tax regulations and reporting requirements to stay on the right side of the law. Consulting with a tax advisor specializing in crypto might be helpful.
