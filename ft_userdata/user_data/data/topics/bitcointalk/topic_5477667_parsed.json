Im tying to get the captcha to show up but I get an error. I would have been locked out of the account but luckily I had saved my captcha code, but if it wasn't for that I wouldn't have logged in at this rate.If anyone knows if Tor is having any problems and how to improve this it would be great.

You can actually bypass the captcha verification by using this https://bitcointalk.org/captcha_code.php, get your link and use the forum without TORQuote from: Cantsay on December 13, 2023, 05:06:22 AMSince yours worked fine the Op should consider checking his internet service provider to see if that where the issue is coming from.

At least with what I experienced so far and my knowledge of how the forum appreciates people's privacy.That said, you never told us the kind of gadget you are using. My experience shows that the mobile browsing of Tor with the forum is better in all ramifications compared to the PC experience. If this is the case, I don't think it is the forum still, though you might try it on another gadget.However, my last suggestion goes to your internet itself. At times, it might be problematic, it might be slow or Tor and the particular IP you use are warring. This last might be strange to many but it happens and you might consider refreshing it if you are using a dynamic type.",

The only thing that comes to my mind is that maybe your country (ISP) blocks publicly known bridges, and the only way to get around that is to request a private bridge by going to \"Settings - Request a bridge from torproject.org\". As for VPN, regardless of whether it is free or paid, you should keep in mind that the level of privacy between VPN and Tor cannot be compared, the latter is a completely different level of privacy (in a positive sense of course).Quote from: FatFork on December 13, 2023, 02:36:25 PM~snip~Am I missing something?

Anyway, I don't think my ISP is blocking anything as I have used TOR before to access Bitcointalk. I could be wrong thought. Have to test it myself.
