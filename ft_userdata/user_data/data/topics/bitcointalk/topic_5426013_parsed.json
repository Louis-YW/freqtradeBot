  "content": "Hey guys and gals, So recently since I made a post about ledger and my dad buying one from Best Buy (thankfully he returned it) I just noticed that Bitcoin Mag published a brand new article about how Ledger announced their new Stax wallet: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/ledger-announces-ledger-stax-walletAt a glance it looks pretty cool, touch screen, the back looks to have an intricate pattern. This portion is from the article: \"The wallet utilizes E ink technology on a small, rectangular wrap-around screen, similar in appearance to a smartphone.\"I know a lot of you have mentioned that Trezor, CoinKite, and ColdCard are all suitable wallets. It seems like Ledger is not highly favored among Btalk users, I've noticed that more of you lean with Trezor or one of the others mentioned above. Anyhow, the new device is on preorder, I just thought I would share this with the users. I hope you all go out and seize the day!Cheers, TREAD",
