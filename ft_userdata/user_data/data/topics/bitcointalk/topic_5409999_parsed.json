Quote from: gweb1996 on August 15, 2022, 11:21:54 PMSo i am trying to find a biz to start do to fact  web dev / graphic design is dead here , so no matter what industry i try there is a major crisis , high energy price, high rent, no clients and so on ? As supply and demand rings true normally it'll have to change back at some point. People have higher increases in price on essentials so money will be taken from things considered less essential (although a lot of public transport in the UK seems to have undergone legal attempts to make them cheaper - or direct intervention if a government entity holds the contract).Quote from: gweb1996 on August 15, 2022, 11:21:54 PMDrought killed agriculture here also ... i have some land , zero income from there this year ... it's like it's all f..ked !I don't know if this is too much of a problem since the UK (and presumably the nordics) have had bumper harvests this year and the EU still subsidises the bloc when they can't produce crops due to weather conditions so I imagine imports can be sought fairly easily.",

Maybe people are a little more cautious in starting new businesses, or invest less in existing ones, but the private sector is far from dead. I live in a tourist country within the EU and the income from tourism will probably break the record this season, and in the context of this, all those who deal with tourism have invested in the design/redesign of their website and promotion. If you're into graphic/web design, then it's wrong to focus only on the EU, offer your services globally and be competitive with prices, in other words, adapt to the market.Quote from: gweb1996 on August 15, 2022, 11:21:54 PMDrought killed agriculture here also ... i have some land , zero income from there this year ... it's like it's all f..ked !I can say that this year is extremely bad for those who are engaged in agriculture, and what was not destroyed by the drought, before that was destroyed by the hail - so even though I only have a garden with vegetables and some fruit, the harvest is at least 30%-50% smaller than usual depending on different plants. However, I do not despair because I am an optimist who always hopes that things will get better, even though climatologists do not have very bright forecasts for Europe.",

If you have countries like France with a public sector that accounts for 60% of GDP and in others like Spain or Italy that exceeds 50%, the most profitable in the European Union if you plan to start a business is that your customers are public administrations, and for that you need contacts and suckers.",

I did work for some private companies but it was indeed really hard to actually find some clients for the same therefore I can affirm tbe fact that private companies might face a bit of a problem in the EU.",

So think rationally, if you are in need of a web developer, would you hire someone at 30 EUR hourly rate or 5 EUR hourly rate at the same experience with same output? In difficult times, businesses look forward for opportunities to optimize their cost and increase profitability. That's why for information technology domain, jobs are going to Asian countries, especially to India. So business is here, but a cost optimization is ongoing.",

It sounds like a nightmare.I would guess a transition towards sources of raw materials that are locally sourced will begin naturally. Prices are reaching tipping points where the door will be open towards producing more needed materials locally. The only question is how long it will take for these shifts to manifest.There could be opportunity. In terms of starting businesses that produce locally sourced commodities that are in high demand. The days of shipping strawberries from chile and assorted items halfway around the world could be over. With high fossil fuel costs, there could be no other option aside from locally sourced alternatives.",

But imagine it this way, we are talking about whole of EU and how they got hurt from financial trouble. Which means that we are going to end up with something that is not going to be easy for smaller companies like you are trying to start.This means that you are going to have trouble because even major companies are trying to reach smaller markets which makes you not have any good customers. So it is not dead, but it is not in a place where smaller companies that just started, even not a company, just a freelancer basically, could get a lot of business, we are not there.",

Peace and stability is also a big problem today which affects a lot of sectors in the economy. As you mentioned, there's also the effects of climate change. In other words, things are rather unfriendly these days to start a new business. But I don't think EU's private sector is dead. It might even be growing, albeit in a much slower pace due to the factors mentioned. But the brunt is felt by the ordinary people. The private sector could still be reporting significant profit every quarter, but the consumers and jobseekers are the ones that are severely affected.",
