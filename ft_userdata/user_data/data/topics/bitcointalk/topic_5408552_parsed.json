As the \"owner\" of the smart contract, you have all privileges to trigger functions built into the contracts. You can also set up other roles in the smart contracts using FeverTokens' UI or SDK. FeverTokens has no roles in them.With third-party platforms, they have superior access control rights to the smart contracts and can trigger functions without your consent.",
