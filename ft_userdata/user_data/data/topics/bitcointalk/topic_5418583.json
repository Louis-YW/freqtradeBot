It was a very wonderful experience and I observed that my carving skills improved as I progressed.My parents when I was younger used to serve us pumpkin dishes which is called \"anyi\" in my local dialect. But my children have never eaten pumpkin meals in their entire life. This competition allowed me to prepare a local pumpkin dish for them.I boiled the pumpkin with salt and served it with pepper, palm oil, onions, and vegetables. I thought they would not enjoy it because these Gen Z generations are used to sweet and foreign dishes. I thought if they taste it, the dish would be returned to me. But I was wrong. They rushed the pumpkin meal and even had some disagreements in the course of eating.",

They are very concerned since they always see me in front of my computer and seldom go outside.  I only go out when I have something important to buy or to do then the moment I got home, I am always in front of the computer.At first, my mom keep on nagging me that I had gone lazy and just wasted my education has no plans in my life because she thought that I am wasting my life sitting and playing games (little does she knows that I was learning the curve of cryptocurrency at that time).  I tried to explain it to her but she doesn't understand.   Of course, people won't listen if they don't see any results.  Even though my parents are not comfortable with what I am doing, they just let me be but often remind me about my future.  I always listen to what they are saying and when they are done nagging, I humbly explain my plan.  As usual, they have no faith in what I am doing but still, I keep persevering.Almost half a year had passed, and at last my effort come to fruition.   I had my first earnings in Bitcoin.  I happily give it to my mom and explained what happened.  This time she eagerly listened to my explanation.  The first earning is followed by another, and another.  The conversation about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is now a normal thing in my family.  It is hard to make them understand in the beginning but the moment I show them the result, all their doubt about what I am doing disappeared.",

No matter what ways (how to attract), the main thing is to convey people knowledge about bitcoin. Including dishes \"with\" bitcoin in thos soup in the circle of family and friends.By the way, very funny and cute BTC-s in your soup and now you can brag to everyone that you have a lot of bitcoin.",

Because there are only 2-3 days left (31 October 2022). This is a pumpkin carving contest. but I saw another member who carved in besides the pumpkin. there are carvings on papaya, potatoes and other fruits. the point is that they all want to participate in this contest even though they can't find pumpkins in their area. You can start looking for pumpkins in your area. but if can't find it. then I thought it was okay to carve on fruit other than pumpkin. but i don't know if the job will be counted into the contest or not. good luck.Quote from: salad daging on October 28, 2022, 05:14:53 PMThis warmth engendered positivity and some brothers accepted Bitcoin with understanding.Yeah, It's so nice to be able to find warmth in the family. and chatting about bitcoin in a fun and happy situation is a great thing.good luck sir, with your pumpkin carving in the bitcoin pumpkin carving contest.",
