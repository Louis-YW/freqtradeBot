It doesn't matter of the amount invested but be sure that when it comes to profitable percentages, it's calculated based on your capital that's why Dcaing strategy is being applied on investment. Not really involved on any technical factors nor tools or expected to have a minimum huge amount as the trading.Understanding how volatile crypto markets maybe, you will understand holders are more of good advantage on making good profits than traders if considered their periods of selling.",

And Secondly for fact that am new to this forum doesn't mean that am new to bitcoin, I don't know why some members on this forum we not make a harmless reply to someone post, and if you think bitcoin investment is as simple as you said why are people selling in panic? Bitcoin investment is not as easy as you think it is so stop misleading people to invest in bitcoin without knowledge of what Bitcoin investment is all about.",

And again Bitcoin investments are vulnerable to hacking, phishing and security risks, only with proper knowledge you can find adequate precautions to these problems. That is why we should encourage newbies to conduct thorough research before investing because the price of Bitcoin fluctuates quickly and they will make uniformed decisions with their long-term investments.",

They don't learn about Bitcoin before they decide so they don't know what they suppose to do when Bitcoin price moves to the lower price. Most of them panic when they see the price is down and sell again their Bitcoin they already bought without think that is temporary.Investing in Bitcoin need time to see the profit so when they can spend some time to learn the details, they will not panic and know what they need to do. They will see the next opportunity come to them and give them time to buy at a low price so they can have more Bitcoin.We hope that people want to learn more about Bitcoin so they can handle their emotion when the price is down. They don't have to sell their Bitcoin because they see the value is down but they can use their money to buy back more Bitcoin.",

The problem would start if they proceed and encounter those unimaginable situation. We know the market is volatile that's why aside from learning those basic things people should consider to know risk management and consider to be resourceful to gather more helpful information for their investment. Because if they didn't take any further action to became more knowledgeable on Bitcoin and just rely on basic things like simple buying and selling for sure they get bother if there's lots of fuds spread and market start to decline. There's huge chance that they get panic and sell their holding since they don't have any knowledge about what other things needed to do. So before and after jumping out in this investment people should make sure that they would get enough knowledge to help them to became a better investor.",

For bitcoin I will exclude it, because understanding everything about bitcoin investors need to balance it with direct investment actions. Unlike other cryptocurrencies where every decision needs to be careful, but in Bitcoin as long as you understand long term investment, that's enough. Bitcoin will not disappoint you as long as the main requirements for longterm investment are met.

Investing in Bitcoin is not rocket science. It is not as difficult as you have portrayed it. The first thing is to learn the basics of Bitcoin, like the cycle, how to buy, types of wallets and how to use and protect them. You need to have a long-term plan and follow it diligently, not minding the pressures caused by FUD. It is also important to have an emergency fund and a buying strategy.",
