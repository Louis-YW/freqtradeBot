  "content": "There are many people in the forum, who want to make some profit with Bitcoins. But there are a lot of scams too, so people invest Bitcoins and loose them.In fact - no hope, which is very sad thing, therefore I present easy & fun project to get 1 Bitcoin from nothing. I think something can be also positive, even if there are a lot of scam profit projects.So here is the possibility:Invest 0.00003BTC/$1 in Bitcoin and get back 0.00006BTC/$2 + your transfer fee, then invest 0.00006BTC/$2, and get back 0.00012BTC/$4 + your transfer fee and so on up to 1BTC/$34800 - so at the end you will receive 1 Bitcoin. Transfer fee - your real transfer fee, but not more than 0.0001149BTC/4$ for a single transfer ( 0.0001149BTC/4$ fee could be enough ). But if the real transfer fee will be higher, then you will get it back.All transfer transactions will be in this thread too, so you can check everything by yourself.This project will be slow, you can not get back BTC fast.How much you can loose ? - just 0.00003BTC/$1 + transfer fee.All negative replies will be deleted - I do not need your views on possible scam, because member can loose only 0.00003BTC/$1 + transfer fee, which is nothing in fact. And this project is more for fun, than something serious.So, if you will be interested, I will make this project just for fun - so now all depends from you.Even one member for the project will be ok. At current stage - max 3 members, who can participate.All members, who decide to participate, need approval before investing. Do not invest, without approval. If you are participating and investing, you agree, that you can also loose and not receiving back your invested BTC, transfer fee and profit.Because of legendary member Stalker22, which gave me negative trust, project is stopped. So forum members had the possibility to earn 1 Bitcoin, which is $34800, and now they will get nothing.",

That totally fits the \"Investor-based games\" board, but will get you negative feedback on Bitcointalk. What you call \"receiving 1 Bitcoin\" in reality means someone else pays for it. That's a scam.QuoteAll negative replies will be deletedIf you delete my warning post, you'll get it back as negative feedback and Flag on your profile. Consider this a warning and last chance to understand what you're doing.QuoteI do not need your views on possible scamMy post isn't for you, it's for your potential victims.Quotebecause member can loose only 0.00003BTC/$1 + transfer fee, which is nothing in fact.I've seen so many scammers who call the amount of money they want \"nothing\". And yet, they want it.QuoteAnd this project is more for fun, than something serious.Trying to scam 1 Bitcoin for fun. Right.QuoteBecause of legendary member Stalker22, which gave me negative trust, project is stopped.You deserve negative feedback for this. Your retaliation feedback is considered Trust abuse:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3559595The user giving trust ratings without any experience and knowledge. Stay away!Step one should be to remove the retaliation feedback.Quote from: Joeyp on November 03, 2023, 04:33:13 PMSo forum members had the possibility to earn 1 Bitcoin, which is $34800, and now they will get nothingI'll cry myself to sleep tonight, knowing that I missed out on $34800.",
