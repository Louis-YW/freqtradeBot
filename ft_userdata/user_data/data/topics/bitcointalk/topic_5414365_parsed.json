So keep the Pi you have and think of it as a memento you have with those damn coins. The Pi you offer will not attract people who buy it because the coin is worthless and will be a display in your wallet.",

If interested send me a PMDo you think there are people here will trade your worthless pi to litecoin? If you are been hype on what you see in social media where they post about getting wealthy if you participate on task or trading with pi then you cannot do it on coins with actual value. And those people who just hype you about pi is just taking advantage on newbie people so I strongly believe that no one will trade that coin to any top coins here.",

If interested send me a PMPI believers have a wonderful expectations about the future of this coin. So much promising that I can't even understand how it can possibly to happened. Without a real market price, I doubt someone will be interested in your offer.I heard that there's an own marketplace designated for PI users. I'm not just sure if it's real. Why not look for it instead and do some transactions there? Although I'm very sure that almost everyone there wants to dispose of their PI.",

But for us that don't see anything significant with this project, we would likely just feel that it's a worthless token and sorry about that OP and those folks that are still believing that someday this token will have any value.OP, look to those believers that are on groups in social media, maybe you'll find the right person that will accept this deal.",
