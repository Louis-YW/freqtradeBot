Again, I totally have no doubts about your deal or deals with Hopenotlate.Just my suggestion, I myself have got loans here a couple of times, but I try to make the whole process as transparent as possible to avoid any questions.Hello there, I communicated him my repayment address in PM as I would like to keep it as much private as possible, even if a few minutes search with infos made available by the borrower can reveal what my addy is; but generally speaking the less informations I share online about myself the most comfortable I feel. Also in several loan deals in this section I saw many \"internal transfers\" therefore no transaction details but no one questions their legitimacy. I understand the need for transparency to avoid possible scammers building their trust in lending section and I also tried to have a constructive discussion with a specific user, who doubts the most, on how to reconcile the need for transparency of the forum with that of my privacy when giving out a loan U( considering am not a professional lender but I just give out small loans here and there  when I feel comfortable with) but no solutions came out of it.  If you have some suggestions they are welcome.Quote from: hopenotlate on July 29, 2023, 10:51:20 PMAs discussed in private am issuing HedgeFx a new loan for 500 USDT, sending in a few minutes to their TRON address TFqN1GmbXtQNZu1BsuhrExzpKLszXBfQ4U.550 to be repaid within August 10 , repayment addy will be communicated by pm.Also 115 USDT are still to be repaid for the original loan of this thread, within August 5 as agreed in previous post.Back to the main topic of this thread I confirm: - I received 115 USDT on August 8th ( a little delay was privately agreed)  - I received 550 USDT todayEverything that was due has been repaid in full.",
