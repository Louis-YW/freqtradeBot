Regulating a constantly growing crypto market and vetoing them to determine which deserves funding and assistance is a difficult task.regulating can be easyby having \"regulations at the gates\"EG innovate code that does many functions without jurisdiction within the multitude of networks / tokens created inside the city but where to get a stablecoin to trade with it..Â  you had to use an KYC regulated exchange. and then once having the stable coin you can then trade that for whatever you like in other unregulated systems within the cities ecosystems of multiple tokens..where by just having the stable coin (without revealing name outside the exchange) shows you have been verified just to even hold/get the stable coin. thus no more need for validation elsewhere",

News of FTX once being responsible for managing $32 billion in assets has to be opening the eyes of the world as to the big cap potential cryptocurrencies can deliver. Naturally everyone would want to hop on the bandwagon and become involved in what could be the next big thing. And so we see some EU nations offering digital nomad visa programs to crypto whales in an effort to attract the opposite of capital flight. The UAE as well appears to be on board with their own version of the program.If it is true that a comfortable temperature of 80 degrees farenheit is maintained mere meters below the surface of the earth. Would the UAE consider pursuing subterranean real estate development to save on air conditioning costs? It might also serve a secondary function as a viable bomb shelter in case of emergency. Even a standard basement could potentially offer 10 degrees F cooler climate than ground level floors.",

Fraudulent corporations are arguably more dangerous to the industry than \"street scammers\", because corporations entrust their clients' funds with them, and we have just seen the collateral damage that can happen when those corps go down.",
