You should've been careful about this OP, now your 20 USD short because you believe too much what the scammer said, although I can't blame you, that scammer seems to know how to smooth talk and make a legitimate service out of a scam.Edit: Checked the name of the token, you're one horndog OP, now I know why you got scammed.",

They offer exciting offers in order to attract buyers until they accept their offers and agree to buy from them instead of the official Chaturbate website. If this dishonest member placed the same Chaturbate offer, quantity of tokens, and the same price of these tokens as specified by the site, there would be no one who would buy from him and risk his money.The mistake that falls on the OP is that he trusted this newbie member and paid him first without using an escrow service to guarantee his rights. As SFR10 mentioned, this scammer has alt accounts with newbie ranks, and he will likely come back with other accounts and publish other offers after his Chaturbate tokens scam offer is exposed and after his accounts are tagged.",

It may be difficult for you to see it now, but recognizing where you went wrong can help someone else. Unfortunately, there is a very low chance we can do here to refund you.

After seeing and knowing he has an account here you could have told him you wanted an escrow to know if truly he is for real and I believe you could not have been scammed by him. It is unfortunate this happened. These are the reasons why we are warned to be wary of accounts with not much activities here and to avoid outside platform discussion if it happens that both parties meet here and start a conversation here because going outside of the platform to further discuss business would put such parties at risk because scammers always want to be out of trace. Your funds are gone and the only thing that can be done is to make known the scammer's account so that nobody will be a victim of the scammer in the near future.",
