  "content": "Happy easter, my fellow Bitcoin members, I actually taught about something today, what if Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies existed In the old days? how would it have affected their economy. would it have hasten technological developments and maybe by now we could have been in the most advance planet in the universe? some major coins that were listed in the bible which had great values includes the *TALENT: used to measure precious metals most especially gold and silver was known as the most accepted coin or currency in the old testament. I do think that this was the Bitcoin of the olden days. it actually still existed during and after the time of Jesus death.of which Jesus did mentioned in some of his parables. *SHEKEL, was used as a measure of gold and silver in various cultures in the region, including the Israelites, Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks  which were known for their  wealth and prosperity.*DENARIUS, was a silver coin, used in Rome during the time of Jesus. it was a standard pay for a days job in Rome which was the richest and most powerful country at that time.*DRACHMA:  used in ancient Greek as silver. at that time, it was used in countries including isreal.*MINA it was used in the mesopotamia to measure silver and gold. in was also accepted in many countries including Babylon, Persian and Greece.[/url](This image was gotten from Google free research) most of these coins existed during the period of Jesus birth and death and had values in their respective times. do you think if  Bitcoin  was developed in the old days it could have brought about technological developments and maybe we would now be having more advanced crypto technologies as at now.",

      "body": "Happy Easter Mate , Bitcoin can't exist in the old days, because the old generation don't have the kind of technology we have now. In the old days, there was nothing like the computer system, nor were there internet connections. Programming is only possible with the use of a computer, and Bitcoin is programmed. The old days lacked things that could have made it possible for Bitcoin to exist then.",

The same way you have thought about it, you need explain how you presumed it would be used and transacted without the availability of the internet. If you are thinking of Bitcoin as a fiat currency then I would not have to argue about that but if you think Bitcoin had existed as a digital currency in the past the same way we are using it now then I think you may be wrong. The Internet was never available in the aging days so there was no way transactions would be processed without the help of the internet.

Back in the days for a simple computer to run which contains a small storage, there's already pile of wires therefore for people to have access to this they would need to afford that pile of wires to have access to computer. Not only that internet before is not even a thing back then, so how will you observe the volatile situation of Bitcoin without the internet? It would be hard for them to have transactions especially its a decentralized system. I think the time Bitcoin exist is just the right time since we already have those mentioned earlier in that era. Maybe in the next decades Bitcoin would evolve more and might pump to the moon.",

Let us assume that if something like Bitcoin had existed in those times, how could the common man use it? It would have required knowledge of some sort of supernatural power to access something that was invisible to the naked eye, intangible, and could not be carried like physical items such as gold coins.

Today it does not have much effect on the economy at all.There is no benchmark to measure the most advanced planet or species in the universe, but if there was I doubt we would be high on the rating. As Neil deGrasse Tyson talks on: since we know so little about the universe and are not aware of any other specie we are surely not the most advanced in the universe.- Jay -",

Why I shared this thought with you is for the fact that time and development have happen, and industrialization and globalization have brought with it demands alternative currencies Bitcoin is designed for the now and future and Bitcoin is open source so anyone can contribute to its networks, in the olden days a lot of services where unavailable such as a computer that could have aided the development.",

If the imagination envisioned by the OP can occur in the past, then the civilization of the past was more sophisticated, and now it may have entered the advanced Modern era.

There was no reserve currency which influenced any near as many countries as USD does today since both technology and globalization were not/not near as prevalent or capable of being prevalent in these era's.Bitcoin was a response to the global financial crisis which highlighted that the United States and the USD who cheated the collapse of its currency by bailing out failed institutions and re-enabled the flawed system.  Bitcoin addresses a flawed currency that continues to cheat its death and is obviously becoming a threat to the people.
