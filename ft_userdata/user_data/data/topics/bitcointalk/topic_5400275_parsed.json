  "content": "During a bear market, almost every new project is going to fail immediately. The funds required for the startup to begin will not be there, investors will not fill the presales, and scams will rule.What could have a small chance to succeed, now has zero.It takes backing from big exchanges and connections with investors for a project to succeed.Having said that, I never stopped looking and will keep investing during the bear market appropriately. But for anyone that considers leaving, know that this market will reward those that stayed. It is the time to educate yourselves.I've seen even silly spammers changing their ways and realizing there is a lot more everyone can offer by changing their ways.For now, it is the time we count losses, but also we strengthen and rise to the challenges we face.Besides the new cryptocurrencies, from my perspective, I'd look more at cryptocurrencies that hold utility, keep developing and have a serious community.",

So there are many reasons for the initial investment to succeed or fail. When the market goes up, it is possible that we will see many different earning opportunities, and it is easy to check the profits, but whether new participants have enough awareness to approach that is another matter. There is nothing to blame here for not taking the opportunity, I have seen many of my friends enter this market and they are still stuck with losses. They are not satisfied with the profits they made. Greed and loss of psychological control in the market are some of the reasons that led to their losses. And honestly, I believe that buying BTC or ETH is safe if you can buy them, or other altcoins you believe in, and getting really ready to reshape your investment plan with knowledge and personal finance are comfortable in the opportunity to invest in the financial markets, particularly in this market.",

During a bear market, established projects also struggle to survive and overcome, let alone new project released during bear season. I think at this point we should not spend too much time learning about new projects, focus on projects that have a long history of achievements and reputation in the market to avoid risks and multiply opportunities double your future wealth. When the bull market comes we will have a lot of new projects created and we will have no shortage of opportunities to invest, so just try not to lose money in the bear market and get through it.",

However, there are few projects who manage to be successful in their sale despite the bear season. it all depends on how good the projects are and the community support they have. overall i believe we can gain a lot in bear market as well.",

There are always profits to be gained in every phase of the market(bearish/bullish). That is, if you know what you are doing. Now, talking about new projects, most of the developers that really know what they are doing will not launch or postpone as much as they can when the market is bearish. Which is why it is pretty hard to find good projects in a bearish market. And if you manage to find one, it is either you are lucky enough or you have put extensive amounts of effort in searching for gems in a bearish cycle. Which I personally think isn't worth it. So what I often do at bearish seasons is keep the number of assets I hold to a minimum and just slowly accumulate or DCA. not just because it proves to he quite rewarding but mainly because it saves me a lot of trouble and gives less stress.",

Yes, this bear market will never be easy for us, but it always brings big opportunity to enter the market, and for those who want to accumulate more potential coins to add in their portfolio. Sad to say, not all realized this. Others chose to escape and leave the market because of panic and that's how this bear market become useless for them. But for those who remained calm and smart, this bear market is the start of a new challenge, and only those projects who have long term vision and real use cases end up surviving, while others fail and lose their value along the way.",

I do not believe it, anyone using that excuse is not really a developer and just wanted to obtain some money out of this market.",
