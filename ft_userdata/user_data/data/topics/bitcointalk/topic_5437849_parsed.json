I have read about Asic miners getting hijacked by hackers to mine for themselves, precaution is better than cure.",

      "body": "1) Do not use the default username / password2) Keep it behind a firewall separate from the rest of your network. VLAN will also work.3) Only use stock or well known firmware. Finding a post about a random bit of code that can generate 20% more profit is going to get your miner and possibly your network hijacked.That should just about do it. Some people also say don't buy used you don't know what the old person did, but so long as you re-flash the miner to stock you should be fine.-Dave",

      "body": "Just keep your miner updated to the latest firmware and disable ssh.Also, change your root admin password and keep your router to enable firewall protection for any attack, and don't access any website randomly that records your IP because sometimes they scan your IP for open ports.And don't flash your units with random firmware that you downloaded from unknown sources there are lots of fake firmware out there be careful.",

Sometimes they do get a very small hashrate from your miner just like other firmware with a developer's fee of around 2% to 10% without you notice. That is why if you buy a used miner it is always recommended to flash them through an SD card and then upgrade it to the latest firmware to make sure you are using clean firmware. Dev fees don't affect much if you only have one miner but for those who have big farms, a 2 to 10% dev fee is a big loss.",
