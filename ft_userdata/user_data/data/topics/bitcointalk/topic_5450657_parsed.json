  "content": "$GENSLR (Good Gary Gensler) is an ERC-20 token (meme coin) which launched on April 19th 2023. $GENSLR though is not just a meme coin, it is a community project which aims to gather the Crypto community in protest against the SEC and Gary Gensler. It is starting to be called a movement coin, however you want to call it, it is a fresh idea which may potentially create a large pushback against the establishment.Â If you are on these forums I am sure you have heard what the SEC and Gensler have been up to you can get a good overview here:https://blockchaindaily.news/2023/04/28/the-gensler-chronicles-a-story-of-deception-multi-billion-dollar-rugpulls-and-market-manipulation/$GENSLR has grown quickly and has an very strong core community, people are starting to see what it is trying to accomplish. If flipping Gary Gensler the bird, off the hook memes and a hard push back for Crypto sound good to you, $GENSLR may be for you.$GENSLR Key Points- 90% of $Genslr tokens are locked in liquidity pool for the next 100 years.- Smart Contract is Renounced, you can see the contract here.- 5% retained for CEX listings.- 5% for Good Gary which I assume is some pay for the team.- Community driven project, the only people that can rug it is the community, which is about as unlikely as Gary Gensler making sense with his regulations.- Very strong and active team and community.- Great organic growth both in community and holders.$GENSLR LinksWebsite: https://goodgg.vip/Twitter: https://twitter.com/goodgenslerTelegram: https://t.me/goodgarygenslerCoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/good-genslerCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/good-gensler/Blog: https://mrgenslr.vip/ (this is a fan site, not by $GENSLR creators)Exchanges (DEX)UNISWAPDEXTOOLSExchanges (CEX)POLONIEXLBANKClosingThe project is a movement, but it is also a lot of fun. The community has a continuous flow of awesome memes, I mean Gary Gensler is so memeable. Everybody for the most part works well together and the growth is constant and organic. $GENSLR I believe is making a statement, that statement is getting larger by the day.Transparency: I am not a Good Gary Gensler creator or developer, I am just a community member trying to do his part.",
