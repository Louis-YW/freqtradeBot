  "content": "Hello, dear miners! I would like to share a story about miners from Kyrgyzstan. Our authorities are dishonestly conducting business in the mining industry. They have banned mining for citizens, citing a shortage of electricity, but they themselves have entered into an agreement with BITFURY and are mining at hydropower plants. According to unofficial data, at least 500 MW of power is dedicated to mining. Every winter, we experience power outages or increased tariffs. We are deceived into believing that we have a water shortage, while in reality, they sell water to our neighbors and use the generated electricity for mining. As a politician from Kyrgyzstan, I am requesting your help, the crypto community, to conduct an investigation through Shodan.io and find out how many mining devices are operating in Kyrgyzstan. Let's expose the energy mafia in Kyrgyzstan! Let's help the people of Kyrgyzstan!Starting from 2018, our government decided to ban mining in Kyrgyzstan. However, despite this ban, we are still facing an energy crisis, and our reservoirs have been depleted. Curiously, I started investigating and discovered the presence of hidden miners operating in the country. I have identified at least two companies involved in this clandestine activity: The9, a Chinese company, and Computer Power Center (CPC). The9 is utilizing 7,500 ASICs, consuming 31.5 MW/h, while CPC is using 20,000 ASICs, consuming 60 MW/h. I found this information online.I am deeply concerned that our officials are secretly engaging in mining activities, exacerbating our energy crisis. As a result, electricity tariffs have increased, and we are experiencing frequent power outages. Farmers are also suffering due to water shortages for irrigation. We are reaching out to the crypto community for assistance in locating these miners within our country. Our preliminary estimations suggest that the total mining capacity amounts to around 500 MW/h.We kindly request mining pools to disconnect any dishonest miners from their pools. We urge regulators to take appropriate measures against these miners, as their activities are detrimental to the entire population. We implore the miners themselves to cease their operations in Kyrgyzstan and provide the wallet addresses they used for safety costs. Additionally, we request assistance in identifying the wallet addresses of the officials involved and sharing the information via email at civicenlight@gmail.com.",

Kyrgyzstan buys electricity from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and uses electricity for mining. Mining can be developed only in those countries where there is a large shortage of electricity. But in Kazakhstan, private mining was quickly closed.",

Just as I don't know if any pools would have refused hashrate of Russian origin because of the pretext that there are Western sanctions against their government.The point of a decentralised currency is that it should be decentralised, and nobody is going to dictate who mines or not within the community. Laws, regimes and governments can act locally, but if corruption gets involved it becomes complicated.Miners don't ask permission from any authority before plugging in their ASICs, that's managed locally/nationally, but it's not the job of the community behind Bitcoin.Good luck to you in any case",
