It's been said If you can't be responsible in storing your coins then don't invest in bitcoin or cryptocurrency In addition to Kelward reply, no matter how aggressive we try to accumulate more bitcoin especially if we are trying to catch up with older bitcoin investors we need to make sure we actually have funds to take of ourselves and also an emergency funds in case something comes in unexpectedly we don`t have to sell our coin to fix that issue and avoid any chance of selling our bitcoin in a lost.Also the risk involve in HODLing bitcoin in a non-custodian wallet is minimal in comparison to what you will gain, while though trading bitcoin is less risky than trading altcoins since majority can be easily manipulated HODLing is still much better and less risky to it no matter what anyone will say. Also as a true bitcoin investor we shouldn`t be thinking of selling all our coins or using our profit solely for other things instead save some of our profit for getting more coins later",

Totally the thing that you should do when you're invested in any crypto, always look into the brighter side no matter what because it's going to be like this for bitcoin market ever since, it won't change for you so the best way that you can go in all of this is to do the adjusting in the market and always be a positive about the market.",

Bitcoin is a popular and volatile currency and has both positive and negative aspects. However, even if it takes a positive turn now, it is difficult to say when the market will turn. Because Bitcoin has been going through many ups and downs and is already taking bold steps towards the bright side. However, we have to keep in mind the risk side, along with all the positive aspects of Bitcoin. Because, as you say, more work needs to be done, and if we want to maximize all that Bitcoin has to offer, there is no doubt that we need to think about how to make it better.",

Yes, investing in crypto certainly cannot be separated from risks, but of course the safest crypto is Bitcoin. Yes, in any case, if we think too much about risks and don't dare to take steps because of risks, then we won't be successful in any business.Yes, managing risk is of course also very necessary, but yes, in this case, insight is needed because with a lot of insight and knowledge, we will find it easy in any case, as well as investing in Bitcoin. And indeed, what needs to be done for someone who wants to get involved in crypto, especially Bitcoin, is of course to first know the knowledge and what money is appropriate to put into Bitcoin so that investing in BTC feels comfortable.Yes, of course we have to look at the positive side of Bitcoin so that we are enthusiastic and have the potential to be successful in the future, but in my opinion we also need to look at the negative side so that we are always alert to Bitcoin's movements so that we can manage risk.

For me and everyone who already understands Bitcoin, this is not a bad investment when you see the market is correcting because after all normal Bitcoin has been proven many times to be able to generate profits for those who hold it.",
