      "body": "The service provided by @jazzvenue is right to the point and then some! Though a bit sceptical at first, I got solid reassurances from the seller and received all the login details to Palm Beach Confidential for 1 year membership, just as I would have if I went to them directly and paid their extravagant joining fee. Come on $5 grand are a huge price-tag for a single publication no matter how good it is, and I got that with just one tenth of that price ! Notwithstanding the fact that I have just now taken up his service, my honest feedback at this moment is that he delivers what promised 100%, nothing to suggest otherwise so far at least.",
