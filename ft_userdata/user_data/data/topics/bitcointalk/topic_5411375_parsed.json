There are lots of them reported here and it is not just on Twitter you can also receive them in some telegram groups, Discord, and Email.What they did was pretend they have USDT on their account as ERC20 or TRC20 or any token-based and luring you to deposit any amount for the fee to transfer the token but in the end, after you deposit it will automatically transfer to another address that you didn't own. Most of the people who are trapped by this trick are greedy newbies. Always ignore these messages if you encounter such messages it's obvious scam.",

What I think would happen. Inability to withdraw and scam is definitely the end result.You can read another the same scam on these threads: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409294.msg60723718#msg60723718https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407489.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407144.0You will notice that Tron are sent to the address, but withdrawn immediately, those are the Tron of people that are scammed already, and if you try your luck, then you would be scammed too.",

No one would ever give you $500 or any amount for free without a caveat- these scammers generally have some sort of shenanigans that will only lose you more money in the process. If there is one thing I learned over the years of looking/finding scammers in this forum, it is never to trust anyone who messages you randomly. Chances are, you would probably and most likely get scammed.Unfortunately, the best remedy is to just ignore and prevent dealing with these people. Though being curious about their replies is okay, just do not fall from their attractive offers as this would only leave you in to trouble.",

Although it is very basic not to ever share private keys or seed phrase, for example, some are still giving it to random strangers online. Although it is advised to stay away from links provided by free giveaways, some are still clicking on them. So this is just one of those newbie mistakes in crypto. The sad part is that some are like willing victims. They know that there is risk, they notice some red flags, they're aware of the scam potential, and so on, and yet, perhaps out of greed or whatever, they still proceed with it.",

Quite similar tactic but I just simply delete the chat and blocked that person. Not only with this kind of script, but we have to be vigilant and learn to have second thoughts or ask opinion from the experienced ones before believing in that kind of message or so. Let’s be extra careful because the scammers and hackers are getting smarter due to learning of their mistakes in the past of failed methods.",

We can excuse those who got scammed when this scam debuted on the excuse that they saw a cry for help and mistook it for a genuine cry, offered to help rescue distressed wallet owners but got done in. What about today that the scam has become rampant. Shouldn't people begin to realize that there's no free cash anywhere?Like several posters have explained the process as a pure ensnarement, I believe those contemplating harvesting the supposed trapped cash in the exposed wallet should call themselves rogues if they as much as made an attempt to reap where they didn't sow.",

Random people aren't going to give you $500 on the street, so stop thinking it will happen online. 2. If the offer was legit, the person wouldn't have to contact you to help them. Everyone has friends, family, neighbors, acquaintance, colleagues they can ask for help. 3. Don't think of yourself as being special to receive this financial boost.

You are correct Pmalek, Twitter or other social media apps that scams happen very well, like telegram, do not verify or check anything for you, and they shouldn't, they cannot help people to verify or check scams, people who use their site are to verify and check for scams by themselves and not to be greedy, if they notice any scam handle they can report it for the site to ban them and they will if the reports are many and the proof is solid. For example people cannot wait for Twitter support to stay in their PM waiting to detect any scam message coming in.

I am not sure what you don't understand.USDT is a token available on several blockchains, Tron being one of them. You can't transfer tokens without paying network fees in the network-native currency. That's why you need ether if you want to send ERC-20 tokens, for example. In this particular case, we aren't dealing with Ethereum and Ethereum tokens, we are dealing with Tron and TRC-20 tokens. To move those 3800 USDT (TRC-20 tokens), you need the network-native currency to pay the transaction fees. In other words, you need Tron. The scammer created a Tron account, deposited USDT on it, and probably set up a smart contract that steals any incoming Tron coins and sends them to a different address that belongs to the scammer. That's the whole idea. If you want to move the coins, you have to deposit some Tron. Any Tron you deposit is immediately stolen. No one can move those 3800 USDT because no Tron can ever stay in the account to be used for the network fees. It's a vicious circle.",
