  "content": "As a user-orientated platform, PandaSale focuses on facilitating a balanced and mutually beneficial environment for both investors and project owners.PandaSale not only provides the next generation, all-in-one DeFi Launchpad for all EVM-powered networks but also integrates many other complimentary services (Marketing, KYC audit, Contests, etc.) under the same platform. Having many partners in the crypto space, PandaSale provides access to many discount services which raise project success rate.PandaSale is financially accessible and simple to use for both investors and project owners.Our unique design not only assures the best possible project launch but also creates the conditions to help the project keep growing after launch.*** The lowest fees on the market.*** Simple to use, no coding skills required.*** Safe and secure platform (ANTI-RUG, ANTI-BOT services).*** Highly user-focused.*** AIO Launchpad with many integrated auxiliary services (Contests, Audits, etc.) for investors and project owners.*** Partnered with many organizations that offer professional services which raise project awareness at unbeatable rates.*** Unique staking system which benefits both investors and project owners.Our mission is to create a healthy ecosystem where both investors and project owners benefit from a safe, secure platform, which offers all necessary services for a project to launch, grow and further expand.The core philosophy of PandaSale is to be centered around the user. We strive to create an environment where investors benefit from supporting their favorite projects and we endeavor to create the best circumstances for project success even after launch.The black and white panda has long represented the Yin & Yang, a symbol of balance that fits our core philosophy as we strive towards creating a balanced and healthy platform for all our users.For us, the Yin & Yang also illustrates how we are all light but also darkness. What we might consider our strongest and weakest parts are actually complimentary to one another, and helpful or harmful depending on how we use them. We have the same credo when it comes to our team and our community.We help each other manifest light and dark in harmony and balance towards a shared goal.Also, pandas are awesome.For the time being, tokenomics and other details pertaining to the PandaSale token will be unavailable since the team is currently focused on developing the platform.In order to illustrate proof of concept and because the project is funded by the team's own resources, the PandaSale platform will be launched before the PandaSale token. Since the platform and token are to be released separately, investors will have ample time to observe the functioning of the launchpad, so as to better gauge the worth of the project, before deciding to offer further support by investing in the PandaSale token. Current blockchains that are compatible with PandaSale and others which will be integrated in the future.​Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain network, constructed to run smart contract-based applications, which runs in parallel to the Binance Chain. ​Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, ether being the native cryptocurrency of the platform.​Built on Ethermint, which supports rapid porting of apps & smart contracts from Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, Cronos can process more transactions per minute than Ethereum, making it faster, cheaper, and greener to execute smart contracts.Further developmentAt the moment PandaSale is focusing on facilitating growth for BSC, CRO, and ETH communities, but we are also planning to integrate other blockchains such as: ​​*** Standard Token Minting Fees: 0.1 BNB*** Liquidity Generator Token Minting Fees: 0.1 BNB*** Baby Token Minting Fees: 0.1 BNB*** Buyback Baby Token Minting Fees: 0.1 BNBCreate BSC Presale or Fair Launch (two options)*** 0.5 BNB + 2.5% of BNB Raised*** 0.5 BNB + 1.5% of Tokens Sold + 1.5% of BNB Raised*** Panda Anti-Bot: 0.5 BNB*** PandaLock: Free*** KYC Badge: Free*** Audit Badge: Free​*** Standard Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Liquidity Generator Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Baby Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Buyback Baby Token Minting Fees: TBACreate ETH Presale, Fair Launch or Private Sale Fees*** TBA ETH + TBA% of Tokens Sold + TBA% of ETH Raised*** Panda Anti-Bot: TBA*** PandaLock: Free​*** Standard Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Liquidity Generator Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Baby Token Minting Fees: TBA*** Buyback Baby Token Minting Fees: TBACreate CRO Presale, Fair Launch or Private Sale Fees:*** TBA CRO + TBA% of Tokens Sold + TBA% of CRO Raised*** Panda Anti-Bot: TBA*** PandaLock: Free",
