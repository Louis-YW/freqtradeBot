Bitcoin is still new if we compare it with fiat and is slowly getting adopted. Give it some time and it will be simple to understand in the future than in the current time. The children of El Salvador will be far much educated with Bitcoin and the tech than those children in counties where Bitcoin is still a mystery for most of the population.",

      "body": "A child who hasn't learned how to ride a bicycle will tell you that it's very difficult, while the one who has been riding for months will tell you it's very simple. We all came into this world to find fiat currency as a major/general means of exchange. We had no choice but to accept it, and we didn't even bother to understand its technicalities and everything that happens behind the scenes. If I were to conduct a survey by presenting the mapping that appears in this thread to 20 different people, I don't think one person could explain everything. Isn't there already a complication?.Personally, I don't understand everything written on that map, but I can choose to understand it just by my decision.Just as Bitcoin has its own technicalities, fiat currencies also have their own, filled with corruption and centralization that only the issuers of these currencies can see, which is clearly unlike Bitcoin.Bitcoin has its own technicalities, I won't deny that fact, but that doesn't stop anyone from learning how to perform a basic transaction by just copying and pasting an address, then inputting a specific amount. Moreover, some wallets are as simple as possible making it very easy to learn.So, I think those people who think Bitcoin is complicated are only referring to the technical part, which I don't think they must learn if they are not willing to. Just learn the basics, like how to buy, make transfers, etc., because that's what we literally do with fiat currency.Let's stop paying attention to these people who are not willing to learn, just like a child who is not willing to learn how to ride a bicycle, but make a complain of it's difficulty.",

Besides bitcoin is still a new technology even though it has existed for about 15 years now.If we must be realistic, individual learning capacities differs and so, there're also people who suffers on technical factors which bitcoin is evolved with technicalities.",

It's under fiat they will tell you this one is bond, this one is treasury bill and the other ones are financial instruments and what all of them are saying is fiat money and nothing more, even your image is nothing but the same fiat, it's their complexity about money that brought us to high inflation they fight every year.Where as Bitcoin doesn't have to deal with all these processes, even on the network aspect, it's just sending from the sender to receiver, the only little complication in it is the nodes and miners that does the validation and comfirmation of the transactions but fiat protocols is like going to a world War where you don't understand anything but you just fight for survival.",

The Bitcoin and Fiat systems are both complicated; what makes people complain about the protocols in bitcoin is that they had to learn about the new system. Secondly, the decentralization makes everything under your own control...in a broader sense, you're entitled to perform every action that the banking systems and third party does, which makes it more complicated. Just imagine a situation where you made a transaction with a lower fees and it got stuck for sometime; you'd have to manually pump the fees ... That's gonna force you into learning how to RBF or CPFP. Meanwhile in the Fiat systems, all you gotta do is visit your bank branch and the customer care would do the rest.Edit:Quote from: cr1776 on June 28, 2024, 10:04:36 PMThe protocols are/will be abstracted away with wallets, ETFs, exchanges and the like over time.   It's actually good to learn things the hard way atimes.",

What Findingnemo is saying is that using fiat money doesn't mean you understand how it works.Exactly his point, to even buttress what he said, there is no point in know some of the technicals of the bitcoin network if you just want to be mere user and not something like a developer or even node user. All you need is understanding the concept of how to set up your wallets properly, how to send your funds properly; knowing the required amount of fees to pay, when to bump your transaction and other little details, which are what the fiat currency also does. Things like how can you get to have collision with seed phrase are not that so necessary. I only see people bring about the complexity of bitcoin technology as a whole propaganda to either shy away from using it or spread FUD and nothing more",

And if both are complicated, do we even need to know how fiat's are made and where they have been made from? no. And that's the same goes for Bitcoin, a user, a holder, or an investor doesn't need to know all of its technicalities because they really are going to be complicated if you're not fond and knowledgeable about it. The basic matters don't have to be complicated at all and it is not requiring a lot of knowledge to be understood. What is important is the value that they have and what it brings to the person who has it. Like for that fiat lover, he'll never understand the importance of bitcoin and it's his own choice to make it look like complicated on his own mind because that's what he's believing and chose to stick with.",

But what needs to be underlined is that nothing is complicated if people want to learn and they can learn to understand. The growing technological journey will make it easier for people to understand the bitcoin system and now there are many people who know technology so that it can help understand the bitcoin journey system.Technology used to be very limited and only a few people had access to the internet but now we can see bitcoin adoption becoming more widespread. This is due to easy access, the internet and increasingly developing technology.

But I will also argue that until we know something better and more detailed about the subject, everything will seem complicated to us. Now is the time when new technologies are changing the world; only the adult and elderly generations will have difficulty understanding. All those who know how to understand the Internet a little better than using social networks, master Bitcoin, use its wallets, and understand the importance of their seed phrase will be able to master it very quickly.
