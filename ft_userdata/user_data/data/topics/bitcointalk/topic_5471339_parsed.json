Whichever way em go, it is advised to have a low staking power(money) than betting with money wey big.",

One of the mentality that gamblers have is that whenever someone wins a bet they will be thinking that they would have also won if they had predicted better and whenever someone wins a bet, you see gamblers trying to meet the person for possible predictions without knowing that gambling is a game of chance as the possibility of winning is 50/50. Gambling is not something that you will follow trend like maybe if someone staked a huge amount on an event then you decide to follow them with the little you have and having the mindset that if they lose that huge amount of money how much more about you that's staking with little amount.Everyone has their means of making and getting money as you may not know how people make their money to stake that huge amount without thinking about the possibility of losing the bet moreover, some of these celebrities and influencial people are being used by this betting bookmakers and promoters in other to achieve some of their selfish goals. So gamble with caution, don't follow trends as you might even go bankrupt as a result of indiscipline.",

It has cause a lot of damage to the Nigeria youth. So many Nigerian youths don't want to work again, they are just looking for means of turning into a millionaire overnight through gambling.After working throughout the whole day they carry their hard time labour and place it on a bet. After losing their hard-time money to gamble they will be left with nothing so, they will be looking for always to get money to gamble in other to recover  their money back. so it's like them into stealing it killing and kidnappings and all the dangerous activities.Gambling as also make some people rich because they play wisely.This weekend gambling put smile in some people's face and sadness in people's face because it was not as they expected it to be. Chelsea vs arsenal and Sevilla vs real Madrid which draw in their match destroy make  people lost their weekend ticket.  For anyone playing gambling should still stake wisely that is my advice.",

It has happened for my side, the person borrowed 10k and play gamble to won more than 100k that is miracle just it's very risky. Today the Champion league will resume i believe the hustlers on that will have try again base one believe   as for me all this gambling is just by luck, for my side a person just started gambling like 2 months ago just won more than 200k day before yesterday and those my friends that have been playing over a have not win such amounts of money before.The funny part of it was that, some that are no more playing after they saw this person win such kind of money, they said they can never give up on gambling again, they will keep on playing until they also win huge of money too, to be gambling is not that bad but we should make sure that we are having this money not only rely on gambling. No be everybody wey borrow money to gamble dey cut but the skills pass each other.",

And secondly, you see tins such as \"borrowing or stealing money to gamble and using your school fees or house rent to gamble\" are the two worst things I can never advise anybody to do irrespective of whatever reason on the face of this planet earth, because when it comes to win a game while gambling, everybody has their appointed time to win, of which even if you gamble from today till next 2years, if it's not your appointed win to win huge, just continue gambling with your small amount of money you can always afford to lose, instead of borrowing money or using your school fees, as I have seen many scenarios like this which finally ended sadly, and as such never you let anybody put you under pressure in this life.",

I agree with that,  because as a gambler there is the need to build a formidable approach that will propel your winning and that winning approach has to be peculiar to only you and what you choose to improve and build on as a gambler,  bit by relying on the speculations of another person is a sure way to lose at some point so being major to buy into that idea of paying for a sure bet,  or even relying on another person predictions is a big danger to you as a gambler. Some time way comes across people who may try to entice us with all of that shit,  but then we have to be smart enough not to be deceived into believing that we may come across something out of the ordinary while looking for the answer in gambling.",

Some would go as far as borrowing just as you have said not because they have clues on how to gamble but because someone told them to do it as their prediction would yield positive results whereas they have no clues about what they are doing but rather the person encouraging them to gamble is just using them to do a guess work together with their own gambling so that if any of the bets works out fine, they would have something to hold unto.",

As a gambler, let your only risk be that you are betting on a game for which you don't know what the outcome will be. Don't risk giving your money to a group of people on social media who have promised to give you a sure game if you pay them; that's pretty much gambling for you to get the real game, which might still end up busting. As a gambler, it is best to learn how to predict and stake for yourself. Most of those paid groups are just scams, although I have come across one of them on Twitter that does not ask you to pay them, but he doesn't drop every game he stakes on; he only drops some that he feels can earn you small wins, but any time he stakes on big odds and wins it, he will only upload the slip.",
