  "content": "Hello my supportive brothers here.  Please I asked for your help before, but I couldn't find a clear answer to my request.  It's simple and clear.  I have an application built in a language.  C #.  Through it I would like to connect to my Bitcoin Core wallet on the same machine.  What is an appropriate subpoena?  To put it in the application you created.  This means that I want to connect to my Bitcoin Core wallet through the app I made.  To remind the app in its language.  C# I want to call.  Appropriate.  in this language.  Windows system.  Thank you",

      "body": "I'm not a C# coder, but when you understand the nature of bitcoin is the same for all languages.You need to understand bitcoin is a service, and you want need to make the call on it's port (8332) to get the data in JSON and for that you can use a wrapper.https://programmingblockchain.gitbook.io/programmingblockchain/wallet/full-nodehttps://gameobject.net/game-program/json-rpc-bitcoin-visual-studio-csharp-application-tutorial-1549/The calls that you can make and the commands are the same that you can make with bitcoin-cli, with that tool you can list transactions, create transactions, get data from the blockchain and do all the stuff that the core allows.I hope this info helps in your project",

If you look carefully you'll find free versions on Microsoft website.* Is it a c# library for this kind of projects? Then look at NBitcoin (https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin which is also available as NuGet packaged for Visual Studio , but just look at git page for other links, docs, or even applications to look into).* It is examples? Again, NBitcoin git has links. There are there even links to nice CodeProject pages.",

Just tell us what you're trying to accomplish, without disclosing who you are or what's your project. Are you searching for a Bitcoin C# library? If so, NBitcoin and Bitcoin.Net are your best courses. If you need to communicate with your Bitcoin Core wallet, then you'll have to search the RPC API reference.",
