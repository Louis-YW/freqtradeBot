  "content": "Good day to everyone. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to drop this!I'm having a problem with my PC when trying to copy my wallet address; recently, I noticed that if I copy the wallet address, the one I paste is different from the one I copied, and when I try to use the forum search to see if it's been used before in this forum, I couldn't find the wallet. What exactly is the issue?I seek support with this matter. Thank you in advance.",

You need to completely reformat the drive (and then ideally overwrite it all with random data) in order to delete everything that is on it first, and then install a fresh OS.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on April 05, 2023, 01:15:58 PMCan you please recommend an Antivirus reputable for this, I am sure there are fake antivirus out there that will worsen this case of malware.A good Linux distro will protect you from viruses better than any antivirus software on Windows.You should also assume that any and all wallets you have on your computer are compromised.

The HDD only stores what your OS tells it to store. A proper format is enough, but if you're paranoid, do a random-fill followed by a zero-fill.The real risk is in restoring your data: I assume OP wants to keep some data, and those shouldn't be executables.",

If you google it, it turns out that the OP caught a virus like Trojan. Coinbitclip. On the Internet, they write that you can catch such a virus from different cracks or add-ons for games. So the OP first needs to decide for himself whether he will use the computer for general purposes, including games and surfing the Internet, or whether he will separate all financial affairs from entertainment.OP, if you know how to partition drives, install Windows on a separate drive for work, and install the second for public use, of course, protect the first with a password. But this will not be a good solution either, try to take an interest in Linux systems for work. If you are not ready for Linux, then be sure to install the latest licensed versions of Windows, and be sure to update them.As for the antivirus, many will not be able to detect such a virus, since it only wakes up when something similar to a Bitcoin address appears in the clipboard.

If you're that worried, you can delete all existing partitions then create new ones.The last way that definitely solves the Clipboard Malware problem.But keep in mind, important data must be backed up first and make sure the data is free from malware. formatting the partition will delete all data.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on April 06, 2023, 12:10:45 PMIf you decide to try Linux-based OS, make sure you choose user-friendly ones such as Linux Mint, Pop OS or Ubuntu. I mention this because i've seen few people start with less-friendly ones (such as Kali or Arch).Ubuntu seems to be more familiar and has more users. I tried several Linux Distros starting from Kali Linux which is specifically for testers, Arch, Debian, Fedora, and Puppy Linux and the last one was Ubuntu. there are indeed many choices that can be adjusted to user needs. It is quite difficult as a beginner, but if you are familiar with the terminal and its commands then using Linux will be a good suggestion. In addition, for other options without having to reinstall or delete partitions, you can try to remove Cipboard Malware in several ways described in the article below. It's quite complicated, but if you want to try this option, you can follow the tutorial. https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/15815-clipboard-hijacker-malwareVirus names detected by some antiviruses:AegisLab (Trojan.Win32.Generic.4!c), Endgame (Malicious (high Confidence)), ESET-NOD32 (PowerShell/Rozena.EA), Kaspersky (UDS: DangerousObject.Multi.Generic), Full List: Virus Totalhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f47cee6e222b3a8c0b2e0af1de610ac0ba32f248cb0234ccfaf2d7a1d51d9fd2/detection",

Some websites embed hidden ads and display pop-ups that will usually download files automatically. It happened to my computer once. Trying to download some files from an application downloader website, but many ads appeared so some files were downloaded but they were files in disguise. Opening a foreign file with a capacity that does not match the original file will be very dangerous. The use of an antivirus or special defender embedded in Windows will be the first security to detect it. Usually, you will get a warning if the file is indeed dangerous. Staying one step ahead of the bad guys or scammers is necessary. Being more vigilant and separating everything related to crypto is better. Use specialized devices that are used for crypto, don't lump all activities together.",
