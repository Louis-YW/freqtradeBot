Then I decided to delete 748 to make my posts, activities, and merit the same, which is 252 for posts, activities, and merit.Now my question is, since I have had up to 500 activities before, if I start posting again after deleting, will the post just keep updating into activities until it gets to the 500 that I initially had, or will I have to wait for every 14 days before activities can update?Thanks.",

      "body": "I think there's a thread for this question. But however, whenever you delete some post from your profile there will be no increase in activity until you meet back your previous post target before your activity will keep counting again, your merits remains the same the only thing needed to boost you to another rank is just the activity so you will keep posting till you get back to your previous stage before counting continuous. Although it may change in 14 days time but I am not too sure about this but let just wait another person to explain more better.Edit..Read more here..https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2766177.0",

      "body": "FAQ: Everything you need to know about forum 'activity, account ranks and meritActivity point is maximum 14 for each 14 days from Wednesday to Wednesday forum time. If you have 1 post in each 14 days, you will get maximum 14 points for that 14 days.If you already have 100 posts in that 14 days, you only receive 14 activity points for that 14 days. If today you delete all 100 posts in that 14 days, you will lose all 14 activity point. If you make 14 days after deletion (100 posts), you will get 0 activity point for that 14 days. Because you don't have any post in that 14 days to be counted.However, if you delete only 99 posts in that 14 days, and remake 13 posts after deletion, your activity point will be counted to 14 points for it. You don't lose any activity after all.Activity updateSheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12saLhlUoqIdairxzuSPu6EYGrt7FN2lOstO1yDjCEbA",

      "body": "I was wondering the same thing, but I think the answer is no. You will only receive some kind of limited privilege, which is that a few of your posts will be updated to activity immediately after you drop them, which might be up to 14 posts. After that, I think those deleted posts and activities are gone; they will start counting from the beginning. That's how activities are supposed to be updated normally, which is 14 posts to 14 activities every 14 days.I experienced some kind of activity update on my account, which was not updated every 14 days but was updated every day that I dropped a post almost immediately until I got to 90+ activities, which was when I started experiencing the 14-day activity update. I believe this was a result of my account being created for a very long time and me just dropping a few posts with it and abandoning it. I don't know if you might also have the same experience if you experiment with what you just stated above, because I can't even find the answer to this one in the updated list on how activities are being updated.",

Just a correction on this. You can still delete your post on a locked topic. The only thing you are restricted is editing your post. I believe Archival board is the only place here in the forum which user canâ€™t delete their post. I tried to delete some of my old post before while post from Archival remain.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on May 13, 2023, 10:49:55 PM For example, let's say I have 1000 posts, 500 activities, and 252 merits. Then I decided to delete 748 to make my posts, activities, and merit the same, which is 252 for posts, activities, and merit.This details need further information because you should determine when that 1000 post made the most. I think everyone here knew that we can accumulate 14 activities per 2 weeks even with 1 post only. It means that if you post 100 post within the span of 2 weeks then deleting that 100 post will just be equivalent to -14 activities since the rest of that post is just an excess to your max 14 post per activity.You should determine the time span of your post which activities distributed to see what post and how many is needed to be deleted that 14 activities within 2 weeks span.",

If you delete 748 posts and there are still posts in different activity periods, Your next activity will account for your posts until your reserved activity period ends. Let me explain a little more. Let's say you deleted 748 posts but did not delete all by serial. Instead, you deleted 20 Posts from the same week and kept one post for this week. If you continue deleting following these patterns, Your activity period remains. So, Whenever you write a post, Your activity will keep increasing till the reserved activity period. However, If you delete all the posts by serial, Your activity will also be removed. You won't have a reserved activity period. I don't think anyone wants to try this. Or if someone does, I would say it's stupid to try. Quote from: SmartGold01 on May 13, 2023, 11:18:59 PMWhy would a normal Being delete about 748 post without any reason, is that normal? I don't think it's normal. If someone feels that they made some mistakes in the early days, like Plagiarism, and they don't know which one the plagiarized post, Then it is worth deleting them. It's better to get delete some old posts than to get banned. However, All posts are scrapped these days. But, Moderator do not consider the offense that is not available on the forum anymore. So, deleting posts can help sometimes.",

Well it's some how but your decision.From all have read here I would like to ask, what if you delete all your post, would there be any post to be updated in the next 14days? I want to know because I just started thinking about it, since the activities are responsible for ranking up and I know it can't be deleted, is it possible for that to also happen?",

If you delete your posts to match up with your merit just like the instance of having 1000 posts and deleting 748 to get 252 activities, your activities will still maintain the two weeks counting, So if the activity reduces and your previous two weeks was to end the next day or two days latter it will wait till your 14 activities is complete to add it up to your activities thereby changing the period of your activity.What i mean in essence is that in your profile there will be lesser activity to add up to your profile so the system automatically start counting from when the first post is made after deleting your posts so it can count 14 activities on a two weeks period interval.",

When you delete a post that has been updated with activity, those activities will be reduced to your current post count. Even if your activities are what qualifies you for your current rank, they can still be reduced, and if you are short of activity, your rank will automatically reduce by itself. Let's say, for instance, that you need 120 activities and 100 merit to be on the full member rank, and you have already achieved those 120 activities, so you are already seeing your profile updated to the full member rank. Then, if a few of your posts are deleted by the moderator and you happen to run short on activities, it will just take a few minutes before the system will automatically bring you down from full member rank to member rank until you make a few newer posts that will equal your activities to full member rank.",
