People buy bitcoin for mainly two purposes, to speculate and to use it as money. People who want to speculate buy and hold it for as long as possible, people who use it as money exchange it for commodities and services.Quote from: Ethan151 on June 14, 2022, 02:05:11 PMit has been a great value  for storing assets, commodities and currency. These qualities attract to those who believe In future bitcoin. Crypto help those who have issues with hyperinflation.. Bitcoin is a good hedge for storing inflationary currencies, but bitcoin is not a store of value per se, it does not hold value like conventional assets like gold, but if you want something to give you higher profits many years after, for hedging your money with it, bitcoin is the best asset for that, it is volatile and it might lose value in the meantime, but in the long run you will get profits bigger than most assets can give.",

      "body": "The reason I often hear why many buy bitcoin is because Bitcoin is only considered a speculative asset, has high price fluctuations that will provide faster returns and vice versa.For those who believe in bitcoin and not just about price fluctuations, but about the technology, of course they will buy and keep it or use it for transactions that use bitcoin.Bitcoin becomes a good investment, but in the end we return to our own confidence whether bitcoin will be a good store of value or not for the long term. Bitcoin is decentralized and transparent so that no one has complete control over it. resistant to inflation, but has a high risk of decline in value.",

      "body": "The simplest and shortest answer here is that people invest in crypto because they hope to make more money than by investing in classic stocks, and unlike the classic stock market here they do not need brokers.Another important reason to invest in bitcoin is anonymity because no one knows the owner of the digital wallet and the state does not have access to your digital funds.Digital currencies are a common good, they are decentralized, without the control of financial regulators and so it should remain.Today everyone wants financial freedom and crypto is currently the easiest way to do it. As for protection against hyperinflation, I'm not sure that bitcoin can help in the short term.",

If you have studied it properly then you must have understood that it's the first decentralised cryptocurrency that made it possible for us to have that financial freedom providing us alternative to the central monetary system and many more things.So if you say it's centralised then it's all wrong and it's completely decentralised in all the ways like no there is no main server, institutions,mining pools controlling it.Even if we see it from Mining aspect then after the China ban the hashtate distribution has increased to different parts and there are many pools so nobody have the central chain of authority over it    So then you said about appreciation and depreciation then it's termed as bitcoin volatility and prices fluctuate on the simple rule of economics which is demand and supply so at this time people are dumping the coins and FUD is there which is pushing price graphs downward but if you have known btc for a while then you must understand it tends to grow in the long run as there is mass adoption on the line with supply shrinking.Quote from: Ethan151 on June 14, 2022, 02:05:11 PMThis stages are very important to traders or exchangers. it’s a medium of efficient, crypto currency has been a life change in recent years, it has been a great value  for storing assets, commodities and currency.

Crypto market is big and there are thousands of coins trading over exchange and more than 18k listed on CMC so do you believe all of them are are like bitcoin? I would say none of them is like it and many people beleive it to be get rich scheme but are rugged by scam projects with shitcoins.The other coins are different but only bitcoin is good hope for us to deal with hyperinflation and if you know this fact then you how risky the market is.People investing in bitcoin are of two categories like the first one is to make quick profits seeing prices rises in bull run but when it drops they panic sell contributing worse to the situationThe second category is people who understand bitcoin at core level and realise true financial freedom against government and with profit they can also gain in the long run.",

Cryptocurrency can change your life either in a good way or bad way depends on when you bought it and when you are going to sell it, I don't think bitcoin is great for some to use it as store of value because in the last 48 hours it dumped almost 30% and almost 70% from its all time high so it comes with huge risk.The real reason to invest in Bitcoin is decentralization which gives you the freedom to use it, I mean the real freedom.",

The matter why people buy bitcoin is because of its future potential and we all know that volatility makes it even more attractive.Just as what we see how fast it went down, then it will also be quick when it shall recover and when the price start to rise again but not today.",

Centralization?Read this:https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/17/bitcoins-value-depends-on-its-decentralization/Maybe you meant its volatility?Well, whatever you meant, in my opinion, there are several types of person who are investing in Bitcoin:- The one who really knows Bitcoin much, the trust value, and also its specialty as cryptocurrency, are the one who is holding Bitcoin for the long term, with a high trust that the value and market cap will always increase. - The one who refers to profits. The long-term holding of Bitcoin will always bring high profits for its holders. Although the value of 1BTC will be always 1BTC, but in certain time after long-term period of investment, the value compared to fiat will be highly increased. And I think this profit is the most reason everybody wants to hold Bitcoin for the long term.",

These qualities attract to those who believe In future bitcoin. Crypto help those who have issues with hyperinflation.. You missed something, OP. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency in which its existence solely reflects in a public ledger being controlled by nobody. One of the few reasons on why the government avoids integrating BTC to their current financial model is due to its decentralized nature- meaning it cannot be controlled by them. While this may be the case, some countries limit the transacting of BTC by implementing rules and laws against it. Cryptocurrencies have this certain aspect that will help them become relevant in the future. I do consider them as the future of transactions given the fact that the world is slowly shifting to digitalized payments. Though this kind of transaction may be the ideal form, its full integration would take maybe tens to hundreds of years to come.",
