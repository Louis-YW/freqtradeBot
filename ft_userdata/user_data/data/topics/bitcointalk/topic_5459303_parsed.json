You shouldn't learn gambling before you can gamble,there are some games that you don't need to have the skill or make research on before you can place your bet on them. Slot is an Â example of game that is totally based on luck and don't need any knowledge on.Quote from: Jocuserious on July 10, 2023, 10:48:29 AMSimply put, here only millions of money are managed by asset owners, so where i have no money.

On the other hand if you love to gamble,it is better that you have a time limit and see gambling and a way of entertaining yourself and not to make profit.",

      "body": "Gambling will be important for those who are used to playing it everyday, every week or months. However, those who don't really like it, definitely won't feel important. Well, should you learn to gamble? I believe, that is your personal decision, not for someone else to answer. Because If someone say \"you have to learn, and you are lose, maybe you can blame him for your lose\" even you are not blaming anyone, I'm affraid you will hard to stop when you are trying to play and lose few hundred $.Anyway, You said you don't have money to gamble, then i think you got the answer to what you asked, because it's not important anymore for you to learn to gamble, because you don't have free money. Try to control and stay away from gambling if you don't have free money.

No one is forcing you to learn gambling, but most of the members here are gamblers, specially those who carry casino signatures. But it doesn't mean they have been taught to go gambling. Maybe they have a lot of experience prior to joining this community. For me this is the case, I have been a gambling for many years before I learn bout bitcoin and this community.Quote from: Jocuserious on July 10, 2023, 10:48:29 AMSimply put, here only millions of money are managed by asset owners, so where i have no money. In fact, i have ideas about gambling, but I don't have the ability to spend money there.So my best advise is not to get involved yourself into gambling. If you don't have money or little of it, you shouldn't put yourself risking that and gambled it simple as that. Maybe the best thing to do for you is get a regular job and safe your money for other things.",

Simply put, here only millions of money are managed by asset owners, so where i have no money. In fact, i have ideas about gambling, but I don't have the ability to spend money there.In fact, gambling is only for fun, and when we feel burdened by our gambling activities, then we should not do it. Especially when you say you might not be prepared to lose money when you gamble.The thing that should be the basic knowledge when gambling is that we must be prepared for all risks and the most concern is that we must be prepared to lose money as a result of losing the game.I think in certain games it is very easy, but what you have to pay attention to is the amount of bets. Whenever you're going to bet, then you have to look at the bet amount, because I also often experience negligence that ends up making mistakes that should not be so fast I spend my money.In each game there is usually a game guide, for example in pragmatic slots like Gates of Olympus, you will get free spins if you get 2 scatters, and 8 symbols must appear if you want to get money in that spin.But if you're too scared to start with real money right away, you can play on a demo account to learn how it works.But I just want to remind you, don't push yourself if you're not really prepared for the risks.",

If you don't like to gamble then don't push yourself to learn it since it will just give you stress for doing things that unnecessary for you to learn. Focus your time and energy to those activities that catch your attention since for sure you will never get bored on it and you maybe it became more rewarding for you if you focus yourself on right thing. But if you wanna try because you are so curious to know about it then gamble using a small amount of money to know if you can enjoy with it.",

One of the most important rules in gambling is to only use money that you can afford to lose. So if you don't have any money it's better for you to save and invest the few crypto coins you have at the moment. Maybe in the future after making good returns you can come back to gambling. If you still want to know what all this gambling hype is about, you can sign up at a casino for free and use play money to test their games. Just don't make the mistake to take out a loan to start gambling, that can lead to largr financial losses.",

Gambling is not for everyone unless you have a lot of money to spare and want to use that money for entertainment. If you do not have any money to spare then leave this space. You still can come here and understand how gambling works and when you have the money then spare a few to entertain yourself through gambling.

This kind of entertainment is discretionary and not everyone is forced to delve into this kind of dangerous kind of activity.If you are convinced into gambling due to the sheer number of advertisements being held by streamers and influencers, be reminded that it is a dangerous kind of addiction. People sometimes fall into this trap where they wager money but at the end, they lose more than what they planned for.If you are truly curious, then feel free to try it. But be warned, however, that if you were to get addicted, make sure that you only gamble the money that you can afford to lose OP.",

Suppose you intend to convert your cryptocurrency to a stable coin that can be cashed out to your bank account. In that case, it is important to avoid using an exchange site as a long-term storage solution for your funds caused by the money will be centralized in the hot wallet owned by the exchange site itself. It's the same as gambling site. If you don't have any and distrust it and then move on.",
