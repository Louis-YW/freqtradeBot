Well the difference between a bounty hunter and an investor is: 1 an investor holds an asset that is already marketable with realistic values vs a bounty hunter is a high-risk individual that gambles on any project by investing their time instead of money and gambling to see if the coin gets listed or not and if the project will actually keep to they promise by distributing the coins allocation for bounty hunters. 2 an investor put in physical cash in the form of investment capital and even though some people invest in new projects,  and are left to face the same faith with bounty hunters whether or not the asset they invested will get listed on the exchange or not but still the risk with altcoin is a general phynominuim. So in both situations, calculative bounty hunting can be more profitable than investing in the wrong project and the only investment that makes sense right now is Bitcoin and a few other good altcoins.",

Bounty hunters' investment is efforts and investors' investment is their money, both want to be in a profit but between the two, investors are more eager to make a profit because they want a return on their money, while bounty hunters can always dump their rewards anytime and accept the price of their efforts based on the price on the time they dump their shares, investors have more to lose than bounty hunters, it hurts the most when you lose money.",

So, for some people, time is important, while for some, money is more important.",

Because you just used an example of a bounty hunter who needs to wait several months so there is enough liquidity on the market for them to sell their tokens, etc. In the case of the regular investor, they do not need to wait for liquidity, they only wait for other reasons like because they are bullish on their coins or because they have performed other kind of market analysis. Liquidty and ease to sell or buy their investment was never a problem from the beginning. Big difference.",

I guess? Just the patience though. Technically speaking bounty hunters aren't really investors, I'd say investors invest both time and money on a project (mostly money tbf), while bounty hunters spend time on trying to spread the word about it, and they get rewarded. They're workers so to speak, and their rewards are a form of investment towards the product that they are advertising. There's also the amount of risk. Yes, bounty hunters still invest time BUT they don't exactly take up a majority of the 24 hrs in each day, maybe at most an hour or two. That's pretty low risk compared to thousands of dollars of investment towards a project.",

If those bounty hunters were waiting and keeping their coins out of their own volition I would say you have a point, but since in a way they were forced by the circumstances to do this I am not so sure that I agree with you.After all it is known that as soon as the bounty hunters get their coins there is a dip on the price of that coin, as the supply on the different exchanges in which the coin is available increases and the demand cannot keep up with it, and in my opinion such actions are not compatible with someone which can be described as having a lot of patience.",

As an investor, you contribute your own funds to a venture or business with the hope of receiving a profit. As it could take some time for the investment to pay off, this also calls for patience. The dangers and possible benefits of investing, however, are often substantially greater than those of bounty hunting.Bounty hunting is not the same as investing, despite the fact that it might be a method to make some additional money and possibly profit from a project. Although the amount of risk and patience required may be comparable, the objectives and approaches are different.",

Supposing that, I believe holding an uncertain asset differs from a tangible thing like other kind of non-bounty investment.It comes in handy if you join the bounty carefully by means of truly researching and analyzing its prospect, despite that, it might require patience, but still, it is not as challenging as having the patience to trade or invest a tangible asset or commodity. There is no way, bounty participants have the same mental burden as them. Clearly, it is a whole different level of patience due to the nature of the distinct each user's motives.",

They do not pay not only because the project does not reach the hard cap when they launch an ICO but also because they see bounty hunters as people who are gullible. Bounty hunters don't have a strong community to protect them from this crime. Even bounty hunters ignore others, so they're not united. So, in everything, there are two sides to a coin. There are responsible hunters and wretched ones. It's not rare to see hunters fight each other because some are cheaters who take other people's work and claim it. Because of these unresponsible bounty hunters, hunters are generally seen as the lowest level in the chain and are not significant. I think this is the risk that bounty hunters should know and face, and when there are solutions that would be better,",

I also am part of this forum since 2017 and since then i have joined a few signature campaigns here and i also have pretty mixed results so far. Some of them were pretty good like Radix, even though we got the token 1 full year after the bounty campaign has ended but i am still holding those tokens and they are worth a little more than 1000$, so definitely not a bad salary for a few weeks of writing posts. I also only was a full member back then. Most of the bounty campaigns though were a total failure, with tokens that were never delivered or just absolutely worthless.I would like to agree that Bounty campaigns are also investors in a project in some way, but the sad reality in my opinion is, that the majority are just Bounty hunters that are hopping from Bounty to Bounty and dumping as soon as they get tokens. So projects need to be careful to to allocate to much tokens to the Bounty or otherwise it will get dumped into the ground.",

Most good projects now are in demand and would have raised all they need from the seed and private investors before they got to the public. Another thing is that some projects that you spend time promoting won't pay on time when the price is high, some won't pay at all, and some won't be able to raise money and fail so the risk of being a bounty hunter is on the rise",

I am also participating in bounties for a long time. There are project from 2017 that havent paid. Think it is used to wait for rewards and call it patiens? I think no. I agree that bounty is about more luck but also about patience as I have been only a couple of times in altcoin bounties and I must admit from the three I have been part if I recall correctly as it is since 2016 I believe that I have not been part of them,from those three 2 paid much better than the signature campaign of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin section and one I still have the rewards locked in an exchange with low turnover daily from quite some years now and I don't even know what happened to them.So based on this I can conclude that patience is key together with doing your own research in joining a really good paying bounty like Bitgesell it was for a bit of time here,they paid up to 2000 such coins for highest ranking members and some people would be making more money with such a bounty without investing any money of their own like investors do and only investing time of their own which bounty hunters do,so in the end it all depends on the point of view.",
