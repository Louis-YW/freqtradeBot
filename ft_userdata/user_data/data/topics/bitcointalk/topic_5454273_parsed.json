Obviously Putin is breaking all kinds of rules & moral codes by invading Ukraine. Soldiers are just carrying out a job though, lots of them probably don’t agree with the war but they might not have a choice. All of the soldiers fighting on both sides have families & friends, people who care about them. It’s just a very unwise thing to say, political suicide for his career in some ways.",

It’s just a very unwise thing to say, political suicide for his career in some ways.It is a bad thing to say, fair enough, but the truth is that sadly you do need to kill RF soldiers, some of them Russians because there is a war going on and there is no sign of anyone interested in talking peace, so the way forward is to send the \"tourists\" back to their families and sometimes that means that they will arrive there in a box.I guess this US politician is not much of a diplomat, but thing are how they are... you put in money and you sent RF soldiers back home, one way or the other.Quote from: BADecker on May 28, 2023, 06:21:01 PMIf the US had not used the CIA to upset elections in the Ukraine in 2014, a different government would be in Ukraine right now.

This comes from a user \"BADecker\" who has the honour of having a thread on the forum to his name of people complaining about his inability to provide arguments, spreading fakes and particularly derailing any topic to repeat over and over false information.",

I do not know about your opinion, but Putin is not Russia, the people of Russia is Russia.Hate or disagree with Putin and all his crooks of you want, but do not punch on the Russians as a whole. The fact a senator of the United States has said this is outrageous and does not help to prevent the conflict to evolve further.",

The videos were on twitter, just search for it. The chances of it not being fabricated is higher.The post does not offend me. The problem is that the information is biased and comes from a source that has deleted the full context to support the fake \"Russophobia\" argument that is flying around from the Kremlin. There is no Russophobia  there is a problem with the Russian Federation government and Putin and Co. are trying to make it look like if this was actually a problem with the Russians, which is certainly not and you are helping spread that lie - and it looks to me that you know what you are doing.FULL DECLARATIONS HEREObviously if you are at war and there are Russian soldiers you eventually need to kill as many as possible with as little money as possible. That is the context of this.QuoteGraham said he was visiting on the 457th day of a war that Russia had assumed would be completed within three days and Graham said Ukrainians resisting the invasion reminded him of \"our better selves in America. There was a time in America that we were this way, fighting to the last person, we were going to be free or die.\"\"Now you are free,\" Zelenskiy responded in the encounter. \"And we will be.\"Graham replied: \"And the Russians are dying.\"Zelenskiy then added: \"Yes, but they came to our territory. We are not fighting on their territory.\"Peskov and other Russian officials directly linked Graham's praise for the benefits of U.S. assistance to his comments on Russians dying in the conflict.Initial extracts of the conversation released by Zelenskiy's office had not made clear that the two remarks were made in different parts of the conversation.Peskov castigated the senator in comments to the Shot Telegram channel, saying: \"It is difficult to imagine a greater shame for a country than having such senators.\"Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev called Graham, a 67-year-old Republican, an old fool.",

It's so easy to make fake news and so many people will believe in it. Not US Senator, not Biden, not Zelensky are responsible for deaths of Russians. All responsibility goes to Putin.BTW, asses of Russians burns after these words, but when drunk Dimon Medvedev for example threatens do destroy half of world with nuclear weapons or denazify Poland, Baltic States and Finland, then everything is OK?",

      "body": "Let truth guide us in making our comments. The reason why Russia is rolling out its most sophisticated weapons is to kill Ukrainian. Also, the reason why NATO and the US are giving Ukraine all the assistance is not to dance with Russians but to kill them on the battlefield. Both parties are killers and murderers because thousands have died because of this senseless war. It will be unwise to judge Senator Lindsey Graham based on an incomplete video that might have been doctored. Celebrating the death of enemies is not new because that is the essence of war. When soldiers celebrate their victories in battle they do it stepping on the littered dead bodies of both soldiers and civilians. So no party should claim that they are pained by the devastation and death caused by the war. Though there are many reasons for this war Russia will always take the blame for starting the war. I am sick and tired of these accusations, this war needs to stop. Russia and Ukraine should seek peace and end these killings.",
