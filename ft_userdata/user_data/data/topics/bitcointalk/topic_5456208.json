      "body": "First your subject topic doesn’t correlate with the main message body. First I would say there are different exchanges that actually offer pairs of btc to different coins and tokens. So if you wish to swap to those coins you can use these exchanges and then move your coins into your wallet. Concerning investing into Alticoins for the purpose of diversification of portfolio, I would say it is definitely not advisable to me especially at this moment where the market trend is fluctuating. Investing into Alticoins poses more risk because it is not certain that most of them will survive this market. Moreover why i don’t advice investing too much on Alticoins are because they just follow the trend of bitcoin movement with just few coins moving slightly higher interms of gain percentage but also when it comes to dumping they fall way below and some crashes totally. So if it is about security and probably profit then stick to bitcoin. This is also not to discourage you from Alticoins but be rest assured that most of them are just pump and dump coins and investing in them is just pure gamble",

This makes bitcoin the most preferred cryptocurrency except if you think you've got that boldness for investing on any alts being an experience user.",

As much as I want to suggest other coins, if I were you, I'll keep the 1 BTC and wait until the next or next next bull runs.",

When you are confused you lose your ability to decide what is good for you.My advice to you is to keep holding your 1 BTC till the next bull run. Decide at what point you want to gain profit and then go ahead and sell some of it. The fiat amount you got keep some of it to buy more when the bear market comes. Keep on doing it and you will end up with more BTC. Alway do your own research before investing as it is your BTC and not ours.",

If you do this for sure you will get a lot of options and also learn many things for doing this selections since you can see a different perspectives in your executed trades.",

Owning 1 BTC is dream for many people including me. Hold it and don't use it to buy altcoins because altcoins will make you poorer and from 1 BTC you will have like 0.5 BTC, 0.2 BTC or 0.1 BTC in future with altcoins. You will lose your bitcoin if you don't hold it but invest it to altcoins.",

But if you want to use it for short to medium term investments, you can invest in altcoins. But it's not easy to find altcoins because now there are more and more choices of altcoins and you might find it difficult to find them.I advise keeping your 1 Bitcoin and using the other money (if you still have other money) to invest in Bitcoin. And only use the money you can afford to invest in altcoins and don't use your Bitcoins to invest in altcoins because it's not worth it.And you should know that investing in new coins is a big risk because you don't know how well the new coins will do. It can give you two choices, which is profit or loss.",

But don't put all your eggs in one basket can be applied here too so if you're ready to lose 10% or 20% or the total 1BTC which is upto you can take your chances.I am not going to mention any names but I am gonna say what I will look, it shouldn't be called as next Bitcoin because we already have it then why we need the exact same thing to be existed which will eliminate 99% of shitcoins so there you may have some coins with actual utility.",
