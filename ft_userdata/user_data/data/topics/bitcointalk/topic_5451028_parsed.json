I have created some test instances in multiple States and working with routing transactions to avoid certain States, and Districts. Slightly off-topic. If I'm reading this correctly, you're trying to make pseudonymous/anonymous transactions possible to prevent tracking by government agencies right? Basically a mixer just like the service I advertise right now. Not sure what you mean by closed network though. How does it compare to coinjoin btw? CMIIW. You can probably post an announcement thread if you want to advertise it later and look for tester.notblox also offers testnet coin if you're looking for an alternative, although I'm not sure if he's still offering it or not right now[1].[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5278247",

If you don't mind registering an account, you can use the exchange link above.If you don't want to register an account, you can use the \"quick swap\" tool for tBTC as well:  https://altquick.com/swapIf you don't want to use JS you can use the quick swap tools API to trade accountless:  https://altquick.com/swap/api.htmlWe also have a faucet for a small amount of tBTC, but you have to have an exchange account and it needs to be 24 hours old before using the faucet:  https://freebitcoins.com/faucet/I thought being able to get 1 whole testnet was tough as well, that's why we added it on AltQuick and FreeBitcoins.com.(Thanks for the compliment.)",

Quote from: bonjourbob on May 08, 2023, 01:23:11 AMI do feel there is a need especially with large scale testing of apps. Why can't you just use smaller fractions of BTC to test your apps? E.g. instead of sending 0.1tBTC from a test user to another, you just send 0.0001tBTC.Also, there is regtest, which is probably the best idea for app testing.",
