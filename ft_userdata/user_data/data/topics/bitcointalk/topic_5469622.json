I know that there are some ways to earn it like being active in your local board, engaging in the gambling threads talking about particular sports, create an informational thread, or have some deep knowledge about bitcoin's technical like block size, hash rate, etc. And that's my concern, I am not good with any of those stuffs.

Just have something real to give to the forum, and you might be lucky enough to earn a merit like the one you earned from your local board a few hours ago.There is one statement I came across in this forum: \"Don't chase merit; make quality posts and allow merit to chase you.\" Some local boards are also good at helping one another, especially when they see you contributing actively to your local board. My advice: Look for that area where you can be productive and start making organic posts there; genuinely, don't try to outsmart anyone in the name of chasing merit, as that might land you into trouble.",

      "body": "First of all, merits are not that surplus on gambling board because there you have repetition of threads and mega threads where users just go and make spam which will be hidden within few hours in pages of threads so it’s difficult to earn merits constantly at the gambling board.  But the few that still stands out still manages to earn a few merits.Another thing is that you need knowledge to be able to earn merits, so if you are not good at the technical part of bitcoin which a lot of us are not then just look for other parts that interest you and study more about it,,, you really don’t have to be a genius at bitcoin before you can earn merits just make sure the little you know are not misconceptions and whenever there’s an opportunity for you to share your knowledge make sure you do that to the best you can. And btw, it seems like the 100 merits you have was airdropped I didn’t really check but if you take you time to go through the forum read old threads and also new ones that are being created, look at how those that re earning high amount of merits do their post and what type of posts get them merits you’ll be able to earn some for yourself.Edit:I just checked your info at bpip.org and your history isn’t looking good.This right here indicates that you’re a spammer or your post is of low quality and you really have to change your posting style and like I said earlier learning about bitcoin will definitely be a great idea as it will help you.",

Cheers!  I mean there was no guarantee that you were going to get merit even though you did a quality or great post since the merits are given by members, so you dont really need to do anything, to be honest, you just need to continue doing a quality post and go with the flow and dont pressure yourself on getting one, but for sure higher quality has a higher chance of getting merits, so the only thing that you can do is just to increase you post quality something like that. The best thing to do here just continues your cryptocurrency journey and then you have the forum that could easily help you in any case because we already have a lot of experience members here so they could easily help you, then I best one I think is sharing your experience and knowledge here in the forum, if you learn something you could create a thread here in the forum, the way I see things here in the forum if you share your knowledge and experience here in the forum, most of the time members that do that get more merits in my observation so I think it will work as well if you do that.Still these wasn't any competition so its always better to chill and dont get pressure by it, if your just active, you going to get merit along the way and rank up for sure.",

Post in topics where you think you can be genuinely helpful, and forget about chasing those merits. I've seen a member here (I won't drop names) who hit Legendary status pretty darn quick because one of the merit sources was impressed with their posts. And I'll give it to them, their posts are valuable.So, what I'm trying to say is, don't go hunting for merits – just be a stand-up forum member, share your knowledge, and help out where you can.

If you look at your statistics when it comes to posts in relation to boards where you post, it is clear that more than 50% of your posts are in Altcoins, Politics&Society or Off-topic, with the addition that you yourself admit that you have not been very active on the forum in recent years.If you want some change, then you have to change yourself - and that means that you should start visiting the forum a lot more and reading the posts of other members, and with time you will certainly learn something, so you will be able to participate in discussions.",

Gambling boards are the haven of spammers and merit sources rarely visit those boards. No matter how constructive your post is, it will be buried in a lot of spam. If you have good writing skills, try to be active in the beginner and help section, technical discussion, project development, meta, and reputation. Even if you do not earn a lot of merits, you will learn many things from these boards which will help you to earn merits in the future.",

Yes you might be seeing a total of 101 merits but OP has only earned a single merit since the merit option was implemented the remaining merits were just airdrop which was at then base on activity. When you check Bpip.org site you will see the difference there, some of the accounts that received airdrop merits will have a higher total merits than earned. OP there is no secret to earning merits other than contributing valuable to the forum either creating threads or through replies. This is done by you having the required knowledge about the forum, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Another way I will suggest is to read through the post history of high ranking but prominent ones you would learn how to my post and also get knowledge from them",

Since they don't realize that, they rather copy/paste and do other similar shenaningans in order to appear more knowldgeable than they are and we know how that usuallty ends up. @WannaCry  for start, get out of altcoin board as that's bascially a cespool that merit sources rarely visit and you can be the most knowledgeable guy there and it will still be very hard to get the merit.",

It's unbelievable to say you don't have idea or good in any of these board you mentioned. God has been fair enough to give us the brain to discover our talent. You are just yet to discover the area you are good in perhaps due to your inconsistent stay in the forum. You can read and write and your English is not that bad so, what you need now is to choose the area that best suit your interest and focus on improving yourself in that area by reading other's post in that board and expose yourself to offline research as well. Trust me by doing this, in no time you'll become expert in the area you choose to focus on.Stop thinking about earning merits at this time and improve on yourself first, merit will come chasing you when it's right time. Too much emphasis on earning merits will make you become desperate and end up doing things that may lead your account to be ban. It's all about active contribution in the forum and nothing more. When you are known for giving out useful ideas, people will be interested in reading your post and your merits journey will surely begin.",
