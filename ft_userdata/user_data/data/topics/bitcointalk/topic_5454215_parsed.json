  "content": "To my own understanding.Racism is discrimination and prejudice towards people based on their race or ethnicity.       The world is more and more interconnected but it does not mean that individuals and societies really live together,millions of men,women,children,poor,rich,whites and blacks have all found them self target with racism in there various societies.Lets look at vinicius junior being target recently by racial abusers on sunday between match against real madrid vs valencia,some part of the opposition fan called him black monkey,while some say he will die,why is he being target cause he is not the only player on the pitch.What are the things the world,the governments and people needs to do to stop racism in our society ?",

Go after anybody who does you real harm, rather than calling it racism of some kind.Did somebody defame you? Take him to court for defamation of character, not racism. Did somebody beat you? Take him to court for damages for the beating, not for racism.People are all people. Freedom of speech. Punish the wrongdoers.

Rather, practice doing good to all people.Additionally, if somebody harms someone else - even their reputation - punishment and repayment for the harm and damage done.Let people think their own racist thoughts. But if they harm anyone or any group, that's when to punish.Presently, the thing that the racism idea is being used for, is to attack and steal from people. No matter what your feelings are, get a job. Don't steal from others, but don't let them steal from you, either. Racism will essentially end if we stop advertising it.",

Also peaceful protects by individual or organism should be carried in such a way that the abusers would feel the guilt of abusing people and change from such ill act.  Schools also have to ensure that students doesn't face any form of discrimination or racial abuse by teaching students against it, government should also amend the constitution and condemn racial acts.",

Some of the developed nations getting called racist the most, they actually have Asians exceeding median incomes of the native population.

The racism idea is nothing but a big bunch of talk that is trying to disrupt society.When I read the first paragraph of @BADecker's post I felt bad. How can people that go through the pain of abuse keep quiet? But when I read further learned that most racists are motivated by the attention they get. I agree that anyone caught engaging in racist acts should be arrested and persecuted without partiality. If they stop receiving attention, they might change their ways.But it becomes a problem when racism is promoted by the government. Some organizations or nations engage in systematic racism that limits the rights of these victims. People need to speak out when the legal, political, and economic systems of most nations treat some citizens unequally because of their color. Racism will never come to an end because the world has been designed in a way that some people have been perceived as inferiors. Racism is as old as man and will also change its form. Before now it started as slavery, moved to colonialism and it will keep changing its form. Even in my country where everybody has the same color an offshoot of racism called tribalism still exists. Some tribes believe that they are superior to others. So they ensure that the so-called minorities don't have access to political and economic powers.Most people that engage in racism are not informed. I have been privileged to share a flat with some members of the most dreaded tribe in my country and I discovered that humans shouldn't be judged based on their tribe or color. These boys were exceptionally nice and I enjoyed every moment spent with them. They had better character than most of my tribesmen.",

During the time of slavery, the white people used the black people ( Africans) for slavery, suffered and dealt with them seriously, even killed them too.So to me I think we should try to shun racism because it's really affecting the world today, because even me as an African black man, I don't really trust the white people because I know they don't love blacks...I can't afford to stay with them and be free, racism live in their vains and blood",
