But out of greed I refused to bet the game at 1.3 and I added the one that lost the bet, what a pity?Greed is one thing that gets some game lost, the stake we are supposed to win out of greed we add another that get the game lost.Out of my own experience I have learnt my lessons, but I don't believe that this opportunity might ever come again because I don't bet often, on a second thought this my story is what makes some people put more interest on gambling.",

No matter if you win or lose in that crazy odds bet, you will still lose because you played on a known scam casino that has a bad reputation in this forum. Even if the luck gets you and won that bet, the casino would rapture your luck by not paying you your money. First thing to do if I where you is to check the legitimacy of the casino first and deal with the greedyness that you have. The greedyness is fixable and I believe that anyone who learned their lesson on same kind of situation like this will learn.",

      "body": "It's not that greed can cause a bet, even without greed, people lose all the time. It's just that with greed, you actually want to bet more, which in turn leads to further possibilities of losing (and winning as well). In most cases or experiences shared, losses are more emphasized than winning, hence why the general perception of greed is that it can cause you to lose. And tbf, seeing the original bet and the max win, seems like your chances of winning were pretty close to zilch, so I don't think there's anything to question about it really. And as others have pointed out, it's a scam casino, so if that lightens the load on your mind then might as well just think of it that way instead of blaming your greed.",

Asides the casino being a scam, the point of his topic is about avoiding greed, which can be a big factor against success in gambling. Greed has cost a lot of gamblers, and If greed as a problem is not handled, it will follow you to any casino or gambling place that you find yourself, reputable or not, and continue to cost you.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 23, 2023, 09:43:16 AMYou do not have to blame yourself as you are gambling responsibly.When I converted 1700 naira to dollar, that is just $2.2.

We all know that we are only human beings who can never be separated from greed. That's why for me it's something normal. As long as you play wisely and understand the risks, that's good enough as long as you don't become an addict.I make sure what other friends have said in this thread is true that Betking is not a safe site for you, even if you are just a small gambler you should play on the Stake.com site because it might guarantee your safety and comfort in gambling, at least when you withdraw money there won't be any problems when you play at BetKing.",

But still though, regardless of the amount that he bet, when greed sets in, gonna be hard to control and most of the time we lost everything and then we look back as what to happen and then we have a lot of regrets and whats if.Anyhow, let's see for the OP if he has learned already, hopefully he his, so that the next time, if he win then maybe he will withdraw right away and enjoy his winnings and then come back later.",

The most evident one for the users of this forum is the following one: I'm sure that many colleagues here jumped into the markets in a FOMO stage to see how the value of their coins plummeted because the earnings before the ATH weren't enough for them.Moderated ambition can be positive as long as it makes you move towards a reasonable goal, but when it becomes blind greed little good can happen. In addition, casinos are designed to always win in the long term; take a quick look at the martingale betting system and why it doesn't work: gambler's money is finite and greed inevitably leads to a loss from which he cannot recover.",

There was a time I was rolling dices and somehow managed to get a good enough profit, I thought I was having a lucky night and instead cashing out I decided to go ahead and try to get some more before dinner.As expected, my lucky streak quickly ended in less than half of an hour and I ended up losing my profit and a few bucks to the dices. To be honest, I think this is something which most people who engage in gambling and betting have gone through and know exactly how it feels, though, I have always thought it is easier to get greedy on casino games rather than sport-betting, because the quicker pace of the former in comparison to the latter.

The answer for that is always true since greed cannot bring any good result since it can always kill our luck when excessive activities occurs. So we should place all things set and have proper discipline to follow our set plans so that we will not get any bad result just like what you experience. Since you already encounter that mistake for sure you learn a lot from it and you can avoid to commit the same mistake in future. Although its hard to defeat greed but over the time and thru experience for sure you can get out of it and maintain gambling activity at the right place.",

Definitely true happens to me so many times, like continuing when I should stop and betting the favorite with a huge amount not thinking that things could go wrong, don't think it might not happen again to you just never know, one of the things I hate about gambling so many times your betting history repeats and you end up doing the same thing.Greed in gambling just shows how human we are, we are prone to error because we are materialistic and we always want more.",
