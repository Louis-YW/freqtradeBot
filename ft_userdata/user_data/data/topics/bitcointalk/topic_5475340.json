There are times that you will have to cut off from so many friends just to be focused enough to facing your goals, there will come a time when you might even starve yourself just to get data to do your research on YouTube and other platforms just to become good at the thing you are doing. There are times you will have to endure and cope with the excesses of others just to learn from them, as a matter of fact, if you are not ready to endure whatever comes along with gaining knowledge, you will never learn a thing. Some might take away your night rest and for some persons, they can't even remember the last time they slept complete five hours every night and some might have  forgotten that people even still sleep in the afternoon. These are just a few of the so many sacrifices you will have to make depending on the peculiarity of what you are doing, just to become relevant and successful. This is the same route every successful person took that has brought them that far and if you ever aspire to be like them, you will need to pay your own price or take the risk of cutting corners and paying the bigger price that might even cost you your life.Apart from the fact that we are all bitcoinner, I believe one common thing I find among us is the fact that we are all individual that are very passionate and committed at becoming successful at what we do and I hope this meets someone well out there.",

Reading through this post has this way of infusing positive energy and made me realise that everything effort I have to put is for a greater good.  I have always motivated myself with the saying that \"no oain, no gain\",  a popular word among those that engages in physical exercise like the gym. Lately, that word seems to have lost its value but I guess I'm back on track. I'm more than ready to pay the price!",

Sometimes in life it requires us to lose things we cherish most in other to value the things we have. And again in this life someone doesn't need to be isolated like whatever legit that you see others are doing to meet up life obligation just give it a try no matter how complex it may be but from time to time you might be well in it and even perform better than the people that started before you. Most times one of the things that has made alot of people not to reach their destination is fear of failure like if the get involved and failed how will the society look at them, it is important for us to understand that failure is a link road to success as if you don't encounter different challenges in what you choose to do, you may not value it that much. We live to learn everyday in this life as no one is an island of knowledge so don't be shy from learning new things even if you find it difficult to comprehend it just continue trying as a day will come when you will understand even more than the people that understood it before you. We shouldn't be afraid to take a step in life a our bold steps sometimes leads us to our destination.",

For success to come into accomplishment you need time, dedication, study in and out, frequent questions, admitting to falt, talking less and reason more, consistency, creativity and many other factors.Being successful is not easy. that's why we have dream and wishes. If we have dreams and can't fufill the dream it's becomes a dead dream or a wish. So there is no successful person without a story. That's why when successful people talks, it becomes a philosophy. Because they have atain a hight you have never been, and there words serves as motivation to push you to a greater hight.",

Being successful in life is not an easy tasks, you must sacrifice lot of things and face many challenges along the way. All you have to do is keep pushing yourself and keep trying.All of us dream of of being successful in life, but real success requires more than just words, it requires making sacrifices and committing time in order for it to be attained. Not every problem that someone shares can be solved, sometimes you have to excludes certain individuals from your plan, particularly those you considered friends, I picked football as my career, and I'm working hard to achieve it. but my friends always discourage me, which makes me feel weak and makes me decide not to go on.

Success is not achieved instantly by exposing yourself to the sweet realities in life, but its certainly bitter at first that turns sweet in the process. That is why for you to gain success, one should learn to take the risk and overcome it, otherwise you will never find success on every aspect of your life. While success comes easier to those who are born with golden spoon, but for those who are born poor and empty, they still need to pay the price first by embracing life's struggles and hardships first before they can taste the success in life.All successful individuals have been living this legacy as everyone should start from a scratch before they reach their successful position in life at the moment, except for those who are favored by great opportunities in the first place.",

It means they're doing something that you aren't doing. They're dedicating time to learn about Bitcoin and other quality discussion to introduced into the forum and they get rewarded for it. We have to make scarified if we want to succeed in life. We have to learn to put in the work first before we start looking for rewards. When investing in Bitcoin too, only the patience ones get rewarded. Those who are building their portfolio by DCA are the ones that'll be rewarded the most at the end of the bull market so if we wish to be among them then we have to increase our hustling power so we can generate enough funds that'll be used in purchasing Bitcoin for holding. When we accumulating during this periods that others are panicking or keeps hodling our position in Bitcoin, it means we're paying the price others aren't willing to pay and Bitcoin will reward is at the end with profits beyond our imagination.",

That's why we need to let go of so many things that we used to do and that's fine because it's also part of growing. Like having your own family and you forget about your friends but that doesn't mean that they're no longer your friends but the time that you can allocate to them is much better be allocated to your family. And the same goes in focusing in Bitcoin or learning more about it and then the application goes by what you've learned into earning. Success requires a lot of time for you take it but if you ever reached to that point and you can finally say that you've made it, it's going to be along with words like 'it's worth it'.",

Learning about Bitcoin in-depth is useful, but it won't affect your profits. And short-term trading is just gambling, no amount of research will help you be consistently profitable, so it's best to just focus on long-term investing.",

From the age when a child crosses the digit of 12 in the age he started thinking about his future and his success. He starts working to become a successful person in the future and for the bagian from the education. Spending 16 To 18 years in education he then looked for a job and in that duration, he ran from here and there just to get a job. After completing an education what he needed from the government was a job and his family expected from him a job but mostly we saw that the government is disabled and we get nothing. A person then looking for a job out of his field just to feed his family and I mostly saw most people did not get even a private job because of the economic condition of the country and the last what he doing was suicide or living a very poor life and that is a destination for what we sacrifice most beautiful things of our life. Spending 18 years on education and a lot of money it will be safe if he spends half of the fund on investment in Bitcoin. Because after some time I am sure Bitcoin will return him a very good profit, I am not in opposition to education but only depending on education is wrong, man needs to explore more things and increase his independence.",
