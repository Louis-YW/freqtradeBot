The point of a seed phrase is to import the funds in the wallet at anytime to any compatible wallet; and that means anybody (not just the owner of the funds) who gets hold of the seed phrase can import the funds in the wallet, maybe someone managed to get hold of your seed phrase and has imported it and sent it to a new wallet with a different seed phrase/private key.How well/safe did you keep your seed phrase, was it exposed?",

Did you add account to your metamask address and deposit your balance in there? It’s normal that you will create new password if you import again your seed phrase to metamask after your account logout. Probably you clear data of your browser which results to automatically logout of your metamask.Try to keep adding account on your metamask after you input your seed-phrase until you see the account that holds your balance. This happened to me before when I add new account on my metamask and deposit coins on the extra address.",

      "body": "The reason why it asks you for a password form again is that in Metamask, the password is used to lock the application/extension itself. So each one you use Metamask on any device, the password will be unique. The only thing you should keep is a secret recovery phrase/seed phrase. You can learn more at https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405451730331.Metamask has an extensive information page on its website, if you have any questions, try to utilize the search functionality first. It has a thorough explanation and will answer basic things on OP. In regard to your current problem, try Maus0728 suggestion and make sure you use the correct network/chain. If that still doesn't gives you any luck, are sure you are using the current intended seed phrase?",

Look for the \"had account\" or so option and pick \"import seedphrase\" and you will be fine. Metamask is ok and I believe your funds are intact. The only thing that can make them gone is if you compromised your seedphrase. If that happens, you should be able to see where your funds moved to. Since you haven't seen that your funds moved it means it's still there.",

WHy would I want to create a newpassword when the old one should still work, however there was no option to enter the old password so I created a new one ( same as the old one )After you typing your seed, you must have a password to protect your wallet on the browser.

I had 7K worth of assets there and now ? where is it ?What's the point of a seedphrase if you can't retrieve your old account !! With same seed, you can create multiple accounts. It is similar to using Electrum wallet with same seed but you can have many receiving addresses.If you want to find your account that has fund inside, please try above guide.Why do I have the same seed phrase for all of my MetaMask addresses/accounts?QuoteCopy and paste these rules and place them within your computer or mobile device, and/or write these down and place them next to you.Rule #1: Never share your 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) or private keysRule #2: Beware of impersonators! Make sure to verify it is an official account!Rule #3: Never DM with someone offering to help.Your secret seed phrase allows you to restore/import all of the addresses/accounts associated with your MetaMask wallet.You can import individual addresses/accounts to a different wallet by just exporting the private key. You can find instructions to do so hereHow to Export an account Private key",

      "body": "Thanks people ! I managed to see my funds again, but it was not very intuitive.I had my MetaMask linked to the Trezor device, so luckily connecting my Trezor kinda fixed things.I say \"kinda\" because once I connected my Trezor, it only showed me my ETH balance, all the other Altcoins I hadin all the other Networks were missing. So it was up to me to remember exactly what coins I had and in what Networks.Fortunately I could do that but it was tedious as I had to re add them to MetaMask one by one, not at all intuitive.What caused this problem was Chrome accidentally clearing my history ( I must have clicked the wrong button or somethn )so MetaMask did not recognize I was a long time user and treated me as though I was using Meta Mask for the first time.I was disappointed it took me a long time to restore my old settings and looking to get rid of my Meta Mask as soon as possible.I still have no idea what this \"private key\" is about or the damn .JSON file , that sounds way too elaborate and overly complicated,I'm not really interested !  I already had a super complicated password, a 12 word seedphrase, and a Trezor hardware device setup, why ask for more ? To make things worse, MetaMask does not have customer support, when you click on their \"contact support\" theyforce you to go elsewhere and find the answer to your question there, and only come back when you exhausted all other options.So basically, \" get lost, we're too busy for you, just find your answer in the nerds forum and come back next week \".Not impressed !",

It's either that or a centralized exchange wallet. They'll do everything for you, make the API as easy as possible and you won't get any annoying seeds or private keys because they'll keep all of that secret.The problem is, when they decide they don't want you to get your coins, you won't get them. When they decide they're going bankrupt, you'll go bankrupt too. You either learn or you pay someone else to do it for you and hope that person does it well. That's how it is in every aspect of life.I'm glad you got your coins back. Make a list of all the coins you're holding to make the process easier next time.Keep those seeds and passwords safe.",

They are on their blockchains at a wallet address you store them.By default, smart contract wallets use Ethereum network that is a first smart-contract blockchain. If you want to use your wallet for other blockchains, you must add them to your wallets such as Binance Smart Chain BSC, Harmony, Avalanche.Add Binance Smart Chain to MetamaskAdd Harmony to MetamaskAdd Avalanche to MetamaskI really wonder how did you don't know these steps. You might not know how to recover your wallets, accounts but adding chains you must know. If you don't know, how did you buy those tokens in the past?QuoteSo it was up to me to remember exactly what coins I had and in what Networks.You can use block explorers to check or you can recall what networks you use in the past with that wallet, adding those chains and check your wallet balance.",
