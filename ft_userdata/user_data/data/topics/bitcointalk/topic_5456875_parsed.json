This is my take what's your take?  I pretty much stand by what you are talking about here. We all need exposure for this forum every now and again anyway otherwise the people behind this forum wouldn't be able to pay for stuff. It's just that in spirit of making sure all discussions are fruitful and are relevant, I also stand by the idea that we have to minimize a couple of posts about gambling addiction, in favor of much more relevant discussions. There's nothing wrong with talking about how you fucked up and are now a gambling addict hoping to get some form of recovery in the future, but at some point these people are doing it either for merits, for 5 minutes of internet fame, or basically just to rake in sympathy, only for them to go back to gambling the moment they get a chance which is just god-awful for me. Plus these threads become breeding grounds for shitposters/commenters too. I don't know either how we could come up with a fool-proof plan to filter out these nasty things but I sure do hope something of the likes come up in the future.",

But the issue we are going to experience is that many users would be hesistant to report the thread as they could easily use it to complete their signature weekly quota, and that's why you still see some thread that should have been reported for it to be deleted is still active.TL;DR if an already existing topic is created click \"report to moderators\" and report it, as simple as that.",

Many high roller player has a low rank account because they don’t post frequently and some whale join here once they have concern. We are just making our forum stricter by giving making this gambling discussion a big deal while gambling discussion on reddit is full of this topic without any complains by other reddit user. Quote from: Cantsay on June 19, 2023, 02:45:19 PMSpammingIt can’t consider too as spamming since this kind of gambling addiction topic often times being flooded immediately by sports thread. You can count only 1 to 3 topics like this per page when we browse the gambling boards. Users just notice the increase of topic like this but it’s not on an alarming rate to the point that it already dominates a single page on gambling section.This is my current view right now on list of threads here in gambling discussion. I don’t see any sign of bunch of addiction thread in there.",

They are lessons people can learn for not to get addicted or to quit the addiction.Oshosondy I agree with you on that because real-life topics/stories related to gambling addictions and their resultant effects on the victims are a big way to learn lessons faster,  e.g we used to discuss a gambler who lost about 1.4 million dollars bet and his selected game was based on sure odds which was low odds around 1.2 -1.5 or so. That kind of story helped greatly since it gave us the chance to truly analyze a real-life situation and many members here all air their opinion on the incident even though we don't really know the victim in question.

I agree with,  I am against the trend but that was just my own personal opinion and view on the subject matter and shouldn't be referred to as a call,  the thread was just a suggestion and discussion to know what the whole community think about the trend in this related topic and word. The thread ops shared the link in the topic is nothing and shouldn't be taken as opinion of many so creating a poll for such discussion is like creating a pill to ask what the community feels an AI usage in generating text.

You can create a sticky thread and it may be used by half of the posters, but the other half will keep making random threads. You can see it in every single part of the forum where people don't use the search function but start the same topics asking the same questions over and over again, like will bitcoin die?, can bitcoin go to 0?, who is Satoshi, and so on. Personally I'd like to see less topics from people asking how to fight addiction, because there's hundreds more than 10 similar threads where they can find answers, but they don't want that. They prefer to start a new thread because it's faster than reading replies in old threads.",

But you cannot stop people from sharing their stories because we learn from people's experience. Like you said we should encourage members to come up with unique and educative topics that can benefit the forum. Maybe gambling addiction is the hottest topic now and it will shift to something else in the future. But we should drop quality posts that will educate or inform people and some can even be attracted to the forum. If the post have good quality, people will enjoy it regardless of the category. There are some stories in the gambling sectors that are not encouraging. They are badly written and sometimes filled with inconsistencies that are very clear. Bitcointalk is one of the best platforms to get information because it is regulated and has quality members.",

This is my take what's your take?~Well as much as we want to limit it to topics that are unique or haven't been discussed before is well, one, some users simply just don't search up if the topic has been discussed before already, and two, we can't exactly limit users from creating topics that they want. It's also pretty hard to identify a \"unique\" topic since after a topic goes under for quite a while, discussion about it is simply forgotten and someone would simply create a new one (an instance of the first case I said).

Megathreads were possible because said topics had events that are regularly updated, so the thread stays at the first or second page of the forum. A topic about addiction may stay on top for say a month at max imo, but after that? It's not like it's a guarantee that someone has a story that they can tell every month or two.",
