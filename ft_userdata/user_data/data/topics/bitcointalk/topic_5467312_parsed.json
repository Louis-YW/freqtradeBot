  "content": "STU-U2 Miner is dead and can be only use for loud heater. A want to experiment with miner and try to switch to Blake2sia or something. I think there is way to do that becouse all other miner switched for blake2b to blake2 sia only with firmware update. But StrongU don't care about old miners like STU-U2. StrongU locked his miners on ssh and I can't access because I don't have username and password for ssh connection.I will try to connect mainboard via serial port and try to do something with u-boot.Does someone have firmware or has anyone managed to switch that miner to Blake2sia",
