That means you still have a lot of time to wait for the price of Bitcoin to multiply. This would be better than saving in fiat because fiat is losing value year after year. Even if you save fiat in the banks that offer the best interest, it still can't make up for what your money regularly losses to inflation. But this might not be the best option if your child is already in high school and you are investing in Bitcoin the money that he is supposed to use in college or university. You might get trapped in a bear market when the time comes that you already need the money. You might be forced to sell with a loss.",

      "body": "Investing in cryptocurrencies for tuition fees might seem like a good idea but it is not really the case for short term investments. But if you invest in say, Bitcoin today and your child goes to school 3 years later, you would probably be in the green. Or in Bitcoins case, in the orange.   Personally, I would not risk any money which I need in the near future, no matter how good the outcome might seem. Do not think about investing with money that you need for something else. Especially something important like sending your children to school.I feel like some parents would hold their child off from going to school until their investment shows profits. But by that time the child could already have finished a year or two of school....",

Nevertheless, as you have said, don't put everything in one basket. It's good to have bitcoin investment, but at least you have plan B or even plan C if everything doesn't work well, just like what we are having right now, a bear market.  So for sure not the right time to withdraw if your child is going to school this year. At least have some reserved fund and then step aside money for our crypto investment.",

But still can't guarantee with your bitcoin saving keep the same values at the future when your kids growing up and have been on university, depending how strategy and great moment when investing with bitcoin or try holding on altcoin. I know better saving money with cryptocurrency than saving on the bank because have inflation values actually with how long keep saving more than 12 years based on my country study, from elementary school, junior and senior high school take 12 years. I think most drastically values drop when saving money on the bank, but if entry on correct time with bitcoin or altcoin have chance could growing up your money investment.I prefer keep investing in cryptocurrency than the bank, but keep DWYOR",

Saving some Bitcoin for the tuition fee of my children and I can say that it's quite early for me because I'm already saving even though I still don't have any child yet .Investing in crypto for tuition fees sure has pros and cons but it will solely depend on how long will you hold your cryptos and do you have some cash if emergency comes because if you don't have emergency funds, there might be a chance that you might get your crypto holdings for emergency funds. As for me, luckily I have some emergency funds in case an accident happen and at least I have some crypto holdings for future events like if my child will go to school etc. I'm not afraid at all with these bear markets because I'm holding some Bitcoins for a very long term (maybe around 7 years at least). I know the risks of it that's why I always have a backup plan if things will not go my way and I'm making sure that I always have cash flow so I can still invest .",

It's a great idea for people to learn about finance and investments and stuff maybe when they're in high school or of a similar age level or something.
