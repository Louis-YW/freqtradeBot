      "body": "Bitcoin addresses never expire and they can be reused as many times as you want.The \"expiration\" here is something made off by the wallet so you can control invoices you send to other people. For example, let's pretend you want to sell your iphone to someone. You create a new \"payment\" with the message \"purchase of iphone\", the amount $500 (converted to 0,013 BTC) and expiration in 1 week. If the user sends the coins in the correct time, you will consider the iphone sold. If the invoice expires, he can still send the coins to that same address and you will receive the coins, but you will know he only sent them AFTER the expiration time (good for control purposes).",

It is good that you shouldn't use the same address over and over again, but use different address to receive bitcoin payment for security reason. If you want to get paid by Mr A use a different address and if you want to receive pay from Mr B use a different address",

You can reuse the address as many times as like but just like other HD wallets the electrum gives you the opportunity to always have 20 unused address as receiving addresses. The expiration is used by electrum wallet to know that the address cannot be used for another invoice or payment request if the first request it is used for hasn’t expired. But it gets expired and no bitcoin is received then the wallet can use it again for another request. You can also use it to set a reminder that you’re suppose to receive a payment within that period of time.",

This option doesn’t do anything meaningful for on-chain transactions (i.e. not Lightning). People can always send you bitcoin and addresses don’t expire.",
