It is a derivative product, but if the ETF provider is supposed to hold the Bitcoin in reserve to back up any claims tied to the ETF, it means less circulating Bitcoin on a global level. But as you said, it's not like Bitcoin jumps 10% because Australia launches an Bitcoin ETF product. Regarding fees, I admit that I have never owned an ETF. I guess investors would incur a \"fee per purchase\" or do they also incur annual fees for management and administration?

Some Bitcoin owners don't want to deal with safe Bitcoin storage and regulatory compliance might be quite an important reason. Some interesting statistics would be about the actual ETF buyers. I don't think that it's a lot of normal people, smaller investors. They are probably more inclined to buy Bitcoin on an exchange themselves. I would speculate that the majority of ETF customers are institutional investors. I could be wrong though, but I assume nobody has any significant insights yet.",

Another market that could drive the price of Bitcoin is the Chinese market. These countries have large economies which can affect the Bitcoin industry. I think the price of Bitcoin will receive a boost if Mainland China approves the Spot ETF. Nevertheless, it is a welcome development to see the launch of Bitcoin ETF in Australia. It will help to promote Bitcoin awareness and adoption.

These ETF providers will have to face strict regulatory laws from government agencies, so they are practically under government control. By approving these ETFs, the government is indirectly encouraging people to embrace centralization as they step up attacks on decentralized platforms.",
