Some wallet lock in the price of received Bitcoins and you have to manually check the value at sale.How about hiring an expert to help you put, so you do not make an error?- Jay -",

There are a bunch that offers a free plan for under 100-1000 transactions.",

As a matter of fact, earlier this week Binance announced their new tool called Binance Tax. It is still in a sort of test phase so for now its only available to users in France and Canada but its just a matter of time before they expand the service to other countries. Just a matter of time before other major exchanges offer the same.
