Whatever money people tend to make off any market (crypto, forex, stock) doesn't come from above or thin air but from other people losing money.

The big traders, that is the banks and other institutions are manipulators of the market that changes the direction of the market for the hurting of retailers stop loss. Some times the market suddenly change against your clear direction and you are confused, such is the manipulation going on most times.",

They just look on their day to day charts and market then decides what to buy.Wait for a few minutes to see the liquidity of what they've bought and just do whatever is necessary. But yeah, having no plans is like throwing and wasting money in trading, be it in the crypto market or any other markets.Also remove the code on your title.Code:[b] [/b]",

You have to be able to handle your risk management and also learn to take advantage of the crypto market by taking a profit anytime you see one because there are a lot of people in the crypto market looking for where to make a profit. Always have a good plan that will protect your fund when trading the crypto market.",

They just keep buying shitcoins and memecoins and waiting for a pop up. Some dont work for them but quite effective on others who are also doing a degen but with a mixed up of deep research like whats the project stance or affiliated influencers. Simple as that they gain profits, but also losses due to carelessness and unplan movement.",

I understand that the market has many speculators who make profits from your loss, but it is rare to find someone who invests a lot without a plan, and if he does so, greed and greed make his thinking closed and he does not realize that what he is doing is losing his money.Initially, you should not invest in money whose loss affects you, such as loans, your children’s money, your insurance, or university. Start trading using demo accounts, read and learn, and then start trading with small amounts. Once you get enough experience, you can start trading and investing. Investing is much easier than trading.",
