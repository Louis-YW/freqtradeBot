If you are thinking to buy those coins which got dumped by DCG, better wait it, as the dump can be more deeper than now. $FIL, which got biggest dump, even still has $1billion marketcap, it's still huge IMO",

I know this FUD moment for many people get benefit reinvesting in lower price, but huge drop from Binance actually become questionable whet happen with Binance and can drop more than 15%. I am not holding Binance coin but have several altcoin in my portfolio, I don't think have moment recovery few weeks later coming in 2023 or waiting until halving moment time for getting back my money. Still loyal with holding and not have ideas cut loss because I am optimist with Bitcoin can break higher price.",

If you only wait without bought Bitcoin at cheap price, you will regret what you done only.I agree with you that bitcoin is the best coin in this bear season, as it will always be the first to recover and rise again. Bitcoin is also the safest coin in this crypto market, so investing in it should never be considered a wrong decision.But I disagree with you that the drop in altcoins will not affect bitcoin, with the collapse of Luna and FTX shaking the market and bitcoin falling. News of DCG fund selling assets to save 2 subsidiaries along with Fuds of Binance is causing the market to plunge, and bitcoin once again suffers the same fate with the market. All are related to each other.",

And it will depend on the movement of bitcoin because if bitcoin doesn't increase or even decrease further, altcoins will definitely follow suit. I am now focused on buying more bitcoins, especially if the price can decrease.I just hope that next year, there are altcoins that can start increasing even though bitcoin conditions are still not allowing it to increase. And I'm not worried about the current state of the crypto market because this has happened in the past few years.",

If you only wait without bought Bitcoin at cheap price, you will regret what you done only.You are right, BTC is incomparably more stable than altcoins.In theory, it was necessary to get rid of altcoins a long time ago. The longer you hold them in a falling market, the worse it gets. Loss after loss. BTC doesn't fall as much in percentage terms compared to altcoins.Theoretically, you can buy altcoins, in the potential and future of which you believe, but it is not known how long the market will fall and by how much. It may turn out that we will see better prices in the future. Therefore, I allow partial purchases.",

If we look at their prices now, they have collapsed and their prices have fallen below the cent, and I think that even if the market conditions improve, they will remain at these prices because unfortunately, their projects failed, so I lost hope in them. There are promising Altcoins other than Ethereum such as ADA, XRP, LTC, etc. You have to do your own research. It is a mistake to put all your funds in one currency, and your long-term investment will be a good opportunity for you to achieve huge gains, but you have to do your best in analyzing, following the chart, and looking at the news of the altcoins that will invest in and when the bull season comes and bitcoin rises, these Altcoins that you carefully chose will explode to good peaks.",

We know that altcoin's price always matters on the BTC price, it seems altcoins are tied up on the BTC which leads the market and if I were you, I will go in a safe option which is not worst when it comes to risk. I don't know GALA but I heard about this project, it is really risky to keep altcoins, especially new projects because you never know when their existence is.
