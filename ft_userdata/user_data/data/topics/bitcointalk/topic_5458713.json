Tho if you still want to take the risk there is dozen app out there that provide Bitcoin staking especially the Centralized Exchange. CEX with Earn program usually had Bitcoin Staking but you must know the risk. Secondly staking on third part on Decentralized Exchange but it carries risk too that you need wrapped your original bitcoin to wrapped version on destination chain that carries risk of being de-peggedso the better choice is only have it on your wallet",
