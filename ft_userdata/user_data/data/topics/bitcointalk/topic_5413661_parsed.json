I don't see any reason to buy the Premium dice bot or whatever script people selling out there. In long run, House always wins. Making money with whatever bot is not guaranteed. So, better try Seuntjie's DiceBot for free. You can log in using API. Most of the popular dice sites are already listed on their software.",

Found nothing about it on google.Does anyone of you know this script/bot. Is it real or scam?Greetings, GetschilmI do not understand why you would want to leave your funds to be gambled away by a \"betting bot\". Is the purpose of gambling not to do it yourself? Thats the whole point, have fun and maybe win money! At least, that is what the concept of gambling is to me, in my own subjective view of gambling.And anyway, gambling is luck-based. So how would any kind of algorithmic script/code make any kind of sense? Are you hoping the bot will be able to find some kind of way to exploit bets to win you profit? If so, then that sounds like a red flag and scam to me. I would never pay even 1 cent for any gambling bots.So basically, gambling bots are 100% fake. Don't waste your money.",

NCT Cryptobot or Dicebot though has some reviews and videos about it that mention the NCTTechnology website. It looks like the bot is legit and does what it's advertised based from the reviews.Anyways, I guess the OP wanted to use this kind of service mainly for the convenience that it offers where you can access various gambling platforms on the bot itself. Also, maybe because NCT Cryptobot is \"The Most Advanced Crypto Bot\".",

I think bots are good though, not saying that it won't work, but the tweaks might give you profits but it's not 100% foul proof. Dice is still base on luck, so if you are very unlucky that day, regardless of bot or not, you are not going to win.So going back to the topic, If I'm the OP, I will stir away from this bot.

It's gambling after all, and it's dice, the house always wins, unless you're too lucky.The said bot is suspicious so if you have doubts better look for a legit gambling bot but if I were you, I would focus more on doing betting manually. It's hard to rely everything on gambling bots because as for me, they are riskier than doing it manually unless you don't have much time to focus on the gameplay. I've tried relying on gambling bots before and had more losses compared to the manual result. Â yes agree with this it's better to find some legit gambling not to prevent any loss you can do some research to secure a good clue of which is legit or not. And also comparing manual betting and gambling not the all I can say is like what you said because it's more riskier if we try gambling bot than manual betting also in manual betting all we need is our luck and a hood timing to gain a profit or wining money.",

So it's strange why some people decide to take that huge risk with an unknown dice bot that needs to be downloaded and installed on a computer when there are some online casinos that offer the same bot settings. And all that without any risk for your computer and everything you hold on it, the only risk comes from losing coins if you make a mistake with setting up that bot!",
