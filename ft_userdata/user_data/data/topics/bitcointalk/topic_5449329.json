  "content": "Recently my wife had her wallet stolen, all of our accounts now have fraud investigations going on right now. This whole charade has been fun (not) and I have been spending a considerable amount of time on the phone with the banking institutions, filing a police report, and getting everything transfer to a safeguarded account I already had set up in case something like this happened. The thieves used the no key hack on our car to hack in to the RFID frequency and break into the car to steal her wallet because I know for a fact I had locked it. Gotta be more careful, we now have the RFID fob cover ordered and incoming.  Thank God its Tax Day and my CPA reached out to me on Sunday already with my tax filing ready to go literally on the very day this happened, I was able to change my banking info to a fallback account so now I will at least have access to money in a few days THANK GOD. I haven't had to tap into any bitcoin luckily because I was able to swap some gold for cash to get by with my employer and now I am just left high and dry on my other banking account, which could be frozen for up to 90 days because they are conducting a full on fraud investigation. The cool thing is that if I was really in a bind right now and had to pay my mortgage or something like that I have bitcoin to fall back on. Luckily I have everything paid off for the month which bought me some time so I won't have to tap into anything and I do have the tax refund check being processed into my fallback account as we speak. Phew! Crazy times here. Recently I made a post about being careful and the importance of being anonymous, but I should follow up on that and make a post about the importance of having a fallback bank account in this case. Of course BTC failover account trumps all of the traditional fiat institutions though haha, I'm sure you all would agree. Be safe out there guys, you can never be too careful...",

      "body": "Was your wallet and wife's wallet were stolen in the same time and the same car? Some times these things happen to someone from a close relations. They are doing to harm the person. Arm Robbers are always lead by someone who knows the victim. So if someone knows that you have you wallet in the car and broke into the key and stole the wallet, the person who did it is relative or friend. Outsider can't know that you have that thing in the key. Sorry for the lost. Have a thick skin. This is not carelessness but accident.",
