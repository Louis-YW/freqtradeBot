  "content": "Old story, it repeats again.Spammers and shit posters (nothing wrong to call them like this) use this approach to hit post quota and manage to earn money from their shit posts.How do they do that?Posting reserved posts. Likely they do it because the time of weekly post counting in their campaign is endingReturning back, minutes or hours later, to edit those posts with zero-valued contents.Posting reserve? (old story, 2 years ago)New story. It is bad as the user is from 1xbit campaignI believe we can find more in 1xbit campaignAnother example: (AndySt) The next abuser of stake campaign?I think if campaign managers see such shit posts that were edited, they would have one more reason to not count those posts for weekly payment.For other members, we can report such posts as spam.",
