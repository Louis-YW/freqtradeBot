It's a no brainer that there are lottery coins that could give you gains as much as what you project. But, they're not a good project for the long term and they're just like a one-way ticket on this market. After the gains you'll make there, that's not going to be stable anymore just as the market is stable. What's good is that if you've found your way there and made a lot, don't forget to secure your profits and lock them on for bitcoin. That's a wise thing to do when you've become lucky with some of those altcoins that have made you tremendous gains.",

For next bull market i suggest all newbies and intermidiate investors to stay with bitcoin. 99% of altcoins are just pump and dump shames, bitcoin is bitcoin. And bitcoin is growing the fastest during first part of each bull run. So you accumulate btc during bear market, dump to altcoins in the middle of bull cycle when they lift off and outperforming. And top 300 is way to far. Stay with Top 50 CMC if you are not a pro or insider.",

As long as you know what you're doing and are willing to take risks for big rewards, everything is fine. But I still want to advise you one thing, you should distinguish between investing and gambling, I mean even if you take the risk to invest in altcoins, you should invest in bitcoin because if all altcoins fail then you still have an investment that can help you get back what you lost from altcoins.",

Maybe potential coins like BNB, ETH, and LTC can do that but if you're about new projects, you will surely be facing huge risks. But if you want a better assurance and guarantee, you better risk your funds in Bitcoin because we already know how Bitcoin could strike high every bullish season.

I believe that, we can simply gain more from them and then re invest on BTC which is the trustiest. There is a big mistake in your reasoning. The fact is that there are no coins in the top-300 that can give you x100 in the next bull run. There are projects in the top 300 that have already grown noticeably and gained significant capitalization. If you're hunting for potential gems, you need to look at coins that are ranked ~800-1500. These are young projects that have a small capitalization and are not yet very widespread in the market. If a project has a capitalization of $1 million, it's much easier for it to grow 100 times than a project that is in the top 300 and already has a capitalization of $200 million. It's simple math. So you're looking for x100 gems in the wrong place. In the top 300 you should be looking for projects for conservative investment.",

I believe that, we can simply gain more from them and then re invest on BTC which is the trustiest. i only invest in dogecoin and ethereum both are in the top 300, but i don't really focus on high returns just keep buying when it's cheap, i will buy ETH under $1300 now and doge under $0.06 collect it and keep it for a few years from now because I don't care if we're in a bull or bear marketYour choice is no longer at 300 but ethereum and doge are in the top 10 on CMC and it can be said that this is a pretty safe choice, but with these options will not be able to give big profit as OP is looking for, he wants to get x50-x100 profit.OP, if you are willing to take risks for good returns I think you don't need to pick the top 300 coins but in my opinion, you can search and invest in any project including new projects. You know that after every bear cycle, existing altcoins are likely to be replaced by better new altcoins so don't just focus on pre-existing altcoins, let's expand to unlisted projects like SUI network, layer 2 projects like arbtirum and zksync are also worth keeping an eye on.",

I believe that, we can simply gain more from them and then re invest on BTC which is the trustiest. There's no way to determine what those coins could be gained 50x-100x in the future. Even sticking with those coins that have considered a low supply, everything is not predictable. Being in the Top 300 of the coinmarketcap isn't really a big criteria to depend on.Everything is being dragged by Bitcoin and that's for sure. Unless there's a big hype on that specific coin, that's the time a coin maybe can get a 50x-100x increase but that will just happen once as if that coin crashes, the hype will be over.",

Its advisable you focused on top 5 altcoin maybe or newly listed projects on a reputable exchange, sorry to say this what i does is that most time i do go on Binance listing calendar announcement to pick up some solid project i could focused on and i do trust Binance exchange in a way that if a token is being listed over there after 6 months or a year interval there will be massive increased and that has been helping me. I don't really know for you if you want to try that or not.Note; It must not be Binance only so you can choose any exchange you know that are trusted and reputable or even mostly recognized.After which you may decide to sell off your profits and get back some bitcoin for yourself, but you should know the quantity of bitcoin you could get then can not be compared with the current amount you would purchased.
