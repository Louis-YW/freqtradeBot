Did they send you the funds or were you given a printed private key?Either way, I doubt that the ATM provider has anything to do with it. That would be bad for their business.If the funds moved at the exact same time like the screenshot is showing this could imply that you have a malware monitoring your wallet, that was waiting for you to access your funds so it can make a transaction. When was it the last time you used the wallet? I would try to recover the wallet elsewhere, move most the funds to another wallet, and then leave a little to try and make another withdrawal to see of you get another transaction at the same time or not. Also, do you recognize the address the funds are being sent to? It might help if you could post the TXID.",

Have you verified the Electrum if it's authentic or not before you install it?I hope that you can explain it well because it's hard for us to understand who's fault in your issue you can use translate.google.com from your local language to English so that we can understand you well.",

Some ATMs give you a printed private key so you can sweep them directly into your wallet afterward.@OP As I said, the transaction can't have anything to do with the ATM provider in this case. But looking at the transaction ID, it looks like the funds are being sent to:3E8ociqZa9mZUSwGdSmAEMAoAxBK3FNDcdWhich apparently is Bitcoin.org donation address? (see the footer).But I also found that someone reported the same thing as yours three years ago:https://www.chainabuse.com/report/ec1c7617-7003-4562-9f78-830084850523?context=search-address&a=3E8ociqZa9mZUSwGdSmAEMAoAxBK3FNDcd&chain=BTCSo I still think that you have malware, probably from someone who wants to donate to bitcoin.org? Who knows. Either way, you should stop using that mobile device to store your bitcoin.",

The wallet does support Electrum's seed, but you don't want to import that. Create a new wallet instead. You should also consider getting a hardware wallet if you're going to store decent sums of money.[1] https://bluewallet.io/",
