  "content": "Hey everyone! I've put together a guide for how to code a crypto trading bot from scratch using JavaScript that implements a basic market maker strategy.We will be creating a simple market making strategy that attempts to profit off of the bid-ask spread:Submits one limit buy order at or near the current ask rate.Submits one limit sell order at or near the current bid rate.When either order is filled a new order will be submitted at or near the new ask/bid rate.If the ask/bid rate moves too far away from the existing open buy/sell order, the order(s) will be cancelled and re-submitted at or near the new ask/bid rate.The code is pretty long so I won't post it all here but you can see full blog post and guide here: https://coygo.app/blog/posts/code-crypto-trading-bot-with-javascript-coygo-forge/Or you can see the accompanying video walkthrough here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHo2iCMQON8)",
