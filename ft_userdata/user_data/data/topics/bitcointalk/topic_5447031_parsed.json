Whether you want total savings in this coin (plus the conversions of the currencies to that specific capital) or whichever you want to put?An additional question is that where do you put your coins in the first place? Is that the place where you track it as well? If you use a reputable hardware wallet, you wouldn't have a hard time with it.",

When you buy/sell crypto, your holding should be reflected accordingly.I used Blockfolio though I don't know if they are active now as they were acquired by FTX.You can try Delta app.Edit- Just checked coimarketcap tracker. It doesn't have the option to select buy/sell pair so it automatically sums the holding. Ridiculous. Try delta app instead.",

If you are still confused, you can open the settings menu and set the currency setting to BTC-USD or the currency you want.It's not set automatically, because when I tried using VPN on another location, the currency still uses the latest I've opened (without VPN). Because CMC uses cookies where they can get what you want. I still don't know why OP is very complicated when he knows how to use explorer, he just put his address and bookmarked it on the browser, I believe his problem will be resolved without complications. But it's different case when he invests all assets on exchange (risk) whcih doesn't have a specific address to track the asset.",

Don't buy any Bitcoin-backed or ETH-backed token or something similar since most of the time it is hard to verify whether each wrapped token is backed by the named coin or not. Kinda like how USDT or USDC is claimed to be backed by real USD but time has proven that is not the full story. Buying hardware wallet should not be your first option if what you're looking for is just a portfolio app, although I don't discourage you to buy/setup your own if you plan on holding for long term.Quote from: NIrish on March 31, 2023, 09:11:41 PMhowever I now have to pay premium to see statistics I had access to before on coinmarketcap such as avg. buy price, %profit loss by coin.I guess you can't have it all (for free anyway)Try to look for other alternatives, I'm pretty sure app like this are popular nowadays. Those who have somewhat good reputation is likely going to paywall some features sooner or later though, and the free one is likely going to give you some headache like what happened with CMC. Unless you're fine with ads everywhere, I guess paying some monthly subscription is a good trade-off for a good app.",
