  "content": "I discovered a thread recently that was created by BetGalaxyADM, accusing one of the reputable escrow service on the forum of collaborating with the scammer, Massively fraudulent Escrow Transaction!. This account BetGalaxyADM was involved in a deal with Burky155 on the forum, and his forum account was compromised. He used an escrow service, and when his account was compromised, the hacker was able to get access to his account and contact the escrow service, requesting the release of funds. The escrow service complied with the request and released the funds without realizing the account had been compromised.I believe a similar thread about how to secure your forum account has already been started, but I hope this serves as a friendly reminder to forum newbies to protect their forum account from hacking.I'll offer some advice on how to prevent hackers from accessing your forum account.1. First of all, when creating a forum account, I recommend using a strong password. Letters, numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase should all be included in your password, your password should not be stored in any application or on the internet. For example, it is strongly discouraged to secure your password on your email address. Always make sure you keep your password safe offline, away from any internet access.2. Avoid clicking on phishing links, do not click on random links you receive on emails or on social media, as these could be phishing attempts to attack your bitcointalk forum account. If you receive a link asking you to verify your forum account or asking you to change your forum password, always ignore messages like that, and you can decide to visit bitcointalk.org and change your password without clicking the link you were sent. Enter your forum details on no other forum than http://bitcointalk.org. Because there are so many phishing attempts going on right now, we must be extremely cautious about the links we click.3. Always avoid downloading untested software or dangerous files. Always keep your computer safe from malware, dangerous files can easily compromise your device, which hacker can easily have control of your device.4. Always secure your¬† email address. You can use 2FA to secure your email address, so that hackers won‚Äôt easily have access to your email address. Also, avoid entering your email address on untrustworthy websites, It's always better to have a separate email address for the forum that you won't use on any other websites, so that nobody will be able to hack your email address.¬† If your email address have been compromised it will be easy to hack your forum account, because the user can easily input your bitcointalk username on the forum and click on reset password, a code will be send to your mail which the user can easily use to access your forum account.5. Avoid logging in with a random user's mobile device, Nobody can be trusted, incase of emergency and you want to use the forum and you don‚Äôt have choice than to use other users device, maybe you are not close to your laptop or due to other reasons, make sure you change your password when you are with your laptop or mobile phone. Some devices will save your username and password, allowing the device owner to easily access your bitcointalk account whenever he wants and increasing the risk of account getting hacked.6. When creating your Bitcointalk forum account, make sure you don‚Äôt use the same username and password for other websites as you do for the forum. Always use a unique username and password so that no one can figure out your login information. Use different username and password from the once you have being using on other websites or forums.7. You can carefully sign a message with your wallet address as well. This can help you prove ownership of your account in case you fall victim to account hacking, if you can sign a message with your wallet, then you can recover your forum account back.In conclusion Account security should be taken very seriously in order to avoid such incidents, because prevention is better than cure.",

But once someone is not active on this forum and suddenly become active, or even if the person is active, dealing with such person should be when you have confirmed that his account is not compromised, this can be done either by using PGP encrypted message or telling the person to sign bitcoin address that he had once used on this forum before.",

I don't quite understand why security isn't taught in IT classes early on in life. I was never taught anything about security, but everything about Microsoft Office, which is kind of funny looking back. Also, just saying avoid phishing isn't the best advice, since that's obvious. However, going through the steps of verifying a link is what it is would probably be the best approach. Although, I feel like that guide would be better if it was done visually.",

Apparently, those precautions are the type that anyone should have known -- coupled with several cases that people have lost/ can't prove ownership of their accounts -- it's should have been an optimistic plan in everyone's mind. Several users have stayed out lately, unaccounted for, and very little or nothing is done about it because no one can really acertain to some VIABLE informations about them. Sometimes, a user will wake from Hades just to claim am account that has been active for several years, with the mere fact that it was HACKED few years ago. Now even if that's true (which I'm not sure) has is the case taken? So in cases like this, nothing is done.I'll advise everyone out there, mostly newbies cus -- I have seen a bunch lately-- to adhere to whatever viable informations that can ensure the safety of their accounts in the future.

Ideally, you wouldn't be using the same password anyway, and therefore that wouldn't be compromised. Obviously, data that you give that website could potentially be compromised, and therefore associated with your email address, which an attacker could leverage or potentially gain more information to carry out a more sophisticated attack. So, there's definitely could reason to use different emails if you do use multiple websites. Personally, I hardly sign up to anything these days. Kind of sick of every website requiring you to give your data over by signing up.",

That way, is almost entirely secure. Whereas, a secret question could potentially be guess or brute forced. For example, if the forum ever was compromised again (hopefully it won't be) then the hash could potentially be targetted, and if it's not secure enough it could potentially be compromised. If you make your secret question too complicated, then you're probably just as likely to forget it as your password you've set.",

I imagine most of us have multiple emails that have been lost with time. The good news is from a marketing stand point, most data that's a couple of months old isn't very useful for advertisers so they won't link you up that way. If your emails do have your personal information you've just got to hope that your password was unique, and wasn't used anywhere else. Since, even if you have the strongest password in the world in terms of it being random, if you use it multiple places, and one of those places gets compromised. You could potentially be compromised since that opens up a window of possibilities in terms of attack surface.
