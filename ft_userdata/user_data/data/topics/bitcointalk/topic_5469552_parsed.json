People dey really go through lots now and only those who get skills now Na Dem dey enjoy am dat is why e good make man learn extra skills aside going to school because Na that one fit put food for table now.Being self employed is a good one because that would make you be the boss of your own while you do your business. This can only be achieved when you have the available capital and skills to start such business. Although there are investors out there looking for where to invest their funds and if luck being by your side, they find your business worth the money, they invest into it and your business will grow coupled with their connection they would unleash for your business so they could make profit from it. Self employed is not a bad idea because you will have time for yourself, family and all other things you find worthy of your time. You will also be an employer of labour too.",

That kind person fit dey reach house by 9pm and the worst be say some of them even work on Sundays and their salaries aren't up to 15k monthly.  Sincerely, everything about job nature needs a  boost in Nigeria. People are in major slavery, just to survive because they can't stay idle and they receive little or no proper appreciation for their work. Government jobs are even slightly better cos they observe public holidays and skip weekends. Most private offices don't. In fact, I've worked in an organization that I come to work on Sundays and most times its very unplanned, like CEO just calls and fixes a meeting with you as soon as you're back from church.The economy is very bad currently and that's the root of the problem, of we can get the economy back to what it was in 2015 or better, the 30k minimum wage is a big money cos then dollar was #150. Earning 30k then meant $200. Purchasing power was higher and people  were more comfortable. I honestly think the solution now isn't to increase the pay, if not we might reach the condition of Zimbabwe which has 2 million worth of its currency as a single denomination. The economy needs a major boost and things will normalize. The price of things keeps increasing and with increased salaries, you'll still find yourself not satisfied with your pay. The government has really failed us in this country.",

But the salary is accordingly very low at only 34k naira, where all the money to cover the expenses of self and family runs out at the end of the month. The rest day is Sunday to Sunday, during which there is some time to do homework. However, such a situation may not exist in other countries, but this problem is seen the most in our country.
