It's not worth imagining. When you can't think that you can increase your costs and check the current network health, don't think that you will be able to use it universally. While, for many people, it is viewed as a large speculative asset and is not always traded on a regular basis, user behavior will contribute to its value going up or down. It is not born to meet someone's needs but to solve a common problem in society.",

Because dense transactions already have a slight delay when transacting, but they can still be used by those who are patient.",

Well thats really it is. Adjust to a higher transaction fee if its slow. If you cant take the transaction fee on btc, then pick an altcoin faster than it. There is so much plenty of choices with faster transaction. In terms of this, btc well isnt gonna much on transactions cause theres too much usage on btc network but if you shift to altcoin youll find it faster. Thats the truth about blockchain, the more uses a certain network, it becomes slower.",

It's a common problem on the bitcoin network, however, if you want to speed up your transactions, you can add gas (sats/byte) to your transactions.
