I then used $200 to purchase BTC (Bitcoin) and the remaining amount to treat my family to our favorite meals. At that time, I was eager to apply the theory of forgetting about an asset after purchasing it. So, I left it untouched until mid-2019, around June or July, only to discover that the price of BTC had dramatically increased by 80%. It felt like a stroke of luck, as I received unexpected financial gains, even though I hadn't anticipated it, since I already had sufficient savings at that time.I felt incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a high percentage of profit, even though the actual amount wasn't substantial.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on June 08, 2023, 10:30:44 AM- Have you bought any physical things/items with bitcoin?I once purchased a VPS (Virtual Private Server) for digital goods and bought a headset for tangible items.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on June 08, 2023, 10:30:44 AM- What do you normally use bitcoin for? and how often do you use bitcoin in your daily life?Since I bought and held onto it for a long time, I suppose I could consider it as a long-term investment.
