  "content": "I planned to ask this question a week ago, not that much time to check on the forum and I planned to let it drop till I saw it happening again,  and I'm starting to think it a more common occurrence that I'm being able to observe normally. It was stated numerous times that the best way to make sure a transaction is not reversed would be to wait for at last 6 confirmation, and I saw that Foundry managed twice to get six blocks in a row, like in this example (this was the first):and again yesterdayIf they managed to get that many in a row this open the possibility of an attack in vase they are hacked, one single individual could invalidate thousands of transaction on top of double spending his funds, dealing not only a financial blow but what I think worse a credibility blow to the network, so how can we make sure pools don't get so much power and convince miners to move to smaller pools to avoid concentration of power and ensure decentralization?Would there be possible to make a signalling service that would alert miners if a pool goes above 20% to switch to a lower hashrate one, much like in the days of GPU mining when you could switch the coins you were mining based on profits?",

The censoring wouldn’t be that transparent going forward. For example it will kind of migrate to even normal bitcoin transactions, censorship is pure decentralization so another option is to be seek rather than that. Even a single mining pool with large hashrate is a threat to decentralization too if they decide to censor transactions, the higher the power the higher chances of mining the next block of which means they are set to get new block faster than other miners which is bad if they censor transactions",

Anyway, double spend attack could be detected easily these days and news media eager to publish news about such attack. So i expect some miner would switch to different pool or the company halt their pool operational shortly after the attack has been detected.",
