For the record, I do find your choice of leagues suspicious.nothing suspicious, many of those bets were taken on Pinnacle, Singbet etc as well without any issues, they all paid fine. Besides, Ole7.io is not a bookmaker itself but an agent. A bettor don't place bets against Ole7.io, they place bets via Pinnacle/IM Markets. Ole7.io give you access to 2 thirdparty bookmakers. So it is Pinnacle/IM Markets who settle the bets, not Ole7.io. Pinnacle/IM settle my bets fine without issues. Ole7.io, instead of pay my winnings they confiscated my balance.  It is even stated in their terms that they are not a bookmaker but an intermediate: ''We provide betting intermediary services only and the Platform gives you access on an aggregated basis to sportsbooks operated by certain third party betting operators (“Bookmakers”). Each and every betting transaction (“Bet”) is between you and the Bookmakers only and the OLE Group is not, and will not, under any circumstances be a party to those Bets. The OLE Group does not act as, or hold itself out as, a bookmaker or betting operator.You understand that, by using the Platform, you authorize the OLE Group to deal with the Bookmakers on your behalf, including collecting monies and depositing monies with the Bookmakers on your behalf.''Since my bets were settle correctly from Pinnacle/IM Markets, it is obvious that OLE paid from bookmakers on mybehalf but they don't pay me!A bettor can place bets on any leagues he wants as long as bookies offered those bets with certain limits. I haven't bypassed their limits in any way. There is no wrong with that nor it is consider abnormal betting, suspicious betting etc. That's why they paid me dozen of times earlier while i was always placing bets on exotic leagues.Bets placed are defo not an issue, the issue is the profit. That's why they paid fine on first 3 months and they scammed me later. I was always betting on exotic leagues without issues. I took same competition bets on stake, nitrogen, betcoin, cloudbet, intertops, 5dimes etc, no issues at all. If they didn't liked me they had the choice to limit my account but pay my legitimate winnings first. They haven't did that though, they simply confiscated profit which is against industry standard. What happened here is obvious, they simply removed balance from account without proper explanation. Their live chat support only told some general accusations, their email support the same. Nothing more nothing less.",

Why you're making repeated bet on the same match? you're taking advantage because you see the team is high likely to win, a legit gambler will only put bet one time. Since I'm not a part of the casino, I can't make sure if you're using multi accounts or work with other groups, after all you did a mistake.You clearly got no idea what arbitrage is so better don't post false/nonse posts mate.What you describe is not arbitrage betting.IM markets offered by Ole7.io allows you to place bets double the size of the original bet limits.So when a bet has a limit of 22.04mbtc, you are free to bet a total of double that stake limit, hence i am allowed to bet 44.07,mbtc. They are the one who set the limits, not me. In no way i bet more that i was allowed.For example, in the Vietnam bet you highlighted, my first bet was 22mbtc. I was allowed to bet a total of 44mbtc. I ended up placing bets of 30mbtc in that game. This is not arbitrage and it is according to industry standards. My bets respected bookie limits all the times. If you look closely, you will see that first bet of 22mbtc was at odds 1.96. Then IM Markets lower the odds to 1.88/1.90 and they allow you to place same bet once again. It is normal procedure for asia betting style.Pinnacle on the other hand allows you to rebet as many times as you want, they only change the odds with each rebet. So a selection may have 5mbtc limit but you are free to rebet 3-4-5 times for a total of 25mbtc etc. Pinnacle will lower the odds with each bet though.If you are not sure what arbitrage is, better don't post comments that may mislead someone",

However, betting businesses can reinforce the process of revealing arbers by implementing AML/KYC procedures.The one who wrote this got no clue about what arbitrage is. Arbitrage betting is a gambling strategy that involves calculating all possible results of an event and placing bets on each.Thus, bettors guarantee a profit by making every outcome win for them. It is written in the arlicle you posted as well. The parameters you mentioned are only valid if a guarantee profit is expected, which is not the case with my bets.As i already told you, in asia you can rebet normally as many times as you want, bookmaker only change the odds each time. You can ask anyone who bet in asia to confirm if you don't believe me.Can post you a dozens of thousands of bets paid from giants like Pinnacle, Sportmarket etc but it seems you will continue ignoring what industry standards are.I am pretty sure you never bet with asian bookmakers, otherwise you would already know that what you described is the common procedure. Don't want to make this topic a conversation about what arbitrage is etc. You have your opinion which is defo wrong. There are plenty of 3rd party mediators. If Ole7.io believes that i broke their rules in any way, we can follow the case to one of those 3rd party mediators.Hope i am wrong but I am pretty sure that Ole7.io will not accept my proposal which is 100% fair for both parties.",
