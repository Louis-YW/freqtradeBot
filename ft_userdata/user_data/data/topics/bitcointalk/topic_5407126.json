  "content": "As the title says, I tagged 16 accounts of cheaters who were found guilty of cheat multiple campaigns based on evidence. Some worries come and they start asking because it looks like the tag is bad or overkills. It's about high ranking accounts [Full member - Sr - Hero Member] who got caught cheating in multiple campaigns, and based on the evidence I found then I really think they deserve a red tag.Quote from: igehhh on July 19, 2022, 07:45:01 PMNot saying same thing happened here but this COULD be the case in the accounts below, I believe that painting red is overkill! I expected to see a bunch of newbies farming, but this is different. You might also want to slowdown buddy, you've been painting a lot lately.Quote from: BITCOIN4X on July 19, 2022, 08:45:53 PM_BlackStar, I don't know how you linked all of the above accounts as cheates and stabbed every single one of their ass with a red pen, that's something awful to see in my opinion. Some of the accounts are from the local Indonesian community and this is really sad for me to watch.Quote from: rozak on July 20, 2022, 07:54:53 AMthe red tag you provided seems overkill. all accounts do have the same transaction pattern. but that doesn't provide solid evidence for the red tag you provided.Did I make mistake?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403462.msg60595420#msg60595420",

Some worries come and they start asking because it looks like the tag is bad or overkills.I find your Reference link to be far from convincing: I checked arifteguhr, for which your Reference link shows 2 shitcoin addresses and a link to their profile. It doesn't show where they posted the addresses, and your evidence doesn't make clear where it came from.That's one of the reasons I don't like checking Ethereum or other centralized shitcoins on block explorers: it's often used to dump a list of addresses and/or a link to block explorers, without explaining the details. So I can't really review the evidence without digging myself, which I don't want to do.I don't really care about shitposters \"cheating\" spam campaigns. The real problem is that those money grabbing schemes are designed to take money from gullible greedy \"investors\", and they've taken billions of dollars that way already! So if anything, all of them should be tagged for spamming their massive scams, but that's not going to happen. Now you're tagging the little guy, while the rich masterminds behind those massive scams just keep getting richer. I'm pretty sure the spam campaigns don't care about \"cheaters\" either, all they care about is cheap publicity to scam massive amounts of money.TL;DR: it's futile. Many people are going to get scammed.",

Perhaps, the user has used ânew addressâ as a middleman so that no one can link those accounts directly. I hope you guys will find some direct evidence of those accounts connection. I appreciate your efforts.Why do you think so, did you try to do more research from the above transactions? You have to find out some direct connection between those accounts before giving them negative feedback based on the current investigation. In this case, the main wallet (or collector wallet) still holding 5+ BNB on it. If all of those accounts belongs to the same person then he wouldn't hold the BNB which is in the main wallet now. It could be a collector wallet who is buying those coins and holding the BNB.",

The evidence you get is not entirely reliable as a compelling reason to negative tag all of those accounts. I agree that you should probably consider neutral tags or nothing until you find valid evidence. There has to be solid evidence to be able to confirm that all of these accounts deserve a red tag, so I believe you should revise the tag until you can prove them guilty.On this forum it's actually really nice to have users who can contribute like you. I think you are a user who is starting to be recognized for your contributions either in the forum as a spam buster or maybe a cheat hunter, but honestly being a fair forum judge or cop is tough.

But if it's a legal matter, your position as plaintiff and some of the reported users is that of a defendant.Just like in court you present evidence and charges against the convicted plaintiff. So it's up to the judge to decide according to the considerations and evidence attached. Here what is meant by the judge is the community or DT members who ultimately decide to provide a deterrent effect. At first, I assumed you were in a hurry to flag them with a red flag.It's actually not wrong, it's just that what if you wait for the public's reaction first? Do not let you report and immediately give a red tag. Is there a plaintiff serving as a judge in the same case?",
