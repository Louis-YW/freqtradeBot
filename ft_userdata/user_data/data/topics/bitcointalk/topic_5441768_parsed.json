The ones who run the bounties, for example, are the ones who don't need other jobs. Once you think about it from that perspective and seek to offer your services to these altcoins wherever you can fit in, you'll go up a few levels in what you can earn.",

Diving into full-time crypto bounty hunting sounds tempting, but it's a bit like riding a suicide especially if you already have a full time job. The market's all over the place and relying solely on bounties could be risky. Maybe test the waters part-time, keep a steady income elsewhere and see how it goes before going all in. If you really are certain that you want to do it and you already have enough saving , go try",
