  "content": "I am active on this project since 2014 yes the site already exists since 2014 but they just release their own token for their hundreds of thousands of followers, you can earn points by following, liking tweeting, and following social media accounts, and those points can be converter to their own token after a month through their airdrop system, the more active you are the more chances of getting more of their tokens through their monthly airdrop.You can also use these points if you don't want to convert them to their own token to gain more followers and likes for your social media account, or you can sell them to their own marketplace.The token is already in Coinmarketcap in Pancakeswap go check it out  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/addmefast/They have a referral program but I opted to post it here without a referral link.",

I find it a complete waste of time but for the others if they want to gain more followers and also wanted to earn some token it's suit them but just like I said, you will need to work more on this.Btw, isn't buying followers are the same just like this?

It can help users to earn free tokens by engaging on social media but does investors would be interested in thatvkind of service? Maybe for hype it can be but in the long run, only few would be interested with it. There are better ways to earn but associating with a token, usually its not stay for long. Ive seen other platforms like this and end up dying.",

IMO, for the platform to grow fast, they will heed to introduce more use cases for the token such as staking, trading it in more exchanges, etc. that will benefit users. They have the advantage of good followership, so they have more chances of members keying into such projects which will eventually earn more value for the token as well as members of the platform.",

But here we are talking about crypto and also the advantages of it.With very small volume and poor utility, I think this project will be stuck only as a platform for exchanging traffic, it is impossible for investors to benefit from this, because the ecosystem and utility are very limited.",

However, we must calculate if such offers worth, because just like bounty campaigns, you might be being paid in thin air for your promoting job.Personally, I think payments for such tasks should be made in btc or a solid altcoin which we know their real value. It's strange they have to create their own token to pay users, besides being unnecessary.But since you said they are alive and operating for 8 years already, may I ask how much have you profited with this site so far? And how much is it possible to make in a daily basis?",
