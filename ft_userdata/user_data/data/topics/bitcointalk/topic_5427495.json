Take note that even \"whales\" that attempt to manipulate markets can also lose money.Also, no \"whale\" owns 51% of the total supply. Most of the wallets with huge bitcoin holdings(though definitely nothing close to 51%) are exchange cold wallets.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on December 09, 2022, 09:15:30 AMif happen, does decentralization not exist?Bitcoin is proof of work, not proof of stake. So even if a single person held a huge chunk of Bitcoin, that wouldn't give him special powers over the protocol.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp",

Whales can't own upto 51% of BTC,if not it is going to mess the purpose of BTC which is decentralized system,they can own like 10-15%. That's is why they can control the price at that moment because if they choose to sell,the price drops and if they are buying more to their investment it can lead to increase in BTC price.",

We're all here for the money and whales just like us. If they can control half of the bitcoins, then bitcoin is no longer decentralized, and it will be easy for them to manipulate the bitcoin price in their favor. If that happens, it will jeopardize the market as a whole rather than something good to boost the market. Like we're talking about ETH becoming so centralized because sharks largely hold it.Currently, despite not owning 51% of the total supply, some whales can still manipulate the price of bitcoin but that may not last long but enough for them to make a profit.",

I think you have to separate between price movement and coin distribution to some extent if you want to talk about market manipulation. You also need to specify what kind of decentralization are you talking about since the network is definitely not controlled by some whales.Back to market manipulation. Even if you only control 5% of the coins but the market is not that liquid, you can still manipulate the price to your own liking. I sold some shitcoin in the past, and the price move nearly 50% after I did that. If the volume/demand is high, that might not happen. Can this happen to Bitcoin? Probably. Even if it does, as long as the network is still fine, you should not worry too much. Unless of course what you really focused on is the price and you want to get profits asap",
