      "body": "It is not out of the ordinary for cryptocurrency to be accepted in occasions. It is even more common when the people having the occasions know about cryptocurrency and understand that some of the people coming too who are on the guest list know and use bitcoins. Our government has banned spraying of the naira in occasions in the country, many people who have occasions and understand that spraying money adds more color to events have settled for alternatives like printing their own money that people will buy with real cash on the day of the occasion to spray, others know that for people who do not like to show off by spraying, bank account numbers are made available for transfer, and wallet address for other category of people who will prefer to make direct transactions to the wallet of the people who have the occasion without needing to convert it to fiat in a process that can become stressful and discouraging.There will be more occasions where cryptocurrency will be accepted as support.",

There is joy in fatherhood and motherhood more especially when the couple's are youths in their prime age. Your initiative is a welcome development just as you have said,  it would be more easier for the couple's as they understand their existing protocol and the caliber of friends they have who are into Crypto.  In Nigeria, the youths are more into Crypto because they understand the Dynamics of change and innovation and they also see the direction of the pendulum and where it is heading to.",

Send us here a proof or evidence also the addresses the coins were sent for is to trace the transaction, don't think that we are fool here to accept every crypto stories emanating from users. Tell us the date of the ceremony then the addresses, we will find out the rest. The lies here is getting out of hands. If it is true provide the above. There was no need of bringing your sister birth celebration to the forum. Those are sacred issue and not for public announcements if not there are lot of people that have such celebrations every day. Just need proof.",
