I create this thread because most of the brand and newbies do not know the meaning of bitcontalk except the alt.accts. So let see how it is. BTCBitcointalk is a bitcoin forum in which users discuss bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies matters in daily basis. It is the highest informative  forum in blockchain. It is an open source discussion platform on blockchain. The domain bitcointalk.org was founded by Sirius, who was also known as Martti Malmi, after when Satoshi developed bitcoin. The forum was left for theymos  to administered. Therefore, users are arguing that theymos is one the develpers of bitcoin. Because one can not manage a domain very well as he is doing if he didn't partake in the process. A question came,  how does he get the password to login to edit the site?What is SMF?Bitcointalk.org was created with an open source software called Simple Machine Forum or SMF.  Source: click here",

I create this thread because most of the brand and newbies do not know the meaning of bitcontalk except the alt.accts. So let see how it is. There are different sources. Actually you might find it different due to title probably but if you look into the content, its the same like explaining what is bitcointalk about. This is a common topic and surely many have their own info or thread about forum. If you are looking or using the search function make sure to use the forum search to see the posted threads about your keyword, can do Google but it will show you all sources.",

      "body": "I’d read through the links provided on this thread on  general history of the bitcoin forum and build-up from there, using forum’s inner information to get a better composition of the history (see how xtraelv used to create topics to depict historical events rather thoroughly).Mentioning SMF as the forum’s base software is a lateral point, but I’d expand to finding out more on the matter: why was it chosen?, why are we stalled on an ancient version?, why is there a request on Meta (created a long time ago) for developers to create a new forum software?, what were the requirements?, what that lead to, what is Epochtalk?, were are we now?, etc. I’m not asking these questions now, but rather questions that help conceptualize the lateral subtopic of the forum’s software.",

      "body": "Actually, it was satoshi nakamoto who (what I will say) is the founder of Bitcointalk forum since satoshi nakamoto did have SourceForge forum before Bitcointalk according to wiki (wiki article is kind of terrible by theymos)and the forum is lost but Sirius owned the domain name. Satoshi then tested Bitcointalk first which you can find a thread discussing about it before it is accessible to non-moderator forum users and sirius is the head admin until theymos became the admin running Bitcointalk effectively (see quote) Why anyone didn't mention this?. Maybe it's not the entire truth, forgot to mention it or as what theymos describes it?.Quote from: theymos on April 09, 2019, 05:05:22 AMIt's surprising how well-documented history can become totally forgotten... Satoshi created the forum on Nov 22, 2009, and was head administrator until almost 2011. Then Sirius was head administrator until 2012, which is when I took over.Cobra also owns the bitcointalk.org domain name. I consider the forum to be basically owned by or at least dedicated to the Bitcoin community, though; I don't call anyone an owner of the forum.That wiki article is kind of terrible...",
