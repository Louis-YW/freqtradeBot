However, i cannot find a way to import the wallet to Electrum. I have the mnemonic and descriptors. If i cannot use Electrum, is there any other way i can speed up the transaction using bitcoin core wallet or ordinal? Thanks very much for any help!",

      "body": "The problem is that wallets that are not supporting RBF do not flag transactions as RBF. So if you import the seed phrase on a wallet that support RBF, it would still be impossible to pump the fee of the transaction because the transaction do not support RBF. But you can go for CPFP which is an indirect means to pump the fee, but in a way you will pay for 2 transactions (the child and the parent transactions).In case of next time, read these two topics that can be helpful:Wallets supporting TaprootBitcoin open source wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF)",

There is another way to speed up transactions except for the suggestion above but it depends on your transaction if the TX fee is above 10k sat.Here's the tool- https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/If it's below 10k sat you won't be able to use the free service there is a paid version that allows below 10k sat but it's a bit expensive and not worth it if the amount you transact is low.",

The 10,000 satoshi isn't the absolute fee. OP has surely used lower transaction fee rate and won't be able to use ViaBTC free service. If OP had used the fee rate of 10 sat/byte or more, the transaction would have been confirmed by now normally. Currently, 3 sat/vbyte is enough for a fast transaction.",

What wallet did you use?, If have descriptors, that possible did you to use bitcoin core, where have the option to choose the p2tr address at the beginning? But, bitcoin core doesn't support importing mnemonics seed, the best solution for you is Sparrow wallet.If not urgent, just wait a couple of days, because I experienced sent with 3 satoshi fees a few days ago and received between a days.And next, better for you use default address (bech32) than p2tr, because you still newbie, that p2tr is applied science, not many people have experience with it.",

The first CPFP that you can do is to tell the recipient if possible, that he should spend the unconfirmed transaction and use a fee that is enough to get both your transaction and the unconfirmed transaction that he spends to be confirmed at once. Both transaction would be confirmed. But the one I am telling you is a little different which you can do by yourself. Let me explain better. Assuming that you have 1 BTC that someone sent you, if you send 0.6 BTC in a transaction, there will be a change address UTXO that would be sent back to your wallet. If the transaction is not confirmed, you can decide to spend part or the 0.4 BTC and use a fee that is enough to get 2 transactions confirmed as I explained above. With this, the child (second) transaction has enough fee, the first (parent) transaction will be confirmed along with first transaction because miners can not first mine the child transaction before the parent transactions. The fee you used for the child transaction is enough for two transactions and this will encourage the miner that mine the block to include both the parent and the child transaction to be mined at once.",

Electrum can only import TapRoot Address to create a watching-only wallet. (for now)With that, you can perform CPFP/RBF if it's possible but since it's lacking private key,it'll only create an unsigned PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transaction).I'm not using Ordinal wallet, but if it supports psbt import, try that by exporting the \"bump\" transaction created by Electrum.But AFAIK, it needs more than just the address to properly create a TapRoot transaction, so chances that it cannot be signed is high.Warning: if the transaction that you want to RBF is NFT-related, do not perform RBF on it or you might mess-up your NFT.",

But if possible that you are spending bitcoin and the transaction have change address UTXO (I mean a change back on your wallet), you can use part of the change address UTXO to create another transaction in a way that would be enough to make two transactions confirmed at a time. Your initial transaction is the parent while the new transaction is the child transaction.Mempool is at 200 sat/vbytes. For the child transaction, you can set it to 400 sat/vbyte. You can not use 50 sat to create a transaction. At least, you will use around 111 sat which is 1 sat/vbyte as fee, but the mempool is not accept such low fee now. Check the fee you used very well, it can not be that low.",
