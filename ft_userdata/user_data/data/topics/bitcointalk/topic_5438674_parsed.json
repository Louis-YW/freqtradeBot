Just so, if it goes offline your data remains safe.In the case of LastPass's recent data breach, it is not enough to just migrate your vault to an offline place or some other password manager. All your passwords and other sensitive information became accessible, albeit in encrypted form, to whoever conducted that hacker attack, which means in the long run, if the master passphrase you have set up was too weak, you can safely assume that all your passwords have already been compromised. So, it is usually pointless to re-use an old vault since all the passwords it contains have potentially been compromised. I suggest the following solution: login to websites on which you have accounts using LastPass, change your passwords one by one, inserting them in a more reliable password with a randomly generated master password. It will take some time, but it is more secure than simply using your old passwords in a new manager.",

Just so, if it goes offline your data remains safe.Should use bitwarden or keepass as mk4 mentioned instead of lastpass, lastpass can be said to be the worst password manager app with many attacks in the past. I am also using bitwarden, but just to create and save regular passwords, passwords related to bank accounts should not be saved here, especially never save private keys here. Although these apps haven't been hacked like lastpass, there's no guarantee they won't be hacked in the future.",

What security if you can't access your own data in first place?",
