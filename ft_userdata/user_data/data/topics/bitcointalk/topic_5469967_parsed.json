After that, I tried other websites on signatures and got the same privacy error. I scanned my PC for viruses using windows security feature but it didn’t solve the issue either. I tried restarting my PC, I turned off content restriction from my router and browser, I tried changing DNS, but it still didn’t fix the issue.Here are all the images.I think every website has different privacy security errors.Read and help me fix this error if you have faced this type of error before.",

Try using a different browser and see if there are any difference, if that doesn't happen then there's a possibility that it's an ISP thing and you might have to contact them.",

You can't access stake.com, I will suggest you to try all of the other mirror links from this site https://playstake.io/, let's see what you got. I don't think your browser is the problem except you intentionally restrict those sites.",

Maybe your internet network is blocking access to the Roobet site so you get a notification like that when you visit that address. My country prohibits gambling activities so I have often seen things like that. Try using a VPN from a country where gambling is legal, it usually works fineIf you have used a VPN and are still experiencing the same error, perhaps the Roobet site is experiencing problems or may be undergoing repairs.Edit:I tried visiting the Roobet site using Singapore VPN and everything seemed fine",

      "body": "I've actually experienced a problem like this, but I usually do the DNS settings and then I can access it again, but you have done the DNS settings but still can't access it, actually you can find out first what the cause is, it could be that your ISP is blocking you, try using it. Can a VPN access it, if it can, it means your ISP is blocking gambling sites.Another way you can detect it is by using your cell phone browser with the same ISP as your computer. If it can be accessed on your cell phone but not on the computer, it means there is a problem with your computer, sometimes clock problems on the computer often also make the security display like that or maybe you are using private browsing from brave browser, try using another browser and make sure it is updated, hopefully your problem can be solved, I'm just saying it's not a virus",

My windows update is ongoing for now, I will update this thread after a restart...... and also I have asked to other indian members that they are also facing this issue or not waiting for reply.....Have you tried checking if there is any new anti-virus that was installed recently in your system or activated only in your browser? Because most of the time, some anti-virus programmes block some specific sites from being accessed in your system unless you authorise it. Or it could also be as a result of your PC location being changed by some third-party app, where the current location might appear to be in a gambling-restricted location, as it appears to work anytime you connect a VPN to the system and change your location. After the window update, if the issue still continues, I will advise you to run some diagnostics on your PC to see if there is any recent change that was done on your PC, either by you unknowingly or by a third-party app. I guess that might also help.",

You can try to access the gambling sites on another device and see if it would work. The issue is strange to me and I have never seen it before which might make me not have information about it.",

It can be frustrating if a gambler is not able to access all the gambling sites that he is using. It is good that you can access the gambling sites again.
