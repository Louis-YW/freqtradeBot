  "content": "We're launching the Obscuro testnet over the next few weeks and thought I'd get the word out here!Obscuro is a layer 2 roll-up built on Ethereum. It's like the other L2s out there (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc) in that it massively scales Ethereum, but Obscuro is also an encrypted L2.It allows smart contracts to have private and public states. Think of a game of Poker as a smart contract. Cards on the table are public, and cards in the player's hands need to be private. Obscuro lets you do this in Solidity. No new languages or frameworks to learn, and no new wallets, it's 100% EVM.There will be various incentive schemes in place for testnet and it'd be great to have you guys involved.",
