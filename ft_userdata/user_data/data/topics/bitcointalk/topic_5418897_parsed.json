Bitcoin would thrive regardless and would need a platform for exchange.",

Or you meant the CBDCs which are still new and more countries are planning to create their own. CBDBs are fiat and nothing more than being fiat. Fiat and bitcoin are completely different, bitcoin is just an alternative and people adopted it more which makes its price to be increasing and now seen as a means of investment.Crypto exchanges depend on cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin does not depend on exchanges. You do not have to use any exchange before purchasing bitcoin.",

However, when digital money is globally accepted, would there still be a need for cryptocurrency exchanges? Any thoughts on this?First of all, CBDCs don't matter much in the equation, they are just another representation of fiat.Now, sooner or later Bitcoin will most probably get accepted everywhere as payment. Of course, most businesses will still receive fiat, since that's how they pay taxes and for the merchandise. So a conversion will be done.In the same way as now, if you pay in US with an EU card, VISA, MasterCard or your bank will automatically convert from EUR to USD. But if you don't want them do the conversion (because of the higher fees), you can go to an exchange office and get yourself USD for your trip.This will happen with bitcoin too. If you want to do the conversion yourself, or you want to buy more bitcoin from your fiat salary, you'll use an exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange.Then, in the same way people and businesses play on Forex, they do play and will continue playing on crypto exchanges.So while I expect many of those will become huge businesses, offering also banking, loaning and many other things, some others may even merge with banks, crypto exchanges will remain, in a way or another, offering their services to everybody.",

Absolutely!First, for their main purpose you ills till needed exchanges to change fiat into coins, this will be on for a long long time, as nobody sees fiat getting replaced any time soon, not in a few decades' time at least.Second, the main business of CEXs now it's no longer just people exchanging their coins for fiat or the other way around but constant trading just as fx markets.So no, nothing is threatening CEXs anytime soon, they will most likely prosper for quite a while, especially since some have started using them as wallets, they offer debit cards linked to your account, interest accounts, and many other ways of making you lose money for their profits.But now, thinking this over, you as an exchange owner are asking yourself this truly, or you're just doing this to promote yourself?",

We're not seeing crypto die due to fiat, I hardly doubt a digital version of one would do much. We haven't even seen much adoption of crypto itself and exchanges are already prospering, so I reckon we're going to see exchanges last quite a long time before it dies out (if it ever will). Exchanges also serve as trading platforms for other coins, it's more like an investment hub now, a market for buying and selling. You can simply look at digital fiat as credit card #1, and Bitcoin as credit card #2 really, they wouldn't really have that many conflicts, if any at all.",

However, when digital money is globally accepted, would there still be a need for cryptocurrency exchanges? Any thoughts on this?Cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to operate normally because they are the tool that governments utilize to control the flow of cryptocurrency assets. When Bitcoin becomes a widely-accepted medium of exchange, the need for flow control is going to increase even more. There will be two types of Bitcoin: a \"clean\" version and a \"tainted\" version. Please note, however, that given that bitcoin is as fungible as any other \"hard\" asset, any division is highly subjective and based only on the fact from which source a particular chunk of bitcoin has come. If it is coming from a regulated cryptocurrency exchange, it will be considered good even if it has had connections with criminal activity. However, if it comes from individuals who participate in anonymous peer-to-peer exchanges, it will automatically be deemed criminal money, even if there were no such connections.",

This will only emphasize the need for crypto exchanges. Also, exchanges aren't only used to trade between fiat currencies and bitcoin, you can also use it to trade with other altcoins. That's another use-case for exchanges that I think will only help it stay even if bitcoin/crypto gains the upper hand against fiat.",

Any thoughts on this?I believe that there will undoubtedly be crypto currency exchanges in the world of the future. The question is, what will it look like? I suppose that most likely, some exchanges will cease to exist, while others will change. For example, Binance is already developing in many directions and includes various functions, providing different services to its users. This is already a kind of multi-platform. Perhaps the largest exchanges will become something like this and will expand their areas of activity. In any case, those exchanges that will not adapt to changes in the world and to the demand of their users will simply cease to exist.",

Even though adoption is widely spared, exchange are still there to produce volatility and trading for different tokens and coins. This is their primarily used and I dont see it gone even a global massive adoption happened.Also in addition, there are other projects thry wanted to claim or get hold of their asset which isnt on other exchange so the demand on using it still valid.",

The smaller places may not be able to handle what they need. Same goes the other way, MegaBank will let me open an account with them, but I will not get the personalized service I get from some small local place. There will be more regulations as time goes on, but once again for the exchanges, adapt or die.-Dave",

They are not interconnected and structurally different. So let's not mix these two things. I believe that cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrency with the fiat. If in future we see that bitcoin is accepted in 90% of the business establishments, then we probably would not need exchanges that much, but for now, it is one of the most important players in the crypto ecosystem.",
