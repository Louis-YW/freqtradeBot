  "content": "Parenting go along way to affect children's life styles, the community and the society in large. Most country suffer violence due to bad parenting, friend influence and environment factor. But in most cases good parenting may help to overcome other factors earlier mentioned. Imagine when children are abandoned at home without proper care while parents worked, gambled or partied. Such children will have no choice than to later indulge in some criminal act to sustain their life. Such children pick up any life style they want since there isn't anyone to correct their bad behavior. Children deserve to be put first. They shouldn't be worked around mummy's or daddy's more important schedule. Good parenting doesn't stop in providing things for the children. It also includes:ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Being a good listener.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Keep eye on whatsoever they do and give advice when necessaryðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Direct their career path. These doesn't mean you should impose a career on them. Study them to know what they are good at to direct them on the career to choose. One always strive easily when one choose what he loves doing most as ones career.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Teach them the various norms of the societyðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Teach them about your culture.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Creat the fear of God in them.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Try all what you can to make them happy. Let them see their home as the best. Although some parent claim being poor is the cause of their bad parenting. Everyone in the society can't be rich. You can give the best to your children with the little you have. Let's train our children well as they are the future leaders of our country.ConclusionLet's give our children all they need from us as a parent. Only make few babies that you can avoid to offer your being and time. Good parenting have great influence on our children, society, country and the whole world at large.",

They would always be a first priority but the levels to the up bringing and care for a child differs. Some could account due to lack of resources, some could arise base on the relationship between child's mum and dad, not excluding the circumstances to which the child was conceived (which is of no fault of the child) and others counts for children that aren't biologically related to us.In the real sense, every child is your child. Because, they tend to learn from you when you can and if you willing and ready to teach to them. Children grow withÂ  a sense of respect for elders and authority but, when the training is lacking, you see rather societal insecure youth. Mostly, the fault on adults who turned a blind eye.",

The biggest threat is the media that bombard children with unnecessary information, commercials, sex and violence from the early days. If you don't buy them a phone they'll watch videos with their friends who have phones and also blame you for not allowing them to be like their friends. What are they going to watch? Kids on TikTok drinking detergents and eating bugs, people getting out of their cars to dance or recording themselves with their phones while driving and showing off their expensive clothes and homes. I have no idea how to stop my kid from being exposed to this and at the same time not to keep her in a cage.",

      "body": "You tried for the article but you still need a very long way to go concerning parenting and bringing up a child. This topic you create is bigger than your thoughts. But you tried. Let me break it down small for you though I can also tell you everything but just small.First of all. Who is a responsible parent? A responsible parent is the parent that provides all the Social needs to their children. Even not all, at least 85%.Â  Mostly the basic needs in the family. Shelter, food, clothes. Those are the primary needs in any family. Then the secondary needs are education, skill, and provision of job if possible. But one thing we must know, a child destiny is with the child. The parents has nothing to do with the way the child will become they can only guide the child to grow up with a good character. There is a saying in education. I can't really remember the author name but it is in a educational curriculum text book and it says \"your destiny is in your hands, the way you want your life to be that is how it will be\". Therefore, you don't have to blame parents for the down fall of their children. That is how they want their life to be. There is a book (a novel) called \"Without a Silver Spoon\". And that book explain that nobody come to this world with a silver spoon.",

Rather it should be to the number of ones capabilities. Our grandparents where able to take care of more than 20 children. Although times have change but there are still people that could easily take care of 10+ children. Moreover some of us wouldn't have been birthed if it had stopped at number 3",

No need to go back.The fear of God is the most important part of life-training, for everyone.Since God created everything, He has control of everything. He works for people and their freedom, in perfect ways that match how people think of Him, and whatever relationship they have with Him.The best and greatest thing God does for people is to offer them eternal life in Heaven. Everything else is secondary.It's time for all people to consciously recognize that God exists, and to learn about Him and His love that He has for all people. Fear or threat of loss is nothing compared with the joys of Heaven that will be gained... through respectfully and properly acknowledging God.",
