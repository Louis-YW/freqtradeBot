  "content": "Loan amount : 0.07 BTCDuration : 60 daysRepayment on/before : 18th of July 2023Repayment amount : 0.0735 BTCLoan reason : Salary DeductionSource of repayment : Salary (+half year premium)BTC Address: bc1q5frmk2zwqct2jdjcdpkyfxgp5chu0eeanran6xFirst of all I just giving it a try because I just found this forum. I graduated in electrical engineering and currently working as an automation engineer (PLC programing). I fucked up something in work back in February and therefore i got salary deduction for 6 months which ends next month, so I will get full salary on July. I was like okey no problem I can handle this, but currently it looks like I'm running out of money and because of the deduction I can not even apply for loan at my local banks because I do not have the proper salary for it.I am a bit desperate and I'm just giving it a try so take it easy on me please.I'm able to provide any information about myself to prove that I am not joking around. Even if this Loan request fails, please tell me what should I do, to be trustful for all of you guys.Best Regards,Patrik",

It's impossible and i suggest you look for other alternatives if your situation is genuine.Quote from: PPatrik97 on May 18, 2023, 12:12:33 AMEven if this Loan request fails, please tell me what should I do, to be trustful for all of you guys.You managed to make it through February, March, April and May. Then I don't think June and July will surely be a problem. Just hang in there and the remaining to months will be gone before you realize it.The Bonus is when you get your full salary, you will wholly enjoy it without having to worry about a certain loan to repay.",

You realized that treating one's employee like this (no matter how bad they fucked up,) is illegal in just about every civilized country?  It doesn't matter anyway, because it's nothing but a bullshit sob-story no one believes.",

Also I will not take any loan I had to think about for a few weeks.DireWolfM14 You are probably living in some kind of dream world. Such situations do exist and as I wrote I have proof. Not that I'm trying to prove anything to you, it's sad that you're saying it's a bullshit sob-story that no one believes.Thanks to everyone who has at least posted advice or just encouraging things here!!",
