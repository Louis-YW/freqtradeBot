  "content": "I have these friends which perhaps I refer to as \"economic friends\" of  mine, perhaps may be due to how out paths crossed. we met few years back when I had a work to be done and was in search of persons with the right skills to deliver such service within a framed period, and since then we have had a warm friendly relativeness.Unknown to me that the few moments  these guys have being paying me some visits  at my workplace or home they had at different intervals observed how am always spending some part of my day on a daily on the bitcointalk forum to either just read other users threads, make comments if necessary or at times create a thread of mine. And so have developed interest and had asked me to introduce to them what's it's all about and that they would want to get involved too, of which I was glad to see them show some interest but the challenge am having about the whole stuff is that they don't have digital literacy not even a foundation I can build on, as they are just these local craft skilled workers who have only but engaged almost all their life into their area of skill.For days now, I have exhaustively given explanations to them about what the forum is all about and how it works. Even clearly establishing to them to the extent I know about Bitcoin currency and how the system operates but seems like I was speaking to them in a different language, one that's confusing entirely. And I currently don't know any means to use in explaining to them what I know.Based on the idea of bringing Bitcoin awareness to everyone's doorstep so as to  encourage popular and widespread a acceptance, I then felt the need to bring this challenge am facing to the forum, so maybe other users can proffer ways or possible strategies someone like me can employ to explicitly educate to the understanding of these friends of mine that have no digital literacy but have developed interest to know what I know  For it's currently giving me a lot of concern!",

      "body": "Over the years, i've given up on explaining technical stuff to non-technical users that basically just want to use a technology.It's no use to explain to somebody how (for example) firefox is open source, and show them how you can patch said code and compile it... they just want a browser to look at [insert url here].In my IRL job, i'm pretty sure not even the developers or power users know what OS their SAP instance is running on, let alone which relational database. They just don't care.. They want to start their pre-configured developement environment and start writing code, they don't care if SLES 15 SP3 is end of support in x months, or that hana 2.00.62.00 contains a bug and needs to be upgraded to 2.00.63.00. If they come to me, it's because their development tools showed an error, or their code compiles to slow, and they want me to fix it without telling them what i'm fixing, or why i'm fixing something.Same with bitcoin: if your friends are interested in crypto, it's very possible they're interested in USING it, not in the technical background. In this case, i'd just explain them the difference between a custodial and non-custodial wallet, explain them they can never ever give away their recovery seed or private key, make sure they have a safe setup, explain to them that transactions are irreversible and they cannot invest money they're not willing to lose... And that's about it (i guess).If they are interested in the technical background, i'd probably guide them to a beginners book or simple youtube video instead of trying to re-invent the wheel. Very smart people have invested tons of their time to write good books and make informative videos... No need to re-iterate stuff they have already presented in a newbie-friendly way.Once they're on board with using crypto and they've read a couple of books/watched a couple of videos, they can always come to you with very specific questions.",

Stick only to the basics, learning about bitcoin should be just like learning about how to work with a computer or a smart phone for the first time. You don't know what code is being executed on your device's CPU or how it is executed, so you also don't know what happens behind the scene when you click the \"send\" button in your bitcoin wallet or how mining works, etc.",

You should get all levels of answers, some technical some not. (of course, you should search first if that question was already asked, to avoid some harsh answers too). They've already seen you using the forum, let's use it for their benefit too.",

They are the product of the wrong teaching about Bitcoin,I know the feeling... I regret telling one of my (technical) colleagues about my bitcoin hobby. Every time the local newspaper prints an article on how bitcoin's price is going down, he just comes to my desk with a big smirk on his face telling me my \"magic internet money\" is based on thin air and i'll lose every penny i invested (if the prices rise he just keeps quiet).So far, i guess about ~20 ish of my friends, family members and collegues know i'm a crypto user (which isn't to bad since i've been in the community for ~8 years and i've switched jobs and citys during this time). Except from the one collegue who is jealous of the fact that i've made some profit and is constantly repeating every bad news article he reads (ignoring all other articles about crypto), nobody has ever shown any intrest.... and that's ok....",

I sit at my computer and refuse to go to work, and I really don't want to reveal my work to anyone, even if they are close. Then when they see that I'm rich enough to buy a lot of things and they admire me, they want to know why I got it, and it still seems a bit of a skepticism because they don't know what I'm doing to earn it. They are still curious that I can be richer than them, and they do not accept my learning to become happy. People always take pride in their small knowledge and look at other small things as if they are big. I sometimes wonder if in each of our lives that need a change that is not directed toward learning, it will be difficult to enter into the things that we dream of.",

People like Mr. Satoshi are indeed not ever going to sell their coins and we also know a lot of dead wallets as well.

For starters, they need to be able to surf the net and tell them about internet safety.Then invite them to the forum if you write that they are interested in it. Teach them the rules and let them communicate with everyone on the forum. Practice is always better than theory. Everything takes time.And only after everyone has matured, having read the information on the forum, and having received help from you, will people be able to approach the practice of bitcoin. In my opinion, these are very cautious, not hasty steps. By asking your friends, you will understand that people understand how to ask and about what I think many here on the forum will also be happy to help your friends plunge into the world of cryptography.The main thing is not to rush.",

If they are technologically illiterate to the point which they can't even use Paypal, Venmo then you would have to teach them those first. Having to use or adopt Bitcoin does not necessarily mean that you have to understand all the nitty gritty details and it definitely doesn't mean that they would have to engage in any conversations about Bitcoin within the forum either. So long as there is an application that allows them to use Bitcoin like Paypal or basically any other payment processor, then they would be fine.
