While this forum has plenty of capable scambusters and its not easy for a scam to go unnoticed (at least not for a longer period of time), its important to mention that scams are not moderated here meaning scammers aren't banned, no matter the evidence so I would suggest you to thread carefully.Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 13, 2022, 06:21:40 AMI hope you all won't get tired of my questions. Thank you allAsking the right question is often more important than pretending to know it all (common newbie mistake). And yeah, welcome to bitcointalk .",

Which at least shows that the OP has some sort of interest to learn, or some left over from their initial contact with Bitcoin. Whichever it is, it's good seeing a newbie who has interest in actually learning about Bitcoin and not just looking for what bounty to join in or how to rank up.OP, you should also interact after making a thread. It's not enough to start a thread and then move to start another, follow discussions on open conversations and lock threads when you have gotten your answer.",
