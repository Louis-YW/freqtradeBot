With how the price of bitcoin has been increasing, it is evident that only reducing mining reward can not do it, increasing demand is another reason. The mining reward is reducing, but the reward is still adding to the circulating supply and the effect is reduction in price, but in a way that it is not significant. The demand will increase the marketcap and increase in the marketcap means increase in the price of bitcoin.",

Many articles have been written about this, you can read them. What you need to remember is that we cannot say that Bitcoin will definitely rise after the halving. It will most likely rise, but it would be a mistake to be so certain. Better be prepared for that time.",

I want to ask people that have witnessed many halvings if there has been a halving that was not accompanied by a bull run.You don't need to ask anyone, the full price history is available on many websites. You can clearly see a pattern that the price starts growing after the halvening, and typically 1 year after the halvening there's a strong bull market.

And yet they repeated, but you can see that the relative growth is slowing down. There's no x100 returns like it was before.",

In fact, I was not aware of its opportunities and potentials when people were taking advantage of this phenomenon. Now that I have a better understanding on the cryptocurrency world, the halving is now one of those events that I keenly look forward to.To all newbies that are starting and reading this thread, I highly recommend saving or purchasing BTCs before the halving starts. Once it ends, then expect prices of cryptocurrencies to skyrocket; take it as an advantage to invest either short or long-term depending on your goal.",

For example, you should be prepared that a year after halving or so, the profit you expect doesn't come. Make sure you don't go all-in or take a loan or do something stupid like that just because people believe you'll get a 5x increase and so on. Basically, make sure you don't forget to do risk management regardless of how much money you want to invest.",

According to a survey, less than 5% of the world's population invests in bitcoin, which means that not too many people know about the upcoming halving that will send bitcoin higher. Only those who have been participating in the market know about this important event, so we should not worry too much that everything is saturated or becomes too predictable. The number of bitcoin investors is nothing compared to other markets, we are still very small. I believe that as long as the market increases suddenly, there will always be a large number of new investors rushing into the market for speculation purposes and most of them will Fomo buy at high prices while old investors will take profits.",

Instead, they will attempt to maintain the current price of bitcoin since they own the majority of it, balancing mining costs and supply.Because the price of bitcoin increased every time after it was halved, people who view the chart and believe that \"this time will be different\" avoid investing during the prices are low, watch full bull market without investing.We cannot know the future, maybe that time will be different... or same.",
