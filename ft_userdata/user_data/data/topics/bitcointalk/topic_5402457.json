      "body": "I do not think that the rate hikes are temporary, in the Government they take ages to actually agree to even such rates and therefore it would not be a temporary decision it would go on for a while but fed rates hike is only good for people who are :1. Living in a country which is not so good for cryptocurrencies like bitcoins2. Have amazing amount of money so they can secure good investments according to new rates This is not a deal for traders or even for people who are holding a small amount of money in cryptocurrencies it won't bring up good fortune the moment you move your Money so the real investors are still there and waiting for the price to go even more low.",

      "body": "Whichever way that we want to look at the fed rate hike to the banks this year is going to have harsh effect on the poor and rural people. The rate that was increased from somewhere around 0.75% - 1% to 3.25% and 3.5% will come down on small business people. Yes weak hands will likely sell off for other needs. It tells on the economy when businesses don't get required funds to grow.",
