  "content": "Note: Metamask wallet do not support bitcoin, it support altcoins like ERC20 and BSC tokens etc. If you want to buy bitcoin, you can still always follow the decentralized, or the centralized way. If it is centralized, no privacy.Also know that Metamask to support direct purchase can help self-custody, but likely there is no privacy or anonymity about it. I do not know how this works for now, which I will later find more about, but I believe your crypto addresses which you used to buy the coins can easily be traced to your real identity using your bank details. This is a silence means KYC. On Metamask wallet, you can now buy crypto directly using bank transfer, through the help of MoonPay. Quote from: https://m.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/metamask-enables-direct-crypto-purchases-in-nigeria-3035496On March 21, MetaMask’s parent firm ConsenSys announced a new integration with crypto fintech MoonPay, enabling users in Nigeria to purchase crypto via instant bank transfers.The new feature is available within the MetaMask mobile and Portfolio DApp, significantly simplifying the process of buying crypto without using credit or debit cards in Nigeria.If you are a metamask wallet user, you can confirm that for us after updating your wallet.",

One advantage of the Moonpay/Metamask integration be say e present Nigerians with an opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies via bank transfers. Purchase by credit and debit cards also dey available but according to the survey wey dem conduct sometime ago, 90% of users prefer bank transfer, maybe na because of fear of not wanting their card details to be compromised.But one thing wey I no like na the high transaction fee. If person want buy 0.0362 ETH at N48464.73, dem go charge you N1090.46 for processing fee and N444.81 for network fees, i.e about N1500 for the transaction which is equivalent to $2, and for me e dey high.",

This update is truly good but I feel their is no need for me to check it out again as the already discuss charge rate scares me although one thought just comes to my mind maybe its a newly added feature, maybe overtime the rate is actually going subside. I have tried out some exchange platform's like busha, yellow card and binance and for me binance still remains best due to their easily understandable platform and fast and little charge rate on transaction made through peer to peer.",

I would try this out and give feedback here.Dear Charles- Tim, with the instant bank transfer, does it not still mean the app can record one's personal details like account number and account name of the sender? I don't think this Metamask instant transfer is like that of Binance P2P. which means the process is centralized, right?",
