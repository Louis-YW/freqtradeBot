  "content": "Hi guys,I do not know if this same topic have been brought up here recently, I've search and found none, but if actually there is, please point me to it and I will lock this one.There have been a lot of controversies surrounding the mode of operations of ledger - one of the top hardware wallet manufacturers, meant to be complete non-custodial, but recently, researchers have discovered data Harvesting Inside the ledger live app.For whatever reason best known to ledger, and hard to comprehend for users, ledger live app is transmitting information about..- Clicks- Page visits- Redirects- Crypto transactions- Page scrolls- Number of accounts- Crypto asset names- Session duration- Hardware device type- Firmware versionTo ledger's analytics provider known as segment.io.For those who do not know what ledger live is, like explained HERE[1]- Ledger Live is the official software for interfacing with any Ledger hardware wallet. The vast majority of PC users download this software in order to set up their hardware wallet and sign transactions. It was while inspecting the ledger live software code that a Twitter user by the handle Rektbuildr[2] discovered that user tracking is built into the entire software. Use the [1] or [2] links shared above to read more about this. How exactly are crypto holders who believe in decentralization and privacy still buying ledger? If this is because most don't know this things, aren't we being robbed by this companies, due to our ignorance?",

Let's take a look at Metamask's privacy policy:Quote from: https://consensys.io/privacy-policyInformation we collect from you may include:¬†¬† ¬†Identity information, such as your first name, last name, username or similar identifier, title, date of birth and gender;¬†¬† ¬†Contact information, such as your postal address, email address and telephone number;¬†¬† ¬†Profile information, such as your username and password, interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses;¬†¬† ¬†Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide in your responses to surveys, when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with Service, receive customer support or otherwise correspond with us;¬†¬† ¬†Financial information, such as your credit card or other payment card details;¬†¬† ¬†Transaction information, such details about purchases you make through the Service and billing details;¬†¬† ¬†Usage information, such as information about how you use the Service and interact with us;¬†¬† ¬†Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications and details about how you engage with them;¬†¬† ¬†Financial information, such as bank account number and bank routing number; financial assets holdings; and¬†¬† ¬†Technical information, such as your Ethereum wallet address, application programming interface (API)-key and network information regarding transactions.So Metamask collects literally everything. Not exactly a good recommendation.Since the seed extraction \"feature\", everyone should have abandoned their Ledger devices a long time ago. But when it comes to privacy, Ledger Live is only as bad as most other software out there. If you aren't using Linux + Firefox/Tor + your own node, then Ledger Live isn't any worse than the rest of your device.",
