If you consider the amount of reward that'll be sufficient for miners in relation to price of Bitcoin and make the reward last as long as possible by estimating how long the Bitcoin system could possibly last in relation to human civilization and changing tech ... maybe you say in the next 200 years. Â As an early Bitcoin developer, Just multiple the time by the number of BitCoins that will be issued every day (while considering deflation) and you get your answer.",

Satoshi set the initial block reward to 50 BTC and decided that bitcoin block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks. This makes the total supply approximately 21 millions. The exact supply of bitcoin is 20,999,999.9769 BTC.",

      "body": "I think it is very relevant to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million units, the creators of cryptocurrencies are trying to prevent inflation and maintain the purchasing power of cryptocurrencies over time to create scarcity and ensure the long term value of cryptocurrencies and This is different from traditional fiat currencies, which can be inflated through government policies such as quantitative easing or deficit spending.As the Bitcoin supply approaches its limit, miners will rely more and more on transaction fees to maintain their profitability. This creates a positive feedback loop where higher transaction fees encourage more miners to join the network, which in turn results in greater network security and stability.The limit of 21 million units in the Bitcoin source code is a key feature of the cryptocurrency that has helped promote its long-term value and stability.",

As other users already mention, those 21 units is a tricky number because bitcoin has 8 zeros after the point, and that means the total units can be a lot more than 21 million. Maybe your question is: Why limit the total of coins and not make the infinite? And the answer is - Because finite elements will always have a greater value than infinite elements. And 21M is a good number, isn't small or isn't big.",

So since the Genesis block is 50 Btc, it can be divided by half into 33 times. Like this: (1st)50 Btc(2nd)25 Btc(3rd)12.5 Btc.............(33rd)0.00000001 Btc Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â If you add it all, you will get a total of 20999999.9769 Btc. So because the Genesis block is unspendable, the only Btc left is 20999949.9769.For more details here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38994/will-there-be-21-million-bitcoins-eventually/38998#38998",
