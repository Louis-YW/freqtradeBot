  "content": "The attorney general of the District of Columbia (DC) Karl Racine believed Saylor was moving to different states every few months to evade income tax. 183 days living in a state will be subjected to paying tax but moving to somewhere before the required days as a resident makes him clear. Saylor lives in a Washington penthouse while actually a resident of Florida and sometimes moves to Virginia. I'm however not very sure of this info as I was just reading the news from crypto news sites. In some comments I've read it's an attack on Bitcoin. They first sanctioned Tornado Cash and accounts are to be frozen, now they start with the biggest crypto personality Micheal Saylor. What are your comments about it, are Bitcoiners next?",

But I don't see they are targeting bitcoin, if the news is true it will affect MicroStrategy more than bitcoin, Saylor is also just a bitcoin fan and bitcoin holder is not someone who can control bitcoin or impact bitcoin. This is Saylor's personal story and it has nothing to do with bitcoin.",

If one of these days there's an attack on Bitcoin you'll know what it is. If mining is banned in the US and other countries, as it happened in China, you will know what an attack on Bitcoin is. If legislation is passed to make all Bitcoin transactions KYC, you will know what a Bitcoin attack is.These measures and others that would be a real attack on bitcoin, would not be 100% effective, because no matter how much they are banned there will always be miners and P2P transactions, but if those two things happen in a short period of time you would really know what is an attack on bitcoin.Quote from: mk4 on September 02, 2022, 05:25:18 AMQuote from: pooya87 on September 02, 2022, 03:55:39 AMHow can this even begin to be about an attack to BTC?!Almost anything that very mildly affects Bitcoin is an attack on Bitcoin, apparently.

Its quit disheartning to see these high-earning CEO still want to cheat the state of revenue that would be used to improve the lives of the people. I am sure the that the income tax of employees of MicroStrategy are withdrawn regularly from their wages. The law has no respect for anybody and his connection to Bitcoin should not be used as the reason for the attack if he is guilty. If he is innocent, he has nothing to fear, but he is not let him face the punishment. My only reservation is that his actions might just give all these anti-Bitcoin forces another opportunity to link Bitcoin with tax invaders.",

What are your comments about it, are Bitcoiners next?Bitcoin is under attack from the Gensis block to this day, but that does not mean that the incident with Saylor is something that can be characterized as some kind of special attack on Bitcoin. Saylor is not nearly as influential as some others (if we look at social networks), and if he owes $25 million in taxes, that's not something he personally or the company should worry about.From what can be read, the prosecutor will have the difficult task of proving where Saylor stayed and for how long during the year, and it seems that his private jet and the pilot's statements will play a crucial role. One sarcastic comment says that it could be decided in a few days or hours, that is, whether the prosecutor will be able to prove whether Saylor spent more time sleeping on a pillow in Washington or in Florida Bitcoiners next? Of course, the prosecutor will demand that all members of the forum be identified and that they be arrested and delivered to a secret location where they will be tried for anything they can think of. However, I hear that our savior Mr. Mars is building a big spaceship that will save everyone who accepts the woof-woof coin as the official currency on Mars 🚀",
