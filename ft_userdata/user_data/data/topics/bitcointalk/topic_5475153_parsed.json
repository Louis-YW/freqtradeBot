Today the match will be played in Vizag, it starts at 7 pm. I was checking the betting odds for the match and it clearly favors the Australian team. We all know that the Indian team consists of new players and a new Captain. Naturally, the Indian team cannot be the favourite and it will be quite interesting to see who is in the playing 11 in the first match. I am not expecting any kind of miracle from this Indian side but I have a feeling that they would play well today.",

The buffering starts and when I select Hindi commentary it works smoothly. Ultimately it does not work with Jio when it is not IPL. I guess they are concentrating only on IPL and not bilateral series. I might be wrong but are you guys facing the same issue as I am facing? I did check with my broadband service provider and they said the same thing it is an issue with the streaming platform.",

I also faced the same buffering issue that is the problem a streaming platform faces when they offer free streaming for an Indian cricket match. BTW, Doordarshan Sports is a free TV channel where you can watch all cricket games played in India.Yesterday, I felt the bowling was not up to the mark, which might be due to the pitch being a batting paradise. The fielding was sloppy and some easy catches were dropped, not to forget Bishnoi dropping two catches which I felt were not that tough.Batting was not that up to the mark, except for Ishan Kishan, SKY, and Rinku Singh all of them were trying to hit the ball rather than timing it. Rinku Singh as we all know does well in the lower order and due to his brilliant batting India won the first game. SKY as usual at his best when he plays a T20 match, it would be his first win as a Captain in International cricket. If he had played in the same manner in the finals of the ODIWC we would have won the trophy for the third time. AFTER WATCHING SKY BAT YESTERDAY THIS IS WHAT I NOW THINK ABOUT HIM!",

A batter like him, who can hit 360 degrees, struggling to bat in the World Cup! Watching him bat as he is supposed to play, made me realize how much influence and corruption is still active within BCCI. A board that was like the board of Srilanka suddenly became the richest board because of Modi who conceived the Idea of IPL. If it was not for IPL and JIO cheap internet this board would have died or would have become a laughing stock like PCB is now. I feel there should be a separate team for the three formats and I think that is what is happening now. The problem is that for all three formats, there is one selection team. I would be right if they have selectors only for T20 cricket and another for ODI. Test cricket will die down soon, we are seeing a big decline in test cricket and we will see it out of cricket team schedules.",

I heard another rumour that Rohit Sharma is being released by MI and most probably would be taken by RCB. If that is true then Hardik would become the Captain of MI. There is another rumour circulating that Virat would be released by RCB. I doubt that he would be bit if that happens then Rohit would be come the captain of RCB. Now I have zero clue as to which team would be onboarding Virat. If these rumours are true then we would here other big names too in the coming days.",

Apart from exclusive government policies for them, these guys make a decent amount of daily wages to spend on booze and gambling every day. Engaging in gambling is quite common for them, I remember the time when lottery was quite common in many states. they were the ones who were engaged in the lottery so much that it became quite frequent to hear one of them winning the amount.the second T20 match will be played today, in the last match Indian bowling and fielding were not up to the mark. Only a few batters batted well and due to Rinku Sing's and SKY's efforts, we won the match. I hope India plays more sensibly today and wins again.",

Seeing Bishnoi and Patel effectively bowling and taking regular wickets shows things did not work as expected by Australia. Indian batting was at its best with Jaiswal leading with explosive batting. Â Ishaan Kishan has now scored back-to-back half-centuries in this tournament. Australia should win the next match otherwise the interest to watch the bilateral series would be lost. All of the rumors in regards to major players being released are rumors. It seems they are trying to create a bit of hype before the IPL auction starts. I am not sure why they need the hype.",

I had the feeling that Australia would come back and they did it because of Maxwell. Rituraj Gaikwad was brilliant yesterday, he got his first T20I century and that also when most Indian batters were struggling against the New Australian pace attack. Indian pace attack was not upto the mark I felt. It is possible due to the dew factor that they struggled. The last over by Krishna could have been bowled far better if it was Arshdeep.

Prasidh Krishna has been a total failure in all the three games and I don't know how he has been elected for the WC squad. The match has been total thriller due to the batting paradise condition but Indian pacers could have done a little better cause failing to defend 220+ os really a bad thing at any ground. As you said its Maxi show again and he has to be departed early or else the game is going to be snatched just like yesterday that is where SKY missed the trick as captain in my opinion.",

I still remember Wasim Akram saying that if you fail over the wicket then go round the wicket. We have seen Shami doing it frequently when he bowls.
