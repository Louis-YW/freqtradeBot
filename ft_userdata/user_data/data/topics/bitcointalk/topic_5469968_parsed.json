There are countries where people would rather to work for a private company and others where a work with the government is more appealing. I have received some offers from both, but it is very situational what you will choose here in this country. Private companies offer a better salary, but their schedules are very grinding and can mess with the health of people. Government jobs tend to be more lax, pay less but you got more time to do your own things. Depending on what  our needs are, we will end up choosing one. Also, I have always wondered who good is to work for the government in countries like the United States and Europe. I assume salaries are better than average.",

In most of Europe it doesnt matter if you have a private or goverment job, you still have a pension. Private jobs usually tend to pay more at the higher end but gov jobs tend to be more stable. I would even say the lower end of goverment pay is also higher than in private sector.",

There are good private jobs that pays much higher than government jobs and they will take proper care of you and till you retire. They will even pay your gratitude and every other bonuses. Most government work don't have bonus, you are to depend only on your salary. If the government wants to employ me based on my skill and area of specialization. I will prefer a private company instead of them, because private companies pay higher than the government and you can be given a car and a house to stay in, if your input to the company is great. Government don't care about this, because they are not there to see how hard working that you are. It is only your colleagues that will see this.",

It is therefore better to begin a personal business even if you still get government jobs and that was the mistakes the old people did, to rely on just one stream of income, no body gets financially comfortable or rich with that.",

Most public setups suffer from bureaucratic bottlenecks that hamper positive changes. Most government establishments operate on laid down rules that are very difficult to change. In a private organisation, your ideas will be accepted and appreciated but in public firms, the process of policy-making is centralised making employee input difficult. Reward in private organisations is mainly based on the input or performance of employees but public organisation focuses on seniority based year of service. Public firms usually promote workers based on how long they have been in the organisation instead of using their positive impact or contribution.",

But if it is a regular paying private company, a government job will be more suitable for me, because you have to consider the job security where you may be required to work till retirement age, also the flexibility of the job because government jobs will not require extra from you as private companies would, plus the pension afterwards.",

I'll start by explaining why I would rather have a government job than a private sector. 1. Job security: In the private sector, it's possible to get fired at any moment without a good reason, but it's more difficult to get fired from a government job without going through a duo processes. 2. Time-consuming: While working for the government gives you the time to pursue other enterprises, working for a private sector forces you to concentrate solely on the job offer.3. Salary payment: In a government job, you are paid when it's due; in a private employment, the employer selects when to pay you. 4. Line of duty: In a government job, every employee is aware of the type of work that they are responsible for performing, but in a private employment, you can be given any given task or demoted to any level against your will. If you're not good at that, you leave the position that was provided to you.",

I hard an experienced with private job for 3 years immediately after I graduated from the university and that hard a lot of impact on me even though I have left the company long ago,  so I do prefer to work for the government since it gives me time to do other things that are beneficial to my finances and health and government staffs have a lot of leaves and vocations to enjoy with loads of other.

As you mentioned, government work is pensionable, and it also provides high job security, as opposed to private work, where you can be sacked at any time. I'm not sure, but perhaps in some regions of the world, private work will be preferred over government job. As long as there is no job security, I will not accept it as my only and only alternative source of income.",

For most of us, it's all about that steady salary because, let's face it, no one wants to work until the end of time. We all have dreams of retiring when the time is right, and we want to make sure we get the perks we've earned.Speaking of stability, I'd place my bet on the government jobs. They're not likely to go bankrupt anytime soon since they rely on taxes from the people.

I mean what are your skills?If you prefer security, i would say a government job unless you negotiate yourself a good job in private sector and you are an union member. Benefits on governement is giving are probably way easier to get then from private sector. But if you want to go somewhere with your career, your changes with private sector are higher. It's no guarantee of anything and you might not get a promoton ever in there either.Also i am assuming you are from USA as in some countries even private sector has to offer way better benefits than in USA for example.

But many have learned with the private sectors and jobs there that even they say that you're in a permanent position, this past years through pandemic have taught us that jobs aren't permanent.Quote from: Usasauki2004 on October 11, 2023, 09:22:11 AMWhich one do you prefer if you are given an offer?These days, many are choosing to get into side hustles because you own your time and you can do much within 24 hours unlike with government and private jobs that you're tied to work 8 A.M to 5 P.M. or any timeframe for that 9 hour schedule for job of yours.IMO, as long as it brings food to the table and you love what you're doing then that's more important to choose. Because when you love your job regardless if it's from a private company or from the government, nothing beats being happy while working and there's no toxicity.",
