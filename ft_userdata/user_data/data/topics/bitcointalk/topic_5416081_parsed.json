Here’s the first auction for one of them on this forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415704.0I was lucky enough to get 3 of them. I’ve tried very hard to get a miss btc Japan, Zaif exchange, omise go, as well as some of the one off customs (which you can see in my pic below)but just haven’t been able to find anyone willing to sell them.",
