So far, because mining involves large consumption of electricity, the real threat which bitcoin mining posses is an increased consumption of power which sometimes means increased carbon emissions. Countries with already a high percentage of carbon emission via massive industrialization and having much concerns for the environment and global warming will seek out ways to cut and reduce their carbon emission and making their country unfavourable for miners through policies, increased tariffs and even total ban are all options for them.Carbon emissions are not equal worldwide, so countries with lower carbo emissions may not pay attention to miners even if they ban bitcoin use in the country.",

No, I don't think that countries will immediately jump on banning bitcoin just because some organizations saying that it harms the environment.I'm also not convince that it needs to switch to PoS. And it will survived being the only PoW crypto, after all its the prime mover so I'm not sure what will make people not to invest despite this bad publicity.

There is a possibility of banning POW mining by some countries. I know NY has recently drafted a bill proposing such ban and that might gain traction if other US states decides to go to the same way. If US decides on imposing a ban on POW mining, EU may start looking into the same option. So I would say possibility exists!But chances are very high that some other countries may come forward and seize the opportunity. Especially those countries where the temperature remains low throughout the year. An absolute ban will not be possible but some major economies and their allies may impose such bans.",

In a world completely dependent on fossil fuels it looks really idiotic when someone deals with something they can't control in this way. Bitcoin mining is at the very bottom of the problem when it comes to the environment and this cannot be a compelling argument when it comes to any ban. Of course, that won’t stop some countries from continuing to push that pointless agenda, or that geniuses like Mr. Mars from time to time say Bitcoin isn’t green enough to use it for transactions.POS will never happen, no matter what blackmail they come up with - and in about 10 years, will this debate make any sense at all if we know that 99% of BTC will be mined, which means that the 1% (210 000) what remains will not certainly increase the number of miners, but will drastically reduce it.",

I think if countries do start to ban bitcoin mining it will be an excuse for them to ban bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.  The amount of waste countries create in all sorts of different situations pales in comparison to bitcoin mining.  It also might be pretty difficult for them to enforce.  Again I think if they do ban, it's more so they don't want bitcoin being around than it is they are concerned for the environmental impact.",

According to  Bitcoin Mining Council  Q3 2021 report, 57% of the energy used for crypto mining comes from renewable sources (hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal and carbon generation with carbon offsets as defined by the). Moving to green energy is a gradual process hence; the government needs to give crypto miners time to diversify their energy source. Harsh policies against the crypto industry also have its economic effect on the state or country. Economic analysts have warned that this bill can lead to massive job loss because many local vendors consisting of electricians, engineers, and construction workers earn from the crypto industry. Bitcoin mining operations are providing high-paying and high-grade, great jobs for local communities in New York. An exodus of crypto miners could translate to jobs and tax dollars moving out of state.
