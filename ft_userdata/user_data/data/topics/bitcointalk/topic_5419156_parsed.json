Best to just give your own address that you have its private key, you will be able to trade it on a decentralized exchange, or if the coin become well known, you can also send it to your exchange has it becomes tradable there.For you not to lose the coin is the reason for the advice.But airdrops are now waste of time.",

Thank you all. It's probably that bounty campaigns wanted you to submit address that you have control over with, i.e. custodial wallets.Yes, crypto exchanges will give you ERC20 addresses, but the question is, do you hold your private keys? what if the exchanges gets hack? all your hard earn tokens from bounties will disappear like that.",

Thank you all. The reason is simple which is the exchange owns the address and not yourself so if the token you are about to receive is not on the supported list of the exchange then you won't be able to see that token in your deposit even though it is actually deposited to the address. However every address support the erc20 tokens still the exchange has the ability to make it visible or not that is why the campaign always wanted your address not someone's else.",

Thank you all. Because most airdropped tokens are not listed in an exchange at the time of the airdrop, and may never be listed there. If you send coins that are not listed by the exchange yet, nothing will reflect in your account, and you won't be able to withdraw them as well.Secondly, most of the ERC20 are traded using dexes such as uniswap that require you to connect the wallet that contains the tokens, if they send the tokens to an address of a centralized exchange. You won't be able to use that very address to connect to uniswap and other dexes.",

It's caused by the reward that you will receive that will never be listed on major exchange site. that's why you will be loosing your token if you are submitting the exchange address. that's why the developers are always telling you airdrop hunter never try to use exchange address to receive your token or you will get nothing for that.

The exchange site owned such address and you have no access over the private key or seed phrase and you will never able to take your token if that was being sent to the exchange site address.

Because ERC20 tokens have same address as Ethereum address in either your non custodial ERC20 wallets or exchange wallets.But you only have control to import tokens (symbol, decimal etc.) in your non custodial wallets.With exchange wallets, you can not customize and import tokens. You are depended on exchange support to get those ERC20 tokens in your exchange wallet. When they give such support? Mostly they support only if they list those tokens at their exchanges.If you join bounties, airdrops and use exchange wallet address, you will not know that exchange will support to add that token or list that token on their exchange for deposit, withdrawal and trading.",

I think you're just make an assumption since it's possible to get an airdrop by using exchange wallet.

Also when they use their own wallet, the participants will take a part of the network since they need to send their token to the exchange.",
