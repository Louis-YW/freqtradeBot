  "content": "Would bitcoin be better if all users had the same hashrate? Do not the rich just get richer with this system we have? and eventually 1 person will win.If all users were 1 vote on the network? (direct digital democracy)I think if we all had the same hashrate it would be more fair.The supply is 98% premined to anyone born today, why do they not get to mine?In 2142 it will all be mined and kids then wont even be able to mine, but 98% premine today? WTF? is it ETH?I think it would be better if we were all 1 node on the network, rather a few guys or even 1 guy being able to be 50% of the nodes.This can be done using passive sonar to scan WILLING users heartbeats.I think it would be better with a built in school system in a wallet that gives credits for people do courses and paying people like gov jobs that they finish, like real life bounties. I know my idea is so 2200, but bitcoin is not it boys, the central bankers can buy all the supply, you are still $laves.",

I can show you what happens in the end with bitcoin and it is not good for satoshi's children.In the end, killing will be easier to take others hashrate out of the game, rather creating miners yourself. Enjoy your children dieing to eachother sir It is fine, you and I will be in the afterlife and watch them blow eachother up and I will have a good chuckle at your tears.Then I show you what it was like my way and ask you to go back and do it the right way, enjoy being re created to learn what is right again. Trust me, you will want to do it my way when you see what your children do to eachother.You could just do a 1 and done, but you are going to repeat the cycle if you do not fix it in this life.

If it is the later, you may be a idiot, in fact you would be.lol bling bling dog $$.There is no more nor less security in a fairly distributed supply. I would argue there is more because with bitcoin 1 person can be 50% of the hashrate.When your great great great grand child ask why he did not get to mine initial supply like everyone else, you can explain to him because your generation were complete cunts.
