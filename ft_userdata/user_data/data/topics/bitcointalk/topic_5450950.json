      "body": "Kind of similar to exchange, gambling site scams where a telegram user asks that he has some balance stuck and they will give you a good chunk of balance if you do things for them. Always try to ignore such messages, saves your time.I still receive some telegram messages promoting some sites and how good their offers are and the high returns they can give me if I invest under a program. I always ignore such messages. They get all the Telegram UID's from some groups and start messaging them one by one either promoting some projects or some scam sites. There should be something like reporting these users on telegram.",

      "body": "Here is how you spot a scam:A guy, girl, or transvestite contacts you on Telegram. That's it. Please follow me for more trading advice. Joking aside, 8 or 9/10 unsolicited PMs over Telegram are surely a scam in one way or the other. It's not worth anyone's time.This fake deposit scam sadly still works. Please deposit 0.01 BTC as a fee to withdraw the 1 BTC we gave you, and from where we can't take fees ourselves.",

We have already a lot of users and we will not change our protections policy just because of youLOL.I am reminded of the reverse scam someone did on r/scams. To sum it up - iirc, dude pretended he didn't know USDT transfers needed ETH for gas fees and asked the scammer to send ETH for about 30 bucks or smth so he can transfer his fortune. Scammer bites and OP disappears lol.But this probably worked mainly because we're only talking about beer money. In any case, I'd say it's always a good thing to waste a scammer's time and perhaps annoy them along the way hahah",
