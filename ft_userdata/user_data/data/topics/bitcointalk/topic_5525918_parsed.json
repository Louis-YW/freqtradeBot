I mean, it makes a lot of sense to print this as raised dots and then only readable by someone with third sight.Joking aside, I believe this is clear and unrefutable evidence that satoshi was not only responsible for spreading malware, but that he used ill-gotten gains he made as the creator of the Y2K bug. That's the problem with millennials.",
