I think that asking them to contact you (obviously on a rather temporary email address) would be the way to go.The main contributors/devs tend to be rather active on Github. I'd start from the issues page ( https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues ) and find my way from there.",

Is there an email or a phone number I can use to reach out to the team? Makes me wonder, you want to talk to the developers on phone? Seriously what is the type of partnership being discussed here? If you dont mind me asking.Though its pretty easy to contact them, ThomasV's account link is here, but being a newbie you might have difficulty sending a PM. Recommend you use their official email address. Also is someone with similar sounds or similar looking username has already PMed you, double check that it is not some imposter. There can be no end to the scams that happen here.",

You can surely download Electrum anytime and anywhere, but for whatever it's worth always download Electrum in a safe enviroment, what that means is ensure the device is airgapped if the funds is worth a lot and at least 'free' from malware and other attacks if the funds is for spending on the go.",
