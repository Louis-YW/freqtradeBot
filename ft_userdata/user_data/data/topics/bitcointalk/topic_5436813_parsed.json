  "content": "As you can see everyone, most huge gainers for the past few days or weeks are different chain networks most of these chains are new.The best example is Aptos and Optimism, which recently had their new all-time highs and even old network chains are also making some noise just like Solana or Fantom.Any opinion about this? Do you think this will continue? I remember before the days of Solana, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain (BNB) when there are times that most of these altcoins or like altcoins are pumping too much.Maybe you can suggest some altcoins also that has their own network with active community and working product already?",

Looking back at the history that has unfolded from the time BTC appeared to the time altcoins were created to bring features that BTC has not solved, more and more we will see problems in life that need change, but things like that basically have their own place. And new things that fix old problems will also be well received, and there comes a time when everything is balanced, and I think their equality will be more obvious when the possibilities to which they can apply get into the realms of life.",

I might stay for them as Ive seen a lot of progress on these network. I didnt manage to ride the APT and OP but, definitely still trust fantom and avalanche for their network upgrades. I am long time holder of these two network and still believe it will be a big projects in the coming bull season.",

This project is a L1 project that was developed several years ago (2020 if I'm not mistaken), before, when it was first launched, I participated there as an Ambassador and got a lot of profit.The ATH reached by $ROSE is $0.5964, and its current price is only around $0.05585. This means that there is a price reduction of up to 10x, this is not a dead project, but rather a project that people don't pay much attention to, I'm sure when the Bullrun comes, the price of $ROSE will easily go back up.",
