I normally consider them as mere speculations until proven true.    Just wish people are held accountable for damaging rumors and gossips (and they are aware of the consequences)... that's probably when I will start taking such writeups seriously. In my opinion, you could understand Satoshi better by consuming most of his writeups, rather than what people who don't know him well enough (or atall) say about him.",

Over the decade many had only one motive of trying to find the person behind the name of satoshi but was left in vain while some like CSW took over this opportunity and tried to scam newbies in the name of claiming themselves as satoshi. Thanks for posting the titles of all the topics in which satoshi was mentioned and we can infer that majority of the titles had one common question about speculating who was satoshi. It's always good that satoshi was never found nor he came out because that would create unnecessary chaos in the whole community and would completely destroy the decentralisation idea of bitcoin. I would also support the move of coblee (Charlie Lee) while he sold a major stash of his Ltc to improve the decentralisation. In a decentralised environment, every one of us should have an equal opportunity for participating in the network and not someone who is the founder/creator alone.",
