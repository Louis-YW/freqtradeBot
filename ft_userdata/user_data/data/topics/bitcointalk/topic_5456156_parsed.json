Well, if you can do all the things you mentioned here, it will make you feel comfortable with the platform because once you disobey any rules here nothing like newbies or legendary you must face the punishment at the moment. I will advice you to go through the Bitcointalk rules very well so that you will be able to relate well with the BTC and crypto discussion. Ensure you sacrifice more time in the beginners forum were the floor is open for newbies to ask any kind of question that relate to crypto and BTC and answer will be given.",

But, if you are a honest member and you created the post to show us that you will abide all the rules then that's a very nice thing. I recommend you to be a nice member and follow all the rules of the forum and soon you'll soon make some good friends on the forums who will help you by replying to your posts with the knowledge they have.I recommend you to read Bitcoin whitepaper and deeply study the topics of the forum and the replies to learn about it deeply. I personally learnt about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from this forum and I'm proud to say that I made the best decision of my life by joining this forum. It has helped me a lot in my financial life and I truly appreciate all of the knowledgeable members of the forum who are deeply devoted to this forum.Quote from: Onset on June 12, 2023, 05:18:02 PMWhy do some people take this forum so deep?

No one in this forum has ever said to lick the books or worship them and saying such words isn't a fair thing buddy. The forum is unique and there is no other website like this forum. All the other forums are mostly dead and the members on those forums aren't much knowledgeable about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. The rules of this forum are general rules and anyone who is knowledgeable enough knows that those set rules are part of each respected institution or forum, and even those rules are present in schools and collages because plagiarism is the stealing of other people's hard work and the ones who do that aren't actually knowledgeable about the things they are posting, but are the thieves who are stealing copyrighted text and claiming it as their own.",

All the other forums are mostly dead and the members on those forums aren't much knowledgeable about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It doesnâ€™t seems harsh to me. Onset is just telling OP that this forum is just a discussion platform like social media places although with much advantages like earning and getting free resources on bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. But from what the OP actually wrote and like other newbies they just come and feel nervous about the whole thing which isnâ€™t supposed to be. You donâ€™t clearly need to state out like some officer taking an oat before going into war. Feel free and engage in discussions and do not take the forum way too serious. The more perfect you wish to be the easier you could end making mistakes",

Just like others have said, there is no point in trying to tell the forum and its members how honest and truthful you will be; no one really cares who you are in the real world, and as such, your outside life doesn't matter here; if you choose to lie here, that's your problem. What the forum need is someone who is here open-minded willing to learn contribute in whichever way they can, and help others in sharing knowledge where necessary. Outside of that, any other thing you want to do is left to you, and if you go against the rules of the forum, then the law will catch you and you will be punished accordingly, and that pledge won't save you.",
