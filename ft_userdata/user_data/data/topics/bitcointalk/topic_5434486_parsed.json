The topic recently moved to archival and I want to delete the post I made in there so that it will not be reflected on my post history.I notice that you can still reply on the topic but delete button is not available on my post. I just self report it to moderator for now but I’m not sure if my report will be handled since the topic is already on the Archival.",

Simple.I don't think it's something theymos would be interested to add though it would be good to have the feature.What's wrong if it remains in the post history? Any special reason that you are finding weird?I thought that it’s just regular board that only disabled the delete buttons since it’s just on the regular thread. This is my first time to visit and see the feature of that board.I just don’t want to miscount it as valid post when I double checking all my post made for the week.Quote from: hd49728 on January 12, 2023, 03:43:02 PMAllowing users to self delete topics can increase scam and I believe don't allow it is better.

Appreciate the reply.Quote from: NeuroticFish on January 12, 2023, 03:43:49 PMEven more, one can easily ignore the Archival board and he will not see those posts in his history.I've done that and not only for Archival; I've also ignored most local boards, for example...@Coin_trader, wouldn't this be a reasonable solution for you?see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=807453;sa=ignoreBoardsThanks this will work. I’m aware on this feature but I’m always forgetting where to find it.",
