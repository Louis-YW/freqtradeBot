Good luck with whatever you are doing buddy.Thanks for the reply buddy.I contacted some people of the list you mentioned already. Unfortunately, however, not all designers also do NFT designs.  That's why I would appreciate an answer here, if you're a capable NFT designer.",

Unfortunately, however, not all designers also do NFT designs.   I'm curious to know the difference between the NFT Designer and just a regular designer. Isn't it just changing the designs based on the specific properties of the NFT? Like Eyes, Mouth, Head, Color, etc. and changing them accordingly?Anyway, have you tried checking in freelance servicing marketplaces? Like fiverr?",
