  "content": "As can be seen from the chart below, Bitcoin bounced last week from the 200 Week MA (blue line) currently at $26.3K. This is now the third week price has tested this level as new support, but do you think it will hold?Earlier in the month I didn't think it would act as much support, as only recently in February did it act as resistance for a couple of weeks, however this was arguably came from the 50 Week MA - purple line - that was trending downwards in bearish formation. Now the 50 WMA is trending back to the upside for the first time since 2021 with the 20 Week MA due to cross the 200 WMA in the coming weeks.So far price has corrected around -16% from the yearly highs of $31K which is considerably less than the 20%+ correction from $25K to $20K earlier in the year. I still think a 20%-25% correction remains possible, which would be relatively normal after a 100% increase in recent months, taking price to around $23K to $25K, but so far on the Weekly time-frame price is looking optimistic for now.What are your thoughts? Do you think the local low is in after the recent bounce from $26K to $28K, or does Bitcoin have further to correct before continuing to the upside?",

      "body": "Also worth noting that yesterday there were $44m short liquidations when price reached $28K, which was the biggest short squeeze in over a month. While this highlights that there were a lot of bears trying to short the price of Bitcoin, likely with relatively high leverage, this does arguably open the door for more shorts to enter the market, now they have been wiped out. For now however, the Long/Short Ratio remains relatively balanced at 0.98, even slightly favouring the bulls.",

Because of the graph, only two things can happen, either the value decreases or increases.In the image of the graph, traders seem to be able to see if Bitcoin's price value is going up.

I got lucky with the 200 WMA during COVID crash and got a good average. Bought again last year when it touched and it was definitely not even close to support. Completely broke thru it.I generally agree and have been saying this since it broke as support last year, as overall it failed to act as support nor resistance. Arguably it didn't act as resistance this year either (as referenced in OP), and it could be said that the 20 Week MA was what recently supported price from around $25.8K as opposed to the 200 WMA. It's only real significance is that it's close to an average 4-year price, so a good DCA price.Quote from: adaseb on May 30, 2023, 04:25:20 AMSo right now, especially being So flat, I don’t think it’s of any importance. As for the claim that it's flat, it's still rising, even if not as aggressively as in previous years. For example by the end of the year it will be priced around $30K, which would be +20% within about 6 months, which is quite a reasonable increase. As long as price remains above $10K it will also continue to rise, as currently is replacing candles from Summer 2019 with current Weekly candles for reference sake.",

Even if price were to go to $50K this year, it'd still take until the end of the year for these moving averages to cross-over. If I had to guess it would therefore be towards the end of the year if price continues to the upside, otherwise sometime next year if there is more consolidation this year. Given the 50 WMA has never crossed the 200 WMA in Bitcoin history, the only comparison would be something like the 50 & 100 WMAs crossovers. Notably in 2019 it took until the end of the year until these crossed back over, but that time price had already corrected by 50%.In summary it will be important for the long-term start of a new bull market, but as for whether price continues to the upside or not this year it's more or less irrelevant.",

Worst case there is Ichimoku cloud support around $20K.Really hard to make a position at this moment. Price move sideways as usual but I guess a more volatile one. Price would reach $28k then fall $27-26.6k. Also with speculations of market price reaching $20k to fill the CME gap. Gigen that there are many speculations which revolves around this industry, I think it would be much better to wait until a more visible trend line appears before maaking a long position. But since the price is on sideways, it is quite good for scalp trades; jist manage the risk of how prices move at this moment. One thing I have observed as well are altcoins reaching their highest price since March and April on the current year. But I doubt things would be consistent; it is more of a bull trap.",

Don't worry, the $36k that you assume is only easy for BTC.Remember we already crossed $30k last time but even if not $36k, let say $35k is only the max we get for a while, I will still consider this a bullish move.

The bitcoin price is still moving sideways and of course not everyone will think this is negative.About of $35k, I don't think I'm expecting it hit very soon before the $30k resistance is hit again.

And now we are in the $25k'ish, although I expect the price to go down hard because of this negative news, at least the market is still holding. But let's see, I have a feeling that this is just a temporary effect and soon we might see the price going back to $27k again. As for SEC and US government, they are turning to be anti-crypto now and it starts with their attack on exchanges like Binance or in the past months, Coinbase.",

While price may well still go lower in the coming days, it's good to see the buying pressure at least.In other news the SEC must be fuming. The timing for these lawsuits was during a corrective period for Bitcoin where the bulls looked weak and could easily be an opportunity to take advantage of bearish selling pressure. Anyone in the know what have been shorting the market prior to these announcements, but so it's starting to look like a mistake as price reverses back to the upside with bullish volume.",
