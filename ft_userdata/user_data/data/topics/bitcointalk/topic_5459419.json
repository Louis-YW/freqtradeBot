  "content": "It's hillarious to have read about the Bitcoin sign guy and his heroic action at the DC when Hon Yellen was giving a talk to the congress. He, standing behind Yellen, raised a \"buy bitcoin\" inscribed placard. This appeared to the eyes of the world's most powerful people, though wasn't acceptable by all who attended the congress, as he was compared to appologize to his then employer, his simple act of bravery was loved by all the bitcoin community members. In his talk with coindesk he did it out of his love for the concept of bitcoin, he wasn't only buying bitcoin, he had a perception that bitcoin will take away, in future, some country dollars, which is already falling away like Zimbabwe dollars and venezuela bolivar. The bitcoin guy whose name is undisclosed, got so famous in the bitcoin community and attended numerous interviews to explain what led to his action. According to coindesk he received about 7BTC for proving his act to the internet. Personally, I wasn't a bitcoiner at that time, but others who were in the market can shed more light about this event, everyone else can add what they think about this \"Bitcoin sign guy\".Photo source: Rizzohttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/12/31/most-influential-in-blockchain-2017-1-bitcoin-sign-guy/",

I doubt Bitcoin will replace country dollars, but its possible.Zimbabwe and Venezuela's currencies collapsed due to inflation and mismanagement, not cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a viable option, but socio-economic factors must be considered. Bitcoin adoption in stable currencies requires major structural reforms.Our Bitcoin sign guy earned 7BTC from the community, demonstrating decentralized financial power. It also raises the issue of wealth's impact on the community.",

Don't forget that 2017 was a crazy years for us, so it added more fun. Others have done similar things, but it's all the same. It makes us laugh for a few days and then we forget.As for his perception about Bitcoin, well, we all have more or less the same here isn't?",

This will always remain a story to remember because the guy took a bold step and decision to have made that knowing fully that he's under the camera surveillance but risk the repercussion that might come after doing the act, there's one kind of boldness bitcoiners developed right from the beginning, they don't accept threat or intimidation, we do not know if the guy is even a supporter of the woman in capture being a bitcoin holder, we don't know who owns bitcoin and who don't except someone make a declaration for it.",

Don't forget that 2017 was a crazy years for us, so it added more fun. I was not familiar with the story and around that time I started to learn about Bitcoin. I guess it was reported as something funny at the time but little repercussion. In fact, in all the time I've been in the forum, it is the first time I see talk about it, so it does not go beyond anecdote. This kind of things usually happen in this type of events for various reasons. If it is not inside when they are giving the conference, it is when the television interviews someone important.",

We can say that's a brave action from him and became a meme in the community. Such a noble act from that guy and with that small gesture, I wonder how many people did followed when they saw him with that sign.Also, I remember that it's being worn as an avatar by pooya before.

I certainly recall that period vividly; Man, it was a hot topic all over the internet. It was period that in which many individuals were making concerted efforts to create awareness. And no doubt, we owe the rate of adoption now to that time. I'm curious to know if the response from those who were not involved with Bitcoin at that time is different from their view now, considering the significant advancements Bitcoin has achieved in all ramifications. Personally, If I had direct access to the media by any means, I would do the same thing in my country, but I would go beyond merely writing buying Bitcoin.",

The man definitely had the courage to do something like that, and obviously it paid off through donations, although it is important to emphasize that he spent most of the 7.03 BTC during 2017, which means that he did not have good timing.Besides, some say granny Yellen got even more mad at BTC after that, but not everyone can be happy in stories like this, can they?",
