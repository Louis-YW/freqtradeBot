I don't think i fully agree with your statement. Of course at the moment with the very high inflation the money that we have on the bank account basically loses a little bit of value each and every day that we let it sitting their idle. That being said i think you should always have a certain amount of wealth as FIAT available on the bank for emergencies because you can just never know what happens in the future. So to say \"don't keep your money in the bank, invest it instead\" is a very risky advice in my opinion. Of course if you have money that you can afford to lose then you can or should use it for an investment instead of just letting it sit on the bank, but you should never do that with money that you can not afford to lose.",

In the bank I keep the equivalent of 3-4 months' salaries, so that in the event of unexpected problems at work to have security in cash and I invest everything more than that. It is important to remember to diversify your investments. I definitely do not recommend investing all your funds in something as volatile as cryptocurrencies.",

Yeah, if I could have this knowledge when I was still very young, I could have made money already.Nevertheless, it's a long arduous process for the money of us. Because when we are young, we really don't know how to make the right decision. And what you have mentioned could be just learn thru hard experience. So I guess my advise for the young out there is just to really find something that they will like to invest, like crypto, stocks, bonds and anything that will grow their money overtime.",

I agree with you I also know that there is some kind of relief when you have savings where you can lay hands on in terms of emergency but this time around with the level of inflation and some kind of problems around the world I do not think that saving is a good option. The currencies of the world are collapsing day-in-day-out. If you save today in 2 years time your purchasing power will be reduced because of inflation that is why some persons will decide to invest their money. And the same way not all Investments are genuine even the cryptocurrency we are talking about most times it goes to bear and everybody will be crying tears.Just save little and invest more.",

Of course, if you have the knowledge but if you don't take actions then how can you grow your money. So we should take action, and whether we make the correct decision or not, it's up to us to adjust.Quote from: Famous Grouse on October 28, 2022, 09:45:41 AMKeeping Money is behavior. Attitude, we need to be very positive that we can make our money grow continuously and have multiple sources. So we will not rest, we will go on and find other ways to make more money.Quote from: Famous Grouse on October 28, 2022, 09:45:41 AMGrowing Money is Knowledge.And as we mature and gain knowledge and wisdom, then we should execute it with perfection.I don't think that keeping money is a bad behavior too, what is not good is that you enslaved yourself with money that it become your focus. Look at how the billionaires are, they have money and yet they go on sharing and become philanthropic.So you just have to balance everything in life, you will have a good life and your family if you have good source of money flowing.And the best thing is that we have crypto now that will have us that opportunity.",

But now when I look at the wars and tensions around the world, saving money in this period is a huge mistake. Because there is a serious inflation problem around the world right now. For this reason, all the money you save in the bank or personally is melting away in the face of this inflation. Because the value of money is decreasing day by day. The house and cars you bought for a certain price yesterday were almost doubled. Therefore, in this period, it is better to make a profit by investing your money in some way or by converting the money in some way. For some people who have no ideas about investing, keeping money is the safest thing to do because they think that will ensure their future. But that is not the case right now as everything you have saved might be insignificant in the future as their value will keep on depreciating due to high inflation. To avoid it from happening, never focus on saving alone this time as investing a portion of it will give you secured profits in the future. As long as you are only investing in good and reliable projects, your money will keep on growing as well as you also gained consistent knowledge out from your investments.",

Money making more MoneyÂ   Some people thinks it is the amount of cash you are holding in the bank accounts that determine how rich you are. Your money should be invested so that you are earning more. It is your Investments put together that actually determines how much you are worth, not your money in the Bank, which could be depleted by Inflation anyway.",

I think saving some money is important for some needs every month, of course, we also need money that can be disbursed quickly because we don't know what will happen in our family. because we can not fully control what will happen in life such as accidents, illness, and so on. therefore saving is also important to me.and we also need to save money in the form of value which gives us an advantage like investing in stocks, gold or any other commodity free market, and i suggest storing value in bitcoin as i do even though its not much but i do it every end of the month.",

The problem here is where you will invest to increase assets instead of saving, I think this is a problem for many savers because they have no investment experience and they don't take risks. The second thing, saving is something everyone should do because life will always have unexpected incidents. Assuming you are currently investing all your money in bitcoin and you are in urgent need of money, where will you get the money to solve the problem, when the price of bitcoin goes down like it is? if you sell bitcoin in a bear market, your loss will be greater than the devaluation of fiat.",

Sure, Warren Buffet is a good example, but when you look at the top, you see that building something is a better way of getting richer, instead of just investing.If you want a regular amount of \"wealth\", like what would be enough for you to live without ever needing money, depending on where you live it could be 100k to 1 million. In that situation you could invest and hope to reach that level, but even that would be quicker if you had a successful business instead.
