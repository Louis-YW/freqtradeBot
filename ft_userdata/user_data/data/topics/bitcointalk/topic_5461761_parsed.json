What's OGG will become or what's the mission out of it and of course having such kind of price jump is impossible of what can OGG can offer to the community. Better to have a better plans and design of the website because marketing strategy is vital in crypto industry.",

Am i supposed to find some information from here what this project is about? I know it's a coin but what's the goal? How is a website or \"social media\" linked to this coin. How is it powering it? The site has few vague posts in english and interface is something else, maybe spanish?If you have a whitepaper i would like to read it. What i gathered from this this far is that you are somehow building a new social media, that might or might not be linked to the coin.Edit: also claiming that you are going to list on bitmex is a lie. They have NDA on that. So even if that would be true, just by saying that you are violating their NDA and not permitted to list.",

I could not find the project's whitepaper on their website.Â  Also, you are telling me you will list it in a few exchanges. But I can not find it in all the announcement channels of the exchanges.",
