  "content": "I was thinking of an easier way to acquire crypto currency as investments without actually buying any directly from a trader or an exchange. I discovered how sane it is to purchase stock from publicly traded companies, working on or utilizing efficiently the blockchain technology by either mining crypto, being involved in the development of blockchain technology, or holding significant amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, also, through mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).By using the method of buying stocks,  it is wise to patronize companies or industries with a financial stake in the future of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology.Some pre-points to consider before doing this, should include an up to date status for security, charges/fees, and the risk of loss(es) in mind.For example,  a company like Tesla, holds over billion dollars in Bitcoin and is known to have accepted Bitcoin payments in the past. It is one of the top choices amongst a host of others who use and accept crypto currency for payments and trade.Are there any other methods you know, that one can buy/invest in crypto from without using a regular exchange or trader?https://www.investopedia.com/indirect-crypto-investment-6386330",

      "body": "While I don't understand why would somebody (especially an individual) risk their money on various \"products\" wrapped around bitcoin instead of buying the \"real thing\" (for corporations the situation may differ, that's why I said individual), there are already a couple of directions, from ETFs, futures and similar financial products to stocks of businesses that have acquired bitcoin. For individuals even \"buying bitcoin\" at PayPal or Revolut is actually not the real deal (afaik they still sell only IOUs).Also there were shares (or similar iirc) to be bought at El Salvador's bitcoin venture, but you can look up in the forum to read how bad they are.These financial products linked to bitcoin can be nice/correct ones or can be some complicated products containing more fees and booby traps than means to earn money.So be very careful. I still recommend going for the real deal - bitcoin - even if that means you have to learn a bit of this or that and also acquire a hardware wallet.",

      "body": "You can invest in stock funds which have bitcoin on their portfolio. Instead of purchasing bitcoin, you purchase paying dividends assets which invest part of their funds in btc. There are retirement funds which also use the same methodology. By contributing to a retirement fund which invests in bitcoin, you are also investing indirectly.However, I don't see why to invest like this. With bitcoin you can cut every middlemen from your personal investments. You can have total control of your assets in your hands and 100% profit in the end, as you don't have to pay fees, taxes or comissions to the stock funds or retirement funds.I believe such funds are more for people who don't have any informatics and internet knowledge, so they have to pay someone to invest for them.",

Without investment, could be yes, but there is an exchange that considers investment as well. As the link says, buying ETF seems like you are buying coins but not directly in crypto, but I don't understand this thing, is that ETF safe for saving your fund to the asset that you don't have full control of? Considering all fo this is a very high-risk decision.",

There are too many places bitcoin mining is not profitable, especially in places where the electricity bill is quite expensive not like in cold places where the electricity bill is very cheap and the place is cold no need for ventilation. So, this still depends on the OP's location. Trading stocks for bitcoin is not an investment without buying, you still trading your asset for bitcoin, Tesla company has a good marketing strategy --they can cover losses once bitcoin drop because they have a lot of money, but on our side, once bitcoin is down, it is hard to get our wallet and spend to trade stocks or vice versa.",

      "body": "I don't think buying crypto related stocks is a good idea. Unless you're well diversified investments, you might be investing in a company with a stronger risk tolerance than you and you'll definitely be investing in a stock with investors that have higher risk tolerances too (so they'll bump the value up already).The lowest risk way to invest in crypto would by to save money in a bank account and invest the ~4% you make a year. Slightly more risky goes towards buying index funds and stocks and using your investment growth to buy bitcoin. The next risky is probably just buying bitcoin.I recommend deciding if there's something you can market in exchange for crypto though as that can produce higher returns at lower risks than everything listed above.",

I mean in exchange of your products you'll acquirw cryptocurrency, not just directly. You just want the longer process because you'll just wait for someone who'll pay your products using cryptocurrency which for me is not worth it since product depreciate overtime, so buying cryptocurrency directly to an exchange is the best and hold it to your own wallet which you hold your own keys.

If so, it is not possible in crypto currency, and if you find one, I think it is risky because someone will be holding your coin.

But issue will come at point when you will be buying them with WETH or ETH since most of them are bought outright with it. You may need to find someone who is reselling an NFT so that you can pay them directly in the fiat. You can wait for the NFT to get valued over the period and then sell it for the fiat currency. This way you will be in the crypto space but you will not be touching any coins. The other way is simply through your brokers. You pay them fiat, ask them to trade in the crypto space, get your profits. Your broker gets the commission and you both stay happy.",
