Usually, the debtor remains “in possession,” has the powers and duties of a trustee, may continue to operate its business, and may, with court approval, borrow new money. A plan of reorganization is proposed, creditors whose rights are affected may vote on the plan, and the plan may be confirmed by the court if it gets the required votes and satisfies certain legal requirements.Source:  https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basicsThe coming weeks will witness more bankruptcies of the platforms exposed to FTX",

Or better question, who's next as this shitshow doesn't seem to stop anytime soon!",

Their business model (and indeed their Terms of Use) was almost identical to that of Celsius. When Celsius collapsed, if you didn't pull everything you owned out of every centralized platform then you weren't paying attention. If you still have coins on any centralized platform today then you are an idiot. Nowhere is safe. Nobody is too big to fail.Don't forget of course that BlockFi can also be added to the growing list of \"Platforms which made statements/tweets assuring everyone that everything was fine days before they collapsed\".

In theory, assuming no problems with liquidity or irresponsible printing those tokens shouldn't be affected at all differently than shiba inu, but again it's theory.The others, like Bybit or Yield App or Nexo are simple centralized platforms, they can go down tomorrow without a warning, just somebody flipping a switch and that's it and there is no list whatsoever on the hundreds of platforms that offer investment plans, not even counting the thousands of fraudulent ones.Just as an example, on both lists they have wirex token listed as normal token for a centralized exchange, wirex itself is seen as a CEX, but they do offer (or did) some insane APY on lending and they also offer blowing plans. Same with nexo, it's tagged \"Services and Payments\" not lending as the token itself doesn't do that but the platform is.I'm fairly confident that the next one to crash won't be one with a smart contract lending pool but a CeFi exchange.",

They might be telling the truth, they might have a really good risk management team and a lot of information on everything that moves in the crypto world, or they could be just the next one to crash.Also, even if everything is fine with nexo internally, even in their tweets they did say this:https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268229084225537QuoteAll these activities – exchange services, crypto-backed loans, collateral liquidations, staking, etc. are revenue generators that require Nexo to hold on and move balances across a number of exchanges & DeFi protocols as part of standard operations. 13/33So at any point, they can end up with frozen or lost coins because of a third party, the risk is there and they know it!",
