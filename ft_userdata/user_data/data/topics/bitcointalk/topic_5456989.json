Some eagle-eyed users spotted our new lightning nodes recently. Yes - that's us! However, there's still more tech work to be done. We'll update once Lightning is fully integrated.If other exchanges follow Binance to integrate lightning network payment for bitcoin transaction, more people will use lightning network.But one thing about lightning network is centralization, most people are not running their own node and they are using centralized bitcoin lightning wallet.",

It's already around 2 months and the integration hasn't been fully implemented yet. I guess this isn't really an urgent concern for Binance. The same with Coinbase. Brian has already spoken of integrating Lightning early in April. As a matter of fact, this might even be an addition they don't really want considering that their revenue from current transactions fees could be significantly affected. Anyway, with the entry of Binance and Coinbase and other huge exchanges I'm expecting the Lightning Network capacity to balloon. At the moment, there's just around $145 million.",
