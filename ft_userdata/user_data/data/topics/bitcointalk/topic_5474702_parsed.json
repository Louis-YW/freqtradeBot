  "content": "Hi BT-forum, I been thinking a bit of what Bitcoin actually have been giving us (me) ¬†I can start with myself. I was quite late in the crypto world and my only regret is that I didn't start earlier! The best thing is that thanks to bitcoin I get an extra income every month from trading and I have find new friends that I probably never would meet if it wasn't for Bitcoin. I also for the first time in my life have been able to save some money for a later period in my life and that is only thanks to Bitcoin. I am a small business owner and the most money always go back into the business, but thanks to the Bitcoin-P2P-trading I am also able to save and hold crypto for long time! ¬† ¬†So conclusion almost everything is better thanks to crypto, at least for me. ¬†I also in the process to set up a crypto payment system in my shops and I got help from this forum with the process. üôèIf I am allowed to ask how about you, what is the best thing that have come to you thanks to Bitcoin (crypto)? And is it any negative that came from it?What we all can and should do is to say thank you to Satoshi! üôè Without him we probably never would have been here and educate us self, and we don't only learn about Bitcoin we learn about how to handle many situations in life.",

It's more of a mental battle here, but if you understand it then it will be easy on your part for a weekly or monthly grind and doing DCA.I'm not sure about trading though, I'm not into it because it might take sometime on my end. I have other jobs to do so I just invest whatever I can and again, it's a slow process but it's reward in the end. Just like in what we are right now, bitcoin has recovered from the lowest low last year, yet we are all looking for the block halving next year. So we still have a lot of time to accumulate and then wait for it to happen as it is a catalyst for next bull run and new all time high.",

And you have right, nothing can solve the problem on the earth or an individuals problem, then individuals and the individual himself, but what he can do is to find paths that will help him reach his goal and BTC have helped me a lot further in my journey!

I don't wait for Bitcoin to go up or down. I buy from one person I know very cheap, then I sell it on P2P websites and make quite good profit (maybe you haven't heard of this yet?). I also HODL Bitcoin and some more assets, but I can't find a reason for not P2P trading since its more or less like a passive income each month and I make more then enough to pay my bills, put food on the table for me and my cats and also keep and HODL crypto for the future. Thanks and keep grinding!",

Indeed in this case trading is also quite good but it will not be able to be done by beginners who are still very high risk and I do not recommend this for beginners.",
