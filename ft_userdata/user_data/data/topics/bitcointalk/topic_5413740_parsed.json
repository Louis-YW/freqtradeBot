  "content": "The same thing that was reported here on Reddit happened to me: BTC payments though Bitpay seem to be brokenI used bitcoins to buy gold through APMEX and was presented a BitPay invoice. I paid exactly what the invoice said to pay and the transaction was quickly confirmed. Regardless, the invoice timed out.I got an email after contacting BitPay and it is clear that the problem is on BitPay's end -- the exchange rates didn't match. The exchange rate used for the invoice was higher than the exchange rate used by their servers.I plan on avoiding purchases that go through BitPay until I hear that they have fixed the problem. It's too much of a hassle.You can try using BitPay, and it might work. And while you can get your money back if it doesn't work, keep in mind that they deduct a fee from your refund.",

Regardless, the invoice timed out.Isn't APMEX or some other website offering any other way for purchasing gold with Bitcoin?BitPay is not relevant for some time especially after they added KYC verification, and there are much better self-hosted open source payment processors they can use like BTCpay server and others.I am not supporting Coinbase in any way but I think they also don't ask for any verification for Coinbase Commerce.(I think goldsilver.com should still accept Bitcoin for Gold purchase in US)",

      "body": "Nobody that I know who uses them for crypto processing has mentioned any issues, and I am the usually the 1st person they call when things like that don't work.Just did 2 transactions through merchants that use BitPay and they went through with no problems, had to make them soon anyway so not a big deal to do the test.With a quick look there is nothing on Twitter about it, and only the one report here and the one on reddit, and the merchant who replied. So it might be isolated, the reddit poster did not say where they were buying from so it could be a merchant cart issue. -Dave",
