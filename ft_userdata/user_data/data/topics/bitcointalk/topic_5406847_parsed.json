  "content": "Bitcoin may have bottomed out – The worst may be over for the Crypto marketsBitcoin soared above $22,000 and Ether above $1,500 on July 18, raising hopes that the worst may be over for the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin’s recovery started on July 13 even as the United States inflation in the month of June hit a 40-year high of 9.1%, much higher than economist expectations of 8.8%, according to Refinitiv.The recovery in Bitcoin and Ether on July 18 pushed the total crypto market capitalization above $1 trillion for the first time since June 13, according to coinmarketcap data.Does the recovery mark the end of the bear phase in Bitcoin? Market intelligence firm Glassnode believes that a “genuine bottom formation could be underway” but more sideways action is likely in the next few weeks.In their latest newsletter, Glassnode said that the realized price, the value of all Bitcoin at the price they were bought, divided by the number of Bitcoin in circulation, is a reliable metric to signal a bear market bottom. During previous bear markets, Bitcoin has spent an average of 197 days below its realized price while it has only clocked 35 days below its realized price during the current bear phase.On similar lines, fund manager Grayscale said in a recent report titled “Bear Markets in Perspective” that Bitcoin moves in market cycles that last approximately “4 years or 1,275 days.” According to Grayscale, the current 2020 cycle completed 1,198 days as of July 12. This means Bitcoin “ may see another 5-6 months of downward or sideways price movement.”Although on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin may have started a bottoming formation, the Bitcoin whales have not yet sprung into action. BlockTrends analyst Caue Oliveira said in a Twitter thread that institutional activity could be tracked by monitoring the “transactional volume moved over a short period of time.” Large transactions have been absent after the month of May, barring the period when Terra LUNA collapsed. Oliveira added that “whales remain in hibernation, waiting for the right moment to take up.”Could Bitcoin price bottomed out and major altcoins remain stuck in a range or is a short-term rally possible?

I'd be convinced If Bitcoin touches $30k. If that happens I'm kinda positive that Btc may either have another run (which I don't think it would be the case for the current global economic crisis we have) or it would at least roam around that range or reach even at $40k. What we're seeing right now might only be a dead cat bounce. Btc is currently at $23,500 though.",

The 4-year cycle pattern will tell you that this whole year might be bearish for Bitcoin. This price increase right now may tell you that there's now enough reason to believe that Bitcoin is already on the road to recovery. So Bitcoin could still go either direction. But this small rise in Bitcoin's price could fuel positive sentiment which brings it further toward $25,000.",

View the current bear market as an opportunity to accumulate coins, rather than horrible times of losses.I concur, without a doubt I'm happy that the price has shown a positive movement but it is simply too early to think that what we saw is the bottom, I remember the previous crypto winter and there were several instances in which it seemed as if bitcoin was going to go up in value relatively fast only for this to not be true, so it is important to keep our expectations in check so we do not invest more money than we cannot afford to lose in bitcoin and then you are forced to sell your coins for a huge loss.",
