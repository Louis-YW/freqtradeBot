  "content": "I am playing provably fair games for 1 year on sites like stake , bc game etc,How provably fair games works :Serverseed: this is provided by the casino itself;Clientseed: this is provided by the browser you’re playing on;Nonce: with each new hand, this variable increases by one so you can keep track of which hand is which by the end of the session.Before you start you will get a hash of the serverseed, which is encrypted. This hash contains the entire game you’re about to play, so the casino cannot change it no matter what. Also, because it comes to you in an encrypted code, you yourself cannot calculate any results for the hands you’re about to play. So you noticed something: in these type of games our client seed also used, people think that provably fair means everything is random , but no ,random in numbers but not in streaksMany people play to capture 100x 1000x , if we play on a fixed bet amount the probability is it will hit 100x in 100spins or more or less but around 100 spins when played on a fixed bet and assume you started betting on a fixed bet and you completed 80 bets to capture 100x ,  it's obvious it will hit in next 40 or less spins but when you increase your bet even 1 % of your previous bet , then it will take another 100 spins to hit 100xMeans capturing 100x is easy when played on a fixed bet amount and in constantly changing bet amount, is hard to capture 100x it can take upto 200 300 spins the algorithm count our nonce and use client seed to determine this player is winning or losing when player is losing then the client seed also sent to server that this player is losing so you will definetly win 2, 3 times in a row.after winning. client seed tell to server that this player is winning then you will notice you are losing more  then previous games after winning sometimes This is my experience from these games i know I am bad to teach but i tested many times .you will always lose when you play provably fair games too longI played provably fair games 1 year and i mostly losed so i am moving to live casino My english is bad and it's hard for me to make you understand ,",

      "body": "In fact, if we play on the most trusted and most popular casino sites, all the games are the same, there's no such thing as fair or unfair.If Tita says it's fair, it's because we won and the dealer lost, was that fair for the dealer, and conversely, we can say it's unfair, if we lose and the dealer wins, is that fair for those of us who only bet and play.So my personal response to the question you made is that all games are the same.Fair or unfair depends on our own mindset not about the problem of the game or even the casino site.Except if we play at a casino which is indeed a scam and fraud often occurs in it, then it can be said that it is unfair. However, the fault is not entirely with the casino or the players, but we are also wrong for choosing to play at a casino that cannot be relied on and trusted.",

Exactly. Anyone with half a mind to know more about how these games work will bring it to themselves to research about what makes these games provably fair but for the majority, that is not the case. If a movement that allows less experienced players to be informed of what part of the game makes it provably fair and why, I think it will do the industry a big solid. Then again casinos also earn cash from belligerent users so this is a farfetched dream.

Point taken. Streaks mean nothing for a game that is randomized, although honestly true random doesn't exist in this world. I do get OP's sentiments but it mostly comes from a lack of information, he just knows something is wrong and being a gambler who lost a lot of money on these provably fair games, he'd of course blame it on the house.",

I agree that the current system is confusing, especially to new users. The verification also takes time. Nobody is going to do that during a fast-paced game like dice where you click and get an instant result but provably fair has become an industry standard.

Results are 4/10, 3/10,7/10,6/10. Provably fair is just the randomness of your game. By doing that I understood how it works. There's no such thing as a lucky seed too. Sometimes one seed could give you a good initial win streak but as it goes on you will feel the changes in the results. So, you could keep on changing those seeds but soon it will try to balance the outcome because some seeds do give you profits in the long run. But short-term gamblers will try to get a new seed so it resets.",
