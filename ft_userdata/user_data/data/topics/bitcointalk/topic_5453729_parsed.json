He taught me so much about my own note collection, he really knows his stuff that m8. I asked him if he had any of these notes left but he only had number 1! Which of course I only drooled over a little bit  . Anyhow let me know if anything comes up, would love to work out a trade as well!Thanks, Tread93",
