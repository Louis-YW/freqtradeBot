I need this data for various types of analysis,for example, like Gann, cyclic, etc.I do not take into account the registration date of the bitcoin.org website (08/18/2008) and the white paper (10/31/2008)and I start from the moment the Bitcoin emission began, namely from 01/03/2009, we have the first data on the sale from Martty Malmi(https://twitter.com/marttimalmi/status/423455561703624704)where he created an exchange office with the name NewLibertyStandart on 10/05/2009 and already on 10/12/2009 he already made the first sale of 5050 bitcoinsat a price of 5.02   -   1฿ ~ 0.00099406$the NLS date in the webarchive ends on 03/02/2010 and the following data from the bitcoinmarket.com exchanger from the date (05/25/2010) to the mtgox date, further questions to the dataI don’t have it, but there is no data between 03/02/2010 and 05/25/2010 and historical snapshots in the web archive from bitcoinmarket, which makes it difficult to confirm the date, maybeHas anyone seen NLS data between 03/02/2010 and 05/25/2010?in addition, I received from the blockchain and added to the chart the volumes of movements in the Bitcoin blockchain during the day, with the exception of rewardsper block, and did not exclude returns, and we see that there were movements in 2009, we will not delve into address statistics and other detailsbut let’s just visually analyze and try to guess whether any of these transactions could be real sales,if Martty Malmi could tell us a little about how many transactions there could have been during this period, for 2010 I have no questions, it shows not onlyan increase in movements, as well as a crazy bullrun when the price soared by 290% from a price of 0.00072 to 0.002828, I wonder what caused the price increase?In total we have withblock 1 - 01/03/2009NoNe - but I will put 0.0001 so that we have the first date defined,start NLS 05/10/2009 - 02/03/2010https://web.archive.org/web/20091229132610/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/page/Exchange+Ratehttps://web.archive.org/web/20100129103612/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/page/Exchange+RateNoNe - but I will fill them with site data https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/05/25/2010 bitcoinmarket startstart mtgox 07/17/2010Some pictures:And some data =)https://github.com/xpnkz/bitcoin_history_data/blob/main/transactions-btc-in-out-2009-2010.csvhttps://github.com/xpnkz/bitcoin_history_data/blob/main/btcusd1d-2009-2010-blk-vol.txt",

It's intriguing to hear about the early days of Bitcoin trading. I'd love to learn more about the first Bitcoin exchange and how it paved the way for what we have today. Do you happen to know more about the evolution of Bitcoin trading platforms since then?",
