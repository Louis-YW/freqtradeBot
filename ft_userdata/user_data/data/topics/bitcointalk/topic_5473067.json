  "content": "First, I would like to start by saying that I'm not affiliated with this project in any way.It's just a project that I have been keeping an eye on for some time because I found it to be interesting, and they just officially launched on the main net a few hours ago, so I thought I'd share[1][2].The app is a non-custodial multi-coin wallet (currently only supports Ethereum, Polygon, and the Nervos network) but should support BTC, SOL, and other coins later. Unlike other wallets, this wallet uses passkeys. You don't need an email, a phone number, seedphrase, or any of that. See here for more info[3].I'd like to hear your thoughts on this? I just started using it and will make sure to post updates as they add more features and coins.EDIT: Moved this to the wallet software board, as the developers are now supporting Bitcoin (SegWit, Taproot) and working on a Bitcoin layer 2 solution (RGB++).[1] https://joy.id/[2] https://docs.joy.id/guide[3] https://joy.id/faqs",

See here for more info[3].On the main page, I saw their animated image explaining the security system using fingerprint and facial recognition. Do they actually implement this?Afaik, it is a very weak security method. They also have a recovery mechanism with some means that I think (tentatively suspect) that backups of privatekeys or mnemonic phrases are (also) stored on their side. My conclusion is that this wallet actually goes against the security standards of crypto wallets in general.",

      "body": "Thank you for introducing Joyid to the Bitcoin Forum. I'm Cipher, the founder of JoyID, and I'm delighted to be here to discuss our new solution to wallet technology. Allow me to provide some insights into the mechanics of this innovative wallet.First and foremost, it's crucial to highlight that JoyID is a non-custodial wallet. Our server never hosts your keys or any form of key shards. With JoyID, you retain 100% control over your private keys.Furthermore, our wallet doesn't directly access your biometric information. While it does utilize the system's biometric verification feature, the wallet only receives the system's response in the form of an ECDSA signature. It remains entirely unaware of how you choose to identify yourself -- whether through Face ID, fingerprint recognition, or a PIN code.Our technology leverages Passkey, a standard supported by the FIDO Alliance and widely adopted by modern devices. It utilizes a dedicated hardware secure chip to generate and manage asymmetric keys, enabling secure signature and verification services right on your device. Passkey is compatible with a range of operating systems, including iPhone, Android, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux. Passkey makes JoyID a wallet with the secure level between software wallet and hardware wallet.By combining these technologies with account abstraction (which maps multiple devices/keys to a single account) on Nervos (a UTXO PoW + RISC-V VM chain), we've created a wallet that's non-custodial, passwordless, mnemonic-free, and doesn't require installation. It also prioritizes biometric security. Our wallet is permissionless, chain-agnostic, and offers instant onboarding feature (10s to create a wallet and never lose). It's a game-changer for the crypto world.And as a Bitcoin advocator and hodler, I'm working on the following features to benefit Bitcoin community. - Bitcoin support, with air-gapped wallet feature, working- Lightening network support, planning- RGB support, planning- Nostr support, already supportedFeel free to ask me anything about JoyID, thanks.",

I read the FAQ, but maybe you can give more details on all of that?",

I think its the same given the color of their UI. It seems you ate fond of their project as it seems you keep up with an updated info on their progress. If its the one used on smartlayer I could say that its run smoothly. You thi k their fingerprint locking and unlocking of wallets is actually a better one for login?",

I think its the same given the color of their UI.Yeah, it's the same JoyID OP is talking about. I just finished reading posts of some dudes in an online group I belong and away from the project's telegram handle. They talked about SLN (Smartlayer) and its claim that's ongoing. Those who lamented they haven't got theirs were directed to check their eligibility status with their JoyID addresses. That's how I got to know it's the same project.I saw a screenshot of someone who got over 2,000 SLN from that airdrop. That's really huge when you juxtapose that with its trading price of >$6. It's unbelievable what people make from airdrops. It's very tempting, and that's why more people are chasing airdrops.",

Anyone more serious and experienced in crypto shouldn't have problems with being a true custodian of keys and not rely on biometrics and face ID as ways of generating and recovering crypto wallets. Your Passkey creates your private keys. And you get your Passkey by providing your fingerprint, face ID, or a PIN. Who else uses such a system? If JoyID where to disappear from the face of the world tomorrow, where could I import my Passkey and continue using my wallet? I know it's open-source, but we can't expect the target audience to build their own instances of the wallet from code.The documentation says that it's not possible to export private keys and seed phrases from devices that support this standard. Apparently, they are working on enabling seed backups in the future. So, users are limited only to systems and services that use the Passkey standard, not like with traditional wallets where you can always import/export private keys and seeds.",
