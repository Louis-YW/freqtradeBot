I created this thread and on the thread I was talking about my plans on how to buy Bitcoin and apply the DCA strategy so I can accumulate Bitcoin but one of the things that made me never to invest in Bitcoin is that I am a bit skeptical of the kind of wallet I can use to hold my Bitcoin, I want to be part of the long term Bitcoin holders and not the short timers.I have a good PC, that's why I want to know about a better wallet that I can use to hold my coins for longer.On that thread I created about my plans, someone suggeste I should use an electrum wallet. Quote from: mocacinno on October 05, 2023, 11:06:55 AMSounds like a plan... The only tip i'd give you is to look into running electrum on an airgapped machine... If you are going to convert around 1/6th of your monthly income to bitcoin, it'll represent a big part of your funds, and it might be a good idear to keep it as safe as humanly possible.you'll need this (official) electrum document to set this up: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlI'd also suggest to test non-\"default\" setups with tBTC before actually using it on the main chain, that way you can make sure you know how everything worksBut I still want to know more about the electrum wallet, although I have clicked on the link, but still want to get more info from you guys.",

I think it's not safe, because you using a PC for storing your assets and also using that same PC for something else like browsing and possible doing airdrops will get your PC compromised.This was how my cousin lost all his assets to keyboard malware, he never told he that he is using the PC for Airdrops and I don't worry because he always hate Airdrops, until he fucked up and I detected that a malware is also switching is address to another when he copy to paste. All his solana tokens and Eth tokens were drained, this happened somewhere in 2022, he had to format the PC before he start using again, PC is very vulnerable to attacks if you are using it for browsing, I trust running Electrum wallet on a smartphone for beginners than running it on a PC unless you won't do any other thing on that PC.",

I think it's better to fund your Electrum wallet already, I mean it's one of the best wallet you could have if you are a bitcoin investor.And besides, in this market, you really need to have the experience and as much as how many threads your read, if you are not practicing it, the information is nothing. So download Electrum verified it and then fund it so at least you will know how wallets works in it's basic form and protect it by having your mnemonic seed safe and secure, (not online).",

It has been around since 2011, two years after Bitcoin’s creation, and has changed little since.5 While this wallet is bare bones in terms of its user interface and commitment to only Bitcoin, it excels at this primary function. Electrum is also more suited for advanced users due to its complex options.Electrum is open source, allows its users to set custom transaction fees, and has the option to choose between legacy Bitcoin and Segwit. It also offers users the ability to determine the level of security they wish to use. For example, you can create a standard wallet, one with two-factor authentication, or a multi-signature wallet. You can also elongate your seed phrase with custom words. Electrum is perfect for the more advanced Bitcoin holder who wants great security features and customizability, all in a simple layout.",

However I hope you have securely backed up your mnemonic seed and private key, those are the credentials that proves you are the owner of that wallet, but if you misplace them, just consider creating a new wallet because their is no way you're getting it back. So I'll advice your store them in a water proof and fire proof safe because of cases of emergencies like natural disaster. Aside that, now is the best time to buy bitcoin, next year we would be experiencing the halving event, and also a tremendous increase in price of bitcoin, so if you've not yet bought your first coin, I think now is the time to act right so you'll not miss this opportunity.",

Non-custodial wallets, in which you maintain control over private keys, are your second-best option. Step it up a step and go offline. Write down those keys and store them in a secure location. The well-known multiwallets like Trust Wallet come in third, although I'd proceed with some caution there. For information on how to use the Electrum wallet, see their official channels. And remember to always check the links twice to avoid falling victim to phishing scams! Oh well, better safe than sorry.",
