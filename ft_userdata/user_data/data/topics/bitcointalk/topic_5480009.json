They all learned whatever good they have ever contributed outside the universities. First lesson, go to bounty's board, read the posts for a week, you'd learn some hard lessons and realize you'll end up developing one of those useless projects with scam being the end game. Lol",

      "body": "Depends.  What do you mean by building potential in Bitcoin?  As in a course that allows the student to learn more about how to use Bitcoin or a course that allows the student to build something on top of Bitcoin or make Bitcoin better?To learn more about using Bitcoin I do not think a course is necessary.  I believe courses are generally way too fast for the brain to store so much information in such little time.  Experiencing on their own and learning in a longer time span is crucial I believe if they want the best experience where they actually learn something.Courses I would take to make better use of Bitcoin are Economy, Business and the likes.If they want to build on top of Bitcoin or make it better then things are a little different.  Economy and Business can still help tremendously depending how you want to make Bitcoin better.  Is it by building a business to help more people get into Bitcoin?  Or is it to make Bitcoin as a Currency much better than it is.  You can make Bitcoin a better Currency by learning how to do coding and strengthening Bitcoin by yourself.",

While I still prefer to say that if you have the opportunity to finish college studies and even go further with masters or doctorate, do it. I have met a lot of people telling that it is not just for promotions and higher salary but all of them commonly say that it is for their personal satisfaction. But with the actual course set that deals focus major courses and skills related to technology and such, it is easier nowadays because experts in their fields have been sharing direct knowledge related to real world job and skills. And about study on this field.I have made a thread about this specific certification or being a Certified Bitcoin professional by C4(cryptoconsortium). But to mind you, many here are Bitcoin professionals but do not see the essence of that certification. As I have said, it can just be for personal satisfaction.",

Hope you have ventured these aspects and seen to Ii that you like them so you don't end up in a university studying a course you don't even like for a period of like 3 or 4 years in the name of Bitcoin because it won't be nice at all.Anyways you must not attend a university to be able to understand technicalities in Bitcoin.

So I think, if you're eyeing a career in Bitcoin, you don't have to stick to the usual tech or finance courses. Sure, computer science is cool, but you can also dive into data science that helps analyze all that blockchain data, while a knack for business or entrepreneurship can lead to creating your own crypto venture.",

Sites like Coursera, FutureLearn are some go the good sites where you can learn with the courses of those universities from comfort of your home. You can also learn advanced technology related things from websites like Udacity and maybe if you have some money or you know how to use coupons then you can get some courses on Udemy for free and start your learning journey.",

Bitcoin and Blockchain technology are some of the areas one can consider building potential while choosing a course of study in a university.I don't think most of the universities have any courses on Bitcoin or Blockchain because these courses have to be allowed by the government's educational authorities, as if I talk about my country then Cryptocurrency is not legalized here so it would be difficult for a university to allow students to have a course about it while governments have not allowed.But other than the government's involvement, we can learn Bitcoin and Blockchain technology on our own from any other private sources, like online tuition, and YouTube Courses, and there are many Udemy courses to learn about these things. But I do understand the importance of practical work among other students and teachers, as this makes a helping and growing community while online is of not that level. And if a university allows such courses then we should take them abrultply as they are the new trends, the funny thing is, universities don't allow such studies here but they happily accept any research proposal regarding to blockchain hehe.",

Trading and investment has nothing to do with it but you can possibly get involved with Bitcoin mining. There are no specific course about Bitcoin technology in universities but you can combine multiple things in order to come up with something new.Are you going to choose quantum science and do us all a favor by creating something that harness energy and creates more energy through low input while conducting less heat. Which is has been the main conversation about Bitcoin being energy hungry. And it is back for environment. So maybe you can choose something from that and do some research to create something which is good for the world and in that process you may end up being a successful person.",

Bitcoin and Blockchain technology are some of the areas one can consider building potential while choosing a course of study in a university.It is no longer as important as before that the department you study and the job you do are the same. This is also the case in the country I live in, and the field you develop yourself in is more important than having a diploma.It doesn't matter which department you study, you can develop yourself in another field. The vast majority of the people I know do not do a job related to the departments they graduated from. Sometimes their living conditions lead them to different jobs and sometimes they choose different fields. If you cannot find a job related to the department you are studying or if you do not want to do it, do not condition yourself and do not give up striving to do the job you want.Sometimes after choosing a department, you can change your decision while studying the department and give up doing the profession you want. So our decisions can sometimes change. If what we want to do is something different from our department, we should know that we can always do it. In today's professions, diploma is not as important as it used to be. Doing a job is more important than having a diploma for that job. This also applies to the private sector or your own business. A diploma is usually required to work in the public sector.",

Bitcoin and Blockchain technology are some of the areas one can consider building potential while choosing a course of study in a university.Economics faculties and computer engineering faculties are still relevant and have something to do with Bitcoin for those who have chosen and have started studying.In terms of economic facts, the course material taught is still around transactions and trading methods as well as market behavior that can be practiced in investment and trading activities by people who use Bitcoin as an investment and trading asset. Like me, who is currently studying at the economics faculty, majoring in management at a university.For those who have chosen to study at an engineering faculty majoring in networking and programming, it is very closely related to Bitcoin technology.But it depends on the person's will, even though the person is studying in that department, but there is no interest in focusing on that section.Lectures are important as formal recognition in the social environment. However, if the goal is to be able to learn Bitcoin technology, lectures are not that important because there are many informal spaces that can be used as a place for learning such as courses.We can also add loads by taking advantage of easy internet access.",

The most accurate course that one can study to understand bitcoin is finance generally because it is all about money. In general, economics majors concern everything related to money, including new technologies, payments using crypto or Bitcoin. This is more suggestive of how the economy is built with new payment technologies. Learning about Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and related technologies specifically may not have a major. But all can be learned in economic learners in general. And this also depends on how each government regulates crypto laws and studies them. But mostly everything is still open about the knowledge of Bitcoin, Blockchain and others.",
