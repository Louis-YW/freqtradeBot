Bitcoin was around $200 or so when I first bought so Iâ€™m sure I was spending a ton of coins on things worth a tiny fraction of that value today.",

I spent it on internet payments, buying fuel and kitchen supplies.Fluctuating prices can't be resisted but I think when there are assets that can be exchanged it is very useful for my needs. I don't regret the current price. stays the same and stays at the value I need.summer is still on and its time to save my btc.i believe btc will come back and surpass ath. and my income will be more than my previous Btc.I usually only spend a few $.",

Must be a consumer product or service, etc.What was the date and price of BTC at the time?It hurts me when I flash back or come across this kind of question. I wish I had known about this forum before now, it would have helped me to properly plan my BTC spending and investment. And talking about the BTC I had spent on something, there are many of them to the extent that I've lost count. But the highest amount spent on frivolities at a specific time was 0.8 BTC in 2019 when Bitcoin was 3901.85 because I still have the withdrawal record. The most painful part is that the amount was the peak of my earnings since then and I was unable to make money when Bitcoin rose between 2020 - 2021. I didn't believe in Cryptocurrency then, and it hurts till today.",

It was roughly $100, if I remember well, and I spent this money on buying two hoodies, but also as a charity thing, which is why it's more than I'd probably spend just on a random hoodie on a shop. Unfortunately, I haven't spent much BTC directly because of a lack of ways of doing it. I wouldn't spend Bitcoin on something I wouldn't otherwise buy, and things I do spend money on usually aren't those easily available for purchase in BTC.",

Maybe some will say that it was stupid to spend Bitcoin back then because today we could buy much more for the same amount, but if you looked at things like that, then I would never have spent even 1 satoshi.I can't say at the moment what I spent the most on, but maybe the most expensive was a very expensive TV, although I also bought computers, smartphones and a lot of other electronics.",

But don't get me wrong, I didn't buy it with btc but with fiat even though I had to convert 0.053 btc to fiat on the local exchange.The government still prohibit us from using crypto as a legal tender until now, and that's why I dare not pay sellers with bitcoin. Converting it to fiat is one way out, so it's safe for me to make transaction. Luckily for me at that time the government had not applied a tax for every transaction of converting crypto to fiat or vice versa, but now the tax has been applied although it is still quite acceptable as a reasonable limit.",
