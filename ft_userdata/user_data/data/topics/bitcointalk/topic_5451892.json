What is really happening in the blockchain? I was trying to made a transaction of 0.003 bitcoin but the change rate is too big that I could not made the transaction. I checking the fee within 4/4 hours to see if the price of the charging rate would come down but it couldn't. And I was thinking of the possible reason of the high hike of price.This is the first I checked around 9pm on the 7th of May 2023.Mining Fee: 0.000806 BTCFee Rate: 44.3 sat/BSecond rate within 4 hours intervalMining Fee: 0.001273 BTCFee Rate: 454.6 sat/BThird rate in the same period of time.Mining Fee: 0.0013 BTCFee Rate: 522.1 sat/BI was checking it because I am in dire need of cash.  It the fee is making me to be scared to make a transfer of the coin to an exchange for marketing. Why is it that the fee price is going up every second to scare people?",
