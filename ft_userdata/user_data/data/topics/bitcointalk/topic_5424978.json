The decentralized hybrid exchange (Byte Hybrid Exchange) will be built on it.  It is planned to be a cradle for DEFI projects with smart contract support (2023).Byte Hybrid ExchangeIt is decentralized exchange where all Cex functions such as limit-market order, stop loss can be used by connected with your wallets (metamask, trust wallet, Byte Wallet, etc.) whose private keys you have (2023).Byte Exchange (CEX)It is centralized exchange targeting users who are unfamiliar with the use of Dex and prefer a centralized structure. It has technology and infrastructure to provide \"minimum necessity of Trust\".\"People shouldn't even has to rely on their exchange platform to trade cryptocurrencies\" is the motto of Byte Exchange.

      "body": "First of all, Byte Exchange is a Cex. Centralized part of Bytedex Ecosystem. The main aim is that creating Hybrid Exchange which runs with smart contracts on dual layer blockchain (Bytechain).I am not the authorized person which can present a document. I can say about insuranced funds that some partnerships are being negotiated.Yes you cannot use VPN with Byte Exchange.Assigning IP's is an option for people who want more security. People can assign spesific IP's to reach their accounts. This is an option. No, people don't lose their assets if trying to reach from different IP's. They can reach support services of Byte Exchange. Then, They request to remove blockage. If you don't like assigning IP, don't use. So, the idea that controlling people, is irrelevant. As I said in the first post, Byte Exchange is a Cex. But, Bytedex final aim is building a platform which gathered Cex functionality and dex security. This is not a bullshit. This is vision!",

Could be because you are not advertising your exchange much and hence not many users know about it. I'd suggest you to promote it more in the forum via exciting airdrops, sig. campaign, promotion via twitter, tg camps etc. Also, could you link to some strong audits (done by any reputable auditor) who have audited this exchange already?",
