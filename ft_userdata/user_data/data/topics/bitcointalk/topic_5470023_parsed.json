  "content": "In Nigeria almost all the drainage has a blockage just from the fact that citizens has turned the drainage to dump yard and they suffer from it especially during this period of rain. The government are not trying the little that is done should be appreciated and cared for because when it gets bad again we still gonna suffer it. It's raining season and we can see the effects of this, when they are poured into drainage. How many times have you gone out during this raining season and have not seen a block drainage leading to road or other places filled with water. We mostly don't care till it affects us that like the biggest issue in Nigeria. Let's try to limit the use of rubber and plastic and even if we do use it, let's us try to dispose them properly.This causes soil and water pollution (since plastic is a non-biodegradable waste).Pet coke use the tag RECYCLE Me but most times it's still end in drainage Is not everything the government has to enact laws on before we know is badPray God help us to the right thing always",

I don't really know about the rural areas in my state though but I won't really blame the government for this because the little ones done on the road is not even cared for. In some ways the circle of life of governors is different government fixing the same problem because is either its not done properly or the citizens carelessly spoilt it.",

Challenges like these are caused by our human activities and we cannot expect the government to help in this situation when we needed to take actions on ourselves, if one has experienced flooding before will have a better understanding foe the needs of having the drainage free of water movement than blocking them with refuse dumps, it's also not hygienic for the environment we lived in because it will cause many diseases through stagnant water infection.",

I no blame them sha...na our institutions wey dey weak dey cause some kind rubbish. If to say we get strong institutions wey sabi enforce laws for this country, so many people suppose go prison make them correct their brain small. I remember Cross Rivers State of those days wey be say if you drink pure water through the satchet for street, police don carry you one hand.
