  "content": "Since the Han Solo miner, Nerdminer, Bitaxe initiative, and the Public Pool release (a solo mining pool with a low share threshold), I've been thinking in a way to incentivize community mining: some king of intermediate pool (a cluster of miners that connects to an actual mining pool). The odds of getting hit by a meteorite are higher than earning a reward with some of those devices. In cases where people can submit shares to a pool, the payouts are just a few sats and it's boring. Could there be something like \"Intermediate Pools\"? (Not like NiceHash, but BTC-native and open-source.)Here's the basic idea:The intermediate pool resends work from a mining pool (not solo) it has joined to the small miners. With a much easier share threshold, the intermediate pool counts the contributions of these miners and broadcasts those shares to the mining pool. The intermediate pool then collects the reward from the mining pool and distributes it to the smaller miners in a consensually fair manner (that's the tricky part).This could involve randomness, challenges, and other community-driven events to make mining a bit more social, it could even use LN (I know, not easy).Some concerns:Delay: Introducing an intermediary might introduce some lag. How much delay is too much? Complexity: Even do it as simple as possible I'm aware it won't be easy.Any ideas on other risks?Thoughts?",

I am not sure if this is the correct one.Thank you",
