      "body": "just curious, other than that you can adjust the speed from 10-200 rolls per second on lightning bet, what exactly is the difference between lightning bet and flash bet?anyway, is the gambling site that you've shown on your screenshot operational? I tried accessing it and I always get \"page isn't working\" when I type \"gigabet.com\" on the address bar. also, if you type gigabet.com on the search bar on Google, the first result that will be shown to you is a very suspicious website that is named \"gigabet\" but the URL is \"m.gigabet.bet\".",

Could you be a little more specific about what exactly you're looking for?By the way, there are many casino sites that offer flash bets in dice games; all you need to look around and choose one of the more reputable platforms.",

      "body": "Gigaget no longer exists hence my question. Basically gigabit allows you to make up to 200 rolls per second and have a minimum bet of next to nothing (something flash bet is lacking). You could make incredibly low risk strategies that would not normally be profitable because of them having such a low basebet, profitable because of the insane bet speed. Also you didn't have to set parameters in order for it to stop you could wait until you saw what you were looking for and then stop it yourself. Another big difference between it and flash bet is you could let it run forever, you weren't limited by setting a number of rolls.",

I'm talking about the Seuntjies DiceBot - Multi-Site, multi-strategy betting bot designed specifically for dice games. It works with many gambling websites; all you need to do is activate API access.I'm not sure if it can handle 200 bets per second, but it likely operates much faster than the standard automatic betting feature on casino platforms. On the flip side, it offers the flexibility to place bets with minimum amounts and configure complex strategies and conditions, and you can let it run forever.",

With lightning bet you could adjust the speed from 10-200 rolls per second. Im not looking for sites that offer flashbet im just looking for something similar to this.Most of the dice site that offering the feature of bulk bet per seconds are already close. Flashbet or Instant bet feature are the new alternative for the lightning bet you are searching for. You can try Duelbits dice instant bet or Bitsler speed since it has an option to adjust speed based on your preference and check whether this speed standards will work to you. Duckdice flashbet might interest you too.",

I'm not 100% sure exactly how it works as far as minimum bets, maximum bets, setting win/loss or all that. I just know I've used it a couple times and they do offer it.I know that's not what you're looking for but it is probably the only thing you'll find. I play on Just dice from time to time as well and you can use your own bot there and get 100-200 bets per minute. Only issue is its for clams, not anything else.",

There is a flash bet feature and I think it works similar to what you described from the Gigaget site. You can have a minimum bet down to just a few satoshis, probably even cheaper with other cryptocurrencies.https://duckdice.io/faq#aboutflashbetAlso, you can give Flashbet mode at Wolf.bet casino a try. You can place an unlimited number of bets, and the minimum bet amount in flashbet mode is approximately $0.002 or the equivalent value in another cryptocurrency.https://wolf.bet/faq",
