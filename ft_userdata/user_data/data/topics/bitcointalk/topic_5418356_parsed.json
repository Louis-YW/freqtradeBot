But Nitrogensports is doesn't have a good reputation, so you should know the risk.

A lot of the 3rd party Slot providers has geographical restrictions, so most of the games are not available to US players.  It gets a bit tricky if you use a VPN and you win something big, because the casinos will use that as an excuse not to honor the withdrawal, if you played with a VPN. (Then suddenly, KYC verification is asked)",

And unfortunately, there is a site that provides this method, you can see it at the link I put below.https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/vpn-for-stake/",

As others have said, sensible US players who want to be sure that their money and account still exists the next day should be playing on fiat currency local casino sites - of which there are plenty out there. I don't know of a single regulated cryptocurrency accepting casino in US borders, but maybe others do. Casinos are often battling against money laundering and presenting a believable story to the regulators in America, which requires KYC, thus defeating the purpose or extra step of converting cash into Bitcoin. You are at high risk of losing your account trying to hide your overseas gambling, because overseas gambling sites avoid US customers like the plague - they've seen too many extraditions and prosecutions of casino owners from friendly countries to make it worthwhile.",

More than 10 years ago it was also illegal to play poker for US citizens, although most online houses turned a blind eye, until April 15, 2011, when the DoJ \" issued an indictment against the three largest online poker websites in in the country: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker. Immediately following the indictment PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker, who generated the majority of online poker traffic, stopped offering players the chance to play for real money, effectively halting the poker boom started in the early 2000s and jeopardizing the livelihood of thousands of American poker players.\"I guess a puritanical mentality has a lot to do with the fact that online gambling is banned in many states. The best thing they could do is to legalize it throughout the USA with proper regulations and open it up to the world market.",
