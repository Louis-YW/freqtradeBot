However, food price standards can often be used as a benchmark for other prices. The price of standard food is of course the price you buy at an ordinary food stall, not at a fancy restaurant. Like in my country, we only need around $1 - $2 to buy a standard meal, the menu provided is usually rice, chicken/meat and vegetables, plus a cold drink such as iced tea or orange juice.",

What is the average monthly and annual income in your country? Please those who answer can use calculations in USDNote: I don't need the tables issued by the government because they are usually different from the reality on the groundGetting exact information will be kinda difficult because cost of things varies from location to location even in the same country. The things are more expensive in  city based areas than local places and again, what type of meal do you considered standard? Well, in my country, the average income is actually not much (about $30-$35) but likewise, the cost of things are not too expensive. Unfortunately, the recent economic crisis troubling every nation has inflate and skyrocket the cost of things but even with such situations, with $1.5 you can obtain a decent meal of rice, beans, salad or any other vegetables of your choice, chicken or beaf and cold drinks. You'll still have some little change remaining. This calculation and analysis is based on my current location and it's a local area where they engage in farming and animal rearing. To some, this might not be a standard meal but it is at least average considering the income.If we are to talk about the house rent and other expenses, then we must also consider the type of environment you're living in. At this present place, it cost $80-$100 to rent a single room with bathroom, toilet and kitchen per annum. Other expenses like transportation and electricity depends on individual usage. You can spend up to $10 on electricity monthly depending on how many units you use per day and transportation depends on how far your place of work is. Averagely, $0.5 daily on transportation for to and fro. It's still impossible for one to live comfortably with just a single means of income unless you have no plans for future. Its high time to look for alternatives means and increase the income in order to meet up with bills and other plans.",

In my country, prices of things varies based on the location you find yourself and the truth is that non of it is cheap as they are all on the high side as a result of the dollar exchange rate as we virtually depend on importation whereby virtually everything we consume in our country are imported except for the few local products that is produced in the country and even at then, the prices are on the high side. House rent is  drastically on the rise, transportation is every day thing as fuel price is increasing too. So you can see that even in some countries, all prices for the same produce varies based on the location where you find yourself. I will do a proper findings to get the accurate  figures to update here because if one depends on the government figures, I bet you it would be wrong because they are not reliable as they have no idea what is happening as all they know is to embezzle funds.",

      "body": "About 4 years ago, I worked for a company in the city with an income that I thought was very good, converted to about $1500, and actually, with that income, living expenses were not a concern of mine. Because every month, I only spend about $200 for rent + $150 for food and transportation + incidental expenses of only <$100. But I have completely moved to a place that is considered quite rural, where the cost of living is no longer a problem because I can earn my own food every day, and growing food is quite comfortable. I have a small house near the hill, and there are also ponds around. Perhaps few choose the life I have now because the friends who often contact me and also often meet at my house all say my life is simple. I'm not sure, but in the place where I live, which is considered a country with a developing economy, I think the amount that people can easily earn monthly regardless of the job is probably > $300. With such an amount of money depending on living needs, the spending, IMO is enough so that people don't have much pressure. But for those who have bigger goals in life, of course they have to make an effort to get a good job, so they can build a house, buy a car, get married,... Anyway, for me now life is quite peaceful.",

The price of things have so skyrocketed that it is quite difficult to say exactly what meal is actually a standard meal or not. What might be a standard meal to one person might not be called a standard meal to the next person.  This is as a result of the differences in purchasing power of these individuals.  In my country,  many people are  just eating to survive,  it doesn't matter if it is a balanced diet or not because they are preparing what they can afford. Food wastage has decreased greatly. Who would want to waste a meal you spent fortunes to prepare? This is the situation of things now, not just on foodstuffs but on all commodities and  services that have a price tag.",

However most monthly incomes in my area are also around $150-200 as this is the minimum wage standard.When talking about the cost of living, of course each region is different. Moreover, living in a small town means the cost of living will be cheaper than in a big city. Lombok is a tourist area, of course the cost of living is slightly higher. However, what is clear is that in each region in Indonesia the cost of living is definitely different.Cost of living in my area:1. House rent (including electricity and jet pump bills): $352. Transportation cost is about $10 - $153. The food was probably about the same, about $50-65 for three meals a day with standard meals and we also got hot tea.",
