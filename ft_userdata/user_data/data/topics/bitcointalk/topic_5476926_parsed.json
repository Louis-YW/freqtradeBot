Lets make it simple, how this bonus works? Is the bonus credited automatically as unlocked bonus which players do not need to claim by inserting a code? As per general terms, the formula to unlock bonus is adjusted_wager / 50 * 20%, is it the same formula applied for this Massive Bonuses? Or there are maybe some other different terms for this bonus which cant be found in the general TC page?",
