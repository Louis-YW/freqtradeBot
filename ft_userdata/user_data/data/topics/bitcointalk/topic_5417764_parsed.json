  "content": "It is said, that Liquidity Providers on Uniswap will earn from the swap fees, that the trader have to pay.Question: Is the amount a LP will earn depending on the pair he is providing liquidity?For example will I earn more with ETH/USDC than USDT/USDC ?Or do all become the same amount?(I think it would not be fair if everyone got the same amount, because \"impermanent Loss\" is bigger with ETH/USDC than USDT/USDC.)Thank you.",
