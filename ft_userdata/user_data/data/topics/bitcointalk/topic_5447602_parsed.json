And secondly you need to show some proof of your conversation with them so that anyone can help you from there maybe if they have any representative it couybe possible to access them with your claims.",

Does histakes have a legitimate license? Have there been any complaints online - you can search on google and on their social media's. Do you have the real web address or perhaps did you get lured unto a phishing site? You can find many red flags if there is anything shady going on with that casino.  I am not trying to say that histakes is shady or anything and by no means do I wish to alarm you.After googling the words \"Histakes.io\" and \"scam\", the first result is on Trustpilot and I can already find several scam accusations. And only 11 reviews...    Best to stick to casinos that have been vetted by the Bitcointalk community in the future.Hope you get your money back..Also, if it turns out that they are scammers, you should probably make sure the government identity documents you gave them are flagged as stolen. Otherwise you might find out that you have been the victim of identity theft. And that can become very serious (especially if somebody takes out a loan in your name). One of the reasons I abhor KYC.",

      "body": "Never heard of this gambling site as well But I guess it would be better to show your proofs and conversation with the gambling site in this post for it to have further attention and to give it a bigger chance for your fund to be withdrawn. It is sad that your concern is pending already for 5 days, try following it up more but if it would cross a month, I guess it would be time to accept things unless you have something to come after them perhaps site's registration, but if not, this will just be a learned lesson. What's unfortunate as well, are gambling sites being not responsive on such issues. As OP have mentioned they have closed the sportsbook and left casino alone, which could even be a sign of bankruptcy? and if not they should atleast compensate their players whose funds got stucked.",

Have they given you the reason why the withdrawal is still pending after 5 days? Have you had any type of conversations through chat or email regarding the issue? if you have you might want to take a screenshot and post it as evidence.upon checking their website it seems that they didn't actually remove their sportsbook, they just remove the link. if you search \"histakes.io/en/sports\" you will be directed to it. I'm making an assumption here based on your post, judging from their action I have a feeling that they either don't want to pay you your winnings or they don't enough funds to pay you, either way, their actions are clearly shady.",

Not saying that they have a bad reputation, but we don't like to take risk and then face issues later when we win and then we can't withdraw our money.As @Dr.Bitcoin_Strange, the best thing to do is to make some noises on their social media account to get their attention so that the support or even the owner themselves will see your issue and maybe they will respond to you in timely manner. Just be ready though to prepare your accounts or even KYC if they are going to asked you to send to them before they will allow you to withdraw (it could have been in their ToS).",
