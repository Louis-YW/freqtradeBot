      "body": "Bitcoin is different from other cryptocurrencies in many ways. It stands first before the rest of the cryptos and I do not take anyone who promotes any other crypto aside bitcoin serious. I always feel that there is a sinister motive behind it. Because why should anyone promote a less secure, highly unscalable and centralized asset over bitcoin.

And I would say this is more powerful than those personality who says that they have this X amount of Bitcoin investments.And isn't it obvious by this time that Bitcoin is one asset that everyone should invest? average Joe or Bitcoin whale? With the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF, this hedge fund managers or anyone who managed large money for a clients will evidently pitch Bitcoin to their clients as they wanted to make profits from their customers.",

What you say is not wrong, investing in a bitcoin ETF is no different from investing in stocks, we don't actually own bitcoins or have full control over our assets. But you also need to understand that not everyone is qualified and knowledgeable enough to learn about private keys, non-custodial wallets...and we cannot deny that thanks to the emergence of bitcoin ETFs, bitcoin is gradually becoming more popular with everyone. Many people hesitate to invest in bitcoin because of concerns about its legality, their wallets being hacked...and do not invest in bitcoin. But now with the emergence of ETFs, they can invest in bitcoin without the technical barriers they were concerned about.",

The altcoins or other type of crypto-currencies are only there because of Bitcoin and anyone who invests in Bitcoin is much more safe then the ones who invest in altcoins.There are some OGs on this forum who completely avoid other altcoins and believe that only the king of the crypto market Bitcoin is the only coin which one should choose for investing.",
