  "content": "The endless possibilities around Bitcointalk community can't be over looked, I found the community to be a place specially made for business wise and mindset alike, So much has been discussed already and i advice all newbie's like my humble self to highly get involved and learn as much as possible.During the past few days, i've come to realized that over zealousness to get recognized in the platform is leading most newbies toward destructions. With the recent compiling list of banned account i found on the platform, i could only wish. That those newbies really takes out time to study and stay banned free.With the subject matter above, Instead of chasing recognization, my advice to newbies is to get acquainted with the platform. Educate your self in some certain areas and topics. This is necessary for daily improvement and investment growth. Do not rush, take it a step at a time, by so doing the recognition you chase will be placed before you. I recommend all newbies to stick with this beginner and help sections for days before thinking of other sections of the platform, By so doing. You gradually become a pro in your area of specialization.",

Plagiarism is a result of a desire to cheat the system and benefit from an idea or thought that doesn't belong to you.",

And most newbies tend to Plagarise alot even after learning the consequences of Plagarism in the forum they still go around plagarising without referencing the source. My advice is that \"if you come across any discussion in the forum and you don't know anything concerning what's been discussed instaed if looking for an article to copy from why not just read everything that's been discussed so that when next you come across similar topic you'll have an idea of what to reply.\"Some users behave as if they're gonna get punished if they don't reply to a post.",

Some were and some may still be banned because they post a plagiarized contents on beginners and help board. As long the newbies are patient, taking time to read what established members are posting, reading the quality posts than posting, they will understand more and have a good discussion. But many newbies just want to grow as fast as possible and some plagiarized and spam until they get banned.",

They know about merits, and they care about rank, but they can't read all the forum rules. I recently re-read all the rules. I'm just surprised at all the questions that come up here from newbies who ask what is very accessible and legible in the rules. By asking such questions, newcomers once again attract attention to themselves, and after that, they are simply checked regularly. The pursuit of rank, not knowledge, betrays them very quickly. Hence, the bans and getting negative tags.",

I have really seen this very two saying apply in the forum, as there are nothing really new in here and we are here to learn, unlearn and learn again.One major advice for my fellow newbies is to be bold to ask questions when the need be and be ready to learn.",
