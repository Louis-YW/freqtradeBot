  "content": "Hi all,I am starting with the lighting network, specifically with Core Lighting (C-lighting). I was looking for information about how to execute remote commands on the node.I mean, locally you can execute \"lighting-cli $option\" commands but I'm looking for a way to do it remotely without SSH connection.I thought the node had an API where I could do petitions but, I do not find anything on the Internet regarding this without using additional server.Does this API exist? If it does, please could someone share some documentation about this?If not, please feel free to share your sugestions about how could I interact with the node remotely without SSH.Thanks in advance.Best Regards,SS",

But thanks for the example.As far as I can see they (RTL) build a server on the node computer and play with a plugin configuration option on the node. So I guess this is the answer. I need an additional server on the node side. So the schema should look similar to this:      10.0.0.1(client) -- > 10.0.0.2(server) --> 10.0.0.2(node)",

One of the big differences between C-Lighting and LND is that C-Lighting is more 'modular' you need something you add it in.

I'm only using C-Lighting for the moment as I need to use that specific node due a specific reason. But it's nice to know that other implementations have this kind of things already implemented.Quote from: DaveF on March 22, 2023, 12:10:18 PMObligatory, use testnet when playing around and testing or don't commit funds you can't afford to loose if you are tinkering and detonate something.....Yes sure, I'm using a LN simulator called Polar.",
