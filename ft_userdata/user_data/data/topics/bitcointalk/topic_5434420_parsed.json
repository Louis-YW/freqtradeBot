  "content": "Good day BTT Famz, is there any danger at all using DNS server on a android phone? Smartphones of today comes with feature where you can change your DNS server and this help my phone to speed up when browsing.I have to be careful with every changes I made, just in case, so I want to know if there are any history of hacks through DNS servers or even Data leaks. The last is, how possible of leaking your recovery seed through the DNS server? Never heard of this but gotta be very careful.",

DNS sever performs a conversion from Doman name (i.e. Bitcointalk or any human readable URL) into IP address. this process also known as address translation. So its not a a part of internet connection and there they don't see your recovery seed.Also, with the exception of the web wallet, the seeds are encrypted in a file, and then you need a password to decrypt that encryption, while the hacker needs both the file and the password, and therefore there is no logical reason for you to enter your wallet seeds in an online device.",

      "body": "Actually the choice of DNS provider is what matters, not the type of device you are using. As far as I know, the DNS Server does not set up storage to record (inputable) any user data, but it can be configured to \"rogue\" mode which can redirect the user to various dangerous sites (like phishing) and the data can be intercepted by an attacker especially if the DNS queries not protected by encryption.",

As said, a DNS transforms the nice name of a website into an IP address.At least in theory a malicious DNS can send you, instead of website A you know and want to use, to website B, which can even look like website A, just (also) steal your data.This being said, entering the wallet seed into online services / web wallets / apps built around web wallets was never great for your coins' security.On the other hand, with a normal stand-alone wallet, there's a higher risk coming from the auto-completion features of your phone's keyboard program than from the rare DNS hacks.",
