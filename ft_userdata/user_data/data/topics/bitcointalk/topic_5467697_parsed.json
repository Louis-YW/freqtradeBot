My username and account name are both the same:  @minerjonesSame as here.....   I would like to add that there are symbols in other languages with a totally different ascii code that can look the same as the letters we are used to in English. There are probably plenty of @minerjones permutations. Generally speaking it’s good practice to be a slight nuisance and double check by requesting a bitcointalk dm from the correct username id to verify. Did this with liquid and a few others before trusting external bitcointalk communication.",
