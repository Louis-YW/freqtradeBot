      "body": "There may be a lot of Indian cryptocurrency community members who have invested heavily either in Ethereum or in its ecosystem. I had once read that the Ethereum ecosystem is many times bigger than the Ethereum market cap. I have some coins from the Ethereum ecosystem and some Ethereum as fuel. I am confident that many from the Bitcoin Indian community have invested heavily in Ethereum, and some might be profiting from the ecosystem. I believe Bitcoin would be the biggest percentage wise in the portfolio of most of us. We are here because we love Bitcoin and want to earn more Bitcoin. Some of us might have invested, before 2017 when Bitcoin was dirt cheap and some of us might be still in accumulation mode regardless of its price. In 2023 it is just like how our families in the past would accumulate gold for the worst time. ¬†Although, gold gets more preference than Bitcoin in India because of the negative environment created by the government and due to a lack of knowledge. I feel with the next bull run the mindset of an average Indian belonging to the middle class and the upper class would change drastically.",

I agree with your point that the Ethereum ecosystem is much bigger than Ethereum itself. It was designed in a way that can enable other projects to utilize its Blockchain. Its ecosystem is the reason why Ethereum grew so much in a short span of time. Vitalik is a poster boy of the ecosystem still it he will not be able to get as much popularity as Satoshi has by staying anonymous.",

In general, how much you owe to this guy for your success in crypto business.Waiting for your replies.Thanks.I have it. Just a random 15% of my portfolio, simple logic is that it ain't a shit coin it has delivered what it was made for and even delivered much more than that. Talking it in this way this guy has actually made a big impact on the crypto industry as a whole. I used to feel that on day Eth will surely take over bitcoin in terms of price and market cap, this was the time when I added it into my folio, now I highly doubt this would happen but still a worthy investment.",

      "body": "Bitcoin and Ethereum were created for entirely different purposes and they are indeed serving the targeted audience instead of shitcoins which has been created just to lure the maximum money from investors. Cryptocurrency market as we know today have outgrown only because of the builders who were present on Ethereum and not on Bitcoin. Bitcoin on the other hand, never allows the developers to build solutions on top of the currency unlike Ethereum which has been created for the sole purpose of improving the usability of cryptocurrencies other than using them as a mere currency as opposed to the governments.I have been a hardcore Bitcoin enthusiast in the past and I would like to admit that sadly, but after learning about the technicalities of Ethereum back in 2020 and becoming a Smart Contract Developer recently my respect towards the Ethereum community has risen significantly. Ethereum was never meant to be used as a Digital Gold and stacking them would never be as fruitful or profitable as Bitcoin since Bitcoin is finite and never rises up in supply unlike other Smart Contract currencies such as ETH, BNB, SOL or MATIC which acts as a fuel for the smart contract platforms.Quote from: pakhitheboss on June 29, 2023, 06:56:14 AMIn a lot of ways, Solana is better than Ethereum and that was the reason it got good support initially.

It is a possibility that the next Bitcoin bull market might recover the price. Just like the rivalry between Microsoft and Apple in the early 90s where Mac would be announcing and designing entirely the opposite of what Windows does, Ethereum and Solana have become the rivals in Web3.0 space but right at the moment the development and community support on Ethereum is insanely high which cannot be compared towards the Solana community. To fuel this forward, after the shocking demise of FTX last year the inflow of funds from investors have gone down significantly which has caused a greater dent in the developer community of Solana. Even Ethereum was down badly by 90% in 2018 bear market but they were never really affected by any external sources such as how FTX played the game in pumping their Solana Bag. Almost 90% of the innovations happen only on Ethereum and Solana is lagging behind and as you stated, there needs to be greater catalyst for Solana to move forward in the next run.",

I am well aware of the technology as I only invest in something after a thorough research.I was not willing to sell it but whats the use of a blockchain technology if it cannot be trusted.
