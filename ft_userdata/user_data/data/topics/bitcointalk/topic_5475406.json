  "content": "The people on this site cannot handle any intellectual scrutiny. And the explanation for the sorry state of Bitcoiners is quite clear. Bitcoin has a mining algorithm that was never designed to advance science, so Bitcoin attracts people who have trouble forming grammatically correct sentences and complete thoughts. The people on this site are also deeply anti-innovative. They somehow believe reversible computation is impossible, infeasible, or 100 years away even though people knew how to make reversible adiabatic circuits back in the 1990's which recovered 99.999% of the energy per cycle as long as one does not include the dissipation in the power supply and clock distribution. This means that the remaining problems with reversible computation (power supply and clock distribution) are difficult engineering challenges, and one has to have a good reason to believe that it is not possible to overcome these challenges. Reversibility happens in nature (the transcription of DNA into RNA which consumes less than kT energy because the process is reversible). Yes. Nature figured out a way to engineer reversibility so that we do not consume >>100kT for every single little thing.It is a royal shame that reversible computation is getting nothing but hatred when there are other ideas such as power from nuclear fusion and quantum computation that people tend to gobble up uncritically. In case you did not know this, in order to get power from nuclear fusion, one has to create and sustain conditions for years that are more severe than the center of the sun (the sun takes 10 billion years to consume all of its fuel). Oh. And the only way that we have figured out how to do this is to use superconductors that must be cooled to 4K which are right next to the center of the sun.'Quantum computers' have never done anything useful, and they probably won't do anything useful for a while. If we want useful quantum computation, we should then work on reversible computation since the proper progression is irreversible classical computation==>energy efficient (partially) reversible computation==>quantum computation. Anyone who skips the middle step is simply giving into hype. It is best to just ignore the hype behind quantum computation. If you can read the scientific literature, then do that and only that.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D. (Mathematics)",

I understand the section is \"off-topic\", but he was so insulting to the community in his opening remarks, I'm not sure if this topic has any relation to BTC. Perhaps I'm just one of the \"dummies\" he talks about, but I did get really good grades in school.  Quote from: DieterNeustadt on January 13, 2024, 08:02:25 PMReversible computation is a concept in computer science that refers to the ability to compute both forward and backward through a given computation. In reversible computing, operations are designed in a way that allows for perfect information preservation, meaning that no information is lost or destroyed during the computation.While reversible computation has been an area of research and interest in the field of computer science, it is important to note that it is not yet widely implemented in mainstream computing systems. Most modern computers and electronic devices use irreversible computation, where information is lost through processes like heat dissipation and energy consumption.That said, reversible computation holds potential benefits and applications, particularly in areas such as quantum computing, low-power computing, and fault-tolerant computing. Some potential advantages of reversible computation include energy efficiency, increased computational speed, and the potential for error correction.In the field of quantum computing, where information is stored and manipulated using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, the concept of reversibility is fundamental. Reversible operations are essential for maintaining the coherence of quantum states and enabling quantum algorithms.While reversible computation shows promise in certain contexts, there are also challenges and limitations to its widespread adoption. Implementing reversible computation requires specialized hardware and design considerations, which may come with additional costs and complexity. Furthermore, not all computational tasks can be easily expressed in a reversible manner.Overall, while reversible computation is an intriguing concept with potential applications, its widespread adoption and realization as \"the future\" of computing will depend on advancements in hardware design, algorithms, and the specific needs and trade-offs of different computing domains.I find this challenging topic interesting, thank you for the useful input, DieterNeustadt.",

Yes. Reversible computation is related to Bitcoin. People on this site are not very respectful towards me, so I do not know why anyone is surprised when I don't respect others either.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
