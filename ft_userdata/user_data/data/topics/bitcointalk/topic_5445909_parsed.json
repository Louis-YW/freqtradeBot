  "content": "Just saw this website on twitter: https://ftxnetworth.com and I must say, it's quite intriguing. The website provides statistics and leaderboards about losses in the cryptocurrency market, and what's even more interesting is that it uses public data released by Kroll.One particular entry caught my eye: someone reportedly lost a staggering $120 million, which can be found at https://ftxnetworth.com/03840345.htm.It's mind-boggling to think that someone could keep such a significant amount of cryptocurrency on a centralized exchange and sleep soundly at night. As we all know, exchange are not safe, and we have seen a lot of exchange failures in previous years. It seems that nothing is going to change.I hope we get our Customer code soon, to check our balances.",

Having a note on what position they lose whether it’s long or short will be very helpful.",

It seems that nothing is going to change.It is not your coin if you are using exchanges to hold your coins, that is just it. After the FTX implosion, people started to move their coins out of exchanges. But what happened last, increase in exchange inflow again. People are always people, they can not change. Sometimes, it is beyond ignorance. We also see leaders like Binance CEO that says noncustodial wallet is not safe when people were moving coins out of Binance some months ago. People like to believe known people like that even as they are lying.",

I really like the idea. Note*No offense please I just share what I have in my mind if it makes you upset then sorry from my side.Well as I was saying the website is quite new but your account is newer than the website. hehe. here i can see the website stats. As your website does not get any traffic yet, DA is also very low you should work on Off-Page SEO. Overall, how Kroll can get your customer id/code from a centralized exchange(FTX). Because customer IDs are secret credentials and cannot be accessed by someone else like Kroll. Can you please shed light on this too, because it confuses me. Thanks.",

Some persons feel that without exchanges there can be no Bitcoin buying, selling or hodling. I will not be surprise that the customer lack knowledge on safe keeping of assets. Another aspect is the source of such funds. People tend to be careless about the safety of their funds because they didn't work hard to earn it. Everyone that got his money genuinely will seek for diverse means to secure it. Atleast we have learned from this unfortunate events that no third party can be trusted with your coin except you are willing or able to bear the loss.",

Many people don't understand what it is to keep your wallet outside of exchange or how to go on that, just like some of us initially didn't have such knowledge. But can I really leave such amount of money in an exchange even as a novice?

Secondly, all those Top 10 were not even close to be genius by keeping all those stablecoins over an exchanger. I am not sure if they were staking it or they just kept them in stable coins to avoid the market crashes but in both the cases they did a dumb mistake. Perfect example of how to be rich person with no brain at all. Those guys must have had stroke after seeing everything going down the way.",

Perhaps the reason why someone can store large amounts of cryptocurrency on the exchange in question and still sleep peacefully at night is most likely down to the convenience factor.Restricted exchanges often offer easy access to trades and fast transactions, which can be attractive to those who trade actively and want to take advantage of market movements. Also, some people may feel that the security measures in place on these exchanges are sufficient to protect their assets.However, as you mentioned, currency failures and hacks have occurred in the past, indicating that it is likely not going to be easy.",
