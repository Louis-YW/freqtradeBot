So, he/she hasn't sent you any bitcoin.Also, a normal bitcoin transaction doesn't need that high transaction fee.Can you be more specific please? I guess someone is trying to scam you.Anyone asking you to send bitcoin to receive more is a scammer.",

An unconfirmed transaction may be able to get reverted.Even more, Coinbase (and any exchange) uses parts of the money to process the withdrawal.Don't be so naive.",

Don't be fooled by these screenshots. Whatever you do, do not send money to scammers.Another common method is that they show you a false balance on a website, such as an exchange or investment platform, but you must first pay a fee to withdraw the funds. These are fake sites, and you have no balance there. Any money you pay goes to scammers.",

May I assume you're into any promising telegram groups?Scammers (that is, people who spend their lives on a chair miserably trying to rob people via telegram) harvest members of Telegram groups and use multiple accounts to mass-DM the members. Usually the groups are related to finance or the official groups of some coin, but which are no way related to scamming.They usually write something like \"Hello\"Â  or perhaps a more elaborate message and immediately talk about finance and \"helping\" you.My life experience has tought me that nobody on the internet wants to help you with anything, not for a charity or business purpose.To cover their tracks they sometimes change their name and profile picture to resemble that of another fake person.",
