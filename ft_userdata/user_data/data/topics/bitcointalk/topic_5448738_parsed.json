  "content": "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241Elon just tweeted that: “For the next 12 months, Twitter will keep none of the money. You will receive whatever money we receive, so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS & Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better, depending on payment processor).After first year, iOS & Android fees drop to 15% and we will add a small amount on top of that, depending on volume.We will also help promote your work. Our goal is to maximize creator prosperity. At any point, you can leave our platform and take your work with you. Easy in, easy out.”This is a pretty awesome move to get good content on the platform. Seemingly a direct shot at YouTube. Will you be offering subscriptions to your followers? You need to be 18+, tweet a lot, & have 500 followers… I’ve never really cared about follower count, but it would be cool to participate in this program and start making some cool content. Feel free to post your twitter handle if you are planning to create subscription content. Mine is @NastyMining",

Content creation has been one of the few areas I want to dive into but has been finding it tough with YouTube nobs now that Twitter is offering it out afresh I will be glad to be among the first to take advantage especially now that I have tons of active followers on Twitter. @OgNasty I kind of wonder if you offer mentorship service in content creation it looks like you have advanced knowledge on that please let me know to possibly enrol on your mentorship class.",

The only content I create currently is with my drone and it’s been a while since I’ve done a new video. I’m a content creation newbie as far as anyone should be concerned, but thought it might be fun to give Elon a couple bucks and create some content for the platform to see how it goes compared with platforms like YouTube. I would feel like a scammer offering a mentorship in this area because I am far from an expert. There are only a few areas I’d feel comfortable acting as a mentor and the only one I’d share publicly is that I feel I have knowledge on budgeting, investing, and managing your finances responsibly to be able to enjoy early retirement that would be beneficial to most people.",

This move by Elon Musk is a smart marketing strategy to attract more content creators to Twitter. It will make content creators put in their best to get the required number of followers and start making money. One of the problems of this kind of enticing policy is inconsistency. Twitter might decide to change this partnership policy in the future and replace it with unfavorable clauses. Content creation is an interesting area to engage in but it requires time and money to produce quality content. You don't need to be a professional to start creating content because you will learn on the job and your quality will keep improving as you become consistent. It is an area I will like to exploit if I become financially stable and when my children are grown up.",

It can be seen that paid Twitter users are benefiting even though in business the winner is actually himself.",

Throw in that he’s going to make mankind a multi-planetary species and I can honestly say this is the only subscription service I’ve ever paid for that I didn’t need.",

Still, he has made noise for his own platform after the acquisition and some issues or not really issues but talks that have taken the attention of the masses worldwide.It's like a marketing that everything is going to be for free and everyone can enjoy all of the amenities, perks and stuff that they do offer. I won't be surprise if some changes will be made when there's a huge growth on them just after that announcement.",

If your friend wants to have more reach, have them sign up for Twitter Blue. I went from getting a couple likes per post to getting a couple hundred likes after signing up. Social media has never been something I cared about, but I’m glad to participate in what Elon is trying to do and the evidence it’s working is crystal clear.",
