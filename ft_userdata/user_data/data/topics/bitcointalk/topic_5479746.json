And how many transactions do they actually process? Bitcoin's blockchain is currently 569 GB. Chainstate is already 9.4 GB. If blocks would have been 10 times larger, spammers could still easily fill them with transactions. If the current blockchain and chainstate would have been 10 times larger, you'd need 8 TB SSD and 128 GB RAM to run a node. That's still possible, but most consumers wouldn't do it anymore.I really hate high fees, and I really want to see a solution for the low transaction throughput, but on-chain scaling can't be enough to reach mass-adoption. Google tells me Visa processes 242 billion transactions per year. That's not a problem for a huge centralized database with many backups, but it's impossible to decentralize to tens of thousands of nodes.",

If you don't want to hold Bitcon or trade with it then explore other options.There might be multiple reasons for you to create this topic. After seeing your activity on multiple board and in specific  your topic which, for me looks like you are desperate I'll Do Odd Jobs for You, it somehow relates that you  might have found jobs that pays in Bitcoin and you want an option to cash out without getting into the transaction fees issue.Either you keep holding to what are getting paid or swap them to alts that are known to be cheap transaction. I meant altcoins like TRX as this is the most traded cryptocurrency on every exchange with the lowest transaction fee. I would still recommend not to sell everything that you have been earning with Bitcoin. Whatever you are earning take out 30 percent of it for your monthly need as I wrote above and let the rest be in your wallet.",

When we check out each of the alternatives, we see that they either suffer the same flaws as Bitcoin (because majority of them are copies of Bitcoin!) or they suffer a wide range of other issues as what they've changed is opening up new attack surface.For example Ethereum (which is not far from being a copy of Bitcoin) suffers from the same problems and on top of that it is not what it was advertised as (the theoretical case I said above). Instead it is a centralized shitcoin with a flawed protocol, a massive premine and a mutable blockchain.",

The effect it causes is very bad for all Bitcoin holders in times like this.In the mempool space, when I monitor it, I don't see it drop by 60 sats. Rather, it happens so rarely that it even happens, but it's only a matter of time or a coincidence if its fee suddenly drops in the undermempool. In such a matter, it should be done in a way so that the holders do not have headaches in reality. And I don't think there's a way for us to avoid it to lower the feebut we can adjust it however you will not be priroritize for sure.",

I quickly rushed to the ViaBTC acceleration page to check what you claimed that bots had hijacked it and I was surprised that at 7 minutes past 4 PM, the available slot was 0. This has never happened before ever since I used the service.Well, I can't ascertain the bot hijacking allegation as ViaBTC will not allow their website to be compromised with bots. It is either they are the ones doing it or the traffic is so high for obvious reasons. Bitcoin's fee issue is pushing people to use any available services that can lower the fee, so you shouldn't be surprised if there are thousands of people using that service on an hourly basis now.This will appear like a bot if people continue to queue to secure a space at the very first second of a new hour.",
