Well, a full 50 BTC? That definitely wasn’t my offer )) I discovered Lambda myself without even realizing that it had already been discovered before me. )I didn’t quite understand how you use the lambda endomorphism to obtain the entire group without private keys...How about this kind of block (full with pk)?Single block design:pk       gx       gy-------------------A         27       KB         27       LC         H         KD         H        LE         J         KF         J         L-------------------27+H+J=phttps://e.radikal.host/2025/03/06/2999bdf922e54c1d3.png",
