So that means it's doable.In Python 3, there is effectively no limit to how long an integer value can be. Of course, it is constrained by the amount of memory your system has, as are all things, but beyond that an integer can be as long as you need it to be:that's one thing they got right about python.  not sure if they're using the gmp internally or what they're doing but it's nice to know that the only limitations on the size of the number is the amount of ram you have.java you can use BigInteger class library IF you're into java. C/C++ seems to be a bit behind the times definitely not going to be crypto friendly if what you're saying is the case. good luck!",

That's quite significant.Although compiling programs written in Python doesn't make them run faster, you can still optimize them for speed by using in-built functions written in C. Proper memory allocation via usage of generators instead of lists, list comprehensions instead of for loops, avoiding for loops completely, small tricks like multiple assignments can do the job and significantly decrease the runtime of your programs. But it all won't work if you also don't choose a right tool for the job, namely proper data structure or algorithm. For example, you need to determine whether the number 40 is odd or even. You can write a recursive function that will call itself 40 times until it reaches zero and 40 times back to tell you a correct answer. Or you can just use one modulo operation to find a remainder. Even better, employing of bitwise operators may increase the speed of such a determining by dozens of percents.Code:import timedef is_odd_rec(n):    if n == 0:        return False    else:        return not is_odd_rec(n - 1)def is_odd_mod(n):    return n % 2 == 1def is_odd_bit(n):    return n & 1start_time = time.time()for i in range(1000000):    is_odd_rec(40)print(time.time() - start_time)# output 8.055624008178711start_time = time.time()for i in range(1000000):    is_odd_mod(40)print(time.time() - start_time)# output 0.24014711380004883start_time = time.time()for i in range(1000000):    is_odd_bit(40)print(time.time() - start_time)# output 0.23915982246398926",
