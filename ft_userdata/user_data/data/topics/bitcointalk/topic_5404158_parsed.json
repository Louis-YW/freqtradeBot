      "body": "It was hard going through your post. I got most of your point but I am left confused.Do you believe that the elites want the war to happen and spend their time in a safe haven by making a profit on it? or do they want to prevent it and just sell the idea of war?War is huge for the economy, that's true. It reminds me of Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, it's an anime based on this very idea Â  There's an AI-driven war, created by the US after a global financial crisis. Since a war can provide the required stimulus to production and employment.maybe you wrote this post after watching this anime lol",

All money is redirected to the weapons and munitions factories, the shipyards, and the aircraft factories. Wall Street is actually the first thing that's going to be closed in the event of the war (just look at Ukraine stock exchange for example).And the funds raised for the war are not printed, they are taxed from the people.",

They also have far higher maintenance and upkeep costs.One interesting observation of the current ukraine war is russia deploying many old tanks and none of their air force. It appears to be a penny pinching war that Putin is currently waging. Maybe meme authors will illustrate images of Putin searching for lost pennies in the dark. While not great. It would be better than most attempts I've seen to attack russia.Hypersonic missiles russia launched can also cost approximately $100 million each of which I think they launched only 3.These being the basics, how can people focus on defense in this era? Most europeans cannot legally own guns to hone their marksmanship in case Putin invades. European nations which failed to develop viable 4th generation aircraft (eurofighter typhoon) are not likely to overturn those negative results within the span of a few short years. The term \"too big to fail\" is thrown around often. If the economy tanks there are no protections or insulations which will protect big players from winding up far less wealthy, than they previously were. War does not create wealth. It is moreso a destroyer of it. Material assets, land, infrastructure are all destroyed. With liquidity spent in the destructive process not necessarily being equal to tangible net results produced.",

A country can raise funds for guns in the same way they can raise funds for anything. Either by increasing the taxation of income, consuming, property, or by just printing more money which essentially does all three. It is well understandable, though, that not all countries have this option, and those that do suffer economically afterwards.Alternative for taxation is, of course, borrowing.",
