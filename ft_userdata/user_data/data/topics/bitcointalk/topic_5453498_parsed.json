For example ROI with L3+ miners will be about 4 months. While ROI on the most energy efficient s19 miner will be many more months than that. Also, if my budget is 7000 usd total. How many s19 miners can i afford? (Or L7) Not many. I find that I can make much more profit with a few dozen L3+ than with one or two newest most energy efficient machines. For example 100 units of L3+ will give me about 4000 usd profit a month. While 2-3 s19 will only give me like 1200 usd i think ? Asicminervalue is a great website and I used it before  But its still a bit tricky to find the most profitable machine to run (Including purchasing cost and ROI and so on) on my electric cost. Thats why im asking here, maybe someone here faced the same issue and found the perfect miner. Best regards",

A) So yeah, im pretty much at this point I think haha. B) I propably have access to a few megawatts  I think. I live next to a hydropower dam so it wouldnt be too expensive to connect additional powerlines either I believe. C) I live in a cold place, and I already have connected cooling tunnels to lead warm air outside. I also have a pretty large garage and an outside shed. So these places are naturally pretty damn cold. 1) Yes they will take lots of space.. 2) About management, I already set up 10 of them at home already. And I was able to automatize everything. So that I dont need to touch anything except keep the internet access on and power on. This is how I got the idea to get a 100 of them. Because they literally take 0 management from my side. They boot automatically and start mining to my nicehash account. I also ofcourse have the 10 I currently have running connected to Hiveon.  Or do you mean repairs maybe? In that case yes, I dont have any knowldedge in repairs of these machines. Exactly I was looking into making a blend of some sort. And thought this could maybe be better generally and not fully rely on LTC mining but maybe bitcoin mining also. But I was looking at the ROI for the m30 whatsminer and the ROI is many more months than the L3+ or? I can get the l3+ for about 60 usd a piece. I think the cheapest M30 Whatsminer I found through Chinese retailer was like 1000 usd. Idk, what do you think? Its still worth it to buy M30? On the other hand, the M30 takes up much less space and less time to set up ( Due to needing fewer units for the same hashpower) Im not quite sure what you mean here \" the L3+ act as coolers for the m30 gear.\" how? Do you think the M30 is more future proof than L3+ ? Your idea is pretty good I would say, I will think about it and do the math behind it  Best regards",

When is litecoin halving?https://minerstat.com/hardware/antminer-l3plusSoon you will receive 40-50% less profit, and bitcoin also has less than a year before halving.Check your calculations taking into account halving and ASIC delivery to you. Otherwise, you will get your asics right before the litecoin halving.",

While 2-3 s19 will only give me like 1200 usd i think ? This is for my thoughts and my opinion, Maybe what you say is right that you can make money there with a few dozen L3+ miners compared to 1 or 2 S19 miners. From what I know, L3+ is cheaper compared to S19 miner, although it is weaker and older, unlike S19 miner which is better and newer, that's why it is more expensive than L3+ miners.       Now, regarding your question that you have 7000$, my answer to you is that with this amount that you have, my rough estimation here is that you can buy from 7-10 L3+ miners and I estimate the hashrate that you can get here is between 400--510TH/s. And the chances you can earn here are probably playing more or less 1000$.If you buy S19 miners, my rough estimation that you can get hashrate is more or less 110TH/s which with the difficulty and value of bitcoin it is possible that you can earn around 2000$ I guess . So if you're looking for good miners I suggest that I think it's better to buy 1-3 of the S19 miners.Reference: https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19-95thReference: https://simplemining.net/asic-miner-profitability/antminer-s19",

Maybe there is another miner out there, that is quite cheap right now to buy due to high watt usage, but which can be profitable at low electric costs? Best regards all, will be happy to receive any advice. there is no legal 0.01$ electric price in the world, if exist there is only quota based on. even you make your own electric, 0.01 is hardly to achieve, solar only produce 0.03 in terms cost of facility/25 years maintenance. hydro can achieve 0.01. but to be honest, 0.01 is just like free electric, you can throw anything without any loss even a decade old hardware  I agree with you that there are no such cheap prices for mining companies, but nuclear power can give 2 cents when building a modern power plant. Although in Russia, in places where there is hydropower, there is also a tariff of 2 cents for the population, but consumption is limited there.There is no possibility for such electricity price as you say but let's say the OP has it.The best bang would surely be L7 Antminer at 9500 Mhsh for Litecoin plus Doge mining.I think it is better to have this rather than other devices and have fewer of them,as 1 of them equals to 11-12 L3+ or even more than them,so rather than going with 100 such L3 Antminers it would be great to go with 8-9 L7 Antminers which are managed in a much easier way rather than to manage 100 devices.",

Which miner is most profitable at 0.01 usd/kwh? I mean, where you get most bang for the buck. I have been looking at buying 100-200 L3+ miners, as i found them to be more profitable than the newer s19 machines for example for the same amount of money. For 100 L3+ miners, my costs would be 0.01 usd/kwh + 300 usd/month (Cost of housing them) + 700 usd/month (Electric) all amounts are approximate. I estabished contacts with a big reputable Chinese seller and after a lot of discussion back and forth, we agreed on 6000 usd for 100 L3+ miners. Every machine will be tested before sending it, shipping costs will be about 800-1200 usd, cheapest and slowest option. Is this a good deal? Or would you guys propose another miner? Something that worries me a little bit is how the profits will look like after LTC will be halved, that is going to happen soon. And Im worried if this will make my setup unprofitable?

It is not necessary to buy asics for one algorithm, you can buy asics for both bitcoin and litecoin to reduce risks if the price of one of the coins rises more.",

But with any option, you can even buy old asics for bitcoin with a hashrate of 40-60 terahash with discounts if you need to use the entire power limit.",
