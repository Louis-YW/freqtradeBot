  "content": "QuoteWays To Earn Passive Income In Nigeria With EthereumCredit: https://businesspost.ng/economy/11-ways-to-make-money-with-ethereum-in-nigeria/amp/1.      Trading Ethereum:One of the most straightforward ways to make money with Ethereum is trading. The basic idea is to buy low and sell high. You’ll need to find a reputable crypto exchange that supports Ethereum., and create an account. From there, you can buy Ethereum using Nigerian Naira (NGN) or another cryptocurrency and hold onto it until you think the price will go up. Then, you can sell it for a profit.Keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change quickly. It’s important to understand market trends and do your research before making any trades. Consider using stop-loss orders to minimise your risk and protect your investment.To get the most out of your investment, you must sell your Ethereum on the best crypto trading platform, Breet app. Breet is an OTC crypto trading app in Nigeria where you can convert Ethereum to Naira and withdraw your funds directly to your Naira bank account within seconds for no extra charge. Get started by downloading Breet today, and enjoy a seamless trading experience.2.      Staking Ethereum:Staking is another way to make money with Ethereum, and it’s a lot less risky than trading. Staking means holding onto your Ethereum and helping to secure the network by participating in consensus. In return, you’ll earn rewards in the form of new Ethereum. The more Ethereum you stake, the more you’ll earn.To start staking, you’ll need a minimum amount of Ethereum in a wallet that supports staking. You can choose a staking provider or use a decentralised platform like Rocket Pool or Stakefish. Staking is an excellent option if you’re looking for long-term investment and passive income.3. Participating in decentralised Finance (DeFi):Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is a growing sector of the Ethereum ecosystem that allows you to earn interest and yield on your Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound and Yearn Finance allow you to deposit your Ethereum and earn interest, similar to a savings account. You can also earn yield by providing liquidity to DeFi exchanges, such as Uniswap or Balancer.DeFi is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, so it’s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved. Make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your investment.4.      Crypto Lending:Crypto lending is another way to earn passive income with Ethereum. You can lend your Ethereum to borrowers and earn interest on your loan. This can be a great option if you have a large amount of Ethereum that you don’t need to sell right away.Several platforms offer crypto lending services, such as Nexo, BlockFi, and Celsius. Keep in mind that crypto lending is a relatively new and untested market, so it’s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved.5.      Mining Ethereum:Mining is the process of creating new Ethereum by solving complex mathematical problems. The more computing power you have, the more Ethereum you can mine. You’ll need to set up a mining rig, which can be an expensive investment, but the rewards can be substantial.Keep in mind that mining is a highly competitive field, and the cost of electricity and hardware can be significant. You’ll need to do a cost-benefit analysis to determine if mining is a good investment for you.6.      Participating in Ethereum-based prediction markets:Ethereum-based prediction markets, such as Augur and Gnosis, allow you to bet on the outcome of events and earn rewards based on your accuracy. You can participate in prediction markets by creating a market, placing bets, and earning rewards based on the outcome. This is a great option if you have knowledge or expertise in a particular field or market. 7.      Creating NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. If you’re an artist, musician or have another creative talent, you can monetise your work by creating NFTs. You can sell your NFTs on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or SuperRare. 8.      Earning passive income through yield farming:Yield farming is a process of earning passive income by depositing Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in liquidity pools and earning rewards for providing liquidity to decentralised exchanges. This is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for those familiar with the DeFi space. Several yield farming platforms, such as Binance Smart Chain, allow you to earn rewards for providing liquidity.9.      Investing in Ethereum-based startups:Another way to make money with Ethereum is by investing in Ethereum-based startups. This can be a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, as startup investments are generally considered speculative. However, if you do your research and invest in a promising startup, you could see significant returns on your investment.10. Earning Ethereum through content creation:If you have a talent for writing, video production, or other forms of content creation, you can earn Ethereum by creating and sharing your content on various platforms. Some platforms allow you to earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency for creating and sharing valuable content with the community.11. Earning Ethereum through affiliate marketing:Finally, you can earn Ethereum through affiliate marketing. This involves promoting products or services and earning commissions for every sale made through your unique affiliate link. Several Ethereum-based affiliate marketing platforms, such as Refersion, allow you to earn Ethereum for your marketing efforts.ConclusionIn conclusion, there are plenty of ways to make cash with Ethereum in Nigeria. Whether you’re into trading, staking, DeFi, or something else entirely, there’s a way for you to get in on the action. The key is to do your research and understand the risks involved with any investment. But with the right mindset and effort, you can make the most of your Ethereum investment and grow your wealth over time. So, get out there and start exploring the opportunities!DISCLAIMER: I haven't verified most of the means of earnings above so I can't vouch for them myself but I just want us to discuss on them so if anyone find them worth trying they can give it a go or if there's any you would advise against participating in you can go ahead and maybe save a soul from encountering losses. Do note that most so called evening opportunity are using not worth it on the long run so always do your own research before adventuring into any of them.",

Ponzi schemes are never an option when it comes to passive income. Irrespective of how lucrative it's for you, do note that you're ripping another man to get that bread whenever you're been paid. Ponzi follow for wetin increase the interest of Nigerians for cryptocurency and that's why many still think cryptocurency entirely na Ponzi and dem dey fear say e go crash like them ponzi schemes dem crash. Ponzi scheme should never be a part of passive income options and most multilevel marketing businesses aren't truely what they claim to be. We dun run ponzi that year and we understand how the thing be. Infact most Altcoins wey dey market now na Ponzi like project dem be. E get one coin wey be dey top 20 for coin market cap dat year and na Ponzi e been be. The coin name was bitconnect but e dun crash now and na the fate of all Ponzi scheme be dat. If you wan earn, commot ponzi for mind as plenty other legitimately ways dey for the passive income business.",

Just do research and invest in multiple only to take profits immediately your target are reached and if you notice things dey go sideways sell and move on. Altcoins na ideologies dem dey sell and not actual product because 99% of dem no get any project. So the best way to profits na to get in on the idea early then leave when you dun get a significantly good return. No go dey trust altcoins.",
