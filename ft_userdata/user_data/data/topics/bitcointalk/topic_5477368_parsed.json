  "content": "Hello, Good AfternoonI sold a game account of a game name Summoners War by 4300$ thought this website.The buyer released the funds and I transfer him the game login and password.I read all the conditions of the website before accepting the deal so I was aware of the natureof the trading portal. I read fees and conditions to be met in order to withdraw the money.At the moment of withdraw they asked me to verify my authenticity by sending an amount tocheck that I was a real person.Then after it was completed, they told me In order to withdraw the money I needed to buy aninsurance to avoid the bitcoin to be lost in blockchain. I refused since they explained theywere going to mix the coins in order to avoid to be lost and that is not true.I told them to release the lock, and after that I tested by sending 0.006 btc to a wallet incoinbase. After 30 minutes I did not receive it, and contacted back for a hash or transactionID to track it online thought the blockchain.Then they stopped answering. After an hour I needed a explanation of where is the money andwhat is going on. So they send me a message that my account was blocked due suspect ofmoney laundry. That they will hold my account funds.The sent transaction never arrived and I did not receive a transaction ID. It seems like a scamfrom them. Even thought the remaining amount is still listed in their website and is good sinceit received a part that I sent to check if it was really a bitcoin address.I checked while I was doing this claim and they closed the message center messages. Im stillunable to withdraw since it is not safe. I do not want to remove more btc from them since itlooks shady no transaction ID no refund from initial payment.",

That the OP has registered to report the scam here but there is little we can do. What I would recommend to him is to learn that in money matters all caution is little, and more so in the whole area of cryptocurrencies. If I understood him correctly, he has lost the money he should have been paid for the sale, $4300, plus the money they made him send as 'verification of authenticity'. That's no small amount.",

      "body": "Sorry for the loss, OP. it looks like the person you were dealing with is the scammer. Let me guess, he suggested that you use exchxdeal.com for the trade deal? If yes, then try to recover the account you sold to him if possible because the Money or Bitcoins you are seeing in the exchange are actually not there. The person who bought the game from you probably owns that site too, and he used it into tricking to get the login details of your game account.",

There are thousands of parties to prove that you are the owner of the account, and sending money is not one of them.Sorry for your loss. Most likely, the scammer (site owner) is the one who bought Summoners War from you. It seems that he convinced you to use this service as a guarantee. Unfortunately, it seems that you have fallen victim to this scam. He did not send you $4,300, so add the information for that account because it is definitely the scammer.",
