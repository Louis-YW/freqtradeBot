Yeah my gut feeling is more and more of this will be occurring the next 10 years or so. It's kinda of why I pur it in economics as I feel trade will be more and more interrupted down the road.I am not sure if Saudi Arabia provides aid to Palestines or Russia but they used more than 1000 missiles or so the news claims.

A month ago, it was announced the creation of the India-Middle East-Europe transport corridor, which will pass through: the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel. This corridor is very unprofitable for Iran and China, as well as for Turkey. I think the current Hamas action, timed to coincide with the Yom Kippur War, has one of its goals to demonstrate the unreliability of Israel as the weak link in this transport corridor. In other words, Hamas's attack on Israel benefits Hamas's sponsors.",

Very well said about winning war in 2 minutes and losing it in next 3. Today's strike was massive and obviously prepared for long time. But I don't see how they can win war against Israel, even if they will get help and for example Hesbollah will get involved.Palestine independence movement was getting more or less support globally. Nt saying that Israel is sacred cow, but when you see Hamas kidnapping women and children or ridding with dead bodies on motorcycles (https://t.me/ukrnastup/89381), I don't see how civilised world can support Palestine.",

      "body": "Common tactic by Hamas is to set up military posts and and weapons depots near civilian areas or in civilian buildings. Israel will fire in retaliation to rocket attacks towards these buildings and within the collateral damage, civilians get killed. It's a method of generating emotional propaganda to paint Israel as the aggressors.Of course the Israeli military would wipe Palestine off the map if they chose to unleash the full strength of its military. They show vast amounts of restraint.Europe will stay out of these matters. I'm curious on what the U.S. will do. Under Trump, Israel and the U.S. were strongly aligned. Under Biden, the relationship seems tumultuous.",

Otherwise the price will have to fall too far to be viable. Or oil production grinds to a halt.Not good. Very bad for business.Need to prop up oil consumption and oil prices in lieu of actual worldwide economic activity.Also need valid \"reasons\" to charge certain countries more for oil and blame it on \"supply chain constraints\".But how to do that?A: Proxy war.First was Ukraine.But after 2 years, now Ukraine war is beginning to dwindle.Need another war to replace it.Hmmm....what next ¬†Follow the money, normies. ¬†QuoteFinally, there is some speculation that Iran may get dragged into what is rapidly emerging as the worst Middle-Eastern crisis in years, with various pro-Israeli hawks claiming that the Hamas attack would have only occurred with explicit Iranian backing. If Israel does indeed attack Iran, as it has hinted it would do for years, may we suggest you fill up your gas tank.https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/israel-state-war-hamas-after-palestinian-militants-launch-unprecedented-incursion",

According to rumours,¬† Isreal have an unwritten rule that a single Israeli killed by Hamas is equal to hundred Palestinians. This is the reason Israel's retaliation is always more divestating.¬† I truly wish there is anything that can be done to prevent the doom that is awaiting Palestine.... we are humans before anything else and human lives matters",
