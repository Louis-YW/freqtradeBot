I try to focus on my trading and anything stupid thinking like intimidation may result into a failed trading. I use to say this: if you are a trader, you have to do away with everything that can make your mindset to be of low or poor quality. Focus on yourself and how you can achieve your long term goal in life. Among all, I am happy, there is nothing better than joy and happiness. The little I gained from trading is enough for me.",

I know that there go the self-made traders just to show off on social media. But for the best traders, you'll see their authenticity in many ways that you can.I'm not jealous nor intimidated by them but instead, I first ask a question in my mind if they're legit and if they are then I just think of it how can I achieve the same achievement that they've taken? It may not be exactly the same as them but like 1% or just the path that they've taken through the process.",

      "body": "That should be used as motivation, if other people can, then we should also be able to get that success. However, if we feel intimidated by such things, it can be said that we have little or no confidence in ourselves. The question is, how is it possible to achieve success if you do not believe in the potential that exists within yourself? Even if we don't have the ability, then we can learn it. Everything needs a process and nothing happens instantly in this life.But such viewing must also be comprehensive in my opinion, because many beginners who see successful trader content find this trading easy. Because most of them only show when they are successful, without showing the process they are going through. It's not all like that, but it would be better for content creators like them to educate thoroughly including the risks that will be faced.",

As a small bitcoin trader, have you ever felt intimidated, distressed, inadequate or inspired after watching these types of videos or content?I think most of these videos are absolutely fake. There is no point in distressing yourself for these videos because they aren't actually doing any trading they are just boasting upon their generational wealth, or maybe a few lucky trades and acting as if they are trading.  Real trading is hard and actually takes some times before you see good results and much more time before you can be a millionaire. Most of these people have more incomes from selling courses of trading than trading itself. So no need to get dishearten in these things.",

If you feel intimidated and distressed, then simply stop watching them.

YouTube videos could sometimes be true or not, it depends on how an individual sees it. But since they’re crypto influencers and would want to gain a lot of followers, they will do everything to attract a lot of viewers even if it’s crossing the line already.",

Finally, I prefer to build inspiration and make ideal achievements with self-satisfaction versions in the field of trading. I guess it’s human nature to feel a bit of envy if we see young traders earning a lot already and making their dreams in life come to reality. But if you based yourself from the achievement of others, you will never grow and you might only continue to feel the pressure which is not helpful at all if you want to be a good trader and become highly profitable and skilled in it. Besides, traders have their own time when to make it big in trading, depending on how does a trader work hard and become the best version of himself. So I prefer to work on my own and follow my own strategies which for me are working well and are still reliable when trading.",

So I’ve come to realized that youtube videos are not all true, some are just done because they are forced to do so since they are making a good income from it.",

I have not been intimidated seeing stories like this because for sure, these are done for a set goal. And to think that some are making it exaggerated, so I don’t have to be distressed or become annoyed in it. Because as much as I know trading, it’s never easy to earn profits, you should need the skills and knowledge first so you can expect profits in trading. And you have to be patient as well, as those who never have much patience in trading have end up quitting and lose their funds.",

Because we commonly only can enjoy a small number of profits. But this is a trading world, where people with higher amounts of capital will also commonly will earn much higher profits. Moreover, if they have the professional skill and understanding, big amount, and also completed advanced tools and equipment. This will lead them to have a bigger chance to earn profits. But, should we be intimidated? Be calm and patient mate. Everyone has their era to be great in trading. You can take this as one of the reasons why you must be more serious in trading, to be smarter and better at trading. So, who knows that we someday can be one of them? haha",
