  "content": "I created a bunch of Node.js scripts that create and broadcast testnet transactions. It's meant for newcomers that have some programming experience to get a grisp of how the core protocol works. The scripts re-implement the core TCP protocol in a minimal way and you can try them straight within the blog post. I'm sharing it here for some feedback before sharing it on Reddit and other dev communities that are not familiar with the core protocol.Link: https://www.tzionis.com/bitcoin-protocol-in-45-minutesPS: Although I'm not saving anything, addresses you create on the site should be considered compromised",
