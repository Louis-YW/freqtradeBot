Just be researchful before you invest in a project. And if someone decides to go away and let his portfolio sleep until the next bitcoin halving, that's his decision and strategy.",

Nobody is going anywhere this is just a matter of time probably many people will have faced this kind market situations in the past and they know very well about the suitable ways to invest or trade in this kind of market situations there is no doubt that the bearish market conditions have made a dull environment arround investors and traders hence mostly people are waiting for a suitable time to jump in the market anyway I don't understand why you think that those altcoins which you mentioned can be Ethereum killer because I don't find them capable enough to compete with Ethereum",

Long gone of course, so I do not trust at all in those coins and their chances of taking over and replacing ethereum.",

That is why we should never understimate when there is bearish market because it usually opens for more opportunities to gain wealth in the near future.",
