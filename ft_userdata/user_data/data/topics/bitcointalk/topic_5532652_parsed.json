However, the only money flowing in came from new investors, making it a classic Ponzi scheme.Prosecutors claim more than NOK 700 million ($62.7 million) was laundered through a Norwegian investment firm before being transferred to accounts in several Asian countries.The four accused are Norwegian men in their 50s, 60s, and 70s. Three are suspected of collecting money from investors, while the fourth is accused of handling the laundering process.Among the accused is Terje Hvidsten, a former art dealer with previous fraud convictions. Another suspect, Dag Hætta Eriksen, also has a criminal record related to fraud and corruption. The remaining two suspects include a 52-year-old from Romerike, who denies any wrongdoing, and a 70-year-old former lawyer accused of laundering funds.The scheme operated under different names, including Crypto888 Club, Octa Partners, and Nano Club. Each rebranding introduced a new cryptocurrency—OctaCoin, NanoCoin, and Ormeus Coin. Please guys let's be careful, crypto scams are getting crazier by the day Read the full story here. https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/87-million-crypto-scam-exposed-norway-charges-four-suspects",

There are people that only wants to have Bitcoin and scammers knows this so they come up with various schemes that offers an opportunity to free, easy Bitcoin which ends up being a scam.Avoiding greedy and the idea that you can get easy money will help anyone to be safe.",

The death penalty seems pretty harsh but it definitely might stop hackers, it would just require a pretty sophisticated task force and unilateral agreement amoung nations to uphold that sentence structure. The thing the fraudsters usually see is either a plea deal for information or they get life in prison or something. For FTX for example everyone lost money, yes, but eventually law enforcement came in and shut it all down and plugged in a seasoned CEO to fix the whole mess and put a repayment plan for stolen funds, which had its first dispersement for FTX claims less than 50k just yesterday and the next one slated for march I believe. It is crazy though people will go lower and lower and stop at no end to screw people over for money at any cost and its sickening.",
