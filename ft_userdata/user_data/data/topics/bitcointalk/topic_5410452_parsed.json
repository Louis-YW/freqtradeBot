  "content": "The Igbaruku village of Kogi in Nigeria have a reason to celebrate and be happy as the Build with Bitcoin project has once again put smiles on the faces of the 1000 who prior to this intervention, had to trek long distances just to reach a contaminated water source.  This initiative, powered by the Build with Bitcoin project has helped eliminate the issue of children and adults alike falling sick as a result of water borne diseases and because of this, youths who - in a bid to go search for water- end up missing school or quality family time, are certainly grateful for such timely and thoughtful response by the foundation. The project was aimed at providing communities with clean water, access to quality education, humanitarian support amongst others. And Yusuf Nessary, co founder of the Build with Bitcoin initiative, believes they can now experience first hand Bitcoin education and financial inclusion in the community's native language. The joy on these children's faces is so priceless and Bitcoin helped put it there!  Gradually, Bitcoin is slowly creeping into the nooks and crannies of the rural areas and all thanks to Bitcoin Inc and Bitcoin magazine who helped in donations, this small village development is a product of Bitcoin.https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/built-with-bitcoin-completes-clean-water-project-for-1000-nigerian-villagers",

Those behind this project are obviously bitcoin users and people that know what bitcoin is and isn't, but what about the larger community they visit.Needless to say that the community is going to enjoy the 'clean water' provided by this project, but what i am not so sure is if they will be interested in the network that those behind this project are trying to promote and bring the knowledge of to their doorsteps, i feel that is our biggest problem concerning adoption in rural African communities, they have many problems with daily livelihood, and they want it solved and that is that, but can they think about 'freedom with bitcoin', i don't think so.",

A picture they say portrays thousands of words. In the picture above they are brilliant kids who will never forget about this bitcoin based project that removed, in their childhood, the stress of fetching water from a very far stream. Those kids to me is the reason for the project. They will never grow up without acknowledging bitcoin, when been discussed by peer they'll definitely refer to a time when bitcoin was used to sponsor a water project in their village. I'm glad that the banner has bitcoin logo on it, when the kids go to fetch water and see the logo it sticks to their long term memory which will never be forgotten. The grown ups like you said may not be interested in the freedom bitcoin effects for a better livelihood in Africa. But, for the kids they'll definitely embrace bitcoin at adolescent age and we are talking 7-8 from now.",

I don't see that Bitcoin is essential here, because it is not like when there is a bank blockade and the way to avoid it is to donate with Bitcoin.Once the most pressing problem is solved, that they have access to clean water and humanitarian support, I hope that part of the education will be about Bitcoin and that it will help people to find jobs related to it in the future.",

Although the villagers who get clean water may not understand Bitcoin.We only know today, we do not know tomorrow. I believe it happens all over the world that a person born in a village can be a prosperous person in city or even in another country tomorrow, there are many celebrities and business men and women that were born in village, anyone can be successful tomorrow, a villager can leave in a city tomorrow and become very successful. Bitcoin continue to exists, what is done in the past can help in its adoption tomorrow. The kids won't forget this in there live time.Some people that read about this on news can have interest for bitcoin, to learn about it and see if they can also invest in it. This idea and the project is very great and nice. The clean water provider can be the longevity to many lives in the village.  You can see see that Africa have long live span if compared to the past, though healthcare facilities contribute to this, but also clean wallet will contribute.",

Some might say it's nothing special, something obvious and what could be done via other methods, but when Bitcoin is used for donations, it's actually used as money, so I think it's a genuinely good sort of usage, not to mention that the cause itself is very noble because people obviously should have access to clean water. This makes the world a better place, and also gives Bitcoin a more positive reputation. While the people who got access to clean water might not need Bitcoin yet because they clearly have more urgent matters to attend to, it helps connect different people (those who donated with Bitcoin and those who benefited from the donations), as well as make a difference, even if it's at a very small-scale level of one village.",
