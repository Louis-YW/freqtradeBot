You have received red trust scam many times before to do account selling work. In my opinion all these activities should be stopped.",

Or maybe I am missing something here? Inform me about it. I want to know both arguments.Well, you could search, since this was answered before many times.Basically it's the free speech. If that is banned it means more work for moderators and the sales will move to other platforms. No use. Now, if caught, seller and buyer may get negative trust which in many cases means ruined account. Good enough.",

I want to know both arguments.Because having multiple accounts is one thing that has been allowed in the forum from the beginning so to curb account sales, banning multiple accounts should be put in place which is close to impossible or might lead to catastrophic effects to the forum growth so I guess that's why admin is reluctant when it comes to that.Accounts back then were of little value, so there was no point buying an account. One could grow an account from brand new to legendary effortlessly until spam and bots became a problem, so measures were put in place to curb spamming like activity points, merit.",

One could grow an account from brand new to legendary effortlessly until spam and bots became a problem, so measures were put in place to curb spamming like activity points, merit.Yes, before the implementation of the merit system it was easy for those account farmers to rank an account with just spam posting, but after the implementation of the merit system the whole scenario of the forum changed. Those days it would require someone to make at least a single post a day or 14 posts in 2 days or even in a week to gain activity points and that kind of thing can be done by a bot easily. But, after the implementation of merit based system all those activities were halted and a few of those farmers have already made out many accounts back then.They're now selling those farmed accounts to generate revenue or you can say that they're trying to scam others with their tactics these days. The selling of accounts is officially disliked in this forum and thus the sellers try to contact the other party via Telegram or Discord and that form of communication has its own risks. Sometimes those account sellers are just fake entities and they only trap some newbies to loot money out of their pockets.",

I was wondering why would one want to sell an account they spent time to build up to such rank on this platform. One can use them for campaign so as to be generating revenue or income for themselves but resorts to selling such account speaks of much volume but anyways anyone buying should apply caution as such is not advisable neither is it encouraged here.",
