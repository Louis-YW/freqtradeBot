With Google, search, and a few minutes of reading, he can create a wallet. It is not too difficult.Quote100$ worth of Ethereum was deposited into the walletDon't deposit money to a wallet that you don't create it offline, by yourself. If you share or leak the wallet seeds to anywhere, anyone, you should abandon it. Create a new wallet and deposit money to a new one.Quotetwo days later the fund was moved out to am unknown address, after asking few questions from the wallet owner I found out that the other guy has access to the wallet too, I believe he did the dirty trick because he never warned the wallet owner to never share his recovery seed with anyoneCan't say. Naively and easily, you can say the friend is the scammer but no proof to support that. Because the victim can do other stupid things that leak private keys later. Anyway, $100 is a cheap learning fee fortunately.",

But if you can't track it I think better move on because even if you know that guy has an access for sure he will deny that he stole the money. Keep distance with those guys because for sure he can't be trusted for any amount.",

And just think that the money is gone now for sure because I doubt that who ever moved it out has the intention to bring it back.So this is another expensive lessons, and to be honest, I can't imagine the 'brother' trying to scam the other one. So it's better to start all over again I guess. Perhaps he can start small, not necessarily $100, but maybe just $10 or at least what he can afford to invest but this time, he is now equipped with the knowledge that private keys and mnemonic phrase are very important and should not be disclosed even to his 'brother'.",

Once you are sure that he is the one, I also think it is wise to confront him with the facts and express your dissapointment while still trying to push him to return it if he still has it. You don't need to let your other brother who has been affected know who has robbed him so it doesn't ruin their relationship as well, but give a serious advice to him to be more careful and try to trust people less regardless of status with things regarding finance.",

You never mentioned if the ETH that was sent to the wallet is yours or not. Is it?Chasing those $100 isn't worth the trouble. Law enforcement isn't going to do anything about such a small amount either. If you were to follow the trail of the money and realize that the coins were deposited into a centralized exchange, chances are that whoever created the account on that site has undergone KYC. But no exchange will disclose such information to random people, and you will be asked to involve the police and/or present proof or a court order. The best you can do if you are friends with the victim is to teach him how to create his own wallet, generate and backup a recovery phrase, and keep the information safe from other people, including his brother.",

It was a theft case [if the OP finds vallid evidence], but for the $100 sum then I don't think the authorities would bother tracking it down.There are lots of threads explaining how to secure a wallet, but since the OP didn't mention that the person is on the forum then google can help. It's no wonder why someone can lose their crypto asset especially if they don't know how to keep it safe. Basically he is the main person in charge of the security of his own money and that is the consequence if he wants to be in the crypto world.",

Firstly Creation of wallet is such a private thing that doesn't deserve two people to know about it. this was the first mistake. He can use the first wallet created to learn how it is done and then the next would be the private wallet he/she owns on their own.
