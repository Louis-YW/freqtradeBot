You can change the server that you connected to, or change it to automatic and let electrum connect you to different servers that are available. That should work. To select different server, or to select server automatically instead of manual selection: click on tools -> network to see that.If it does not work, update your Electrum.If it does not still work, check you seed phrase backup, make sure it is correct with the one on Electrum, delete the wallet and download the latest Electrum version from https://electrum.org and import your seed phrase on it.",
