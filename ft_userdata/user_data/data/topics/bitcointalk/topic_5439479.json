Even I don't have one of the errors, so I'm willing to pay the price of a new book, $137 USD (inclusive of shipping to Canada).Consider this the opening bid   As for general info, this is only found on the hardcovers. What happened was that I had used the same camera to take the vacation pictures as the coin pictures, which meant that they had the same file names like NIKON_SD_CARD_DCSM_404480 or whatever, and as such the final upload of the book switched the coin photos for others of the same name. Good thing that's all it was.. While I have no idea what's on the right, the left is actually me in front of the sign for Pripyat, the radioactive abandoned town next to Chernobyl, which was recently (still?) occupied by invading Russians who apparently dug trenches in the area, releasing a bunch of buried 40-year old radiation.",

Signed by Elias, and Howard AND the only books signed by the Casacius creator. If so those are just as rare and valuable as the autograph editions ( My opinion). I have no knowledge of a previous sale of this book but would guess 4k-7k",

Just collection wise its worth more. If your buying this book to use it just buy the cheaper one or you can still buy a first edition on ebay for 100. If your not going to use it and keep as collectible buy a premium or first editionAlso watch my encyclopedia video...lol..like ithttps://youtu.be/tpiT-6vfdV4",
