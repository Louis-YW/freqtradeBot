  "content": "Hello everyone, newbie here!I just completed the crypto investment course on Udemi, and found idea of rebalancing very interesting, but have a few questions:- Does it really worth it to do rebalancing as often as possible (as it was recommended)? I understand that each selling is a taxable event, so when you rebalance - this counts towards your capital gains, which, which would be the short term if you do it often (in the course was recommended to do it every day). Also you pay commission every time you buy/sell. So I'm a little skeptical on that advice. The course was a little outdated (5 y.o), so maybe at that time there was no transaction fees on exchanges and no regulations about taxes? What is the best practice now?- What is the most popular/trusted tool for automatic rebalancing? In the course was highly recommended https://www.shrimpy.io/, but I was lucky enough to join crypto-world accurate a month after this platform discontinued its work. What is its current alternative?-What is a best platform for tax calculations and filing? The one that would automatically consolidate all your assets on different wallets/exchanges, track transaction fees, transfer fees, staking, lending etc. and calculate the gains/losses? Preferably free or not expensive tools.Thank you in advance!",

I understand that each selling is a taxable event, so when you rebalance - this counts towards your capital gains, which, which would be the short term if you do it often (in the course was recommended to do it every day). I think we don't need to transfer money from Wallet \"X\" to Exchange \"Y\" if we want to do daily rebalancing. Means if your portfolio let's say you have a aim to maintain a portfolio of $30k but the amount of BTC and ETH you have, making them lesser so you have to maintain the percentage. Let's say you invested 50% in BTC and 50% in ETH it means you invested $15k in BTC and %15k in ETH and due to the price going up and down your total investment of ($30k) might be increasing or decreasing and to maintain your investment you make changes means you do rebalancing. And if you really wanted to do rebalancing on the daily basis then why not depositing some extra money in your exchange because once you put some extra money like $2k along with $30k to rebalance your portfolio then the tax and fee will be lower as you are making only one transaction instead of many.=====Quote from: OK_Kathy on August 23, 2023, 02:24:37 AMAlso you pay commission every time you buy/sell.

No offense. Transaction fee are there from the start it is not just something started few year ago. So, even the course is 5 years old there were transaction fee too. =====Quote from: OK_Kathy on August 23, 2023, 02:24:37 AM- What is the most popular/trusted tool for automatic rebalancing?

What is its current alternative?Automatic rebalancing depends on the platform you are going to chose like it might be centralized and decentralized. Hmm, For your convenience I am mentioning some CEXs but you might find DEXs too. Because many members here hate CEXs and once they see my recommendations they will also mention DEXs.   https://www.hodlbot.io/https://www.cobo.com/https://3commas.io/https://quadency.com/Coinbasehttps://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/what-is-rebalancing-bot-and-frequently-asked-questions-29bbbd2e7fc24085be7a8a7d02779457Quote from: OK_Kathy on August 23, 2023, 02:24:37 AM-What is a best platform for tax calculations and filing?

Initially this was my natural approach - to contribute some additional money every month, and try to maintain the desired balance. However, the course emphasized that frequent rebalancing can capture additional profits from market fluctuations on top of extra investments, even without adding more funds. They used the shrimpy.io app, which automatically rebalances as often as you want, even every hour. I understand the concept, but got concerned that the extra profit might be offset by increased taxes and transaction fees. Just wanted to hear from people's actual experiences. I believe there are established best practices by now, although it's challenging to find reliable information.Quote from: Faisal2202 on August 23, 2023, 06:29:19 AM You asked it is worth to rebalance the sheet daily then the answer depends on your mindset as I think if you do not know the answer to this question then you might have wasted your time on that course. No offense. I'm not sure what you mean  I grasp the benefits of rebalancing; I simply questioned the suggested frequency. The course didn't delve into taxes or fees at all. Presumably, these expenses are negligible when dealing with larger volumes. I'm just starting out with a modest deposit, and my mindset is still evolving. Thus, I had some uncertainties. Traders might not be concerned due to their high transaction volumes anyway, but I'm aiming for long-term growth. I hope I haven't squandered my time on this course; for a $15 investment, it wasn't bad at all. We all have to start somewhere Thank you very much for your reply! I will definitely DMOR on the recommended tools!",
