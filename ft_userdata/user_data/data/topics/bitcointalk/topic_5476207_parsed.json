It   provides a    hub for community members to come together, connect, interact, learn and earn rewards for sharing their knowledge on AI technology, trends, and opportunities.As a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), on the Ethereum Layer 2 Arbitrum, Magic AI uses artificial intelligence to guide and power governance. With artificial intelligence helping to keep human emotions and group think in check, it is hoped that better governance decisions be made for the greater good of the DAO, the blockchain community and mankind as a    whole. A proprietary AI model will be used for the governance of the DAO. While the initial governance process is likely to be messy, the level of governance is likely to improve over time, and eventually exceed governance purely by humans, as the AI learns and improves over time.[Features of MagicAI:•   Education: Explore AI and meterverse technologies and its applications, stay up-to-date on the latest trends, developments and opportunities through webinars, AMAs, workshops etc.•   Rewards: Magic AI rewards users for their contributions to the community, incentivizing participation and creating a vibrant ecosystem.•   Security: The platform is built on blockchain technology, providing a secure and decentralized environment for users to connect and transact.•   Immersive events: Community members can participate in global events and projects launches that showcase the potential of AI and meteverse technologies.•   Marketplace: Magic AI collaborates with global industry players where members can access to high-value AI and metaverse projects, airdrops and token offerings.•   Resources: Connects members with global industry professionals and offers opportunities for project collaborations, business developments and career advancements.System OverviewThe system utilizes MAI Token.
