My fear now is that they have started building and operating secret factories in my country. Joe Biden messed up the US borders when it abolished some vibrant policies of the Trump Administration leading to the high influx of drug traffickers. The war against fentanyl is not an easy fight because some superpowers are benefitting from the trade. China is the major producers of the chemicals that are used to produce the killer drug. In Mexico, the Sinaloa and Jalisco drug cartels are so powerful and popular that arresting a member could lead to violent or even deadly protests.Joe Biden should continue with the Trump border walls, review the country's immigration policies, open the border to viable immigrants and strengthen the Border Guide operations.",

No marked, no cartels, no police work, no overpopulated prisons and less tax* money spend on the \"war\" on drugs.  (* oh forgot all about he did no pay any, no does not know what it means)Secondary it is not his business anyway what someone smokes, eats, drinks, injects or otherwise mutilates his own body.",

      "body": "^^^ Absolutely true!!! But there is more. Government needs to up its advertising about the destructive qualities of using drugs. We need 5x the number of advertisements against drugs. In addition, government needs to get out of helping drug victims, and get away from leniency when a drug user damages someone or his property. The funds saved can easily be used for the advertising.Let the families of the drug users help them, or the churches.",
