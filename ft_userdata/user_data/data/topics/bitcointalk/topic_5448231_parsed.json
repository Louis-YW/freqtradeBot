  "content": "Hi All,Picked these up a little while ago and they've been sat around in a deposit box, feel like it's time to sell them - moving in to a new house so all sorts of expenses coming up These were originally sold in large bags directly from the Casascius website, can't remember where I picked them up but got 6-8 originally and these were the best pick of the bunch, gave the others to a friend. Not sure how to value them or how often they come up for sale, so starting with a higher figure but flexible towards pricing. I used to collect quite of lot of similar coins and happen to have 2 small holograms on a strip, no idea of where they were originally used but I'll throw these in for free for anyone who buys two or more. They've always been handled with care while in my possession.Probably one of the cheapest official Casascius produced items you'll ever be able to own and don't see them all that often around herePostage will be $15-20 on top to most destinations via tracked and signature required delivery. Can use an escrow if you prefer, at your additional expense.View the full photo shoot here Price: 0.0015 BTC per token",

Maybe @minerjones can chime in?Fair price would be around $50 eachThose holograms did not come with the coins originallyYup, that's roughly the price I'm looking to get - it's priced higher to accommodate the volatile Bitcoin price at the moment which has been trending up. Considering a lot of them rattled around loosely in bags, these are reasonable quality and possibly deserve a slight premium. It's been a while since I've sold here, but holograms of any kind used to be hard to find, these in particular are a nicely generic \"Bitcoin\" so it seems like a decent bonus and perfect for a DIY coin build.",

If you ever have something going to MJ, maybe you can include it in that parcel.Feel you on the lost coins there. Better not to think too much about it. Side question regarding the alibaba-fakes: Ist it still possible to distinguish them for an expert? Maybe weight ora closer look with a lense or even microsope?If that's the case, glad to take you up on your offer @Fortify and get 2 or 3 of these.",
