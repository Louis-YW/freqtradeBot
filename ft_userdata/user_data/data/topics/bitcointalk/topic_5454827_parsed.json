Because if you enter this way you will be obliged to borrow money from an exchange to buy crypto. Which can bring you losses if your set-up is wrong and you have no knowledge of it.Also, crypto trading is very stressful, so emotional traders are not allowed here. Also, margin trade is only for pro traders. That's why DYOR (do your own research) is still important.",

However, does this idealism apply if you see a market rally in a relatively short time? Price fluctuations make traders more ambitious and unable to control the profit that has been targeted. It is true that we should make more money, but it will be more difficult for everyone to implement Stop Loss. Believe me, you are entering a trading area where the volume level is very high, so whatever the rules are, they are often forgotten.",

Most of the people wants the easiest want, therefore they always end up losing their funds because they don't have enough patient to study trading first before asking for a huge profit. Taking the high risk doesn't automatically means you could have a high reward, it depends on your skills in trading, that needs a lot of time, money, and dedication before you could achieve the skills that will bring you profit most of the time.",

Profitability should be the top priority and just incorporate the necessary risk management simultaneously. We are trading to earn profit and not to minimize loss. You should not trade if your main goal to minimize your losses you will always be afraid whenever you are experiencing minor losses while you can earn more if you will just bare with the losses a little bit. Invest what you can afford to lose so that you will not be to cautious on risk in a way that you will sacrifice already the aspect of profitability.",

Risk management is only one of many factors, it is important, but you should not focus on it alone and ignore other factors. For me, there is no single best advice in trading, experience everything for yourself and draw your own lessons and experiences. Don't trade on the advice of others or trade on your emotions, everything needs to be calculated carefully. Experience is what you need in trading, you can buy knowledge from others, but the experience can only be exchanged with time and money.",

Because for me, if I have to trade, I'd focus on thinking about what I can do to minimize risk and earn a profit, and building confidence that we can do these things right. The more we think about risk, the more we lose confidence and hard to make good decision because inside our mind is all about uncertainties and this will drive us to losing ends.",

It is necessary to do research on risk management and asset management before investing. If you are going to invest blindly, your losses will increase and you will have an expensive experience. If you make your investment with as little risk as possible, your assets will increase little by little. Rapid wealth and ambition are the biggest barriers to investment.When i first started investing i was buying stocks. By constantly trading, my portfolio eroded over time because i dreamed of getting rich fast. I learned that the system does not work that way, and it cost me dearly. What i will say is that when investing put aside your ambitions and reach prosperity step by step with smart strategies.",

Like if you are losing just $1 to $5 in an account of $250 then you are properly managing your trade but if you only want to retain your capital then you may not be taking proportional risk that can grow your account and you will be stagnant.
