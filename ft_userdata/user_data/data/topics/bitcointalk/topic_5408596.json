If there was any, the thread was probably burried under posts explaining where to get virtual cards to spend your crypto, while i want the exact opposite: i have a virtual card, and i want to buy crypto...",

      "body": "I guess that the bigger problem is not so much the lack of services, but the minimum amount they work with, especially as the fees for handling cards are, afaik, big (or bigger).I've looked at BestChange website for EUR VISA to BTC and I've seen some options/exchangers. Unfortunately only one is shown to accept small amounts; BestChange lists it as minimum 10 EUR, and their FAQ tells about minimum 35 EUR, maybe you see with the support of that exchanger. I've never herd of them, I recommend you also read the reviews and decide for yourself... at least if you don't get anything better.",

      "body": "Indeed... It's the small amounts that are a problem... Those cards are very hard to spend at any place tbh... IRL, the only way i ever managed to spend them is by buying gift cards and using those cards as a partial payment for bigger sums. But in the crypto world, this isn't a feasible option anyways... I really need a service that accepts smaller denomination virtual visa cards if i want any chance for spending my funds.I already tried wise.com, but they give me this error:Code:Your card payment attempt was unsuccessful as your bank did not authorize the payment. Please try again and if the problem persists, contact your bank´s card payment department and ask them to allow card payments to Wise. Alternatively, you can fund this payment via another payment method or by using a different card. also tried skrill... got an error in the same category:Code:Payment declinedContact your bank for more information or try another payment option.Why not pay with bank transfer? It's free and never gets declined.And finally tried b t c bit [dot] net (the one from BestChange)... Doesn't work either Code:Current status Canceled",

Well, the main problem isn't KYC (except for bitpanda, who, for some strange reason, always tells me the picture of my identity card is to blurry, no matter how sharp it is).I'm not a fan of KYC, but i have already reconciled with the fact that, if you want to use a bigger semi-trustworthy company to exchange FIAT <-> BTC, you'll have to fork over your identity card, utility bill and selfie at one point in the process... Sad but true... If you want KYC-less trades, you're pretty much forced to use shady services or P2P, and for people that are not doing such exchanges on a regular basis, it's just not worth it So far, i haven't found a single service that lets me use virtual visa cards with denominations < 10€ to buy crypto... I guess i'll give up and buy amazon gift vouchers or something... Thanks for the tips guys, so far they haven't panned out, but i still appreciate the hints!",
