What platform you are using to purchase Bitcoin because this is so scary if I’m on your shoe since your bank transaction is can be tracked. A simple tip to the authorities by someone that has a grudge to you can make your life miserable. I suggest to stop investing for a while and let the news be cold because your government might be active on catching guys like you for involving banks to do a movement like this. Bitcoin will never gonna die. You can always invest when the smoke is clear in your country. Don’t trade your security over an online investment.",

Ensure you so not speak about it in public domain. Banking and financial services companies will always try to paint a negative picture of cryptocurrency in front of the general public. I have faced it in my country as well when we did not have a clear picture of the regulatory framework. But thankfully it is not fully banned in my country. So keep holding your bitcoin but in silence.",

Don’t trade your security over an online investment.There are countries that actually banned cryptocurrencies and the citizens find a way to buy and sell bitcoin without using the bank. Most of these people use the P2P method and if the exchange is centralized then it will be hard to get the person. But if we look most of these exchanges that offers these services in countries like this are centralized. Advice to the OP aside going totally decentralized and private about cryptocurrency is to also find a way to take his money from all these banks he once used for the transactions involved in cryptocurrency, because the government could freeze all funds in these banks even if it is not used for cryptocurrency transactions again",

Do you think fighting for bitcoin's rights to be accessed by the people will get you some sort of Edward Snowden type of fame? No. So in that regard, don't risk anything that may put you in the bad side of the law. Is it important that we let everyone know of bitcoin and its wonders as early as now? I don't think so. Thing is, a smear campaign only works if the people you're telling it to are already using that product. With Bitcoin being the center of this slander, presumably not a lot of people will catch the drift of this campaign. More so, this will just become a fleeting memory to many, especially when a new All-Time-High happens, or a bull run for that matter. So what should you do? Don't stress about it.",

My country's banks also forbid buying and selling bitcoin or anything related to cryptocurrencies. So we have a solution that when the transaction of money transfer content has absolutely nothing to do with crypto, the bank will not catch errors or detect you. As for countries banning cryptocurrencies, we can still access regular online exchanges without problems.

Even though there are still various ways to access it, the government will certainly not remain idle. The government will create several layers of difficulty for Bitcoin holders with the intention of deterring them from any further involvement with Bitcoin. Typically, the initial impact is the inability to convert it into local currency. Thus, users must sell it using global currency in a manner that is certainly not easy.Waiting until the regulations become slightly more relaxed is the best choice, rather than risking what we have purchased. No need to force it, there are still plenty of other income sources that also have great potential, just like Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin is just a speculative asset, an alternative currency, while a bank is an institution that provides us with many different services. Maybe many people will choose bitcoin as a store of wealth rather than a bank, but besides that, bitcoin does not provide insurance, mortgage loans, loans ... so saying it replaces banks is entirely incorrect. Some governments still ban bitcoin for various reasons, not entirely because they fear it will replace banking. If bitcoin can replace banking or is a real threat, other countries will not legalize bitcoin.",
