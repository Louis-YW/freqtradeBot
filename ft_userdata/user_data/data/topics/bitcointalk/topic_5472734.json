  "content": "Yesterday and Today the Nigerian naira has appreciated significantly against the United States dollar and I think this is the right time I should post this thread. Since the past few months, the Naira has been on a steady crash against the United States dollar (USD), and the impact has not only been experienced by the increasing price of goods and services and the high cost of food prices but also affected by investors and traders looking into investing in Bitcoin because the high rate dollar has reduced the purchasing power of the Naira and some investors could no longer get their hands on Bitcoin, However as of the time of this post, the current rate of USD/NGN is 860/$1 and has traded as low as # 790/$1 as of today which is way cheaper than the price we saw weeks back, which was way high as $1/1,270.Right now, based on my view as a trader, I do see an excellent opportunity right in our face for those who intended to buy Bitcoin but were deterred by the increased rate we saw on the P2P platforms such as Binance and the other platforms. ConclusionTherefore, if you wanted to buy Bitcoin weeks back but couldn't due to the high rate of the US dollar against the Naira, I do think that now seems to be the right time to do so and by applying a proper DCA strategy in buying BTC via P2P exchange as there is a high percentage chance that we might not see the rate go lower than what we have right now.",

Now sef wey e be say we dun near the festive period, I just dey reason how market price go be.

I think, your strategy to DCA should not be affected by high exchange rate, DCA is based on a consistent behavior pattern to investing no matter the challenges.",

      "body": "As for me this NGN860/$1 and NGN790/$1 as traded in the stock market is still high. Like yesterday in AIT news, there was a commentator who said that for everything to go down to the normal price again, dollar has to go down to NGN250 or NGN200 and that was how it was in  the former President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. In fact at of that time dollar was NGN150/$1. Since when this APC Government came in, Nigerians have been suffering from the National Level to the local level. Everything going up and non will come down. If true true dollar come down the #150 even if #200 then God don answer our prayers for us. But for now I never really sure say this news go last. E bi like say to make just make us happy small then carry go back to the 1k+ again. Nigeria e no get strong government to bring back anything we don go up. Wen something go in naija, dat thing na skyrocket be im name an d he no go come down to di normal again. I lost #5 in my house for over 9 months now and I can't use it to buy anything so it is just in  the house. And when down was #150, you would used it too buy many things but today we are doom.I am not yet sake for the move of naira against dollar because it might be a plan work to deceive people and for a period of time and go up and as I said, this  NGN860/$1 or NGN790/$1 will not have any impact on food and clothes. No seller will reduce their goods instead some traders will increase it.Many people no the dollar be their problem oh na money dem no det. And another thing if the dollar rate is low and bitcoin is high sef go affect people to invest.",

The market just took a breath of those fast moves because what goes up fast will as well go down fast and that's what I believe is the situation on the ground with the current Naira gain of strength, Therefore, most likely in the coming days and weeks, the exchange rate will go back to #1000/$1 and become more stable or form range than what we have seen between the naira and the dollar do lately which is volatile than supposed to be stable.",

Meaning if converting from Dollars to Nigerian Naira there is always an advantage due to how the dollars has surpassed the Naira giving it higher amount over Naira just as this morning I sold dollars at the rate of 964 per Naira which shows a very weak point on dollar and a good entering point for Naira.",

You do not have to relate it with dollar.From the chart, you can see how bitcoin has fallen if relating it with naira, and this makes this time an opportunity to buy more bitcoin with naira.",

Oh! It was like that on BTC/NGN spot trading on binance. I will advice you to not let that to be deceiving you as that price is not accurate sometimes and I do not use it again. Look at this: BTC/NGN price manipulation on Binance or what is thisThat did not happened in parallel market but happen on Binance. I have seen similar things often like that on BTC/NGN price on Binance spot market. Now Bitcoin in parallel market is around ₦984 or higher, but ₦912 on on Binance spot market.",

So I would take that hard time of living to be matter of hard economic system and not pointing at the values of the fiats exchange.The value of USD over NGN was to affect traders that is investors specifically with foreign exchange such us importers x exporters or those on foreign financial exchange but was not necessary to hit the local invest as much as that.So here you got it wrong because the price of goods and services including high cost of living in our localities still remains them same but that of the importers and exporters including those on foreign exchanges are on the benefitial side of the appreciation of NGN against USD.The depreciation of NGN against USD never deprived any investors to Invest on Bitcoin as consider because Bitcoin is always affordable according to what an investor could afford to Invest as a minimum and there is no exceeded maximum tag in the Bitcoin investment industry rather, the said invertors who waiting for the value of NGN over USD at today is technically a measure of marketing and investors techniques and not that there was no chances to get into the market at any cost.",

Take you for instance my recent experience with purchasing things in the market, most retail traders don't sell without making calls to confirm the current exchange rate from their suppliers, so this tells you the fact. Quote from: EluguHcman on November 04, 2023, 04:27:04 PMeven the local products are also hiked.

I know say d former price wey been dey read N1K+ dey very discouraging to buy dollar with but now na very good time. For those wey don buy at higher price, dem fit use DCA approach to balance what they’ve bought before with dis one and their total spending will come down to a reduced price that what they bought it earlier which is a very good opportunity. As you said, this might ne the lowest price it might go. I miss seeing the price at less than N800 but it is now already trading at N900+ now which is also a good time before it starts depreciating against dollar again.",
