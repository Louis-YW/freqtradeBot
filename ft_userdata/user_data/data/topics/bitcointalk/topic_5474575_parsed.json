My online gambling escapades haven't exactly made me rich.  Probably just like you... But that's the gambling life, isn't it? Sometimes it feels like the luck's on your side, and then there are those days that make you question everything. Ever think about calling it quits? Haha just messing around, of course.",

Everyone who I know is having more losses than winnings, and that is expected, since the house edge is against them on long term. There are few exception of successful gamblers and personally, I don't know any of them, although I'm sure they do exist. They are the jackpot and lottery winners who are lucky enough to hit a huge prize once in a lifetime. Every other average gamblers you are aware of, are just killing their time and having some fun betting, because in no way they are profiting from gambling on long term.",

      "body": "never bothered checking whether I'm on the green or in the red. Why? Cause I know that gambling is beneath me. That's not to misconstrue, I gamble just like any other guy in this board, sometimes even more than some of you lol. It's just that, for me to be so invested about checking whether I'm on a net profit or net loss would require so much mental work that I could've invested on other important stuff, like actually looking for a job that could pay me. To circumvent the negative effects that not checking your winnings and gambling history could bring, I make sure to be disciplined and smart with my gambling decisions as always. I even employed (and I will die in this hill) this particular system where you stop gambling for the day after earning either 3 wins or 3 losses cumulatively. That's how I make sure I don't go off the deep end.",

This set of people who are successful in gambling have years  of experience in that field, they study past records and current trends, including slight changes which aid them in making accurate or near-accurate predictions. While we emphasise on the fact that gambling is base on luck, we should also note that having vast knowledge and the right information at the right time helps to some extent.",

I have always gamble and sometimes I win and loss but I don't like thinking of my losses because it is something normal and as long as I enjoyed the entertainment, I am cool with it.Most people that we hear about their wins, are just one sided people because most of them must have lost big but they wouldn't tell us this so that we don't see them as reckless gamblers.

Me personally, I would say i'm in the red, but I'm not betting a million dollars either. The best way to profit IMO in gambling is via sportsbetting.

Yes, losses  is more than winning but this is the truth in speaking about gambling thing.You cant really be finding yourself to have assurance to be on positive and you would really be finding yourself that desperate on the time that you would really be that aiming for money.I agree on some points that the only way that you could be having an advantage on winning isnt on casino based games but rather it would be on sports bettingon which you could really be able to increase your odds of winning if you are really that simply that knowledgeable on the choices that you are making.We could really be able to apply any analysis on which basing up with some research on which it would be increasing out that kind of chance on hitting the right choice.Aside from sports betting you could also deal up with some card games which are strategic ones too.",

I don't think there are enough of them, and one of them might be on this forum, it's possible. Actually I think the point of view of successful gamblers can be divided into several things, I often hear that successful gamblers are those who can keep their gambling involvement very well and not too excessive, they only bring a logical and realistic mindset to each gambling session, and on the other hand there are also those who apparently consider that successful gamblers are those who always manage to get big wins consistently, I often hear both of these things.I agree for the first point that I mentioned above, but for the second one it really doesn't make sense, how can they be so sure that there are successful gamblers who can always get big wins, while on the other hand the proven fact is that usually defeat is more common, because casinos will not be that easy to give them a win especially consistently, it's quite impossible. I think it doesn't hurt for you to check the number of wins and losses, it will be useful to remind you and provide information, if indeed the loss is greater then you should reduce your gambling, I see you have done that and it's good that you have chosen the right thing. Of course it's better to reduce your losses.",
