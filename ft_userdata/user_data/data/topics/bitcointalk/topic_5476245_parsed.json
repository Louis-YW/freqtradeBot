  "content": "The record breaking high transaction fee of 83 bitcoin paid for a transaction of bitcoin which the block was mined by Antpool had earlier reported here which was found out to be a hacked wallet due to weak randomization of seed has been after a tweet on X. Now the pool that got lucky to mine the block in which is AntPool is ready to return the excess fees. Although it is not mandatory to return the fees but they are willing to return it. Now the procedure is to just sign a message using the private of the sending address. The procedure is as explained here by AntPool with deadline set to 10 December. My problem or say concern is what if the hacker is still in possession of the keys and ends signing the message. Should Antpool decides to be careful and send the excess bitcoin back to that address as any new address collected by them might also belong to the hacker and in sending it back to the address again what if the sweeping malware is still on the address and the bitcoin is immediately sent out again to the hacker new address is there away for the network to block this kind of immediate transaction again from that same account for the main time. Just like double spending sometimes is rendered invalid by most nodes. If you’re the owner and you are not if the private key is with the hacker and they could use it to Sign the message what will you do at this moment?",

If it's possible to contact them then probably I would send them all the necessary information that I am going to need to prove that it's my bitcoin and I think that Antpool is smart enough to know that there's a possibility that the address that will sign the message might be hacked so they will definitely cooperate on that matter.",

Such as: showing authentic conversations between the owner and whoever they acquired the funds from (could be socially engineered but may be harder if done using accounts that have kyc or are from a prominent figure that can vouch too), signing addresses that paid that one (especially if there's an old input that can be signed along with the address that was hacked or a screenshot of a withdrawal and additional proof - such as a forwarded email and corresponding exchange statements).",

It is not a first time a mining pool shows intention to return over paid transaction fee by mistake like this one.It shows they are not a greedy pool but with the emergence of seizure, sanctions on platforms that be used for money laundering, mining pools like Antpool will have to be careful.It can be a hacked, it can be a money laundering activity.Bitcoin miner F2Pool returns 19.8 bitcoin to Paxos after overpaid fee",

I'd suggest reaching out to Antpool to clarify what happened.  Maybe share more proof that you're the rightful owner and hope they're sensible enough not to send the coins back to an address that has already been compromised.",

As the original owner of the wallet, I should have enough evidence to show to antpool that I am the real owner of the wallet. Antpool are very smart and I know that by signing a message won’t be all they need from the original owner to just do and they’ll send the excess bitcoin fees back. It is great that they are willing to send back, but it will take a long procedure and vigorous investigation and proofs by the original owner before they will send the bitcoin back.",

As I know, the pool is ready to pay it back and if ownership is verified, they will proceed those bitcoin back to the owner.I don't check the address from which bitcoin was sent with the overpaid fee (not sure the X account posted a valid signed message) and it is the pool responsibility to do it.",
