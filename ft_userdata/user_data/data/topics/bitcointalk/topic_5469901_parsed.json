Many exchanges are making big profits from copy trading in case we don't know. Responding to the phenomenon of copy trading, actually this is a feature that does make it easier to trade, only need to copy or follow other professional traders then it will automatically trade according to who will be selected.There are many pros and cons of using copy trading, but this feature is mostly used for beginners who do not have 24 hours to watch the market and those who cannot make good decisions. Trading emotions can be avoided because it only copies the positions of other traders. It's a good idea before copying, to research whether the person you're following has a good portfolio or not. There are points that determine whether the trader is recommended or not. But certainly always relying on copy trading is not good, learning to trade manually and analyzing by yourself is the best in order to gain appropriate trading skills and expertise.",

Obviously this was driven by an unskilled person. and by people who wants to be rich over-night.Are you referring to copy trade on some platforms, or just people following influencer calls on social media? If it is the latter, I wouldn't be surprised. Pump and dump is not new, and sadly a lot of people still fall for this trick due to fomo. If it is the former, then some blame lies on the follower since most platforms show the trader's track record. It is quite naive to think that the platform is wrong when they choose a risky trader. If the platform doesn't show any risk profile, then people should stop using them. If Binance doesn't have a feature like that, I don't think they will last long since people can blindly choose a trader without knowing how terrible their calls are.",

I'm generally not a fan of copy-trading and have never done it nor did any research or checked the commissions and everything on any exchange platform, and Binance is charging 10% commission on every successful trade, isn't that a lot? This is exactly the reason why I believe one should always do their trades themselves instead of copying someone else and giving a very big chunk of the profits to the platform which will eventually make you lose money just like how the house edge in a casino platform eats up your profit in the long-term.Trading is not as difficult as some might think of it, and anyone that has the basic knowledge and can read and understand things and grasp ideas easily can learn everything they need to become a successful trader. After the knowledge, it's all about patience and dedication, and you won't need to copy someone else's trades.",

It makes sense that we should have criteria of choosing a lead trader. One of those is what is followed by the majority, that mostly there is no available slot so it is good to copytrade. The other one is that those whose PnL is upward sloping since when they started, and not those impulsive up move and not consistent. DYOR",
