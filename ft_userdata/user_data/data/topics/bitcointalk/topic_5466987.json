No, not yet to the best of my knowledge.2. Yes (Usually, see next answer)?.3. Personally I'm confused on the funding here - Paper cert says for firstbits FyPcLJVM (No match on walletexplorer.com)? - Coin shows as fyPcLJVM (Also no match on walletexplorer.com)?  Also, scanning the coin brings me to dead page on titanbtc. We sure this is actually a PK, or did he fuck it up and it's really 2fA?  edit - if it's 2FA, it's only worth like what, .48 cents on the dollar? Fuckin' Tim Fillmore is a scumbag (sorry).",

I would consider this a crapshoot unless it was peeled, because, no - there is no database available anymore - Tim lost btc at MTgox, and is currently paying out \"verified holders\" of 2FA coins at the rate of .48 per dollar, afaik.  MJ, jsut curious how many you have seen of these successfully peeled etc?",
