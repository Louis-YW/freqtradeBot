I decided to study about the Blockchain recently, and came across something that raises some questions about the Blockchain security.The question is Quote If someone managed to mine an invalid block five years ago, effectively spending coins without a valid signature, would this constitute a fundamental issue with the Bitcoin protocol, potentially rendering it compromised? If it were possible for someone to consistently mine invalid blocks and bypass the network's rules, wouldnt it indicate a significant issue with the Bitcoin network's security?",

If that happened, that block would've been included exclusively in that specific miner's blockchain,the rest of the network just rejected it for being invalid and most likely accepted a valid block of the same height from other miners.The key factor here is it's not just the miner who'll decide which block to include to their blockchain but the full nodes (whole network) as well.",

This can be done accidentally where an invalid transaction is mined without proper validation and if included in a block renders it invalid. This also can be done intentionally by the miner(s) but it will never get to propagate Long into the network before it is rendered invalid block by other nodes and also other blocks mined on top of this. That is the sweet part of decentralization, many nodes needs to verify a block, so even if one miner is doing it intentionally they would just be wasting their hash rate or power. A recent example of this case happened last week where Marathon miner mined an invalid block due to a transaction in a wrong order (probably the child transaction is in a lower block to the parent transaction)",

There's no benefit for this miner to mine invalid blocks because the rest of the network would reject such invalid blocks.Invalid blocks happen rather rarely. As far as my nodes logged such invalid blocks, there were about three of them in approx. the last six months (none in maybe a year or more before as far as I remember before since about end of July 2021, see P.S. at the end):block 783426 and 784121: mined by F2pool and invalid due to exceeding the SIG_OPS limit of all transactions within a block which is currently 80,000block 809478: mined by MARA pool and invalid due to wrong order of some interdependent transactions, namely at least one child transaction occurring before its parentThe invalid blocks didn't cause any disruption as the Bitcoin network worked as intended. Other consensus compliant nodes rejected the invalid blocks.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 04, 2023, 07:30:15 AMA recent example of this case happened last week where Marathon miner mined an invalid block due to a transaction in a wrong order (probably the child transaction is in a lower block to the parent transaction)What do you mean by \"lower block\"? Parent and child transaction, at least one dependent pair of transactions, were in the same block but their order in the invalid block was wrong because of some foolish transaction sorting: the child preceded the parent transaction which is not allowed.Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 04, 2023, 08:45:04 AMI am shocked to see, that BTC blockchain was not perfect at the start.

And as far as I perceive it, Core devs aren't reckless to implement fancy features without carefully evaluating their possible consequences (that is sometimes very hard if not nearly impossible).P.S.I checked my \"oldest\" RaspiBlitz node that has the longest history of chaintip branches of all my nodes (use bitcoin-cli getchaintips to get a list of all those your own node knows about) and above three invalid blocks were the only ones that this node knows about from end of July 2021 on.",

From your explanation i deduced that all independent transactions do not take order in the block. But for dependent transactions (parent and Child) broadcasted almost the same. Now both waiting in the mempool and a miner decides to pick any transaction to his own candidate block then picks the child first, without the knowledge of the parent which happens to be the output to be used for the child, he would render that child invalid first until it verifies the parent and then the child precedes it. If so this then the only place where order of transaction in a block is required.",

Independent individual transaction which do not depend on any other transactions in that same block can be ordered in any order the miner likes. In reality, almost all miners simply order transactions from highest to lowest fee rates. You can see this in action if you open the most recent block here and simply start scrolling down the list of transactions. It starts at 413 sats/vbyte and decreases as you go down.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 04, 2023, 01:12:02 PMIf so this then the only place where order of transaction in a block is required.The only other stipulation on order of transactions is that the first transaction in the block must be the Coinbase transaction.",

Your transaction either agrees with the rules, or it doesn't. If it's the latter, then the full nodes (which are literally what we call \"Bitcoin network\") will reject it. If you want to validate something that is invalid, then your only option is to fork the client and enforce your rules.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on October 04, 2023, 10:56:15 AMThe probability of finding invalid blocks in the past will be higher given that the block reward was 50k or lessHow is the block reward relevant with the frequency of invalid blocks?Quote from: Yamane_Keto on October 04, 2023, 10:56:15 AMI do not think that such blocks will be minedThere is no doubt.

My guess is that by sorting the transaction array, it makes it trivial to make out which transactions aren't worth as much as new incoming transactions. No, except for mandatory rules like coinbase transaction must be the first in any block and for linked/interdependant transactions parent comes before a child transaction. To my knowledge any other order is irrelevant.If a miner has less transactions in his mempool than fit into a block he doesn't need to make a choice and no particular ordering is required except for above stated mandatory rules.If a miner has more transactions in his mempool than fit into a block he needs to make some sort of choice which usually is to cram as many transactions into the available space in the candidate block usually in the order of high to lower feerate per transaction or transaction package (interdependant transactions). Another limiting factor is sum of SIG_OPs of all transactions in the candidate block which must not exceed current limit of 80,000.I assume that such feerate based ordering is applied almost always because it's a \"natural\" code path, it doesn't hurt to do it as long as you don't violate mandatory ordering rules. You could avoid having two separate code paths (one for all transactions fit into the candidate block, no particular ordering needed except mandatory rules ordering; the other where you have to pick a subset of transactions from your mempool because not all would fit into a block).In pool reality things are likely more complicated to allow to include arbitrary transactions into your candidate block for whatever reasons.",
