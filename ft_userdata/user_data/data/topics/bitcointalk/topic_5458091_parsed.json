      "body": "rby reviews MegaPari Registration Option Used/My Experience:I registered with my phone which is my favourite option when it comes to casino. I opted for e-mail type of registration and I was immediately given a generated kind of USER ID upon completing the registration. I also immediately confirmed my email which had 72hrs deadline to conclude. My registration was seamless and completed within 3mins, I wish winning will be this easy in Megapari The bonuses/ Special offer I picked:Megapari has alot of bonuses which includes but not limited to; First deposit Cash back   Accumulator of the day  Spin it to win The golden era   Big bang  I would have loved 75% Saturday football bonus but I completed this review before Saturday. So for review purpose I decided to try a new thing Bets via TelegramThe deposit method and experience:I was amazed to see wide range of deposit methods in these categories;Recommended method  E-wallets E-Voucher Cash  CryptocurrencyI used the cryptocurrency method USDT(TRC-20). In less than 5mins, I recieved a message in my account confirming the deposit. It was a fast deposit for me, let's see if the withdrawal will be as fast as the deposit.My Experience in the sportsbook section:I didn't have a glorifying experience in this section. At first I had issues in selecting the betting option I wanted amidst the variety, not until I discovered the subheading above and it was easy for me to make selection.But then, I had a horrible experience that made me lose money by selling my bet for 25% loss.  I don't know if it was a bug or a ploy to ensure everyone at the stage of displaying betslip must not return without placing a bet.I had a bet on the Champions League finals with the option of Manchester City win and over 2.5 goals which gave me an odd of 3.7. When I realised that I selected under 2.5 instead of over 2.5, I went back to correct it without submitting. But going back to my bet history I discovered that the bet has been placed twice against my wish and action. I had no option than to sell one of the bets at 25% loss and left one (which is against my picking, under instead of over). So, my experience here wasn't pleasant.My experience about the Bet Slip:The betslip is self explanatory and cool.My experience in Casino section:As I do not delight in betting on outcomes that are not real as sport betting. I do not have experience on how to go about this section  and I ended up trying few games and lost The withdrawal method I used and my experience:I think the withdrawal method aspect is not needed because Megapari already said that same method for deposit will be same method for withdrawalQuoteThe currency you select will affect which payment methods you can use to make deposits and withdrawals. After you’ve registered, you will not be able to change your account currency.I would want to know the reason for this, though I can't figure out any.I placed a withdrawal through USDT (TRC-20), unlike how seamless it was in deposit, there was no provision for QR code scanning and due to the security of my wallet, I couldn't copy the address. I had to manually type in my withdrawal address and cross check upto 3 times.Within 2mins my withdrawal was approved by Megapari and I have to wait for about 10mins and it dropped in my wallet. It is understandable that someone withdrawing will pay for the fees, but then I didn't know that the (withdrawal fee and/or transaction fee) will be more than 2x higher than what it cost me to deposit. Well, there wasn't provision to set my fee myself which will depend how long I'll wait to receive my withdrawal. Is something like that even possible, if yes I will like it to be implemented. My opinion about the existing promotions:Megapari has variety of promotions, I couldn't ask for more. However, some of the promotions require intensive KYC which made me not to benefit from any. I still understand that without strict KYC, the bonuses would be abused.My UI/UX experience:I am more than impressed with UX design of Megapari site. I didn't struggle to find sections and functions in the site. It is user friendly even to newbies in betting. (The light version is more user friendly on mobile) but seems of the same load time with full version. There is consistent fonts and great color blend that keeps the sight pleasant irrespective of how long you stay in the site. I didn't check if there is switch of mode because I was landed to my favourite dark mode on registration (I doubt if there are people these days who use sites without dark mode)The desktop viewAs expected,  the desktop view is more elaborate but I didn't dwell much on the desktop as I didn't even login through the desktop. I visited as a guest. But then on the footer of both the mobile and desktop version there is not FAQs.Application version Since there's an app, I downloaded the app - Megapari V.14(7110):I am surprised this is not mentioned to be covered in the review. I can say that both the mobile and desktop views are cool but the app is superb and I am sure I will never return to any of the former. I believe if I used this earlier, I wouldn't have hard the ugly experience in sports betting. Suggestions/Questions:1.  Inclusion of FAQ in the sticky footer I don't know if it exists anywhere in the site in any form, but assuming I saw it, some of my questions would have been answered. And I wouldn't want to bug this review with much questions. The position of FAQ is always bold and obvious. 2.  Questions from T&CQuote3. In some cases we require additional proof - proof of funds (to make sure player uses his/her own money when gamble at our site).Which methods of proof of funds do you require. I ask because I have seen where a gambling company denied a gambler payment because he provided cryptocurrency as his means of earning a living and it was rejected. If Megapari can clarify here, I will appreciate. 3.  Question about withdrawal Quote10. The Company has the right to request additional information about the Customer if the withdrawal method is different from the deposit method. Is this as serious as it sounds. What does it prevent?I mean I can deposit with BTC and withdraw to a random new BTC address. 4.  Question about data accessQuote11. We may disclose your Personal Information to companies, organizations or individuals not associated with Megapari if you have given us consent to these actions.I understand that if requested by law enforcement agencies, Megapari will release the data of her customers to the government. But since my experience in gambling, I have never been sent a consent request by a company to share my data with another organisation. If they do that without my consent I don't know (which is very likely). Megapari, have you been met with this situation before that you have to consent your customers to share their data?5. Suggestion on loading display:That little time I'll wait for Megapari site interface to load, I would like to be seeing either Megapari or her logo rather than seeing something like this .The more the brand is exposed to sight, the more it sinks to the memory (a major advantage of bitcointalk signature campaign).This is example of what I meant just for clarity purpose. This is the loading icon of one gambling company. 6.  Security eye icon on registration password While registering, I had a bit difficulty to input my somewhat long password because there’s no password visibility icon. This made me had to type-in my password like a grade one mavis learning typist and then, there’s no provision for password reconfirmation. This could make someone enter a different password from what was intended upon registration.However, this was corrected in the application version of Megapari while login in.Conclusions:It took hours of my time to produce this review. My experience with Megapari in overall is not a bad one. I think I will be playing here for now.I will at this time step aside for other reviewers to cover where I wasn't able to touch and hopefully if there is a need to update this review, I'll do so because the more I use the platform, the more acquainted I'll be with it.Thanks Royse777 and Welldone Megapari team!",

      "body": "ULVEN Review MegapariI recently had the opportunity to explore Megapari, and I would like to share my experience with you. Here are the key aspects I would like to discuss in this review:1. Registration Option:I chose the email registration option, which was a straightforward process. The website also provides options for registration via phone, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred method.2. Bonus Option:For the bonus, I chose the sports option. Megapari offers various bonus options, including casino+games, welcome free bet, and the option to cancel and make a choice later. I found the sports bonus to be enticing and it added value to my overall betting experience.3. Deposit Method and Experience: I used the Bitcoin deposit method and found the process to be smooth. Megapari supports multiple deposit methods, allowing users to choose the most convenient option for them. The deposit experience was fast, secure, and hassle-free.4. Sportsbook Section:I was impressed with the sportsbook section on Megapari. It offers a wide range of sports and betting markets to choose from. The odds were competitive, and the platform provided in-depth statistics and live updates, enhancing the overall sports betting experience.5. Bet Slip:The bet slip feature on Megapari is user-friendly and intuitive. It allowed me to easily manage and track my bets. I appreciated the convenience it provided, especially when placing multiple bets across different sports events.6. Casino + Games Section:In the casino + games section, I explored various games and slots offered by Megapari.Some notable games I played include Princess Goddess, Eros Sexy and Hot & Spicy Jackpot. The selection was impressive, and the gameplay was smooth and entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the immersive graphics and engaging features of the slots.7. Withdrawal Method and Experience:When it comes to withdrawing my winnings, I encountered an issue as I couldn't find the Bitcoin withdrawal window. Instead, I found other available methods, but they are unsupported in my country. I am currently awaiting support response and will share my withdrawal experience later.Here I am back, the issue has been fixed. The withdrawal process was smooth and fast, as the withdrawal request was approved and executed within a short time.8. Existing Promotions: Megapari provides a range of exciting promotions. I found the promotions to be diverse and rewarding, enhancing the overall betting and gaming experience. It's worth exploring the promotions page to take advantage of the available offers.9. Overall Platform Experience: Both the web and mobile platforms of Megapari provided a seamless user experience. Navigating from one page to another was smooth, and I had no trouble finding the desired features and sections. The platform's design and layout are visually appealing and intuitive.10. Suggestions for Improvement: While my overall experience was positive, I believe there is room for improvement. One suggestion I have is to enhance the customer support system to provide more responsive assistance. Additionally, adding more localized payment options would further enhance user convenience.11. Most Liked Section: Among all the sections, I particularly enjoyed the sportsbook section the most. The wide selection of sports and the comprehensive betting options made it a standout feature for me.12. Lucky Moment:During my gambling sessions with Megapari, I had a lucky moment when playing Princess Goddess. The thrill of winning added to the excitement of the overall experience.In conclusion, Megapari offers a comprehensive betting and gaming platform with a range of features to cater to different preferences. The user-friendly interface, diverse game selection, competitive odds, and enticing bonuses make it a noteworthy choice. Whether you're a sports betting enthusiast or a casino gaming fan, Megapari provides an enjoyable and rewarding experience.Please note that the review is based on my personal experience and individual results may vary.",

      "body": "I had the opportunity to test Megapari and spent some time on the site, here's my review.Registration :I registered by choosing the email option. The process is quick, clear and simple. I should mention, however, that I didn't receive a confirmation e-mail for a long time, which surprised me, but is by no means a problem. The procedure is really efficient, and we don't overwhelm you with unconsidered requests.Deposit I chose the cryptocurrency deposit method (specifically Bitcoin). It's very good, no hidden fees, everything is clear, the deposit appeared almost immediately after the integration of my txid in a block.I really appreciated the variety of cryptos available for the deposit. However, if your TnC allow it, I might suggest you to accept XMR deposits, as the Monero community is always looking for XMR-friendly casinos. I know that the anonymous nature of this currency can make its inclusion complex for an online plateform, but if never you want to, you could earn a good number of users.Other deposit methods are standard (bank transfer, Mastercard/Visa, Astropay, PerfectMoney etc.), but I haven't tested them now.Bonus I chose the bonus related to Sports among all the others that I will describe later. The bonus policy is quite generous, and clear.Sportsbook Section and bet slip:The choice of sports for sports betting is impressive and vast. I was pleasantly surprised, almost everything is covered! I personally bet on the Champions League final and a Nascar race. I thought the odds were cool. The real-time updating is a good point. Exploring a bit, I saw that even betting on politics or Eurovision is possible, so it's very cool to offer such variety! However, I couldn't find a way to bet on chess games, which is a sad because that's the only thing I couldn't find that's on my betting list! The bet slip is simple and straightforward, and I have nothing to say about it. Maybe a quick access from the main page would be nice, but it's a whim because  it's accessible in two clicks.Casino + Games Section:I tested a few of the casino's games and slots: Ghost Hunter, Aviator, F777 Fighter, Sun of Egypt 3, Roulette Grand Croupier, or Power of Gods Medusa for example. There's something for everyone. I particularly appreciated the choice of slots which leave the player a minimum of possible action on his part, giving the opportunity to play without it being only totally random, for example with Aviator, which was a discovery I really enjoyed.I really like the menu on the left in the web browser version, it allows quick sorting and selection of what you want, and encourages you to make discoveries. I forced myself to get away from my classic Blackjack and I didn't regret it!   Withdrawal :I haven't made any withdrawals yet, because I've been playing small amounts and it's not worth it. I'll update this post when I do. After reading the TnC, I saw that only the deposit methods already used can be used for withdrawals, which means that the casino applies AML measures. For me, this is an excellent thing, and offers credibility to the casino, I'm always extremely suspicious when it's not like this, it's a good point for MegaPari. A platform that respects some basic rules has a longer lifespan and generally offers a clean service to its users.Existing Promotions:There are many promotions and bonuses available: welcome bonuses, cashback, offers for VIP customers. As I write this review, there are promotions on NBA betting and on Roland Garros. I haven't taken advantage of them, but I think it's great to offer promotions on current major events.Overall Platform Experience:The platform is clear and very responsive. I haven't experienced any excessive loading times, everything is in working order, clean and professional, which is exactly what I expect from a casino. The same applies to the mobile and browser versions.Suggestions for Improvement:Overall, the platform is good and well designed. I've had problems connecting to the site, as my operator refuses to use HSTS. Apparently this is not a common problem for users. (What surprises me is that my operator is present in many European countries, but this is in no way Megapari's fault.) The team was reactive in assisting me in identifying the problem and providing solutions.I couldn’t find anything to do with gambling addiction or user-side problems help. Perhaps you could consider adding self-exclusion possibilities, cool-off periods, even outside national regulations. This would enable you to avoid losing customers with financial or gambling addiction problems. For example, if some users has problems of this type, instead of deleting their account to avoid aggravating them, they could self-exclude for a given period of time. This would be beneficial for you, because when the user returns, he'll still have his account, and he could feel assisted by the platform regarding his problems. Preferred section:My favorite section is the casino section. I think the choice and layout of the page are really cool. Keep up the good work!Lucky Moment:I had some good luck with Sun of Egypt 3. I managed to have some good ratios!  It's always nice to see winnings, no matter how small (I play with small sums), it's motivating and makes you want to keep going!",

      "body": "Megapari Review:Heard of this site in the past, but never signed up. I got the opportunity to check it out thanks to their ongoing review campaign and the following are my personal observations.-Registration:Registration was quite simple. I chose the phone number option since I felt comfortable providing it to this particular site. I received the registration details pretty quickly. The password can be changed, but the account number can't be changed.-Bonus:Their first deposit bonuses are decent, but what really caught my eye was 'Accumulator of the day' bonus since I am a big fan of Accas/Parlays. They are premade accumulator bets which provide a 10% boost in odds. Great value!-Deposits:Their deposit methods are numerous and provide a good combination of FIAT and crypto payment methods. I went with the BTC deposit method and my funds reached my account pretty quickly. The amount will be displayed in the currency that you chose on top of the screen.-Sportsbook:I have a mixed opinion about their sportsbook section. It looks great on desktop and I didn't really find any issues there, but it is pretty tough to navigate on mobile(Including Full-screen view). For example, the support chat button clashed with some of the UI elements making it really annoying. This particular area needs more optimisation.-Bet Slip:The bet slip was designed well since I didn't face any trouble while placing bets on mobile and desktop. Its size could be lowered a bit though on mobile since I felt it looked a bit too big.-Casino:I observed that there were many, many slots games, live casino games, poker and megagames(In-house games). My favorite one among them was 'Rich Wilde and the Book of Dead'. Loved the fact that the minimum wager in this game was just a couple of cents which isn't common in slots games.-Withdrawal:Their withdrawal options are pretty much identical to their deposit options which is a good thing. I made sure that I met the wagering requirements for withdrawal after which I proceeded to use Dogecoin as my withdrawal option which turned out to be the right decision since the funds reached my wallet within 10 minutes which is excellent transfer time.-Promotions:I primarily liked their NBA and Accumulator(Mentioned above) bonuses since I bet regularly on basketball matches(NBA and NCAA-B) and I love accumulators/parlays. I suggest checking them out.-Suggestions:My biggest suggestion is to optimize the user interface on mobiles primarily because of the fact that some UI elements(Support chat button etc) seem to be clashing with other UI elements. Another suggestion is to add an FAQ section that answers important queries on the top/bottom of the page since the blog option is pretty much pointless.-Favourite Section:My favorite part of the site is actually the odds format option which can be found on top of the page. The ability to customise several parts of the odds format enhances convenience to a great extent.-Lucky moment:I wagered all my funds on Aviator and thankfully won decent profit which is my luckiest moment so far.-Overall Experience:The entire process from depositing my funds, placing bets in the sportsbook as well as casino games and withdrawing my funds was effective and efficient for the most part. I enjoyed the desktop experience way more than my mobile experience though. If you are looking for a site that provides sportsbook+casino with a multitude of deposit and withdrawal options, I recommend Megapari.",

      "body": "I spent some time testing out MegaPari website and this is what I can say:Registration was quick and simple with email address and I was not asked any complicated questions during this process.I wanted to enter special bitcointalk bonus later in setting, but than I realized it can only be done during registration and not later.This should be corrected in my opinion because people sometimes forget to do at registration or they found out about bonus later. Website loads fast and everything worked good during my testing, but I really didnt like the whole process of depositing and withdrawing coins.First I had to select my main currency for account, but I could alter select additional coins and normal currencies.I deposited Litecoin but my main currency was USDT so it was confusing to me if I can withdraw only one of them or both.I asked support for help, but sadly I had to say that some of them dont know what they are talking about, or they are robots.I dont want to name anyone from support team but I think this was my worst support from all crypto gambling websites I used and they need to improve.After depositing coins they showed up quickly in my account and I was able to use them for betting on Sports and Games.Sports section is good and I like many options available for sport events, Champions League and other big sport events had huge amount of betting options.It was easy to select bet I want betslip was good enough for my betting needs.Everything was shown correctly in betting history, but I had small issue that each time I closed browser I had to enter login details again even after I selected option to stay logged in.I placed a bet on Machester City in Champions League and it was a winning bet.There is a big selection of Casino Games and I had good luck playing few of them, and I am not a biggest fan of slots but I do play them sometimes.My two favorite games from MegaPari is LORD FORTUNE 2 and HIT THE GOLD!, maybe because I won nice jackpot It was super fun playing this games.I tested withdrawal one time using USDT and it was approved quickly, after that I could see coins arriving in my wallet.Like I said before, I dont like whole depositing and withdrawing procedure and it can be confusing even for me who is doing this for years.I tried to add other coins but I could not find LTC but only mLTC, and it was like that for other coins.I would rework whole deposit withdrawal page.Promotional offers are ok but I want to see more free bets, and I want to use welcome bonus later after registration, this was not working in my case.I prefer using desktop version but I downloaded and tested MegaPari mobile app, and everything worked fine, navigation was easy and I was able to change to dark theme that looks better for me.I search on Google store and I found three Megapari different apps, I dont know if some of them are scam or not, but I installed one directly from official website.Maybe MegaPAri teams should check if they are legit or not.My overall experience is ok but I need to see lot of improvements everywhere to make me use this casino all the time.Things that need to be improved is support, deposit withdrawal page system, and I want to see clarification about connection with other suspicious gambling websites.I want to see more MMA events added for betting, other than usual UFC and I want to see LIVE MMA betting, that is not available on other crypto gambling websites.Best time spent in MegaPari was when I won jackpot playing games, and I made nice profit while using this website.Everyone should make their own research before using this website.update:Now I played some more game HIT THE GOLD and I won again, but then I was not allowed to withdraw my coins because there was a limit on USDT.They removed 2 USDT two times from my account and there was no withdrawal.Support told me to try later because USDT withdrawal is limited and not possible.So confusing",

      "body": "Quote from: Wiwo on June 10, 2023, 10:06:18 PMHaving 1xbet as your competitors give you and edge over them here in the forum, since most forum members believe that 1xbet is being run by the same syndicate who operate 1xbit whose image here in the forum is very bad. With their long qque of unresolved accusations against them and their deliberate and systematically scamming tactic. So if you do better as you mentioned than you will have a free market since 1xbet won't attract anyone here and as a competitor that make it easy for you to defeat them in any ways.  Well, what I meant here is that they are operating in the markets were have established ourselves. Still, many players trust them because of the brand awareness strategy they are running. Affiliates choose them for partnerships as well. So, we can't deny their presence as one of the giants on the industry. Anyway, as it often happens with gigantic brands, they tend to rely on the time they are on the market rather then the quality of service they are providing.

Honestly, I also dont really get what you mean by \"main currency\". You are welcome to add multiple wallets in any currency you like. Please check this instruction:In order to avoid exchange difference, you are welcome to add wallets to your account in any currency you would like. For example, add a USDT Tether wallet at MegaPari to your account and deposit from your USDT Tether wallet. Otherwise, as you can see on the screenshot, the currency of my deposits are in MAD, but the account is in EUR. So, when I deposit in MAD, the internal system will exchange MAD to EUR and credit the end sum after the exchange. Does it make sense for you? >I search on Google store and I found three Megapari different apps, I dont know if some of them are scam or not, but I installed one directly from official website.Maybe MegaPAri teams should check if they are legit or not.[/quote]At the moment there are no official apps on Play Market. Please use the apps provided on the website or here on the forum. Regarding your withdrawal - some coins are closed for maintainance at the moment. It is true that if your last deposit is in LTC, you should withdraw with LTC. And what you mean reducing USDT? Have you been credited 2 dollars for sth?",

SuggestionsWell I think the kyc terms on the platform shoukd be reviewed as it isn't really fair to do kyc even on $10 Withdrawal but rather there should be a trigger point for kyc.Lucky MomentI randomly  placed a bet and won over 3k naira and I was happy because I wasn't hoping for a win. Favorite sectionI enjoyed the colorful background  since it was in a dark themed background and I also loved the casino  section but I ran because the losses was too much there.",

      "body": "SamReomo Review of MegaPariI was lucky enough to test this amazing platform and got the opportunity to leave my honest review after that. Here is my review of Megapari.Registration and login process:First of all I visited the homepage of Megapari and found the Registration button, and when I clicked on it and I was taken to the registration page where a pop-up appeared that had the title \"Register and Receive Bonus Right now,\" and there were three options to register either by Phone, by e-mail, or by social networks and messengers. In the social networks and messengers options I had the option to select either Google or Telegram, but I didn't chose any of those options, instead I went with the option of by e-mail and entered my e-mail address and a password and clicked on Register button. The account was instantly created and I was asked to verify the account by clicking on the link sent to my mail, I clicked on that and registration was completed. After registration I entered my e-mail id and password and logged in to the Megapari site. Bonus optionUnfortunately, I haven’t received any bonuses because I didn’t updated my personal information during the deposit time. Although, I picked the sports welcome bonus on first deposit and there are many bonuses for new users who complete their registration and fill their personal information before depositing funds into the website.The Interface of the websiteOnce I was logged into the website I started checking the interface of the website. I first clicked on the sports button and I was taken to the sports betting page. The page was really nicely made and the interface was very user friendly. I found an event on the page and I clicked on it, I was taken to the page of the event where I could bet on a team, the event page interface was very professionally created and the option of betting and bet-slip was on the right corner of the page. Once I was done on viewing sports page I clicked on live button and selected e-sports option. The interface of the e-sports page was very simple and there was a live preview of a match of Dota 2. The option to place bets was still on the right corner of the page. I then viewed all pages of the site one by one and I haven't faced any bugs, or any kind of lag at all. The site was performing very well and everything was so smooth. Deposit Method and Depositing experienceAfter viewing the interface of the site it was time to deposit the money and do some betting on the Megapari platform. I clicked on the \"Deposit\" button and a pop-up appeared, I got excited when I saw the payment methods available on the platform. There were many options to deposit the funds, some of those options were limited to my region while others were for international users. I scrolled down the deposit pop-up page, and viewed the crypto-currencies that were accepted as payment method. The site offered a good number of crypto-currencies for depositing funds, and some of those were USDT (TRC20), TRON, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, XRP, and others. I always prefer Litecoin for depositing funds and that's why I clicked on Litecoin button. After clicking on that a pop-up appeared that include this phrase \"Receive payment information via email,\" and there were options of \"yes\" and \"no.\" I selected the option of \"no\" and clicked on confirm, and within a second a deposit address was generated which was valid for 30 minutes. I went to my Litecoin wallet and created a transaction that worth $12 into the deposit address. After 2/3 confirmations my funds were successfully deposited into my account. The process was easy and simple, and I haven't faced any issue during the depositing stage.Sports book experienceAfter the successful deposit I began my betting journey on the site. My first bet was on sports page where I placed my bet in favor of Australia on Ashes Series of England vs Australia, and selected the stake worth almost 0.35$ in value, and I clicked on confirm button. The bet was confirmed instantly and I moved on to place another bet. I continued betting on some other events without proper research only for the purpose of the review, and some of my bets went well and won but most of those were losses because of not doing proper research. The page was very responsive and bets were accepted instantly without any issue.My opinion regarding bet slipThe bet slip is very innovative one and is easily adjustable. Modifying the amount and then placing the bet is like a charm on this site. I was truly intrigued by the bet slip and its simplicity.E-sports betting experienceI then went to e-sports page and started betting on e-sports live events and once again I wasn't sure that which teams were good and which weren't, I just started betting without any research and luckily I won some bets in e-sports events. All of the best were purely of instinct but luck favored me and I won some of those bets. I placed bets of many live events of  CS:GO, Dota 2, LOL, and other games events and my experience of betting on those events was truly awesome. Like on the sports page the bets were instantly accepted in e-sports page and there wasn't any issue at all during betting.Betting on Live pageI placed some bets on live events just to check the outcome. I selected virtual sports from live events and then DS virtual gaming, and finally I clicked on DS racing karts. The game loaded within few seconds and I started betting on it. Unfortunately, I lost my bets on that game because I was just betting for testing purpose and I had no previous knowledge of betting on such virtual games. However, the experience was really good because the game was truly good and the betting system once again was instant.Casino games and bettingI started betting on Casino games with slots Texas Holdem and the experience with that game was okay and there were not much losses. After playing that game I tested another slot game named “Three Cards” and I lost good sum of money by betting on that game. My gaming experience was average in the casino games page but still I enjoyed playing those games. I faced the losses because I wasn’t really familiar with the three cards game and I played it without reading the rules of the game in first place. The user experience level of the casino games was mind-blowing and I faced no problem at all during playing those games. There were many more casino games on the site but I tested only those two games.Hunting and Fishing gamesAfter losing some amount of money on casino games I went to try some Hunting and fishing games. In that page I started betting with “fishing expedition,” and the game was truly innovative. I started betting with lowest possible amount on the game, and I placed somewhere around 2-5 bets on the game and I got lucky this time. I caught a fish that gave me a “Mega win,” and I recovered the losses of the casino games instantly with this win. I played the game for some more time and then I went to test another game. I started playing “Hook up fishing war,” the game wasn’t like other betting game but was a game which a user can play manually like other casual games. I played the game for some time and the experience was really good with that game. Withdrawing funds from the siteThe platform offers many options for withdrawing your funds. The best option for withdrawing the funds for me was to go with the cryptocurrency withdrawals they offered. The site offers withdrawal of funds with crypto-currencies such as USDT (TRC20), TRON, Dogecoin, XRP, USDT (ERC-20), Binance coin, and ETH (TRC20). Out of those crypto-currencies I chose Dogecoin withdrawal method because of the low fees and good speed. I must say that site didn’t asked for any withdrawal fees, but I thought it’s better to go with Dogecoin to reduce the burden of fees on the site. I requested a withdrawal after some winning and I haven’t yet updated my personal information on site, and the withdrawal went smooth without any issues. After some time I updated my personal details and then continued betting on the platform for a day. The next days I tried to withdraw the money using Dogecoin withdrawal method, but I faced a problem during the withdrawal. The sms of the code wasn’t coming to my phone and I tried resend  button several times but still I was unable to receive the code. I then contacted their Customer support team and shared my issue with them, the CS helped me a lot with withdrawals by sharing me the code in chat. After that I entered the code and clicked on confirmed button and my withdrawal request was accepted. I truly appreciate their Customer support team for their fast response. My opinion regarding existing promotionsThe existing promotions are quite good and they offer some good perks for the users of the platform. The NBA 2023 promotion is currently is exciting one and it offer some good value for the ones who bet on sports. With that promoting one can get a free bet after every 9 bets and that’s truly amazing.My experience with the platformI experienced very good moments with the platform and I found it very useful and entertaining. The site was truly innovate and the games they offered are truly amazing to play. Few of the games on the site are very addictive. I enjoyed each moment on the site and it was really a great experience for me. I checked almost most of the games and features of the website and to my excitement I found no problems at all during testing. The site’s performance was very smooth and I haven’t experienced any lags or slowdowns during the usage. I must say that everyone who’s into gambling should try this site, and after trying it they will love it. All the games are fair and it basically depends on someone’s luck and strategy to play those casino games, hunting and fishing games, and other games. Sports and e-sports betting is amazing on the site and the ones who love betting on their favorite team will find the best place for betting on this site. The depositing and withdrawal experience of the site it truly amazing and there isn’t any delay in withdrawals. My suggestion for the platformDuring testing I found some typos on the site. When I clicked on the homepage I found a type mistake in the bonus code, instead of “Find out more” the written text was “Find out nore” and that’s a type mistake that I want them to fix. Other than that I also recommend them to fix their sms sending issue because it’s somewhat annoying to have delay in receiving of messages or not even receiving messages at all. I hope that they will act on my suggestions and improve those areas of the site. I also recommend Megapari platform to allow new members to avail bonuses in case if new members miss the completion of their personal information so that the users will enjoy the site even more. I also recommend the Megapari team to improve their policies regarding unclaimed bonuses because many new users will miss those amazing bonuses when they join the platform for the first time. My most liked sectionI liked Fishing and Hunting games section the most. And, I recommend the Megapari team to add some more manual games so users with good game play mechanics could earn enough money by playing those games. I also recommend the team to fix the current games, mostly the manual one. Other than that I really enjoyed those games and earned some good profits while playing those games.Lucky moment I felt while gambling with MegapariThe luckiest moment I felt when using Megapari was during playing of the game “fishing expedition.” I lucky got 2 times 20x multiplier by catching a huge fish. The moment was really special for me because that happened after some losses in casino games. However, the winning made me continue to test some other games.",

      "body": "Registration:The registration process was seamless and easy to be fair, I signed up using the email option, and I chose the 130% Sport Bonus option, but unfortunately, I didn’t receive the said Bonus after my registration and first deposit. The reason for that is what I still don’t know.Deposit Method:USDT (Bep 20), My deposit (49.5 UDT) was acknowledged and confirmed within just 2 minutes, that could be as a result of using the bsc chain, but that’s still a very fast deposit timeframe for someone running against time to place a pre live bet on an important fixture and got distracted by other life affairs.User Interface:The website might not be the best I’ve seen but the color combination isn’t bad and the interface looks quite fine, but quite clumsy with way too many games, both live and pre live of multiple sports on the front page, it takes a little while to figure out what sport you’re looking at and finding a particular live event is somewhat stressful in that sense.Site Navigation:The site navigation wasn’t too complicated, it was relatively easy on the website to navigate between different sports, and I like how the different sport competitions / leagues are displayed from a form of dropbox after just highlighting the mouse on the sport choice from the tabs in the upper region of the website. That's for the web version from surfing and placing bets with my laptop.I could barely place any bet on the slot games, the slot page was rather too heavy because of the number games on the slot page, there are over 70 slots games on the page that made scrolling down the page a bit laggy but I was however able to play a couple of spins on the “The Book of Dead” and that’s it. It  would be better to reduce the amount of slot games displayed per row from 5 to 3 or 4, to reduce how slow and slightly laggy the page loads.Bet Placing Experience:My bet placing experience would be an A rating from me, placing bets was the easiest task from my personal experience both on web and my mobile phone, the events/fixtures schedule were arranged in an orderly manner, so bet selection parlay was in no way stressful at all.Withdrawal: N/A, I lost the majority of my bank roll so I couldn’t test the withdrawal option, I still have two open bestlip, so maybe I can get lucky enough.Overall remark and Observations:My general remark and conclusion would be that the platform seemed quite good at least more than some conventional sportsbook, but there is still some work that needs to be done on the platform to make it more enticing for users from their very first glance.Cons: My first question would be, is this site in any way related or affiliated to the likes of  betwinner, Paripesa and 1xbet or 1xbit ? because it’s as though they all together use the same software.",

      "body": "Here is my experience (review) playing at MEGA:PARI RegistrationI preferred to use email as a registration method. However, one thing I noticed was that there was an option to choose currency right at the time of registration and it says that \"The currency you select will affect which payment methods you can use to make deposits and withdrawals. After you’ve registered, you will not be able to change your account currency.\"  So I carefully choose TRX as I want to deposit using TRX.Bonus Option:I preferred the option \"Cancel - Make my choice Later\" So I can choose later as I want to first log in and experience, and then decide which bonus option suits me best. My Deposit Experience:As soon as I signed up, I was asked to set up a payment method to top up my account. There were many varieties of options to choose from like Jeton Wallet, AstroPay, Perfect money E Voucher and also it supported around 20 cryptocurrencies. I selected TRX as a deposit method. The deposit process was very easy and I was instantly given a TRX address ( as i opted for TRX deposit) and it arrived quickly. The important thing for people reading this review the deposit address generated will be valid for 30 mins only. QuoteThis address can only be used once and is valid for only 30 minutes. Each new deposit must be initialized through a new request.Sports Betting Experience:After login, I went straight to my favorite sports betting section and placed a bet on cricket matches. The process was easy and after placing the bet I can also track it through the bet history menu. You can track all of our bets on the bets history page.BetslipGood to see the Betslip option available at Megapuri and it is useful if we regularly bet on sports like me.Esports Betting ExperienceThen I immediately move to e-sports betting and made a bet on Dota 2. DreamLeague. Again the betting experience on this site was cool and easy. No complications.  Casino Games ExperienceI then decided to move to the Casino games and played ROYAL FRUITS 5: HOLD 'N' LINK and ROYAL COINS 2: HOLD & WIN. Played a few of those games but lost all. Maybe unlucky at that moment. However, there are a lot of slot games to choose from and I never get bored once I started to explore the casino games.Withdrawal Experience:I decided to check the withdrawal and again choose the Tron to withdraw. Again this process was easy and my withdrawal request was placed.The withdrawal request status was showing as \"Under Review\". After waiting some time I went to check the transactions history page andthere I found this message.QuoteThe security department reserves the right to decline withdrawal requests if deposit or withdrawal amount(s) do not correspond to the stakes of bets placed (to be able to withdraw funds the deposit amount must be wagered in full in bets with odds of at least 1.1). Criteria for withdrawal approval is the amount of bets placed within the deposit in question.)This means that I first have to wager all of my deposit and only then i can proceed to withdraw. Anyway, I will place bets on cricket matches and see if I can win some bets and then again process the withdrawal. Opinion about Existing Promotions:The promotion at Megapari sites are good ones but unfortunately, I was not able to take advantage of them. As I told you that I did not avail the bonus at first but later when I tried to go to the bonus section (https://megapari.com/office/bonuses?section=deposit) after login, I could not find the bonus.Experience with the Platform:I played on MegaPuri on my laptop and it was a good experience. At first, I was a bit confused as to where to find my account details, betting, and casino option but it does not take me longer to figure out each and every thing. The interface was a bit congested but it is ok if you stay longer on the site. The speed and navigation were smooth and even the slot games load quickly on my system. Few Suggestions:I would suggest making the promotion bonus option after the login easier to access, as I am still unable to find where can i select my initial bonus which I did not select at the login time. Secondly, I would recommend if that sports betting is a bit more organized as it took me a while to choose my favorite game to which I have to bet.The Section i liked MostWell, as I already told you, the sports betting section was my favorite one. Although I placed bets on a couple of matches but i really interested to know about the odds offered by your site and it was interesting indeed. I may be placing more bets on the cricket World cup qualifying matches.Betting on politics was also a new thing for me and I was excited to see that I can bet on political events too.Overall it was a very good experience at MEGA:PARI",

Yes, I mean for the landing page after login it's normal to several live bets there, but having pre live bet there too reduces the of number live bets being display, and I'm quite anyone that's looking to place a Pre-live would always know where to find them, while just seeing a team or match up live could literally influence my decision to settle for a live bet without initial visiting the sportbook for the purpose of placing a live bet.2. While the mobile web page is light and optimal, I saw that there is an Android app for mobile, while there was an app \"Testflight\" for iOS and the Megapari app is no longer available for it, are there any plans to have a standalone iOS app in the nearest future.3. That's good to here because the aforementioned platform isn't welcomed by members of this forum any longer due to multiple allegations of their shenanigans and their very scamming modus operandi.",

      "body": "This is my review, I will probably focus more on the shortcomings than the praises, I believe that your critical opinion is more important.RegistrationI chose to use registration via email address. I am always a supporter of the ID/password combination. I left the local fiat offered as the default deposit currency, later I didn't see any special complications to choose any other deposit method. Immediately after registration, I received an activation email, followed by another one with offered bonusesBonus optionI have to admit that the experience with bonuses on MEGA:PARI is disappointing. - The navigation is very complicated and it seems to me that I was constantly going around in circles, opening new \"how do I get bonuses\" pages. As a regular gambler, I would very quickly give up trying to claim a bonus.- During registration, I didn't see anywhere that it was necessary to \"Fill in all the personal information fields in My Account\", so I didn't even do that. Some sort of KYC for a potential $100 bonus seems unreasonable to me. It should certainly be emphasized before registration and in every bonus promotion, this is how it works as a trick to attract new users.- why is this? \"All types of bonus are disabled for cryptocurrencies, without exception.\" This is also not emphasized anywhere during the bonus promotion, although I would like to hear the reason why it is so.Deposit and experienceI chose Bitcoin as the deposit method. After the second confirmation (8 minutes), I received a message on the platform that the deposit was confirmed. When generating the deposit address, I indicated that I wanted a notification about the deposit via email, but I did not receive it. What confuses me is that each created deposit address can only be used once and is only valid for 30 minutes. Given that the fee varies quite a bit, I wonder what will happen to the deposit if the transaction takes longer than 30 minutes, which is a very realistic scenario.I contacted support to get clarification on this. From a very short conversation, I concluded that the support agents seem to be overburdened. I waited a few minutes for each answer, the only logical explanation is the assumption that he had a large number of users in the conversation at the same time, so he could not fully devote himself to our communication. Also, I did not get a concrete answer to the question of what happens to the deposit after the 30-minute limit, but only a uniform \"Crypto deposits are credited within several hours.\" As a customer, this is not exactly what I want to hear, although I remain of the opinion that agents should be provided with more education about crypto transfers.Sports Betting ExperienceUnfortunately, at the time of writing this review, there are not many current sports that are interesting to me. Royse777 mentioned an event in the invitation, but it ended on the 16th of June.Regardless, I placed some bets. Here I am satisfied with the possibilities as well as the analysis tools offered.What I would definitely suggest is a little better design and more attention to UX. I'm not on gambling platforms every day, but at times it was quite confusing and I wasn't sure if I was on a cricket or tennis page.I don't know if there is a possibility, I didn't manage to find it, but it would be good to enable personalization so that I only have sports that interest me on offer.BetslipSounds fine, but I would like to see some info hints for those of us who come to the platform for the first time.Casino Games ExperienceI tested several games and maybe you have too many choices, I came across some quite boring ones. For example \"THE MINOTAUR\", I almost fell asleep playing it.  Some of the games reported certain problems (I certainly didn't have a connection problem). For example \"INFERNO DIAMONDS 100\" lost connection during the game. Also, one of the Plinko games is not loaded properly or something else is wrongMost of the other games work OK, and some seem better or fairer, but considering the really huge number of games on offer, it takes much more time and money to make a more detailed analysis for each one individually.For example one of the new games \"Piggy show bingo\" seems fun, it kept me a bit longer and I even had some wins there.Some games do not work on the Android application, showing error 404, page expired or does not exist. (new Plinko and suggested Crash)Withdrawal ExperienceUnfortunately, I didn't manage to win any money here, so I wasn't able to test withdraw. However, I submitted a request for a very small amount (probably it will be rejected). I chose the USDT(TRC20) withdrawal option. When submitting the request, I was only informed that a fee would be charged, but I don't know how much it will be.As I expected, the request is rejected, but there is no explanation why. Probably I'm not wagering enoughGiven that you have the rule \"amount must be wagered in full in bets with odds of at least 1.1\", is there a page where this can be tracked? I didn't find it.about Existing PromotionsAlso, I can't say much about the current promotions, because they are all conditioned by certain tasks. Obviously, they are all aimed at regular, everyday users. I already talked about bonuses earlier, which look more like a trick than a welcome. However, there is an interesting offer, as far as I have seen over 20 different promotions and bonuses. I believe that it can be attractive to users.Experience with the PlatformHonestly, I was left with a faint impression. It seems to me that after a while I wouldn't be able to recognize which casino it is if I only saw the interface. There is still a lot of work and customization to make you specific and recognizable. I'm not a fan of non-market apps, but I tried the Android app. And I must admit that here the navigation is much better and clearer. Dark/night mode works well and I have no major complaints here. It seems to me to be the best part of the platformSuggestionsI have the biggest complaints about the UX design (especially the desktop/web version)For example- The categorization of games is not the clearest. I managed to find dice games only after searching by words. Maybe I've overlooked some, and surely there are games that could be interesting to me, but I couldn't find them. Also, snapshots from each game look very similar, most often the dominant red/yellow colour maybe that's why all games look the same.- Navigation should be simpler and more user-friendly. Various offers are everywhere, which adds to the confusion. On the football page, for some reason, I also have an offer for a baseball.- Promotional content like \"Betting Company MEGAPARI\" appears on every page, at some point, it gets boring because it always loads first. I believe that it would be enough if it was in a section \"about you\" or something similar, so whoever wants can read it whenever they want.- You need to define the default colours of your casino. I saw combinations of brown, black-grey, black-brown & two combinations of blue, there are also parts with a white background. For example page: https://megapari.com/bonus/rules/slot_first_deposit Blue text on a blue background is not the happiest choice. At some point, I had more lighting in the room and it was very difficult for me to read.- I am of the opinion that maybe there are too many games here. I believe you have statistics of the most unpopular games, I encourage you to remove them from the offer, they are just needlessly tiring.",

      "body": "Quote from: examplens on June 22, 2023, 12:12:26 PMThis is my review, I will probably focus more on the shortcomings than the praises, I believe that your critical opinion is more important.-snip-Instead, I'm going to focus on the positive because after testing the service my experience was quite seamless and, in retrospective, I have to say that this is one of the best casinos I have ever played for the reasons I will explain below.Registration:I registered by e-mail because I think this is the best way in terms of privacy. Although I'm not really worried about being totally anonymous, I think it is a good practice to give the least amount of data in general on the internet. Other users may find it easier to register via phone for example or other social networks, so I guess that it's good that there are different alternatives, but it's something that I don't particularly value.Bonus:Unlike many players I'm not usually very interested in bonuses. Although I tried to use BITCOINTALK promo code it didn't work, and as I read in the rules that bonuses require phone activation I simply forgot about them for the reason I explained when I talked about registration. But the variety of bonuses seemed reasonable to me: nothing too over the top, which I personally find soothing (I tend to mistrust when bonuses are too good to be true).Deposit:Having so many different deposit methods is great, but unfortunately my experience with the deposit wasn't good. I don't think this will happen with different deposit methods, but I used Bitcoin and network was congested at the moment I sent my sats, so the deposit took several hours to materialise. I think this is against your interests because a client who cannot play at the moment he wants to do it may go elsewhere. As a suggestion, and although I have never seen this feature in casinos, I know that some services offer the possibility to validate the deposit instantly as long as RBF was disabled. I don't know if it will be possible in your case, but it might be worth looking into if you haven't already.I would like to give you another little advice based on my experience. I got scared when I received the following message after making the deposit, as if I was wrong for not having set the amount in a previous step, and I came to doubt whether I could lose the sats sent because it did not match the amount shown, so if it could be fixed that would be great.Sports betting experience:Like in examplens' case, I didn't arrive on time to play the event Royse mentioned (England vs Australia) but I bet in another event and I was really satisfied by all the different alternatives available to play. Number of choices can be a little overwhelming, but I believe that it is better that there are many than too few. France won, so I lost, but I don't regret Casino + Games:I don't know where do Politic bets fit better, so I mention them here. It is great that there is this option, and I tried to guess who will win the future elections in my country. Not the favourite candidate by far, but I believe in black swans and odds where appealing.I enjoyed playing Bingo and, although I'm not a fan of slots, at least it made my eyes happy playing Eros Sexy. On the other hand, I know well the Crash game, but it surprised me this \"Aviator\" version of the game, where you can easily set two different bets at the same time, so you can recover the bet with the first one and risk with the other, although I lost most of the times so I think it's not a good strategy for me...Withdrawal:Unlike with the deposit, my experience with withdrawal was one of the best I've ever had. Withdrawal request of 10€ was processed and accepted in a couple of minutes, and appeared in my wallet in the next seconds. Fees were a bit high, but I suppose that if I chose a different withdrawal method rather than Bitcoin it would have been much cheaper, so this is not your fault.Minimum withdrawal amount of 0.05 mBT (1.38€) is also great: the last casino I visited didn't support withdrawals below 100$ so I get happy when I see reasonable limits like the one you set.Overall experience and a lucky moment:Unlike some other service I reviewed before, in this case games loaded reasonably fast and they worked without too much latency. UX was quite good, interface worked fine and I am grateful that I did not experience typical small unpleasant surprises during the navigation. The website is translated into 64 languages, which removes important barriers for non-bilinguals and expands the potential market. Spanish translation wasn't perfect, but it was indeed very decent and it contrasts with the too typical machine translations that give a bad impression to natives players.So my overall experience, as advanced at the beginning of this review, was very good, one of the best I ever had to be honest. It's not like I'm an expert, since I'm a very occasional gambler, but sensations were really good.And I'll finish with a lucky moment: the first time I played Bingo I won!! This was a clear case of beginner's luck, because although I played like 10 more times I did not get a victory again in an expected but still painful regression to the mean",

      "body": "Registration:Registration made with email. This is the easiest and privacy compliant solution.I Have seen their bonus in sports book but it is not for me (I don't play multiple events). I have not choice any bonus during registration. At the end I have taken the bonus “take the prize” related to slots. It's something really useful for people playing a lot on slots… Deposit Method:I have used Btc as method for deposit. Why not use LN or segwit address for payment? It could help to save some fees...The email received by the provider (I have verified after a while) was something \"strange\" (it's the first time that I see it).It would be nice if a pop-up will advice people that \"upcoming email\" is arriving from this vendor.User Interface:Related sports book section, the interface contains too much information, too much link, too much words, too much letters. Just take in count sports live page: 15516 letter  vs 4229 (generic competitor - don't pretend to be something scientific but just to point out the issue). This is not helpful for gambler... or maybe it's just because I don't like overcrowded page/ I prefer essential/minimal data.If I want to bet on a certain event (especially as I do in my case that I practically only play live) I don't want to be distracted by too much information (for example \"multiple bet of the day\" / mini slot / offers  ) in my opinion it is a bit too dispersive and I don't know how much it will actually help the player. Positive aspect, finally a site that also allows you to play on horse racing and greyhounds! It is not very common in betting sites especially among those that use crypto. Excellent selection of events (abundant with many choices) including minor series events. This is definitely a positive thing!Site Navigation:As reported before, there are too many tabs, too many info in the same page. (Italian version has a typo here piatatforma ---> piattaforma!)Bet Placing Experience Sports / Slots:Unfortunately I wasn't able to play match suggested by Royse777. [that I want to thank for being available in private for any doubt that arise during the test  ]I tried the bet slip: I would call it standard. Here too, I see a lot of written text (it would be nice to have pop ups or information that comes out only if requested by the bettor) example \"bet with one click\" option \"additional (maximum bet etc)... I don't need to see \"sale of the bet slip\" (I still have to place it) I tried some slots. I played lava gold from bet soft. The slot is nice (I was also \"lucky\" winning a couple of bucks with minimum bet) but I see that it is really slow (and stopped 3 times on a dozen spins of the slot!) At a certain point I decide to quit (this can be also an issue linked to my current internet connection, but never happens with other casino).Withdrawal: N/A, I lost my bets today on Sinner, so no, no withdrawal for me. I have seen there are several options. Overall remark and a lucky moment:I have sold one of my bet (in negative!) just to play blackjack! and I was lucky!I believe that with some small updates and small changes it could surely be a reference site. I would happy to see more bonus and promotions for sports gambling. Pro: there is a wide selection of games and the possibility of betting on events even in minor leagues and an excellent presence of a whole series of combinations that are often no longer presented in many bookmakers.Cons: Wall of text! Too many options on the same page. I was unaware of the site  before this review campaign. (more marketing or similar activities must be launched)",

      "body": "After carefully evaluating my recent experience with Megapari, I feel compelled to share my thoughts about their platform:RegistrationI signed up using my email address, and the process went smoothly. I chose the Casino Bonus and entered the promo code \"BITCOINTALK\" in the promo code field. However, I later discovered that the promo code doesn't exist. Unfortunately, the casino bonus I selected was not credited to my account because I deposited using cryptocurrency. I didn't pay attention to that requirement until the support team informed me. Their support is a bit slow, though. It took almost 1 hour to receive their first response and around 10 minutes for the subsequent ones. However, I believe the support agent is knowledgeable about their site; they just need to respond more quickly. Are you guys slacking?  lol.Sports bettingThey offer a wide range of sports for placing bets and have many live games, some of which can be watched live on their site. However, I think the live games should not autoplay. Users should have the option to decide if they want to watch them. The auto-play could strain the network for users. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with their sportsbook.Bet slip- Offers 4 bet categories:  - Accumulator  - Singles  - Lucky  - Chain Bet (the tooltip for this is currently not in English)- Offers bet acceptance options:  - Confirm  - Accept any change  - Accept if the odds change- There is a feature to sell the bet slip in case you change your mind.There is an edit button for the bet slips in the \"My Bets\" section, but I'm not sure what it's for. Overall, the bet slip functionality is good, as it gives users flexibility with their bets. I like it.SlotsAfter around 30 spins, I won a few bucks. Later, I switched to another slot game and bet with the minimum allowed. However, the very next slot I played depleted my balance within a few minutes, maybe around 10 minutes, lol!LottoThe input areas in the lotto section lack labels, making it difficult for players to determine the purpose of each field. I didn't try playing it as I'm struggling to understand how it should be played. It would be helpful to have a help section for that.BingoI played it once but didn't win. It would be better if there was an indicator in the past bet UI to show whether it was a \"win\" or a \"lose.\"Now the withdrawal.Unfortunately, since I was unlucky during my first deposit and playing session, I won't be able to form an opinion on the withdrawal process for now. However, I still have a few bucks left from my wins on their sportsbook. I'll use that later and see what I can get.Their promos.Megapari offers a plethora of bonuses, all of which are undoubtedly enticing. However, I find it discouraging that they have disabled all bonuses when playing with cryptocurrencies. This limitation is a significant drawback, I must admit.The header contains a lot of elements and doesn't look neat. I don't like that half of the site's page is filled with promotional content. The page lacks responsiveness, which would make it easier for users to navigate regardless of the device they are using. Additionally, when clicking on the \"My Account\" dropdown button, it redirects the user to the \"Personal Profile.\" I suggest adding \"Personal Profile\" to the dropdown items and removing the href from the dropdown button, would be great also to remove that functionality from other dropdown buttons. I believe that the site should undergo a redesign and optimization process. It should incorporate modern design elements and themes, and utilize appealing color palettes. Creating a separate landing page that provides an overview of the available features and offerings would be beneficial, instead of directly landing on the sports betting page. However, if the intention was to have it that way, then it can be considered as well.During my session, I couldn't help but feel fortunate. I do hope for Megapari to expand their provider selection by including esteemed providers such as Pragmatic Play.I would love to explore more, but my eyes are getting strained. I will make any necessary edits later when I have the time.",

I was told that the choosing a currency by signing up is basically just a platform feature. It does not affect anything else, you can create wallets in another currency and use them on an equal basis with the main one. I have forwarded your note to the product dept for them to check wether we can change it in future. To check available matches:1 - choose just a line or a live line, then find the button under the number 2 on the screen, scroll down a little to Sports A-Z and find the desired sport.The filter can be done both for all matches in general and for matches of a specific league (3)Quote from: examplens on June 22, 2023, 12:12:26 PM-  It should certainly be emphasized before registration and in every bonus promotion, this is how it works as a trick to attract new users.Hey. Thanks for submitting your review. Would you please elaborate how do you see the whole process? I mean, such things can not be put on the registration page in order not to overfill it.

Given that the fee varies quite a bit, I wonder what will happen to the deposit if the transaction takes longer than 30 minutes, which is a very realistic scenario.You need to send your deposit to the given address within 30 mins. After that, the adress automatically gets updated. It does not mean your funds will be lost or stuck. QuoteAs I expected, the request is rejected, but there is no explanation why As your deposit is in BTC, the withdrawal should  be to BTC. P.S.It would be great if you provided some screenshots and elaborated on your ideas/ preferences, as honestly, I can see that your experience was deeply individual and differs from other reviewers, which found both the offer and the navigation quite satisfying.
