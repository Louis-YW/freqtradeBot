Find out more or start Nasdaq trading at Reflectioni would like to suggest another methods, investing in US stocks from india is possible through few different methods. the mostly common method is to open an overseas trading account(the activity of trading goods and services with other countries) with a domestic broker. This requires you to open a trading account with a broker in india that has tie-ups with brokers in the US, allowing you to invest in US stocks.you can also open a trading account with a foreign broker, which requires you to set up a secure trading platform to access the US stock market. Additionally, you can open an account with a mutual fund or portfolio management service provided by an indian broker which you already discussed. Lastly, you can use a automated investment advisor to invest in US stocks from india. each method has its own advantages and risks, so it is important to research each option before investing.",
