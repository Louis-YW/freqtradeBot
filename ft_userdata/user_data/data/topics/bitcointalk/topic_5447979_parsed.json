I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not sure how correct I am, but I think that'll still be considered as an account abuse and/or bet limit evasion.Ideally, it is but in the actual or technical situation, it isn't since the person isn't betting on his own account nor creating a new account to bypass that limit.  @OP is just sharing his thought and letting the owner of the account trust him and bet on it.  With the difference in the jurisdiction, and different people owning the account, I don't think it will be tagged as bypassing the betting limit of other people.  Unless the owner of the account confessed that the bet is coming from the limited party, I do not think that the casino or bookmaker can trace it.  But obviously, to avoid unnecessary problems in the future, this cooperation should be avoided.",

Very funny though. OP has been on the winning side on all casinos OP has identified with. This  means that casino too are afraid of winners winning too much to go a long way limiting them from certain games and amount to play with nd they the casino want players to keep loosing without any limitations to them playing even going as far as suspending accounts so a bit to return gamblers funds.This topic sounds funny though for a gambler to get to the point of being limited on casinos for winning too much, this should be a record on OP profile as to be a good gambler.",

I won't advice anyone to take this type of offer and if you don't have any alternative Op, it's better you call gambling a quit look for other alternative to entertain yourself rather than to put the account of other users at risk. P.s. And if any user here still goes to op privately even after all the warning don't forget to trend carefully with him/her because there is a high probability that you might be scammed by Op. And if you come back complaining I'm pretty sure you'll be ignored by forum users the same way you ignored all the warning.",

Your account is limit for having a shady winning history either arbitrage betting or you are betting only on value bets which your account was tag as unprofitable.Buying an account will surely result to danger on the original identity in case you are involved on money laundering since the account was KYC.
