  "content": "$SPUNK is an ultra low supply and low tax ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum Blockchain, brought to you by GameFi Launchpad DeFi Punkz Labs. The upcoming game, Shiba Punkz is a revolutionary NFT-based P2E Battle Royale based in a vibrant ecosystem that provides players an experience never before seen in DeFi. Punkz Labs is powered and backed by the native token $SPUNK, which must be held in a certain quantity in the wallet of any individual partaking in this experience.Players will take the role of Spunkle in the single player campaign and blast familiar characters from popular token and NFT projects while burning Shiba Inu and earning $SPUNK tokens. In the multiplayer arena, players will battle others in online game modes to earn even more. Both game modes will allow players to upgrade their characters with weapons, special abilities & loot boxes, stake their NFT for rewards, or rent out their characters to split rewards with seasoned vets.Punkz Labs is creating a staking platform for the ShibaPunkz NFTs which gives a multiplier on staking rewards. The rarest NFT’s guarantee a high % APY. All NFTs are linked to our gaming DAO (DefiPunkz) and each NFT gives you a % of vote in the final decisions of the game. If you hold a lot of NFTs you have more weight on the voting and what’s decided.Site: shibapunkz.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/ShibaPunkz",
