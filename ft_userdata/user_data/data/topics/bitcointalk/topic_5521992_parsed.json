Many people are trying to take advantage of Bitcoin popularity to chase cheap publicity that's a cowardly act. As a Crypto-currency enthusiasts you should be able to make decisions by yourself after you must have done your research and also be accountable for your decisions you don't need anyone telling what to do.",

I am not interested.Just as expected, all his preachings are just against Bitcoin and criticising it, saying how Bitcoin can't help pay the trillions of dollars of debt that the US government owes. It's nothing far from what we expect from him. But the interesting part of the whole thing is the comment section. It's clear that he's a good financial expert, but when it comes to bitcoin, he gets it all wrong. There's a statement in the comment section that says, \"If he had bought bitcoin just 5 years ago when the price was still below $10000, by now the profit would have given him enough money to buy as much metal as he wants and stock. Now is a digital era. The world has far grown past the age where only gold and silver were regarded as the ultimate.",

He just kept going round in circles about what Jerome Powell said about BTC and how he thinks he's wrong, bla bla bla. It is actually fun watching people like Schiff try so hard to be negative about BTC, but struggle at valid reasons to push their agenda.",

Today the price of gold is around $2600 so it barely moved in 14 years, while bitcoin has gone up nearly 6,000%.Compared to bitcoin, or even the S&P 500 gold is a joke. Only idiots invest in gold. Gold doesn't even keep up with inflation. Even a certificate of deposit does better than gold.If Schiff ever learns how to use a calculator, he would realize what a total baffoon he is.

You are in a Bitcoin forum so what do you expect from us? Do you expect that we will watch the whole video? If you're following an idiot like him, now's the time to switch sides. Just imagine this, you bought $1000 worth of Gold and Bitcoin in 2022 when the market is down. Which of the 2 will give you more profit? It's Bitcoin, but since you're following what Schiff is saying, you missed the opportunity to earn more.  He's been criticizing Bitcoin for years and still criticizing it on his X account until now. Nothing new, but I hope he realizes that nobody's following him and what he's saying.Speaking of criticism, here's another person that's criticizing Bitcoin as well. He's saying that he knows how the creator is and when he comes out, he says that BITCOIN WILL GO TO ZERO. His name is Dan Pena.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Gyoe8LxSyMI",
