Lower metrics than BCH, SHIBA, Filecoin, Apecoin or Axie Infinity.I seriously doubt that exchanges made any bets on BSV and use it as collateral, investment or in any vital financial product or department.If all of this is indeed true and they \"upgraded\" the code with some backdoors all it will do is lose more worshippers and get delisted from those few exchanges that stil tolerate them.The fact that they expect such code to be implemented into BTC is bonkers. Could a judge obligate open source devs to change the code ? Regarding the lawsuits, I propose we make a coin and do a ICO to raise funds for future lawsuits.Call it CWLF ( craig wright lawsuit fund) and list it on some exchanges.And everytime he loses and will be obligated to pay damages the money will be used to buy the coins off the exchanges so price goes up and investors get some ROI. Rinse and repeat. The way I see it he will not stop going to court and we might as well get something out of it. Of course with the ones being sued receiving the most percet of CWLF Coins.",

I can see this as being something that they would help fight in terms of the OSS.

EG depending on how he termed/worded a claim/question to prove his claim determines how you can respond/defend(limits what you can say). as your response becomes limited to HIS claim/question... where also no response/reaction is also a win for him..the best defence is to counter.. to make a counter claim where you are then in control of the narrative more. as hodlonaut did, and good for him to do this(being the plaintiff not defendant)for instance the cobra case was a default paper loss for cobra simple because, by not reacting/responding the plaintiff wins by defaultif cobra was someone that was open to doxing himself by counter suing CSW cobra cobra could have easily won..",

His efforts divert funding from people who would otherwise buy bitcoin and invest in the ecosystem into supporting Wright. His actions make the whole space look fraudulent.  His people meet with government officials and lobby for bad policy to harm Bitcoin. etc.None of this stuff should be a concern *if* the community steps up and even resists it mildly.  But since Wright looks like such a pathetic clown people tend to dismiss him completely and fail to step up and resist it.  A foe doesn't have to be formidable to destroy you if you won't resist.",
