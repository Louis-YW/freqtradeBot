Where are you buying the NFT from? Magic eiden? Or are you using magic eiden as a wallet? If you're using multiple wallets but the same nft marketplace, the issue could be coming from the nft marketplace or the listing itself.",

      "body": "Based on the error, your current balance is not enough to cover the fees but by checking the taproot address on the mempool it shows BTC more than enough to cover it. The wierd part is this \"Not enough confirmed spendable funds. Address has: 0.0000429BTC\". It looks like ordinals/incriptions in your taproot address has a value in BTC which is unspendable; a normal explorer like mempool.space reads it as a BTC funds but in fact it's ordinals/incriptions.So I think to solve your case, you better deposit a BTC again on this address to cover the fees needed.",

That time given is just a rough estimation on how quick they can answer. So, if the tickets are filled with a lot of people talking about their concerns.It only means that he has to wait longer.
