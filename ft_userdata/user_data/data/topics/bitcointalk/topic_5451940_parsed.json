I would also recommend starting your crypto journey with Bitcoin, as it's accepted by the most merchants. But, it's also important to diversify your portfolio. You maybe consider other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Litecoin later. It's also crucial to start with small investments and monitor your portfolio performance time-to-time.",

You need to do research before making a choice on a particular Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the best advice for Newbies who are just starting to invest in crypto assets. Don't easily believe the news spread via the internet about the potential for a new Cryptocurrency that is booming for any reason. Focus on your goals, if you have doubts about the potential you have, forget it and leave it. The best choice to maintain asset value on coins that have strong fundamentals, always avoid Fomo which can get you stuck in it. Keep your funds in Bitcoin gradually, you will feel the benefits when the Bitcoin price increases again.",

It's the most preferred cryptocurency because it's the oldest and most trusted due to its years of existence. Most reputed members will tell you to invest in Bitcoin and they're not wrong for giving you the safest option in the market. Bitcoin is the safest among every cryptocurency in the market that you can invest in at the moment, and be guaranteed of a future return. The profits mightn't be as big as others (assuming they get pumped) but it'll be reasonable and you won't be put in a situation were you'll be forced to sell your coins because of the price crashing.While you're making Bitcoin your focus investment, there's nothing wrong with having some altcoins to gamble on. Kindly understand that your investment in those altcoins are pure gamble and you can lose all the money invested. Instead of going to the casino I invest some of my spare money into some altcoins but I don't take them serious or hold them for a very long term. After some significant amount of gains I pull my investment from the altcoins investment and accumulate some more Bitcoin.",

They’re both risky actually, but bitcoin is way more profitable and more secured investment compared to altcoins. That’s the reason why even long time crypto investors still chose bitcoin over a lot of altcoins. And for beginner investor like you, if you want to succeed with bitcoin, don’t invest for greed and expect short term profits, but focus more on long term hodling as that will promise huge amount of returns in the future.",
