The \"story\" of your \"friend\" also sounds a little bit sus to be honest. Don't know if you just want to send traffic to the site or what the agenda is.Anyway, people here are not stupid.",

These have existed for a long time, they take your money and then show that they are increasing your money while you remain in the delusion and put in more money hoping for it be created out of thin air, while in reality all your money is being stolen.Newbies should do well to avoid these and any \"friend\" who talks about them should be scolded and told not to spread such scams.OP has edited the links in the post. @Zwei , @AHOYBRAUSE Please edit the quote from your side too, links are still clickable there.",

So, these sites are obvious scams and in best case scenario they are playing a long game, trying to lure you to invest more just to then take your money while in most cases they will take your first depost and never give you anything back.",

This is a bit weird because I just checked their website and it says the minimum deposit amount for the cheapest plan (Starter) is $600!Anyway, the above members are correct. Both websites are scams and I hope you will be as lucky as your friend and will be able to withdraw your money. If you do, never think of reinvesting a single penny there.
