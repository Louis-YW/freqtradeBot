  "content": "Hello matesSorry to bring this complainant upon this forum as i m eager to know if any of you have made an attempt to initiate withdrawal from IQcent option.This complainant was brought to me by a friend of mine, who loves trading in many brokers got engage with the said iqcent option she was asked to make a minimal deposit of $100 worth in btc and she could starts her trading journey with iqcent as the case may be she deposit and started but never made lot from it instead she lost about $6 within short period of joining them though she was managing her funds very well, after some months she never visited the site due to academic issues studying to meet up for her exams. To cut the whole story shorts, she don't want to trade anymore and wanting to withdraw the remaining left over $94 and she wasn't able to withdraw it due to unknown reasons and she brought it up to me since she knew i'm always online and have been active about cryptocurrencies related issues.I have tried to initiate the withdrawal and they gave me some warning about their rulessaying, she most trade to make about 10 to 20 percent of her initial deposit before she could withdraw or if she has not been able to meet up with the said rules and she wants to withdraw, she have to pay 20 percent of initial capital then before she could be allowed to withdraw. Due to despiracy and wanted to settle her bills at school she gave me permission to proceed with the withdrawal and adhered to 20 percent fee to be deducted from her. We entered the withdrawal via BTC and it has not been credited to the btc address provided instead after 7 working days the payment will be reversed to her trading account and we have mailed the financial department, use live chat support but nothing has been done till date instead withdrawal rejected.At the point of this i asked her to hold on lemme post to see if she could get any help from forum as well.Screenshots, i don't want to make them visible but you can only from the links belowhttps://imgur.com/3CwE9MDhttps://imgur.com/8VhkGdGhttps://imgur.com/TwiRVm2https://imgur.com/pxIvKEmShe needs help from us if anyone can provide any solution or contribution.Warning avoid!!!Do not make account with them or trade with them for any reason.",

It was from then i noticed she will always be scammed, because any woman or man in desperate to make gain is then too open to be scammed.",

      "body": "Sounds like they're just making excuses to prevent withdrawals, shady business practice in any case.But I noticed iqcent.pro is only a month old and you did mention she left her funds for months in the platform. Did the account load the same data when she logged in after a long time or she had to appeal and give some previous information first?In any case, iqcent.com as well as the .pro doesn't seem regulated and is an offshore company so no one knows its team and whereabouts. Huge red flag! I'd move this to scam accusations @op.",

      "body": "How many months your friend didn't visit the site?Is it your real friend? Or you just found this girl/man on the telegram?Look at the domain age belowQuoteDomain:iqcent.proRegistrar:Porkbun LLCRegistered On:2022-10-16Expires On:2027-10-16Updated On:2022-10-21Status:clientDeleteProhibitedclientTransferProhibitedName Servers:woz.ns.cloudflare.comadel.ns.cloudflare.comAre you sure that she is your friend?And I never heard of any exchange or broker site that uses the .pro domain. They usually use .com and country-related domains.So I think she's not your friend she might be just promoting the website or trying to ask help from you until she asks for a deposit amount to withdraw the money it is more likely a scam attempt.",

I did all I could but no avail, I contacted their live chat support representative she directed me to email the financial department for faster assistance which I did the first time and I later told her to follow up their messages if they replied back. I think they replied and asked to deduct 20 percent fee from the withdrawal amount, which I asked her about they were about to deduct so she said I should continue with their terms after which I proceed with the withdrawal till date as I m responding to this message withdrawal has not been delivered to the address provided instead it was rejected by them. Menh I was fucking tired of helping her out so i left it for her to sort her issues besides when she was make registration and deposit with them I wasn't there as I wasn't initiated to know if the platform is genuine Â not after funds being stocked inside then I was consulted for assistance yet no good result was made out of it.Thank you for your research sir.",

That's pretty bad she doesn't know that the website is new and it's pretty risky to deposit any amount to a website that doesn't have any reputation yet.Why don't you just tell her frankly that the website or trading site is a scam?And you don't have power to retrieve them since crypto is irreversible.Actually, I also have a friend who experience the same thing just a few months ago she told me that she had a balance/funds from a broker/trading site but he can't able to withdraw I told her after checking the website and domain age the site is new and I frankly tell her that the website is a scam. However, she doesn't believe me because YouTube gives her some proof I tried to check YouTube but all of them are fake with comments turned off. She was attracted by the free reward which is why she ended up registering and using a voucher code just to earn the reward but can't able to withdraw.So I guess it's also happened to your friend",
