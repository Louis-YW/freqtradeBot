  "content": "The hacker behind one of the largest crypto hacks in 2022 is active again$155 million worth of ETH has been moved to a decentralized exchangeThe Wormhole team is offering a $10 million bounty for the return of stolen fundsCybersecurity firm warns of phishing websites posing as Wormhole BridgeThe hacker who exploited the popular cross-chain protocol, Wormhole, has made a move. After months of inactivity, the individual responsible for one of the largest hacks in 2022 has sent $155 million worth of ETH to a decentralized exchange.According to blockchain data analysis platform, CertiK, the hacker sent 95,630 ETH to OpenOcean DEX before converting it into ETH-pegged assets such as Lido Finance's staked ETH (stETH) and wrapped staked (wstETH). The hacker then used the wrapped staked Ether as collateral to take out a $13 million loan in the stablecoin DAI in an attempt to buy nearly 7,989.5 ETH via Kyber Network. The trades were repeated multiple times.In response to the renewed activity, the Wormhole team has once again offered a bounty of $10 million for the return of all stolen funds. The cybersecurity firm, Ancilla, has also issued a warning that many of the Google ads for \"Wormhole Bridge\" are actually phishing websites.Looks like the hacker is still active, be careful with phishing websites, hopefully they can be caught soon.",

Stop distracting yourself from easy conditions by adding more complication and overplaying than that.With such a clear level you have absolutely no reason to mess around and try to be a super-trader (unless you have a very solid system and want to actively trade all small ups and downs of this market) otherwise, play it simple and 20IQ.",

Right now it is nearly 9 trillion USD. Before 2008 it was under a trillion USD. My point is, $5m from 20 years ago probably have the same purschasing power of today's $50m and it will get even worse. The FDIC will insure every deposit account regardless of their balance. That's insane. Why can't we just let the bad businesses go bankrupt anymore?",

We cannot compare bounty prizes decades ago with today because of the influence of inflation and interest rates. I think $10 million dollars is a good price and actually it's still below the price of the 2 people mentioned above because $5 million dollars back then was really high.",
