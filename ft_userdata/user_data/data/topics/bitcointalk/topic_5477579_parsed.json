If you would have shed a light on these two factors then your post would convey the full message.I did some research on my own and find out that Monaco is city of French Riviera and it is famous as tax haven, where there is no income tax and they might be providing huge or best investment opportunities, but I doubted what must have convinced your cousin to prefer residency than creating an account although the difference is crystal clear which is luxury life and high standard of living and more security. I will say after getting a residency it won't be difficult for your cousin to open a bank account there so I should say he made a good cousin at last he is a good investor so he must know what he is doing and decisions are totally based on individual's mindset so one thing can be good for us while might not be for other.",

There is likely a limited amount of applicants and that country has an extremely high threshold for entry, a few million makes you a pauper. Your cousin likely understands the situation more than you do, if he has been able to accumulate a high level of wealth. Sensible people are quite happy living next door in Nice and doing a day trip when they want, rather than the empty trophy of acquiring citizenship in a such a location when there are many better places for cheaper.",

Even if they refuse to give him the details, he has the right the request information about the grounds for this denial. I don't think money is the only criterion for granting residency in a foreign land, other issues such as criminal records, health status and even your country of origin are also considered. With the increase in criminal activities such as mass killings, attacks on schools and other security challenges, most European countries have become stringent in issuing residency. But if you are legitimately in the country and you have the right to have a bank account, you could report to your country's embassy or seek the services of a financial expert or legal practitioner.",

And without money to tip them, our time will only be wasted. That is the reality nowadays,  so either face it or leave it.This is not just in Monaco but even to other country's governments as well. If you don't have back-ups like people owning high positions in that country, your application will be disregard forever.",

If not then you can be sure is the money that got him denied, now if your cousin does in fact has that much money in the bank and he can prove it then without a doubt this is about the lack of connections he may have on that country.There are countries that are very strict when it comes to becoming a resident there, and if you do not fulfill them the government is not going to waste their time explaining to you why you were rejected.",

The country you're from, your purpose for visiting that country, your police report of your native country, your medical report, and also the recent countries you've visited. These may not apply to some citizens though but it applies to most. The US for example does not have a published list of countries that you've visited or from that will make them deny you a visa but there are countries you've visited recently that will make your visa denied. Also, the denial or granting of a visa depends on your answers to the interview questions and the interviewer.",

From our country most of the people travel to abroad due to minimum job opportunities here and as inflation is on top so here salaries are not enough to support a family.For the purpose of studying one can easily migrate to other countries because they are going on scholarship and other thing is that they are treated well due to the reason that they are scholars.

If you do came from on a country on which you are a millionaire with your own local currency but ended up on being that a standard citizen when you do transfer or migrate into other place then this is where currencies would really differ basing up on the value that it do have. I do able to read up those requirements before you would be considered to be a citizen of Monacco on which not all people would really be having  that kind of amount and also i dont see on why there are people who do really love to migrate into other places on which you would really be needing to adjust again on the environment plus on the said culture of that particular country on which for me even just thinking then i do really see the hassle thing on this one.I do agree into those points on why there are applications that had been declined despite of having that complete requirement or able to pass up the checklist?There would really be something an issue when it comes to that on which it would really be leaving out those kind of questions in mind on what the heck is happening.",
