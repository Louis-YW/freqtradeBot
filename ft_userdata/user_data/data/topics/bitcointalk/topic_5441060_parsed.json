      "body": "After doing some research, I think that this Velo project is most likely a promising project. They are already listed on various top tier CEXs such as Bitfinex, Bithumb, Crypto.com, Gate.io, Huobi, Kucoin, MEXC, OKX and Poloniex. At first glance, people will think that this project is a recent project, but it's not. They even hit their ATH about 2 years ago at $2.07. People will think what I'm saying because this project hasn't really had a great run of their products.Image Source: UniverseIn the product they call as Universe a.k.a their DEX, they don't even have enough enthusiasts yet, we can see it from the image above. Investing in Velo is like gambling with a sizable percentage of profit (IMO). If you invested 2 months ago, by now your investment has been 10x, I personally intend to invest a small amount of my money and will continue to monitor the price movement of $VELO. BTW, thanks for the information, mate.",

But if the project looks promising, then just like any other coins, it might be a good hold and see how far it can go till the next bull run.",

The effect of delisting crypto.com will not be too significant, Velo still has alternatives to other large exchanges with much larger trading volumes as well. The prospects for the future to be honest I'm not too sure this token will touch ATH again, I think the goal of this project is not very sustainable. Also considering the 2018 altcoin bull market season it has largely failed to recover despite being listed on the top exchanges of its time.I wouldn't risk big money even if I had reliance.",

It's not advisable to buy when the price is at the top because you know what's next to it is the dumping of those who have bought earlier.The ATH was around $1 and you think that it will be there again? If I were you, I'll have to cut my loss in here if it doesn't look good anymore and will choose another one.",
