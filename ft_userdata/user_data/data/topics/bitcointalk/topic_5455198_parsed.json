  "content": "As many of you, must have heard the news of SEC sues Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. And this has a great effect on the market as around $3.7 Billion dollars has vanished in 15 minutes only from BTC and Alts Source. Currently, BTC is 5+% down and still going down because of this news has created fud among early, new, and less capital investors. People are trying to withdraw their BTC to fiat or any other stablecoin (pegged). Why? this news has made so much impact on the market and why people fall for this FUD. Or is it really a FUD? Before declaring anything or acting on anything, we should shed some light on what is happening to the market.sourceYou should keep this image in your mind and then read the following. SEC and CFTC had sued Binance and CZ so many times, and we have been reading that news and ignoring them as those were at the lower level (i think), plus CZ always comes up on Twitter with something encouraging that could avoid people stopping panicking. And he still posted on Twitter Handle that it's a FUD. But still, people are leaving the market and so much BTC has been liquidated too. sourceMain Reason Behind this downtrendNow SEC has sued Binance and CZ they are helping US citizens to get access to their Binance (US) exchange intentionally using their BM Trading Platform (As it can be seen above the Binance US). Well, That's not something new, As a few days ago CFTC also said that, and it was also discussed before.Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao violated compliance rules to attract U.S. users, CFTC allegesClimax here is, SEC has found out that, the BAM Trading platform is directly linked to the US Binance exchange. How Bam Trading platform is linked to CZ, Go through the pic again and check the connection of US Binance to CZ and how much CZ holds in shares to BAM trading. Well, in the short story, SEC and CFTC sued CZ and Binance before, that, they are not registered with us and they should be banned for US citizens but CZ always come up with some unique plans to provide access to US citizen like, before he was alleged by SEC that, he made some VPN services for high class, VIP investors and traders of Binance so that they could keep using the Binance and Binance could generate millions of dollars in just fee money. And we know that the US does not like that another person works on their soil without paying taxes or complying with us and still making millions of dollars. Well, no wonder there must be other factors too, on which SEC wants to control and they have to follow those rules and regulations to avoid streamlined adoption of crypto, My personal view on it does not matter, because those who have access to Binance and wants to make money (or want to use Binance) will definitely use it without fear of any regulation. Coming back to the story, So, Binance was prohibited to provide access to US citizens and hence it was providing access to them using its unregulated platform (BAM Trading). So, People could keep using the features of (buy, sell, and trade crypto, asset securities) through an unregistered trading platform that directly links back to Binance and to CZ (CEO). They also mention in their case that, BAM Trading provided the sales of unregistered assets (BNB and BUSD) and US citizens could access the feature of Binance (\"BNB Vault\" and \"Simple Earn\") through BAM Trading Platform which is the product of CZ (that what SEC says). In the Document, they also said that BAM has raised around $200 million of dollars which directly benefits CZ and the Binance platform. Well, i could write the whole points that has SEC alleged CZ and Binance for but this is of no good here, because everyone could read it directly. So here is the link to read it. You should read the reply from CZ's US Binance platform to SEC.SourceNow, How BTC is being Effected by this FUDThe answer is simple FUD and FUD, (i am not trying to accuse anyone here just stating the facts) people are exiting from the market as i mentioned above and volume is decreasing which is a bad sign. The dominance of BTC will decrease. I wonder what would have created so much panic among lower-class traders and investors who have exited the market. I think most of them are in Telegram and Discord groups and those groups sometimes share the news without confirming it, like i hear the news that CZ will leave the slot of CEO for Binance and \"Teng Key\" will become the new CEO. (Source). You might be wondering if that, news would have a big impact but it was shared about 8 to 10 hours ago that CZ will replace by Teng Key and some Telegram Influencer use these types of news in such scenarios which encourage investors and traders who are facing big losses, who can not think straight due to loss of big money and some of them fall prey to such news without even checking the source or background. Because we all know if you want to take action then it must be hurry because till then you could lose more and more. Another reason is those countries like mine, whose governments have seized the use of Crypto exchanges and banned crypto all over the country, we are already living under the roof of pressure and such news will put more pressure on that roof. Now, what will happen to the market, how down it will go? is there still room to go down or hitting $25k was the target?",

      "body": "firstly people need to learn alot of things about cryptobitcoins \"store of value\" is not based on its volatile market price nor any \"high\" . its based on an underlying bottom (non zero) value that gets periodically tested during times of dips. the speculative market above the bottomline value is always speculative and volatile. it moves up and down alot. so dont get too excited or exhausted by monitoring all the 5% swings.. its normal to see these. this store of value is not some reserve amoutn stored in a bank of fiat money. its just a bottomline number statistic of non zero where the bitcoin price wont go down below unless bitcoin truly breakswhen a market price moves by 5%. this does not mean that there is some bank account of reserves that \"disappear\" .. there is no $XYZmillion \"disappear\" eventmarket prices are based on the events of small amount of coin offers that trigger price changes of small amount of coins.a \"market cap\" is not a reserve of fiat money either. its just a BAD MATH of multiplying the current price by circulation of a currency.. but this still does not mean that fiat money has gone missing or disappeared. its just a bad math stat. nothing moreas for binance the main target is the \"binance coin\" which is being titled as a unauthorised security. so ofcourse anyone holding \"binance coin\" are going to sell it and get rid of their stash of it when the SEC says that its not a authorized security. they dont want to hold onto a bag of crap if binance are forced to stop trading it. becasue then where can people trade it to get out after its shut off.. in short they cant. so they will sell it before that possibility occurs",

More cryptocurrencies on the top order were also found to be unregistered securities.

However, the market moves unexpectedly especially if huge investors would interfere. A spike on its value could still happen all of a sudden. If ever its price could continue falling until $23.5k  it could open another possibility for a lower market value around $20.5k.
