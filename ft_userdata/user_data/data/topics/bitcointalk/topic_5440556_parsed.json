In other words, it is the money set aside for future use and not spent immediately.\"The word \"use\"(spend) is the key word of concentration because it seems people talk so much of savings as if one isn't supposed to use their saving even until death and I began to wonder what the purpose of saving really is.We ought to save money so money can save us and some also say that we ought to save for raining days and we should know that our raining days might differ and one should be free to use their savings and not feel they're doing something wrong when using their hard earned savings. What's your concept of savings?",

People save for many reasons, like for nvestment, to tackle emergencies etc. You can even save money because you want to buy something that year or later and you do not want to go for installmental payment which will require paying more over certain period of time than buying at once.",

In itself, saving for the sake of the economy means little, there must be a purpose for which the money will be spent in the future, or this deferred money can serve as a means of insurance in case of unforeseen circumstances.",

      "body": "The concept of saving is suppose to be a clear thing for every body only the purpose for that saving is what can be a different because people will have a different need to build the idea to save their hard money. Everyone can know it that the meaning is money that is keep out of use for certain time. It is for different purpose that we save money and I can class the purpose in two major ways. The two ways can be 1. Planned savings purpose 2, Unplanned savings purpose1. Planned savings purpose is like for investment for other businesses. If you want to open into another type of business like to expound it, you planned with your intention to saving to reach that investment money and you establish the business if the savings money is complete for you.2. Unplanned savings purpose is money that you save incase you are going to have emergency in future and this occupy majority of reason family or couple have to save money. In the family you don't plan something to happen like health problem and other unplanned expenses.",

Those are two completely different things, and it's not hard to tell the difference. What I see people getting confused between saving in fiat and saving in bitcoin. I don't really think that being able to save with bitcoin will work, bitcoin is more suitable as an investment than a savings. Let's say we are in urgent need of money and bitcoin drops 50% in value, then that is no longer saving.",

If you are saving for emergency purposes, then the answer is until that time of need occur. If you are saving for a car, then until you can buy one. There's really no problem with such thing unless you are seeking for bigger money from your savings and that would be through investing into something profitable not only by saving wherein the amount will only be stacked as years go by. Investment and saving are two different things. One would work to some but won't to others.",

I personally save it for various things and have a spare scope of future needs of everything that we predict that we need and might want something in the future, in a straight line to increase happiness and reduce stress in the future which requires a sizable fee so I have to save up.",

But there are a lot other reasons why saving is done like hoping to buy some expensive item that I need or planning to buy a property and so on.Expenditure is the regular spending that you would incur over a month or so. This should be kept separate from savings. I dont think there is much ambiguity regarding these terms. How people might be spending or saving is after all their personal choice and there needs to be a limit between the two.The real thing to keep in mind is that spending should not exceed savings unless in cases of emergency, which should be covered in the upcoming months.",

Since one cannot foretell what the future holds, people tend to prepare for these unpredictable occurrences. That is why people keep money aside to take care of these needs if they arise in the the future. To avoid begging or loans, it is very important to save.People also keep money aside because they want to achieve a particular goal in the future. They ensure they set some funds aside based on the cost or timing of their future achievements as well as their income. Some person save to acquire assets, while some save to buy a good car or to go on vacation. It is also important to keep your savings in the right place.

There are so many things that needs savings in here whether it is kids educations, girls marriage (Most expensive ceremony in India), then savings for fulfilling the dreams. However, let me mention strongly, the last one never happens here and we end up with spending money on kids education, good life for them, marriage and some accountability for grand children. That’s all. That kind of savings we have. Since it’s hard to manage life here with the way Salary structure works in my country. We have bank system in which you can enrol for everyday saving program. Let’s say you have enrolled for $5 per day savings then a Official guy would visit your business place everyday to collect that $5 and it will be credited to your locked funds. In similar way there are other Government run schemes which include “Girls marriage saving”. In that above pattern is followed but government would also fund amount equally and so on. Definitely it changes country to country and the way financial system works. But above one is just short crux about it.",
