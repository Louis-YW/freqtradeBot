Hope I am welcomed.Quote from: Richbased on October 06, 2023, 07:30:18 PMGambling can never be the same with forex trading as in gambling your chances of winning is 50/50 as you may win or you may lose but in trading if you apply the right knowledge and techniques, the possibility of making profit can be guaranteed.And again gambling consumes lots of time to predict the outcome of an event main while trading doesn't gives much stress like that if you actually know what you're doingI read your post and I wanted to correct a few things in your statement. First we all agree that Forex and betting are two different things one is trading and the other is gambling. But they both share one thing in common which is risk you will take in both cases, whether it's trading or betting. Nothing and nobody can guarantee you a 100% profit no matter how skilled or experienced you are in both fields one day you will lose or even in your first try. These two things are always unpredictable and if someone said the opposite he is lying or doesn’t know what he is talking about.Gambling can't be predicted at all compared to trading as you mentioned and that's also incorrect. In Forex trading people use strategies and follow instructions to help them a bit in predicting the next price move and only a little. Every trader has a technique but, it's important to note that even the best traders in the world experience months or even years of overall loss, and to have an income from trading logic says that you need big amount of money and not only falling victim to course sellers, brokers, and scammers who target new traders with little knowledge.",

If you are a scalper, trading will consume time. If you are a trading addict, it will consume your time just like gambling. Some traders will make analysis and still continuously checking the market to know if they have gained or not. Trading is not also easy but it depends on the type of trader that you are. Swing traders will not stress themselves.",

Acquiring the knowledge is a necessity and you shall flourish. There are people who at some stage doesn't encounter losses due to them using good risk management and risk to reward ratio. I don't understand why people affiliate Forex with gambling, this thing have history and authors with books that will boost your Forex skill. It's something you will learn before you earn but some will just jump into it with out proper knowledge then generalized it as gambling when they encounter losses. Undergo thorough training either self learning, YouTube or through mentorship. I advise you go through mentorship because it makes the journey easier since they are experienced already.",

Gambling na simply the ability to take sides without thoroughly evaluating the the desired results but through emotions, instincts. In another word, Gambling na hin be the betting and staking of some amount of money over something valuable in the hope of making profit at the game of contest.While, Trading is simply the buying and selling of goods and services for the purpose of making sales and profit. In trading, you're offering a service for a certain amount of money with the expectations of getting results or better still wooing the customer or clients into patronizing you.Like gambling, Trading also have to do with more than one person and risk taking, unlike gambling, Trading is when you have something to exchange as a good or service with the other person, either as a merchant or as a buyer. In gambling, you don't have a merchandise but in trading that's the most basic essence of going into the trade, with the aim of selling out your merchandise.It is at the bases of the aforementioned one will conclude that trading with forex is not gambling but a business of selling merchandise. When you understand how the market flows, you will certainly work towards the success of your trade.",

Forex and betting na different things but e get people wey dey gamble when trading forex like dem dey gamble when betting too and dem dey succeed but e no dey last long for forex because at a time the market go catch you and if you no get stop loss you go lose everything wey you get. Here are some different between forex (trading in general) and betting; For most betting na the house wey get the winning odds like na dem get the higher chances of winning but when trading na the trader get the odds of winning and not the house (infact na the traders be the house) For difficulties: Gambling dey more easier than forex trading. Person wey no get any experience go fit dey bet and dey win but for forex e dey very unlikely and even though you win e no go last as last last the market go get the last laff Forex trading na the betting on currency pairs but you need knowledge of the currency pairs for you to profit but betting (gambling) na playing of games wey no need you to get much knowledge or skills on am and with just your luck on probability games you fit win  Timing: some betting requires you to join the game as e dey start but trading no get timing, you fit enter and exit the market anything and make your profit. Betting get time limitations but trading no get expect say the market no dey open Saturday and Sundays.One thing about forex na say, if you no learn am well you go lose but gambling is mostly about luck, you no need to learn am per se. Weda na forex or gambling wey you dey do or dey interested in, know say both of dem dey very addictive and if no discipline yourself well you go lose your focus which is to make money. In forex you fit master a strategy wey go work for you constantly and can be thought to others and una dey use am dey make profits together but when you dey gamble, there's no proven strategy wey you fit teach people wey una fit dey use make money. Everyday for gambling na try your luck but for forex, same strategy can be used multiple time to make better profits them.",

Then gambling is a way of betting money on an event in other to also make profits on probability. Even if a forex trader sometimes incure losses but he isn't gonna lose all his money but a gambler has a 50/50 chance of making profits and if he lose, he loses all his stakes.So for me their is no comparison between forex and gambling because looking at our society today, how many people has gambling helped? Few people. But check out forex traders like all these alhajis they make lots of money in forex trading and most of them are living a luxurious life so you can dual the difference",
