  "content": "When the price of Bitcoin reached $28,000, the greed index of users surged to 68 points, higher than when the digital currency reached its peak of $69,000.According to Coin Telegraph, the positive sentiment among Bitcoin users is currently at its highest level in 16 months. Data from Alternative, a website specializing in monitoring cryptocurrency market fluctuations, shows that the greed level of Bitcoin users reached 68 points on March 21st.The last time the market saw this index above 66 points was on November 16th, 2021, when the price of Bitcoin hit $69,000.The enthusiasm among Bitcoin users, in particular, and cryptocurrency users in general, has increased significantly after the Silicon Valley Bank's banking system collapse. Some other banks have also closed or encountered difficulties. The cryptocurrency community sees these as signs of a traditional financial crisis, and Bitcoin as a safe haven. Data from Coingecko last week showed that the price of Bitcoin had increased by 27.8%. On March 20th, BTC broke the $28,000 mark, the highest since June 2022.The enthusiasm among Bitcoin users, in particular, and cryptocurrency users in general, has increased significantly after the Silicon Valley Bank's banking system collapse.

On March 17th, Goldman Sachs stated that Bitcoin's total profit in the first three months of the year has far surpassed gold and other assets.",

According to what I am reading online and that is what I am thinking, it is possible for bitcoin to reach $30000 before it retrace back to $26000 or below. It is also possible that the price of bitcoin may continue to increase. But we should invest what we can afford to invest this time that bitcoin price has increased to certain high price. We should not believe everything that we read on news and fomo because of it.",

This is the time to start getting prepare for the next bull run, not in the bull season.",

      "body": "I feel this index is increasing because the people who thought banks are safe haven and cannot collapse now know that's not correct, they have some similarities with centralized exchanges, just that banks are better regulated and the government can print money out of thin air to bail them out. But the system works with a fractional reserve, and your money in your account is only numbers, because they have been used to fund investments and to buy assets.BTC allows people to be bankers of their own money, when they own their money, no institution can gamble or trade with it; and it is safe if they store it in a safe enviroment, losing it can only be due to their own mistake and not that of any third party, when many people understand this, they would keep most of their money in BTC and allow the banks to hold the amount they can afford to lose .",

      "body": "Greed will surely rise since the price is increasing in a sharply manner. The GFI measures the ratio of buy and sell which means it will always result to higher Greed Index once the price is continuously rising on an uptrend momentum. Actually this Greed index is sometimes being use to scared buyer but in reality there’s a huge demand on Bitcoin that makes this uptrend movement that can’t be categorized as Greed. I believe 60+% is still not bad for accumulating considering how strong the market right now that consolidating on the previous resistance to be the new support.",

      "body": "I became interested in how the index is calculated and what it actually means. It seems that it's a scale from 0 to 100 (at least, according to CNN Business), where the first quarter is extreme fear, then goes fear, then neutrality in the middle, then greed and finally extreme greed. So at this scale, greed at 68 doesn't mean that there's greed at 30, for instance. Greed starts at 51 and is up to 75, so 68 is well into the second half, sure, but there's also a whole section of extreme greed ahead. I also find it interesting that the stock market is currently at its fear stage, so if Bitcoin is in the greed area, it's currently very uncorrelated with the stocks.",

I also find it interesting that the stock market is currently at its fear stage, so if Bitcoin is in the greed area, it's currently very uncorrelated with the stocks.It does not increase to extremely greed area and if climbs to that area, Bitcoin can continue its recovery to more than $40,000 or a little bit lower than $50,000 like $48,000. I really don't think Bitcoin can have a recovery in bear market to very close to its all time high.Bitcoin fear and greed index chart.In 2019 bear market, it only recovered to more than $12k or about half of its 2017 all time high. By history, I think $30k is a reasonable top price of 2023 recovery.",

There are wash trading volume that is not counted for organic real trading volume.Trading volume can be impacted by some zero-trading fee campaigns from big exchanges like Binance. People can become more actively trading when they no longer have to mind about trading fee. However, such trading volume won't be a signal of market growth, just for one or some exchanges.Binance Launches Zero-Fee Bitcoin Trading",

In history, Bitcoin did not make new all time high one year before its halving year. History has its rhythm and we can believe in history before a new history appears. Like in this bear market, it is a first time in Bitcoin history when it fell down to under its previous cycle's all time high about $20,000. It even fell to under $16,000 that is far below 2017 all time high.QuoteHowever, it cannot be relied upon as an indicator for measuring the price direction during the coming weeks.I believe in history and I believe in 2019 and 2023 fractal for this recovery.",
