  "content": "As the development and advancement of the cryptocurrency industry continues to unfold, the problem of security remains acute for investors and enthusiasts of cryptocurrencies. The seed phase is one of the essential security measures that should be adequately taken to protect our digital assets. The seed phrase here is one that grants anyone access the wallet and the amount of money that is available in there as we already know. But the 1 bill I dollars question remains where must be the best and safest place for storing this valuable information?In a world filled with hacking threats, physical storage vulnerabilities, and technological failures, I've come to a realization: the best place to store my seed phrase is actually in my head. Yes; and now, I walk through the process of memorizing and knowing all my seed phrases by heart.>THE DANGERS OF PHYSICAL STORAGE One can keep seed phrases either on paper or in electronic form, and some pay argue that putting the paper inside a safe, or in a locked cabinet may feel like enough security. However, these methods are not reliable as reliable as they may appear to be. Safes can be breached and open, cabinets can be forced opened, papers can be misplaced or destroyed. Further, existing physical storage procedures may face severe challenges such as natural disasters, fire outbreaks, or floods.A very good example is the recent fire outbreak in LA that consumed everything in its path, so imagine someone in that neighborhood has a hardware wallet in his house with the pass phrases hidden in somewhere in the house he considered safe and the fire came and engulfed his house, he’ll literally lose every single thing. Even if the the safe is fireproof, and it’s a flood, everything can be easily displaced. >THE DANGERS OF DIGITAL STORAGEAlso unsafe are digital storage forms that include copying seed phrases in a computer or phone. Technology malwares, ranked hacking, and general technological disasters can in varying degrees jeopardize digital storage. Also, decentralization of the seed phrase also implies that your seed phrase is only as safe as the device or digital platform you use.THE POWER OF MEMORIZATION Eliminating the issues associated with physical and electronic storage is possible since memorizing your seed phrase is 100% possible that even the dumbest person can do it. In this way, your phrase is shielded in a way and you adhere it to your memory so well that no external interuption has a way to penetrate it. In general, your seed phrase will be safe unless there is an exceptionally serious case, for instance, when you suffer a head blow or other health problems that results in amnesia.I’m not saying it’s an easy thing to do, It needs focus and commitment to memorize a seed phrase. I’ve been able to come up with some helpful tips to help anyone commit their phrase to memory:1. Break it down: Split your seed phrase into segments to make it easier for you to memorize them if in case you end up forgetting them.2. Create associations: Connect each word or phrase to individual and interpersonal imagery.3. Repeat and rehearse: Now and then, repeat your seed phrase to help refresh your memory.4. Use mnemonic devices: When recalling information use methods such as an abbreviation or creation of a rhyme, just as if you’re learning how to memorize your country’s national anthem. CONCLUSION In the current world, where cybersecurity threats and natural disasters and theft are prevalent, the best form of security is doing things the traditional way: memorizing a seed phrase. When you memorize your phrase, you are also free from all the risks that you have with the physical and digital storage. Though it takes time and commitment, But still, you are secure knowing your seed phrase is safe and can be used at any time needed. Therefore, attempt memorizing your seed phrase today; you should start memorizing it today if you haven’t. You’ll be glad you did it for your digital assets.",

Nobody knows the future and things can change in your brain over time.The only thing I would say if someone really wants to do this is to be disciplinedis to have the seed saved on something physical, encrypted USB or a metal plateand to be able to confirm the words regularly and that way you have best of both.",

      "body": "Perhaps the subject has been deliberately severely on different boards of this forum that memorising seed phrase is not a proper way of ensuring security to your assets. Many reasons are behind this arguement which NeuroticFish has listed and as such it proves that writing your seed phrase down and putting them in different locations (splitting) or using one of the new techs like cryptosteel cassettes, cryptosteel capsules etc while splitting your seed phrase is much safer in the current world. However having a cold storage wallet is best in protecting your assets and writing your seed phrase is a much more better manual than memorising it, perhaps it's true that nowhere is 100% safe but the safest measure should be taken.",

      "body": "Everything that has an advantage also has a disadvantage; you forget to mention the disadvantage of memorising your seed phrase; you forget that something can lead to another, which could make the person forget a few things in that memorised seed phrase; you have also forgotten about accidents that do result in memory loss. Let's just use, for example, how many numbers that relate to either address, phone number, or whatever it may be in the past 10 years can you still remember correctly the same way that it is? There have been few topics in react to this too in the past and the idea is not entirely safe.  My experience with memorizing seed phrases   Is it advisable to memorize seed phrase?  If you ask me, I will say one should use the best measure to secure their seed phrase, like using a piece of paper to write it down and laminate it to be waterproof. Some make use of steel; write it down there and save it in a safe place where both water and fire can't harm it. If you can back it up by memorising the words, then that will be an added backup, but it should not be used as the only means.Check this seed phrase backup options:  Coinplate Steel Seed Phrase Saver  By Agbe Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers  By fillippone",

That is why I said, memorizing these phrases isn’t an easy task, but with time, it gets easier and you’d be happy you dedicated that much time and effort to memorize your phrases. I still have a lot of things I memorized few years back during my University days, and up till today, I still remember and can still recite them vividly like it was just yesterday, although there are some that I may have forgotten but that’s only because I only memorized them to pass a particular test and after the test I didn’t feel I had further need for them. But with phrases as important as your pass phrases, you’ll remember them all the days of your life because you know the importance of those phrases which will make it impossible for you to forget.Stamping your phrases on a piece of metal may appear to be just an awesome way of storing your phrases, but tell me, where exactly are you gonna store that piece of steel or metal plate, in your bedroom? Burying it underground? Or locking it up in a safe? All these could still be breached, except you have a better place you can store it, somewhere that can keep it out of reach of thieves or natural disasters.",

Yes there's no best way to store your seed phrase but the few ones that have been used and trustworthy in the past still serve it's purpose. Since I've been on this forum, I've come across different means to store my keys, but the best which still stands, is to write it down and keep in a safe place. I wouldn't want to see you in the future creating another post requesting for help on how to recover your seed, so it would be best to follow the usual means and avoid causing your self some trouble in the future.

There are lots of things we have to memorise like our different digital accounts passwords, debit card pin and stuff like that.

Memorizing it is good if you have a strong and long term memory to save things in your brain but it is very risky if you don't have it elsewhere cause in the case of accident,one can be affected and if there is a memory loss it becomes a problem for you to have access to your wallet.

Not adding that we can't stay healthy forever and succumbing to Alzheimers and vascular dementia ain't off the table. Just like offline saving has its risk, likewise memorizing but the offline risk can be relatively mitigated. Combining the two isn't bad, but reliance on memory is risky.
