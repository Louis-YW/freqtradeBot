On the other hand, those how go to college and learn a second language are more paid for the same bosses of those manual workers, and there comes the collision of ideas. If the government and the private sector started to pay the same to all of the type of employees or increased the salary of those who do manual labor, then those who are white collar and educated workers would be discouraged to work, even students may feel discouraged to go to college and instead get right into do manual works, because they would get enough money, in their opinion.Even though, I think Ai and the use of robots to replace much of the labor force is an idea which is gaining force with each year that passes, societies on the planet should get and enforce a set of rules so millions of people won't get unemployed at the same time and rates of crime start to rise out of control in developed countries.",

If there are 100 like you there is no need to pay extra, if you're the sigle one with that skill and there is demand for it you're going to get paid way better than anyone.",

This is just one more example of the supply and demand in action, if the job in question is something that anyone with minimum literacy can do then it is not going to be well payed no matter how much you do not like this situation, however if you have a rare skill, your specific profession is in high demand or you are simply very skilled on your particular profession then you are going to make a lot of money, now if even that is not enough for you then people should strive to create their own business or simply become an independent contractor so they can obtain even more profits from their skills.",

I feel the thing has to do with the company itself, because there are companies that pay blue collar job very well, big companies pay their waiters, drivers and cleaners good money too, same way some white collar jobs have also worker's with low pay grade, i believe it's has to do a lot with the company and the amount they are ready to pay her workers. there are jobs that do have low pay grade but generally it has to do with what the company has to offer not minding the skill or department the workers will find themselves.",

I know some of these can be automated but not everything. its not all white collar workers that are being paid well. If I understand your idea of who does a white collar job, its someone who doesn't use his physical strength to do his job but rather sit in a place and carry out his job routine. They can include, bankers, Secretary, receptionist, managers and lots of others birth at the too and button of those kinds of jobs. although their work isn't always that physical, they still burn a whole lot of energy doing it. If we want to narrow our discussion down to the difference in their pay, some field workers earn way more than most white collar workers and it's more if how skilled the person is than if the person is using his energy to do the job.Their ate jobs that demands the exertion of physical energy and regardless of how skilled you are, if you don't literally work physically, you won't get shit done",

I know some of these can be automated but not everything. It’s not about how tiring the work is but rather the importance of the work is the one being paid. Surely hard labor jobs is very hard physically but there’s a lot of people can replace on this job compared to a white collar job such as pilot and other important job that is not easy to be replaced by normal people.But there’s some exception to this when it already involves skills since some hard laborer manage to climb their rank through promotion using their skills. Promotion is the only way to get out on the low salary grade.",

I vouch your thoughts as everyone should be appreciated for the work and shouldn't looked downwards because of their profession. I work for an Ecommerce giant wherein forget about blue collar workers but there is a differentiation between FTE (Full time employee) aka employees' on company's payroll and the contracted third part employees (HRO) as they are deprived of so many facilities and benefits which we enjoy though we do similar tasks.  I know this is a vast topic where people will have different opinion as I have already seen in the replies to my topic but there should be a fair practice.",

First and foremost, you have to understand that physical labor isn’t specifically the only thing that determines whether a job’s to be paid by the bulk or not. If anything, the brainpower is what matters most since they are the ones that make the market turn and work so these people who aren’t able to be as fortunate as those with white collar jobs could still get their employment and help the economy.Don’t get me wrong, I stand for labor rights as well since I understand just how underpaid blue-collar workers are, but I don’t think it should be at the expense of the other spectrum’s misfortune. If anything,both salaries should be raised especially when you consider those at the upper echelons earning more than they have business with.",

You make it sound as if the blue-collar worker’s not gonna get hit badly if such “correction” ever comes., you have to keep in mind that the ones at the top of the market are able to just pull the strings and save their asses as the boat sinks. So yeah, before you wish for comeuppance. Make sure that the ones you fight for don’t get hurt in the process.Ever wondered why so many companies nowadays are pushing for AI workers, example being those automated servers/waiters in fastfood restos, as well as other automated task processors? This is so they can brace themselves for when blue-collar workers finally mutiny and defect from the current system to fight for their rights.

When we have too much supply of a category of labor, its price will automatically decrease. It's the case of non-specialized work force, composed by people who work on areas where further training and specialization isn't a must.Meanwhile, naturally those who invested a lot of time, effort and money to develop their skills will have access to better paying jobs, mainly for two reasons: because the supply of qualified work force on the market is lower and due to qualifying themselves on areas which are hyped by the jobs market right now, especially technology and health sectors.We can't go against this only complaining how unfair the world is. If we want to thrive in life, we have to adjust ourselves to the society's demands. You want a better paying job? So educate yourself, become a good professional and apply for that!",

But low work should not be underestimated, and people who underestimate low work are wrong. Everyone has the right to be respected regardless of their work.Equating salaries between people who have abilities and those who don't is real discrimination. The best way to improve things is to improve our abilities so that we are worthy of being paid more. One of the reasons low level workers have low salaries is because they do not need special skills so many people are ready to replace them if they don't want to work anymore. On the other hand, if a job requires special abilities, they will be paid handsomely because the company will have difficulty finding a replacement if they don't want to work anymore.",

      "body": "The market corrects itself. If we want to do things ourselves that is when the world would be in chaos. Imagine increasing the salaries of waiters to be more than or equal to that of a college graduate, what do you think would happen? People took loans to get a degree and now they've been handed an opportunity that they can make as much as if they never had to take those loans. One of the things would happen: 1. If the salaries of college graduates are not increased, the number of graduates would reduce because there would be no point in wasting years when you can do jobs that pay more without any formal training. We all know the impact of an economy without many educated people.2.  If the market fixes itself and increases the salaries of college graduates, it would take us back to where we are today, the only difference is, that it would be with an inflation higher than this. People would be on high salaries, even unskilled labor so it means more money in the hands of people and that will in turn cause the prices of goods to increase.I agree that unskilled labor should be paid higher than what it is right now, but that particular economic market and minimum wage decides. What I advocate for is for these workers to be treated fairly. Some customers treat people like trash, and that's something I hate to my bone. The more classics, the more it gets worse. Something else I hate is their bosses treating them like trash too and even refusing to pay them what they have earned. Funny enough, some bosses of white-collar jobs still treat their workers like shit.",
