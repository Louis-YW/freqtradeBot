  "content": "It was not easy for me in this gathering to give a talk on Bitcoin to members of a group I belong to in my church. I thought of how I can get elderly people to have the knowledge of bitcoin,an idea came into me  that I should first start a class with the elders ones in my church.  I attend roman catholic church, i belong to one of the well known society in the church (church warden) our work is to keep the church in order during celebration of the holy Eucharist. we do have our monthly meetings,it was held today Sunday 2nd October.  During our meeting last month,I raised an issue about giving a talk on bitcoin after the major issues in our next meeting have been trashed out. I tried to convinced Sir Anthony Udon who is our chairman,that our meetings should be an atmosphere of learning something new happening in the world today,this will enhance the church warden to have new members and also make old members regular in monthly meetings. I also stated that the meetings shouldn't be based on only the issues of the church but it should also be about the welfare of the members by teaching and assisting the members on other aspect of life which they are unaware of,since the church is part of the society. He said NO,there will be no time for this because the church members of the neighboring communities belonging to the group will in attendance, since it will b a general meeting and we are the host church.   Sir Udoh's son is my friend, I do tell him about bitcoin and answers any question he asks me on bitcoin,I have even told him about this forum but he said he is too busy with work,when he is ready for bitcoin he will be involved. We do see very often,so I pleaded with him to talk to his dad over my request of giving the privilege to give a talk in our next meeting which he accepted.  Last weekend in the church,Sir Udoh told me to be ready to give the talk as he has considered my request,since members from other communities will be present,it will be nice for such to be included in the agenda of the meeting, to show a difference from other meetings they have been attending,he said all these. He gave me just one hour to talk on bitcoin. The time was too small after much thought, I decided to print a guide on Bitcoin basic concept which I shared to everybody present in the meeting today,so that they can easily go through it as I am explaining to them and keep it to themselves in order to read over again and again should in case the person have an interest later.It was quite easy for them to understand because 60℅ of them came with android phones connected to the internet. During the talk I showed them on phone,which they praticalise themselves especially the wallet aspect. I told them about btt forum. After the meeting,two youths met me that they appreciated the knowledge and will love to learn more,I then introduced them to the forum and how to register to become a member of this lovely community. A business man asked if he can buy his goods abroad with bitcoin and I said yes but he needs to confirm first from his customer accepts bitcoin.The elderly ones where confused first,but when I taught them one on one after the meeting, few picked interest and said technology is wonderful with smiles on their faces. We were 36 in attendance. This is how far I have gone in spreading bitcoin awareness in my locality,I  still remain humble in spreading bitcoin awareness voluntarily.",

These same church people are the people you see on the street,Bitcoin can be taught anywhere as long as it is about giving the awareness, have you read my previous thread on teaching bitcoin in schools,I will give the knowlege to the general public. we make donations in church and give money for charity in the church,so teaching bitcoin is like a charity work because if the knowledge is acquired they will be save from the fiat currency and will benefit them",

Your idea deserves appreciation and you should get hundreds of merit for the effort, time and money you put into making this class a success, but sadly so far none of them are interested. While some time ago someone managed to get noticed despite only teaching kids under 18 about this decentralized currency who in the end [most likely] difficult become a potential user in the next 5 - 10 years as a potential investor or forum contributor.I tend to like this idea outside the context of individual businesses or profit-seeking groups, so if you sincerely want to teach them about bitcoin, then I think you deserve great appreciation. My main point here is not about merit, but your efforts are worth it as you will probably bring more potential people to the forums and markets when they realize that bitcoin is a profitable asset. The main problem is, not everyone is interested in the same idea even though the main cover is different from one another. OP, I wish you all the best.",

I just didn't see clearly how to combine faith with Bitcoin. It is Nigeria, isn't it? From what I see you write on the local board. What is clear to me is that you are a very large community on the forum and that Bitcoin is very widespread in the country, besides several of you have initiatives like this to popularize it.Keep up the good work!",

In fact, although it seems like a strange, almost alien-like concept to teach about a financial instrument in a place of worship, it might be a good place to find Bitcoin believers who have good reputations within their own community. But then again, if your target is gullible people, then ironically, church might be just the right answer. (Just my perspective)That being said, I do not want to sound negative. Especially since this is going to enrichen their lives instead of making them poorer. So all in all a good thing. I am sure that they will spread the word among more and more people! Good job!

Spreading knowledge is a good thing. provided we continue to comply with applicable regulations and do not violate them. and sooner or later knowledge of bitcoin will be important for everyone when one day bitcoin can be more accepted by more countries.",

The disparity between religion and science started and ends with the evolution theory, other conceptions and theories that do not threaten the Christian faith are welcome in the church. I appreciate your efforts to teach your church members bitcoin, I’m only worried that you may be dragged in church when members buy the pump and bitcoin dips or they get ambitious and buy alts and they suffer a loss. For now, you should only teach them the basics of bitcoin and not trading. I think the risk management practices is too early for a first class, teaching about stop-loss and leveraging is not necessary unless you’re teaching them how to trade futures.",

I understand that an hour of talking about bitcoins is a drop in the ocean, but your passion and desire to help people deserve respect. I am generally interested in the culture of your people. It is completely different from the culture in which I live. Very few people worry about how their neighbors live. I see that you are doing this selflessly, and I really hope that you will help a few more people get interested in Bitcoin. And of course, we all really hope that you will warn all those interested in investing that it is not worth risking funds at such an uncertain time without having enough cushion in life. My respect.",

Also, the size of the images is completely inappropriate for the forum, and there is a way to adjust them very simply.Regarding teaching Bitcoin in the Catholic Church, I personally think that churches are not appropriate places for it, although I can understand that the situation in an African country is significantly different from the situation in a European country. Therefore, I can understand that the space of the church is used in this way, because for OP and his community, in most cases, the church is perhaps the only suitable place for meetings.Here in Europe, we have fewer and fewer members of the Catholic Church, and the information I recently read is that for the first time in history, the number of declared believers in Germany fell below 50%, and churches all over Europe are being sold and become museums, art galleries or skateboard playgrounds.Source",

I'm not saying \"say NO\" to charity, but unless you earned the Bitcoin you're going to donate in Bitcoins, don't donate them. Personally, the only reasons you should use your Bitcoins is if you require censorship-resistance, like if gambling is illegal in your region, and there are no other ways to deposit in a casino, then you can use Bitcoin.BUT good on OP for educating more people about Bitcoin.

Seeing from the pictures you've shared here, it shows that this are clearly old timers and grown ups, the smile on that pretty ladies face tells me she's shown so much interest, you must be an interesting teacher  They're much more difficult to accept Bitcoin and also learn you have to show proof and proof before they would get to see reasons with you. Accepting Bitcoin in Businesses are also rare they find them to difficult to sink in and mostly scam ( Just like the previous M-M-M ).Although, this doesn't seem unique no more as the likes of Agbe, Crypto headlinews etc has done some stuffs similar to this, some might agree with you and some ? This would be seen as a merit hunting skim. But what's more mandatory is that you're promoting the adoption of Bitcoin in Nigeria. Once again Bravo! They adults tend to forget lots of things, they can write down them seed phase in a piece of paper, and if possible getting a laminated paper over it against water and damp areas. They all should be Privacy minded at all times for the sake of those coins, if gone, it's not coming back.Thanks for tirelessly touching live's from what you've learnt here.      🦍🖤",
