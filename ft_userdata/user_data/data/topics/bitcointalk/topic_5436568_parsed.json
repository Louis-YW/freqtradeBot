  "content": "in a month time, Nigeria election go commence for the whole country and the election is being done electronically and process by INEC. Only for Osun governorship election, not to talk of presidential election. INEC IReV was attacked from Asia. Although na failed attempt. The hackers didn't successfully break into INEC result viewing(ReV)INEC don fully show us sae they are fully prepared for the election to counter attacks from all angles but make dem no tell us story tomorrow of how the presidential result sheets was manipulated from attackers cos I know sae there will be a lot of attackers coming to their endQuoteThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that its result viewing (IReV) portal was attacked by hackers from Asia during Ekiti and Osun governorship election. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu disclosed this in his keynote address at a stakeholders’ conference on election result management in Abuja on Friday September 9. Yakubu who stated that INEC recorded several failed attempts to hack the cyber security system of the result viewing portal, also revealed they are working to address other challenges which are administrative in nature.He said; “Another technical concern for us is the repeated attempts to break through our cyber security system for the portal.“Our engineers reported several cyberattacks on the portal during the Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, some of them from as far as Asia. I am glad to note that all of them failed.“However, while we are confident in the security solutions that we have deployed for IReV and all our web presence, we must remain vigilant and continue to strengthen our defences. We have tasked our engineers to do everything possible to fully protect the IReV and all our web resources.“For example, we found that some of the low-quality uploads that occurred in the field, which some of the observers have also noted, were due to the unavailability or substitution of presiding officers that were trained prior to the elections.“We shall administratively deal with this challenge and ensure that only adequately trained Presiding Officers are deployed for elections.“Also, more hands-on training may be required to ensure that all those involved throughout the value chain of the IReV are fully ready for what is bound to be a major outing during the 2023 general election.” Yakubu also announced that INEC would be introducing new legal provisions, administrative procedures and technological innovations to improve election conduct in 2023.What's your take on this? Do you think INEC go fit withstand the cyberattack wey go happen for the election on their own or the kukuma need assistance? cos una know how the matter for Nigeria d be when it comes to election(them go like manipulate everything for the favor of whom they want to rule).link for the information:https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0FsQqouAwN8CyBU1hVj3N4pHgMjtZHPdBXzQdDPeTx1JeHQsDq1S94cebJrMVExBCl&id=100050487580007",
