However, if you want to try it like in Electrum, that's okay, the important thing is that it supports the function you mean.",

For some time now we have been noticing this issue regularly that Bitcoin transaction fees are high although sometimes these transaction fees come back to normal levels but still most of the times we see transaction fees high. Looking at the past and present, we have to imagine what Bitcoin transaction fees might look like in the future. In the past we have also noticed that the transaction fees of Bitcoin are sometimes very high but after a few days the transaction fees are back to normal and we are also seeing the same now. After a sudden spike in transaction fees, transaction fees are back to normal. As the transaction fees are changing now, maybe the transaction fees will change in the future as well.",

It takes a long time for this bitcoin transaction free to return to normal and we have to wait for that time, because it is not possible for us to trade with such a high free. Moreover, we have seen in the past when the Bitcoin market was at its peak and many transactions were free of charge. But it didn't stay for long but it came back to normal again. However, if most of the stuck transactions are completed, transaction free may return to normal. Trading pressure has eased a bit today as compared to yesterday and trading is free and reduced, hopefully it will return to normal very soon.",

I often do this when I don't check the mempool first. The current situation is unpleasant for small transactions because the fees involved are quite unreasonable, making people reluctant to transact with Bitcoin.",
