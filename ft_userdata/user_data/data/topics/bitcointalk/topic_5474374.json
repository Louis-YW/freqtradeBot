BRC20 are experimental standard for fungible token protocol that allows the mining and transfer of the fungible tokens on bitcoin network through Ordinal inscription. You can read more about them from this link: https://hextrust.com/resources-collection/bitcoin-ordinals-the-brc-20-standard. Ordinals and BRC20 tokens are using bitcoin network for transactions and congesting the mempool often than it supposed to be.",

Some days ago, it was reported that ordinals interest from investors have been half since June but I am not sure whether it was that news that trigger them to come back to bitcoin again. To me, it's best they allow these guys do their spamming on other smart contracts blockchain knowing fully how bitcoin network is becoming too unusable during halving, this will only double our challenge in transaction but I forgot that Miners are happy about it.What are will advise you to do, if you have multiples of outputs in different wallet and you have plans to use them or send them in near future,  consolidate them together into one wallet. It might request for high fees but do that on weekends, you will enjoy that when you send bitcoin from a single wallet address than combine these outputs all together, you will be paying more fees than the outputs if halving should remain 2 months.",

Shey you dey catch my point. The high transaction fees we are experiencing is because of what I chose to refer to as a stampede in the bitcoin network  plenty transaction trying to find their way at once from different locations through a single loophole.The solution to this which wouldn't be possible is if bitcoiners can relax reducing the number of persons that sends bitcoin per day. Example, if it were a 1million persons doing bitcoin transaction a day and 500 hundred decides to hold back, it will be that the congestion will no longer be there and this will affect tx fee to drop.But how possible for this to happen is what anyone don't know.",

But I believe this issue will soon flow past as this case is just temporary and very the network fee would be back to normal and transaction fee will be okay again.",
