This one is intangibl, the Christmas is not like every other day and as such, making it iconic by not doing what everyone would do on every other Christmas is definitely unique.

Buying bitcoin now is good because it will keep growing for you especially if you can be patient for the longtime. It is not everyone that will decide to do this to invest in bitcoin although shirt is not that of same value except you bought few fraction of bitcoin. Buying shit is also good because it makes you look good.",

It's always wiser to spend money on things that will pay off later than to fritter it away on pricey items meant to impress others. You now know that your money is fixed in something that will later be advantageous to you because you invested it in bitcoin. I always tell my friends that they can purchase Bitcoin for a small sum of money that would otherwise be wasted unnecessary things,but they always tell him that those people that make it through Bitcoin  invested huge amounts of money, but always still tell them that small small that due form big but still not believe that.know that no amount of money is small in term of investment especially in crypto investment.

Here's hoping it brings plenty of holiday cheer (and profits) your way. The holiday season is the perfect time to give yourself a gift. I know, I know, you're probably thinking that you already have enough presents under your tree. But hear me out… This year, why not give yourself something that will make every day feel like Christmas!",

Christmas celebrations at the end of the year for you will be a very good moment, whatever is spent now can also be used to celebrate the new year, which will arrive soon.QuoteMy colleagues bought some fine shoes and other expensive items/ wears for themselves and every one of them was expecting me to do some picking myself because we all agreed to go on group shopping but on our way to the market I already have a rethink and a change of mind.I don't think there's anything wrong with your colleagues either, because they buy expensive shoes and clothes to celebrate Christmas and maybe to celebrate the new year too. And don't they know about Bitcoin ? If they don't know about buying Bitcoin by the end of the year, it's only natural that they only want to buy shoes and clothes and so have no interest in buying Bitcoin like you do.QuoteI decided to spend my money buying myself some Christmas gifts which is Bitcoin instead of buying some expensive clothes or shoes I decide to carry the digital Gold BTC  in my wallet, instead of wearing shit that will soon get worn out.Actually there is a better idea if the number of bonuses you receive is more. You can set aside at least the amount of bonus money you receive to buy clothes and shoes also for Christmas and for the new year. And the rest you can buy Bitcoin with the remaining amount, so you can get new shoes, new clothes and Bitcoin at the end of this year which will make your Christmas and New Year more enjoyable because you can buy three different things at the end of the year. Even though buying Bitcoins while still wearing old worn clothes won't be any worse for yourself either.",

In this particular case, it might be wise not to invest in expensive clothes, but why not buy yourself something high-quality and functional that will last for many years, and then invest the rest of the money in Bitcoin?In addition, the term \"digital gold\" is so wrong if you just start from the fact that Bitcoin has a maximum supply, and gold is something that has practically unlimited quantities.",
