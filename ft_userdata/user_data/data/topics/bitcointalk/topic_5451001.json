  "content": "Hello again everyone!   So another rollover, $200 in BTC up for grabs, and you will all be happy to hear that this time we are going to make things a little easier to win. We are going to go with 3 games this week, surely we will get one or more winners!A quick recap on how to play:- I will post 3 games below. All you have to do is decide the result of each game and post it here. So for each Game you need to choose either a Home Win (1), a Draw (X), or an Away Win (2). If you make it to the end of Game 3, you win. You will win either the full prizepool, or shared with however many winners there are. If nobody wins, the prize pool rolls over to the next week.For speed, an example selection for the 3 games could be: 1XXgood luck !  IMPORTANT- Entries close 1 hour before Game 1 starts.(All fixture times for GMT +1)Game 1 - Thursday 4th May @ 20:00, Brighton v Manchester United (Premier League)Game 2 - Saturday 6th May @ 15:00, Tottenham v Crystal Palace (Premier League)Game 3 - Sunday 7th May @ 16:30, Newcastle v Arsenal (Premier League)Game rules & eligibility- Must have 20 minimum Bitcointalk forum posts for your entry to be eligible- Pick either Home (1), Draw (X), or Away (2) for each game- Must be remaining after Game 3 to win.- If multiple winners, prize split between all winners- If no winners, prize pool rolls over to the next week- In the event that a game is cancelled/void, all players still in the tournament will progress to the next Game.-- All management decisions are final, collusion / cheating will not be tolerated",
