Weekends are generally good but it is highly unpredictable due to the volatile nature of Bitcoin. Transaction fees are comparatively very high since the beginning of this week. Memepool is still showing a 10sat/vb fee is still being processed but it will consume a lot of time to reach its destination.",

It could be a huge overpay or a tiny underpay, and no one can tell you otherwise based on this information alone. You should be measuring fees in satoshis per virtual byte, or sats/vbyte.The cheapest time to send a transaction is generally between around 0200-0600 UTC on the weekend. There is no need to wait for this to broadcast a transaction though, you can easily send it with a lower fee now and then just wait for it to be confirmed. If you make sure to enable RBF, then you can always bump the fee at a later date if you get tired with waiting.If you are in a hurry, then right now a fee of 30-40 sats/vbyte is likely to be confirmed soon. If you are not in a hurry, then I would personally set it around 15 sats/vbyte and wait.",

Though I will like to tell you to get ready, and embrace yourselves for what's coming, we are in a bear market right now and low transaction fee is one of the benefits of a bear market, but things will get even uglier when the bulls take over.",

Because it is reported that currently market activity has increased and the BRC-20 token & NFT market cap has increased by more than 600%*. If BRC-20 activity keeps increasing, I think it will be more difficult to determine when is the best time to send BTC. From Mempool's records (at time of writing this post), there are currently more than 200,000 pending transactions, so those who wants to buy BRC-20 tokens & NFTs will continue to increase fees to make their transactions are faster to confirm.* Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/05/32161181/bitcoins-brc-20-token-explosion-market-cap-skyrockets-682-in-just-one-week",

This is likely no coincidence, as during this time window both Europe and the U.S. are fully awake and at work.By contrast, the least busy period is between 9 PM UTC and 11 PM UTC. This also makes sense — The U.S. workday is coming to a close, Europe is getting ready to sleep, while in Asia it is still very early in the morning. In addition to lower average values, the evening UTC period also sees fewer outliers.",

You have been told multiple times in this thread and your other one I linked to before that you should use something like https://mempool.space/ to select an appropriate fee. Picking the same fee you used before is in no way an appropriate way to select a fee.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 06, 2023, 09:04:48 AMHow does this work now as 40 is a lot lower then the 3 options I was being offered without using the advanced option am I expected to have to wait a while now?Correct. You will be waiting an unknown amount of time given the current mempool. Could be a few hours, could be two weeks and your transaction doesn't confirm at all.Did you enable RBF as previously suggested? I suspect not.",

Don't worry JamesDaniel90, this is something that we all had to learn at some point, and this is what this Beginners & Help section is intended for.Another thing you will notice is that, apart from a little decongestion during weekends that not always happen, fees fluctuate quite randomly and differences are huge: some days you can send your coins in seconds for just a few cents, while others it will take several hours or days even if you pay a few dollars, like in the last days.Next time you plan to make a deposit somewhere and you are not in a hurry, take a look at the mempool and decide whether the price convinces you or you prefer to wait. Additionally, you can always send your transaction with low fees at any moment and activate the RBF feature (Replace By Fee) in your wallet that allows you to increase the fee in the future if you eventually decide to complete the transaction faster. I hope this helps.",

Take into account that this estimation fluctuates and, if in the next hours the network gets more congested, the transaction may take longer, and vice versa.Fees are very high right now: the wallet I usually use suggests me a fee as high as $20 for fast transactions, but I have done this a few weeks ago for a few cents.

You can send your transactions with a moderate fee and use RBF to increase the fee if you will need to change your plans and get it confirmed ASAP.High fees are annoying, but you need to look at a bigger picture. If Bitcoin suddenly went up and you want to dump it, it's better to pay a high fee (like $5-10) and get high profit than to wait for lower fee and risk the price crashing and your lost opportunity being higher than the saved fee.",
