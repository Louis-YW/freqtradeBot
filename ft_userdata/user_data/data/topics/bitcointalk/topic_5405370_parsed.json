  "content": "I have been curious about whether or not there are female members in this forum for a long time. And also if any. either a lot or a little. Maybe it's not just me but maybe there are other members who feel the same. The uniqueness of this forum is that there is no data on the number of male and female members. (that's my assumption who is still looking for the data and haven't found it until now. Maybe if there is, please tell me the link or the board that collects the data) so I can edit and add it for information in this post.It would be very surprising if there were a large number of women. because I'm sure most of the members in this forum think that most of the members in this forum are man. Because I think so too. In fact I thought there might not be a woman on the list of all members of this forum. But another thought i denied it and said that it is possible that there is a female member.Maybe this voting there are those who think it's not important and not needed. it's up to everyone has their own judgment in his mind.I just want to dispel my curiosity about whether there are women in this forum. and even now I'm starting to think it could be that there were more women. and that would be very surprising.I thank you those who have participated in this voting.Note to Moderators : please delete this thread if it is just a trash thread and useless and cause inconvenience",

Feel the same heat, what do you mean LOLDon't you have enough with Pornhub? It's not that porn sites are not accessible these days. ðŸ˜‰Anyway, bitcoin does not have a gender. It's same for everyone. So we do not care to share our gender.Quote from: Jatiluhung on July 06, 2022, 10:10:59 AMare you curious too?Not at all. These characters around me are bitcoiners. This is enough for me.",

Especially with Bitcointalk forum where people have more interests to protect their anonymity, including their genders.QuoteMaybe this voting there are those who think it's not important and not needed.Maybe it does not needed.Maybe it is low quality because online voting is very biased with serious information bias. You don't know a voter is male or female and a vote as male or female is honest and accurate.",

      "body": "This topic has been discussed earlier also and the answer is the same that we can't accurately tell that based on gender proportion because you can't verify the information and we don't have tools to exactly find out this information.If you have used search function you would have come across many threads like this one : Re: Stats question - Females in Bitcointalk? which will tell you the some of the ways you can find out this information.You can check More stats of the forum  although not sure they are updated or not or the post by DdmrDdmr in the thread mentioned above.But suggestion is to use search function before creating the thread and simple way to do is :Code:gender ratio bitcointalkQuote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on July 06, 2022, 10:19:40 AMNot at all. These characters around me are bitcoiners. This is enough for me.Exactly and that's enough to bind us all as strongest bitcoin community so don't need to investigate about gender ratios and these don't matter at all.",
