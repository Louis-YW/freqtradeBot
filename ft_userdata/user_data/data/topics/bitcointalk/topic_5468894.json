  "content": "Based on the recent threads about hacked or purchased accounts, I would like to ask the community how they feel about the fact that after ten years of absence from the forum, an account wakes up and completely forgets about its past. To be clear, I came across this account by chance. TheSpiralhttps://bpip.org/Profile?id=103790After looking at his history, which is fairly typical for all signatories, I discovered a long time span. The account woke up and immediately decided to participate in subscription companies. He also entered the pizza competition, probably realizing that some merit might come in there.Obviously, the participation was without understanding what pizza is https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5247383.msg62333379#msg62333379But something else is interesting. In 2013, he was a very enthusiastic and competent miner who discussed different coins in every possible way, simultaneously mining them and actively discussing everything with other miners. https://ninjastic.space/search?author=TheSpiral&board=159https://ninjastic.space/search?author=TheSpiral&board=39Regarding Bitcoin, he did not catch any big illusions, preferring other alternative coins. Quote from: TheSpiral on July 30, 2013, 11:42:48 AMThat's a silly question. The only answer is an opinion. All coins take something from previous coins, whether as a benefit or just simplicity (i.e. being able to mine them on programs that already exist).You pick one you like, then mine it. If you're going by a feature list, Bitcoin itself would be crap. It's established and valuable though, including many ways to actually use it unlike other coins. It's mostly perception and awareness and guessing which will gain either of those.What do I mine? A few of the \"new\" coins off and on for the sole purpose of profit. Aside from that, if you don't know what to mine, go with a pool that offers multiple choices, like multipool or middlecoin (this one doesn't net you alt coins, but gets the profit from them by auto-converting to BTC).But ten years later, his posts became ordinary, typical, as they say, all to fulfill the signature quota. I read everything—completely all the posts—but I didn’t read a word that this person had previously been involved in mining and had good experience. Do you believe that after ten years, your memory erases everything you were previously passionate about? And the second question is: is it fair to ignore an account that easily receives a rank and can participate in the signature? Is this fair to those who come to the forum with a single account and independently achieve high ranks? According to some participants, it turns out that if you have money, you can always buy everything, which means you will be higher than others. I'll correct it. If the account is not in DT, it does not pose much harm.The account has a Bitcoin wallet number, by signing he could dispel all doubts about the authenticity of ownership of this account.https://ninjastic.space/addresses?address=1PSt9bDdGJBkrR7CAGTRA9azp96uLU8hgeQuote from: TheSpiral on May 01, 2013, 08:51:35 AM845256-8ad46782f07921eae5b9a4b8b18fdf1e1PSt9bDdGJBkrR7CAGTRA9azp96uLU8hgeI sent a PM",

Its not just that, as his English level also changed in that period. It would be logical to assume that someone's English would improve after so many years, but in his case it drastically deteriorated. Just take for example these two posts, one writen few months ago and the other 10 years earlier. I don't know what could explain this change other than brain damage of some sorts (which I doubt is the case here).So yeah, account obviously changed hands and now the only question is how exactly that happened.Quote from: TheSpiral on May 26, 2023, 01:48:00 PMas far as a think Zksync token will be high demand able due to it's high usecase. now number if transaction is very much high and dex volume increasing daily. If they launch token in this year with some interesting Usecase and high apy reward than i believe that we will see this token under top 50.Starknet token are also probably will be launch this year because tokenomics already released and the best thing is that this token will also be used for gas fee which will definitely increase #strk demand. Layerzero is also going to launch it's token and we have seen so much token staked and bridge function. these tokens can  easily secure spot under 50 while their dex token will secure under top 200 spot. Quote from: TheSpiral on June 11, 2013, 03:25:20 AMWhile I would like to see more final destinations like BTC seems to be, it is a bit of a headache for exchanges to put every coin against every coin, and potentially an interface confusion for consumers/users. I think the best thing to do would be to add a couple more coins to value comparatively... the problem with that is deciding which, as 99% of them are extremely unstable and fluctuate in their own value by the hour. There's a couple that are becoming more stabilized, but need a bit more time to see if they settle in. http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency shows stability, but that's up for interpretation and bias. It's possible coins like WorldCoin and DigitalCoin might get to that point, just probably not yet.TL;DR I agree more coins should be traded against others, but that's hard to do and/or confusing... for now. When some of these new coins stabilize, they should be able to convert to whatever (including fiat) without going through BitCoin first.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 02, 2023, 01:46:42 PMHe also entered the pizza competition, probably realizing that some merit might come in there.Obviously, the participation was without understanding what pizza is Grinhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5247383.msg62333379#msg62333379Those who merited that abomination also don't know what pizza is.",

      "body": "I have also read the comparison between what lovesmayfamillis is saying theres every possibility that the account got hacked or being bought from someone's, according to Rikafip there's no way someone should get down graded instead increasing in their knowledge this shows are clear judgement and a number one good point to hold at. Between from my personal understanding any account that spent 2 years or 3 years without coming online is assumed that the owner has gotten something much better than here or something much time consuming and a better work for someone to abandoned their account. While if an account spent 5 years to 10 years without coming online it's also assumed that such person's lost their devices and as well as his account and the email associated with the account maybe doesn't have access the account anymore. Other things that judges an account like this is either the person is late maybe involved in one of the naturally occurring or disaster like flood or involved in earthquake where they lose their entire life and their device, and if they suddenly woke up and began operation we then know that such account is being hack and sold out to desperate newbie who are too lazy to be creative to build their account to the required rank they wanted than going to buy an account they knew nothing about which has suddenly landed them into trouble since they can't post like the previous owner, it's very easy to trace. The painful thing is that they often rush to quickly apply for a campaign without knowing the implications behind it. So your investigations are all correct based on my own view.",

If the redtrust function is used to tagging accounts that may not be trustworthy/proven to be fraudulent, then joining the campaign is not something that harms other people, unless it violates the campaign rules. So maybe neutral is more appropriate? Ah.... trust systems are very difficult to understand, even though I have repeatedly read about trust systems. But because this system is subjective, it cannot be generalized and maybe old members like you, nutildah, lovemyfamily etc, know how to use this properly, although sometimes I also disagree",

This looks familiar to me. It seems the current account owner is either from my country or is from my nearest country like Pakistan or India. The bed sheet and the plate look too familiar. LOL. Is this a thing to be proud of? Now I can imagine how badly he thinks about my comment. He would have started beating me because he knows I got him. LOL. I guess some of my country mates never saw a pizza in real life and there is no point in eating it. Well, they could have watched some youtube videos before they started baking one. Judging by those people who sent him merit for such a creation, in addition to the three people who awarded the majority of posts, there was one who singled out as many as three merits. This is a user from the Pakistani local section who also has a very old registration and a break in posting. It is noteworthy that he awarded another account from his country two merits. I didn't go all the way, but in all likelihood, he didn't award anyone else in this competition. And TheSpiral's pizza was truly art in his understanding. I think everyone understood my irony and what country TheSpiral belongs to.",

Bruh this is a HawaiiCoin address, blockchain has been dead for over 3 years  I searched around for old addresses of mine but never posted any BTC addresses until 2018. I do have control of addresses I've been using since 2014, just never mentioned them on the forum. I still have control of the address I used to make the tokens mentioned in this thread, and I signed a message from it in the thread earlier this year.Its on you to prove you owned the account in 2015 as you claimed. Its not on us.Quote from: TheSpiral on October 04, 2023, 07:56:07 AMI don't need your believe...i am just telling what's happen. And I'm just saying you're wrong. The account was already ranked up to Full Member by the time you claim to have purchased it... Just stop lying.",

      "body": "Not specific to this case but it is also possible that one puppeteer controls a number of accounts. If they deem it their right to sign up to campaigns on the basis they paid to buy accounts or took time to build rank, you cannot change their mindset. By far the majority of these accounts that get caught are not just a one-off they part of an account farm. Leaving aside for a moment whether TheSpiral is being truthful or not, he stated he purchased his account in 2015 therefore before the merit system. I asked for discussion to agree consensus as to when tagging sold/purchased accounts would be deemed acceptable without raising controversy but there was no clear position agreed Tagging Accounts Sellers And Tagging Traded/Sold/Bought Accounts The days of buying old accounts to try to pass off new tokens and coins as legitimate, are in the past. It is specifically about signature campaigns and with that the possibility of DT infiltration of nefarious actors. Also, if the puppeteer controls one account and profits from it, why not expand the process to as many accounts as they can control. Quote from: Poker Player on October 03, 2023, 03:31:06 PMQuote from: nutildah on October 03, 2023, 02:33:19 PMFor a long time, people would buy established accounts for the sake of promoting a new coin or token - which were often scams - to make it looks like reputable members of the forum were endorsing them. This is originally why some DT considered the act of purchasing an account to be redtag-worthy.Nowadays people buy these accounts mainly for the purpose of enrolling in a signature campaign. They take the earnings they have made from sig campaigns and re-invest them in the purchase of a second, third, fourth or fifth account. So I highly doubt this member is at all \"new.\" They probably have multiple accounts currently enrolled in campaigns.Do you think if they are \"only\" going to participate in signature campaigns they are not worth the red tag? Or maybe just a neutral tag? If they want to do it honestly they can build up an alt account, but that takes time without getting money for writing. I would say that if they are able to get enough merits, and nowadays it is not that difficult with the number of review threads and that are offered, also forum members like The Skeptical Chemist, in about 8 months they can start getting paid with Mr Member rank. There doesn't seem to be a lack of campaigns lately either. I think it is very benevolent to assume that they are \"only\" going to participate in signature campaigns when they are bypassing the merit system.",

Not because of the supposed year of purchase, but because you evidently bought a ranked-up account, a full member account. At that time there were ranks but no merits, and you bought a full member account that had ranked up based on activity and time since registration basically. That's assuming you bought it when you say so, which I find quite unlikely. Maybe with your manager you will be lucky and you can continue in the campaign with the tags. And I'm not saying this because it's him specifically, because nowadays one or two red tags doesn't automatically mean that you get kicked out of the campaign. However, as you accumulate more, the probability that you will be able to stay in the campaign decreases.",
