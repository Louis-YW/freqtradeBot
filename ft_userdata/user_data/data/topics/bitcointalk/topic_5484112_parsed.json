  "content": "I have always been interested in how difficult it was to mine BTC in 2009, but there seems to be no clear answer. Various sources using various means of calculation come up with substantially different amounts. I've seen 100 BTC as a number, 150, 250, all supposedly from people who used regular home computers. The person who sold 10,000 BTC for $25 of pizza claimed in late 2010, twenty-two months after the Genesis Block, he was \"no longer able to mine over 1,000 per day.\" One person online said 1,700 per day was possible with a Pentium II in 2009. There is a very big difference between 100 and 1,700 BTC per day.Does anyone really know how many BTC someone could mine per day back in 2009 with a nice, personal home computer? Was that same number per day still being mined in mid-2010 or had it become more difficult by that time?Thanks!",

In 2009, the difficulty was 1. The number of blocks a computer could mine at the time varied depending on many factors, but a CPU miner had a hash rate of up to around 3 MH/s. With a difficulty of 1, that corresponded to a maximum of about 60 blocks per day, or 3000 BTC/day.In 2010, the difficulty rose quickly as more people began mining, and so the number dropped. By the end of 2010, the difficulty was around 15000, so that same 3 MH/s CPU miner only mined 0.2 BTC/day.BTW, the average time between blocks can be estimated with this:time in seconds = difficulty * 232 / hash rateSo, the average time to find a block for a 3 MH/s CPU at a difficulty of 1 is  1 * 232 / 3000000 = 1432 seconds",

And when it was 10, one could mine 300 per day? It's just a linear progression, if the hash rate remained constant?If so, that is astounding. According to a website that tracks \"difficulty\" back to January, 2009, the difficulty rate remained \"1\" from inception until January, 2010. By my calculation, one person with a run of the mill Pentium II and a hash rate of 3, running 24 hours per day for 362 days (Jan 3 was the first block) would have mined 1,086,000 Bitcoin in 2009.",

But that was Feb 16, 2010 and on that day the difficulty was 2.53. Which implies under the formula, even accounting for the fact he was only awake 16 hours per day, he should have been able to mine 790 BTC per waking day. Which is why I am confused. In theory, he should have mined the 250 BTC in just 5 hours. Maybe that is what he meant by \"today?\" Or perhaps he had an old computer that only had a hash rate of 1? The fact two blocks were mined within 2 minutes of each other but the other three blocks took the remainder of his waking day seems unusual.",

If another person with a similar set up started to mine with satoshis, the rewards would be split between the two. Your hash rate and the difficulty determine the rate at which you solve blocks even if you are the only one mining. A 3 MH/s miner will mine 60 blocks per day when the difficulty is 1, even if they are the only miner.You will notice that in 2009 the average block time was higher than 10 minutes. Normally, the difficulty automatically adjusts in order to maintain a block time of 10 minutes, but there is a minimum difficulty of 1. In 2009, the total hash rate of the network was not high enough to find a block every 10 minutes at the minimum difficulty. In order to mine a block every 10 minutes with a difficulty of 1, you need a hash rate of about 7.2 MH/s.",

It is like a lottery ticket and no risk because you already take profit includes your initial capital.So it's worth to make a bet with 10% rest for something that can change your life. If it won't happen, you won't lose anything. In contrast, if you take profit with 100% coins you have, you will no longer have a life-changing ticket. I very agree with this advice and glad to learn it here.Below strategy from JayJuanGee and bitmover is different but it's good one too.[ANN] JJG Sustainable Bitcoin Withdrawal Strategyhttps://bitcoindata.science/withdrawal-strategy",
