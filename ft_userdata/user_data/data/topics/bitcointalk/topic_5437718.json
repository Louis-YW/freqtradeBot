Transferring around monkey jpegs and/or porn images on the network is a pointless waste of energy. The congestion and bloat this would create will lead to higher fees for users, clog and slow the network with useless traffic that can potentially compromise security with overcomplexity and bloat. Bitcoin should remain true to its core mission and principles-- the most sound money ever created and greatest store of value. Once you try to be too many things and try to please everyone, you just become another stupid altcoin. Leave the idiots to play around with their ethereum and solana, monkey pics, etc.",

I see it as a good thing since they sometimes find attack vectors like the recent thing with this \"Ordinals\" nonsense that has showed us an attack vector that exists in Taproot scripts where the user can easily inject garbage into the blockchain (as opposed to it being very hard in the past).That's not even to mention how useless the NFT idea is as a whole.Full node developers should get to work and non-standard that to prevent such spams from growing on the chain.",

Anything we use in our daily modern life that is worthwhile requires as much or more energy than bitcoin. Washing machines and dryers, automobiles, public transportation, heating and cooling our homes, using our bank ATM machines, microwave ovens, are things that require more energy per capita than bitcoin. Having said that, the technology is always improving and becoming more energy efficient. Over half the energy used by bitcoin is now renewable and/or stranded energy that otherwise could not be used. The energy it uses it what makes bitcoin so incredibly secure. Which is why it will never become proof of stake which is not very secure.Some American politicians love to criticize bitcoin for this kind of thing while flying around in their private jets, driving in their big SUVs, using energy to heat their 5,000 square foot McMansions. If these people would first give up all their modern luxuries and go live in a cave then maybe they won't sound so dumb.",

      "body": "The problem is with people or things who don't consider the fact that everyone/most participants should be able to run full Blockchain nodes, which help keep the network more decentralized and secure. Another very important reason everyone should be able to run a full node is so that it becomes possible to replicate the nodes within ones physical community, then continue to exist and do transactions with the community without the rest of the main Global Networks. This could be necessary when a part of the World/Network cuts off from the rest of the Global Networks during internet shutdown, disaster. etc This is why I believe things will work out well on Sidechain/Multichain Networks  designed for different economic groups with different hardware capabilities/capacities. They should be able to customize the Blockchain to suit their capacities and their needs. Anyone can decide to run multiple Blockchains (multiple fullnodes) if he/she wants to, or run a single Fullnode of small/medium/big/unlimited Blockchain size. This could be inform of big/medium/small Blockspace or Blockchain that is customized to hold certain amount of information/data before it's automatically locked so that nothing enters anymore. You could customize it to lock at 50gb, 100gb etc.. A Blockchain can be designed to hold whatever amount or type of data one wishes so long as they are not limiting most/all participants from running their Fullnode for the Network. People could even design their Blockchain within the Multichain system to reject evil/harmful data that breaks their good rules. You can only be censorship resistant if your data is not a danger to the networks/participants/societies. If people reject your harmful data you have the option to destroy the data or host it alone or with your group and you will now be distinct group and easy targets for law enforcement agencies. It's important that Blockchain be used for holding certain size of data most times as it may not be efficient to do otherwise. It's more suitable for light data/information. Other decentralized  non-blockchain applications/systems could be used for this purpose and they can be part of the Bitcoin Network as long as they meet the required safety standards/principles.",
