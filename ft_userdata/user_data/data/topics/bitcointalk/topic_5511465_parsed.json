Make sure or confirm if the paths are similar because if they different then the wallet address would be different.If the Xpub is correct and you have the corresponding private key then it should work.",

I found that if you create a view only wallet with Unstoppable Wallet, the address for the wallet is not the same one that shows up in Sparrow. You will need to understand Bitcoin address types because when you use private keys, mnemonic seeds to recover your wallet, you will need to choose a type you want, and a derivation path too.You will need a wallet (for recovery) that is compatible with a wallet you use for creating your wallet originally.List of Bitcoin address prefixesDerivation paths",
