      "body": "Are you trying to translate some Bitcoin-related articles into Latin or something? Personally, I never see one myself (though the reason is probably that I read from English sources). Even on my local websites, most exchanges/news websites use English keywords to refer to technical terms such as blockchain, and mnemonic seed, while \"wallet\" or others are translated literally. You might find better luck if you ask on Latin-speaking boards, or social media if those exist. That being said, is there a problem using those terms as long as you explain what the terms mean? I don't think they need to understand them perfectly. Since you're referring to older people, I also don't think you need to teach them about coinbase, UTXO, etc (I assume you just want them to know the basics to use Bitcoin).",

What would you consider as better alternative (considering ordinary people, normies or ancestors from a few centuries ago and descendants)?It's difficult to find exact Latin equivalents for many of the technical terms used in the context of Bitcoin, as the technology is relatively new and the concepts behind it are complex. However, here are some Latin words that could be used as alternatives for some of the terms:UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output): Outputus non expenditus transactionisWallet: CassidileMnemonic seed: Semen memoriae mnemonicaTransaction: TransactioMemory pool: Piscina memoriaeInputs: IntrantiaVout (Transaction Output): Outputus transactionisCoinbase: CoinbaseIt's important to note that these are not widely used or standardized terms and may not accurately reflect the technical details of the concepts they represent. Additionally, Latin was not a commonly spoken language for several centuries and may not be immediately understood by modern readers.",

What would you consider as better alternative (considering ordinary people, normies or ancestors from a few centuries ago and descendants)?I don't know why we need Latin words for the terminologies of Bitcoin, I believe terms in English are already acceptable and already a standard since English is the international language.  I do not think that there will be any confusion using the English language.  I also agree with mendace that Latin has not been commonly spoken for several centuries and using it in articles or books will only confuse readers.",

So the actual latin word would be coniungo.What google has said would sound to a latin speaker more like a smart jacuzzi than a mining pool!",

Fun exercise. That's why.  [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
