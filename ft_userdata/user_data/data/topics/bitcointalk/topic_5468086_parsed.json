I have also seen that in other threads initiated by him the warning appears on some of them and not on others.

Read the response for Stalker22, you may understand the reason now.The reason for all these topics are summarized on my last post.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on September 26, 2023, 05:32:34 AMIt is another example of unnecessary use of Feedback system. These types of unnecessary practices are the root of all problems everyone is experiencing because of you. You don't get it, do you?To be honest it's not your fault, your mental state is questionable. The problem is many members who have you in their trust list do not see it unfortunately. They are still are appreciating the past works you did to bring you today [it could be a part of your plan from the beginning] but unfortunately they do not realize that their trust for you are now is in misuse and causing the forum a great problem. You are causing problem by constantly offending everyone except some very close circle members those are offering their trust.Additionally, I just realized the inspiration for all these unnecessary conducts by JollyGood could be [1.] His obsession to see himself as a the top feedback sender [2.] His obsession to make his distrust list a long as possible. Just look at the number of people he distrust and number of feedback he left so far.",

To answer your question. That red banner you see is from the old trust system. When Theymos introduced the trust flag system on June 12, 2019. He removed the concept of trust scores, but he didn't want to make the past trust feedback completely useless. So if a member received more negative feedback from DT members than positive.
