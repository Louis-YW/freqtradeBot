Please can you tell us more about the event that is going to happen in Canaan? I think they are talking about that :Quote14 years passed since the publication of the Bitcoin white paper and Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, after 3 Bitcoin halving cycles, Bitcoin has continued to grow amidst countless doubts and gradually gained global consensus, becoming a well-deserved best practice in the field of decentralization. CANAAN has been a witness to this development, starting with the release of the Avalon Made A1, the first ASIC-based mining product in January 2013. Avalon Made products has contributed to the robustness, security, and reliability of the Bitcoin network and mining. In celebration of CANAAN’s 10th anniversary, CANAAN has launched the ‘Avalon Voucher Plan: Seeking the First-Generation Avalon Mining Products’（the ‘event’） to show appreciation to the miners and reward the worldwide Avalon Made users for their industry contributions. Through this event, CANAAN will offer customers the opportunity to exchange their old Avalon Made Products with hash rate Avalon Vouchers of up 1000 times of the original hash rate of the products. CANAAN will dispose the products received in a harmless manner in supporting the industry’s green and sustainable development.https://www.canaan.io/1490.html",

      "body": "Since it bears repeating here is the link to their program again:  https://www.canaan.io/1490.htmlIt is running from May 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.Too bad they stopped the program at the A6's. My 1st Avalon's were the A721's that I switched to in protest of Bitmain's attempt to push their new BCH coin by no longer accepting BTC. You could only pay with wirexfr or use their crapcoin. Coupled with s9 quality going down the tubes around then it was the last straw.Still have the 2x 721's and 2x 741's followed by a couple dozen 841's and 3x 941's. Of them all they all still work and only 5 failures - 2 fans dying on each of the 721's, one on a 841 as well as 1 on a 941. The only electronics failure is a dead PMU on one of the 841's. Considering the many years of them running 24x7x365 that is one excellent track record.    Those are all offline now of course and were replaced by A10's and one A12 - to-date, zero issues with them.Only God knows how many s9 fans, hash boards and control boards died on me - at least several dozen",
