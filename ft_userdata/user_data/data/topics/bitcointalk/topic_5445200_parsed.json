  "content": "A backlash, certainly by those that are well informed will happen  As for the general public that is less informed and a bit lazy/naive - it will depend on how is presented.   The government giving out CBDCs and being presented as way to:1.  protect the US dollar against foreign adversaries2. combat fraud and crime3. Give tax incentives4.  Insure against bank failuresetc...  when presented in that way and possibility with incentives, much of the general public will fall for it and not see any alternative.   There will also likely be the various political presentations to appeal to both the left and the right.   The problem is more than just CBDC vs BTC & Cryptos - the problem is the public is lazy and will take whatever path requires the least of them and appears to give them the most.There will most certainly be a battle and I suspect it will last a very long time.if you look at what happened in the USa in 1971 when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and go with full blown fiat, the pay off was making it legal for USA citizens own gold again, people just saw the idea to own gold a good pay off, again make forgot about how the government stole the gold from everyone back in the 1940sThe mainstream media does tell everyone that crypto is a scam and many believe that, so more less",

You wouldnt really be that still thinking that this could fought off decentralized coins but let alone the idea on replacing up fiat because they are just the same in overall idea. There might be some recognition if it would really be that strictly be implemented by the government but i dont believe that it wouldreally be flourishing up into the future.No one really knows on what it would looks like about adoption and recognition of these things but one things for surethat decentralized things is much more preferable.",

Choosing the CBDC makes no difference from one who is using the banking system because the CBDC is a country's local currency presented to the digital world. Those who want to be totally free won't go for the CBDC because it's still centralized and government controlled no matter how the government wants to explain it. Quote from: mendace on March 16, 2023, 09:28:45 PM The CBDCs are the only weapon that a government can possess to counter Bitcoin and they will certainly make a massive media campaign that will convince most or almost all of the mass It's the only weapon they think can battle Bitcoin, but they are absolutely wrong about that. The CBDs will still be used by them and their loyal subjects.Anyone who truly knows the purpose of Bitcoin and decentralization will also see the clear purpose of any CBDs provided by any country's government.",

Just the digital transition, and people will be under the control of government in a better way than through the paper money. Nothing changes, it is upto the people how they take it forward. Even now more countries have got their own CBDC and that haven't made any impact or gained importance as the real cryptocurrencies. The existence of CBDC is to have control and to keep the market of traditional fiat running. To the changing technology it is a must to make changes and I believe the governments will understand the need of cryptocurrencies someday.",

They has evolved from paper to polymer currency and e-banks. Now in future, they will go to CBDCs but the fact is governments and central banks control CBDCs.Citizens won't have much difference in governmental control on their cash flow because it is main responsibility of government and central bank. CBDCs at least will give people more convenience in their transfers but it only makes sense for people who don't mind about privacy.",

Some people might fall for this trap because of misinformation but most people have lost confidence in the economic policies of the government. In some countries, the government has failed to deliver on all its economic promises, and the people are fed up with these policies. Most countries are going through hyperinflation and currency loss of value. The people are desperately in need of financial alternatives that can give them a little financial lift. The people already know that the government owns CBDCs and they cannot trust this online fiat. If the government lifts the restrictions on the use of bitcoin in my location, many people will embrace it.",

The Government just had a redesign of their Naire mostly the higher Dinoomination and they have since introduced CBDC which is not really been adopted by the citizens. Still, now, even though they are printing new designs of the new Naira notes, they are printing less quantity and asking for the citizens to go more cashless. At some point, they might just find themselves automatically adopting the e-Naira since there is less cash in circulation.",

It's basically stabelcoin made by the government and that's about it, nothing more and you think I should be some sort of happy about it? Of course not and I think that it is something I will never buy or invest into.However, that doesn't mean that it won't convince more people to join into the crypto world, having some government guarantee will definitely make some people consider getting into this market, which is why it's nice for us.",
