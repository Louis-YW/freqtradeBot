  "content": "Hi guys..I had this argument with a friend of mine yesterday while we were discussing over a bottle of beer each  .Is It Possible To Abuse gambling?Answer is Yes ..What is Gambling Abuse?Gambling abuse is simply defined as gambling with a motive that is different from the real purpose why gambling is in existence.Lets Consider This ExampleTramadol is a  drug used to relieve patients from extreme pain, or what would have caused extreme pain, for example, when a patient is to undergo a CS, Tramadol is one of the drugs that is administered to such patient to help numb their nervous system from feeling the pain of the cut, this drugs also give the patient energy, at the same time intoxicates, this helps the patient to have energy, as well sleep so that the operation can be comfortably carried out on them.Today, many of our men and youths now take this drug, not for the purpose it was made, but for the fact that it gives energy and intoxicates at the same time, giving a feel-good kind of feeling, and lets also note that this drug is highly addictive, tramadol today is banned in a country like Nigeria due to the level of abuse on it, that is people taking the drug not for what it was created for, but for their own personal pleasure, police now arrest and prosecute owners of medicine shops who are caught selling tramadol to unauthorized patients.How Does This Abuse Relate to Gambling? We all know that gambling is originally meant to act as a means of entertainment, that is, its one of the ways people entertain themselves and in so doing, they stand a chance at winning money..Today, because of the possibility to win money through gambling, Many gamblers no longer gamble as way of being entertained, but have turned gambling into  their major source of income, this is abuse because gambling was never meant to be a source of income or livelihood to anyone, but rather, another way for players to entertain themselves.Today, we have many players going the extreme just for a win, and most times if they fail, many resort to committing suicide as a way to lift of burden of debt they brought upon themselves due to irresponsible gambling which i can now also refer to as Gambling abuse .what do you think about this?Do you agree that gambling outside what gambling is meant for is abuse on gambling?If you agree, what do you think should be done to gambling abusers if there was a way to catch them? Should they be arrested and prosecuted same way drug abusers are arrested and prosecuted if caught?Lets have a discussion.Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or pharmacist, I know nothing about drugs, all I said concerning Tramadol is solely based on my personal use and experience with the drug, in medical terms, I could be wrong with the description of the drug.",

If alcohol is allowed in your country, if you abuse it, nothing like prosecution unless that make you do something wrong like you rape someone, you drive and you are caught to be drunk. If you drink in your home and intoxicate yourself and do nothing wrong, you are abusing alcohol if you do it often but no prosecution.Some drugs are illegal, like cocaine. Even if someone do not abuse it and he was caught, he will be jailed.Abuse and addiction are just the same. I only know that people should not be addicted to gambling, they should gamble responsibly and they should only use small amount of money which they can afford to lose to gamble. If they got addicted and because of that, they steal or become something else, the punishment of what they become can lead them to be jailed.I am gambling responsibly. Do not be addicted.",

What we need is to now create more resources, institutions and train lay personnel to effectively handle the rising cases of gambling addiction.QuoteDo you agree that gambling outside what gambling is meant for is abuse on gambling?Yes, I do. QuoteIf you agree, what do you think should be done to gambling abusers if there was a way to catch them? Only casinos can catch them and give them temp ban. If they notice that when they return the gambling addiction has not reduced then they give them life ban. QuoteShould they be arrested and prosecuted same way drug abusers are arrested and prosecuted if caught?This is a punitive action rather than a reformative action. It will be counter productive. These people need to be helped not punished.",

      "body": "Yes, in my own opinion. Gamble abuse leads to stress then what's next to it is worst. I don't know how other gamblers are making gambling as their source of income. I have tried so many times to try and defeat the house but there's literally no window to win even if you do it for long. Yes, I did see some winners but it doesn't last long. After that, they will gamble the money they won and the house will take it back, without a little shed of doubt. So, it's better to just leave gambling for entertainment purposes only. That way it won't lead to scenarios that are not easy to return from.",

      "body": "Well said friend,  you nailed it on the abuse of tramadol but note that there is no big difference between tramadol, and beer that you were on while having this discussion with your friend and the only difference is the fact that beer is seen as legal in some part of Nigeria but also illegal in other parts of the country where the Sharia law is in force just like in the northern part of the country Nigeria,  and tramadol is not banned as you put out but have been restricted to be sold only on doctor's prescriptions, and the government also put in measures that make the price of the drug to be so expensive to the extent that those addicted to it can afford it any longer unlike what it was in the past when the price of the drug was so low that it nearly destroyed the life of the youths were many were engaged on the unauthorized excessive intakes of the drug. Now back to gambling abuse,  I think instead us concentrating on the excessive gambling that leads the gambler into addiction,  let us also consider other facts that have also made up the bigger part of gambling abuse which is the real abuse on gambling systems e.g abuse on bonuses system and how some players manipulate the outcome of the game in some cases,  I know this is rear cases that are not often discussed here,  but then also I believe that it is worthy to note them too,  since the impact on some casino has lead to closer of such casinos example is what happened to Betlucy some time ago where there welcome bonus systems were abused at lunch where there did a no wagering welcome bonus but that the end players abused the system by creating multiple accounts just to cashout the bonuses. So I think this is the real bigger abuse? But then also when you talk about gamblers that take gambling as a source of income,  leading them to gamble excessively that means that there already abusing the essence of gambling which is gambling for entertainment,  but then also we must also take note of the fact that gambling winning can really be enticing most especially when you win constantly for some time which also is almost impossible sometimes but then also possibility os there that a gambler can win a big amount on a bet which also can help sort out financial needs but not to be taken as a source of income.",

But in modern times, gambling is rarely used for that, some people use it to make money, entertainment and socializing. Is it wrong if gambling is abused like that? there's nothing wrong with that, because everyone has their own purpose for gambling, some use it for predictions, making money, entertainment, etc., what distinguishes it is only for its purpose.",

Gambling was created as a form of entertainment so that people may enjoy themselves and either win or lose money while betting on their favourite games. Why would someone borrow money to bet, and why would anyone be so reliant on something with a 50/50 chance of success, when gambling is intended to be fun? It's their problem, they should be left alone to find a way to get out of any trouble they find themselves in.

We don't know what is the mindset of a certain person when he gambles. Maybe he want's to be entertain or to earn money. So I disagree about them being arrested and prosecuted like a criminals. Government should step up, and they want to stop gambling totally. But the problem is that government rely on the money being generated by casinos.",

And even if we do try to preempt by taking action, everything is only based on \"assumptions\". And technically the police force or casino staff can't make a move based on such a thing. It's basically the same thing with drug abusers, in most cases, their states are already far too in before people can even notice and stop it. The key idea to do here is to prevent said situation from happening in the first place, and it doesn't stem from gambling, no. It usually stems from the influences in the environment, from your parents, friends, advertisements, the internet, etc., and that would be a too big of a thing to influence, so most people really just ignore it, not that they don't care though, they can't just do anything with a single persons influence.",

If you bet your money or have staked it in gambling then you are gambling. Unlike the tramadol scenario you made which is quite understable. However, but if patients were to be relieved by tramadol on their pain and some people are also using it as hard drugs to get intoxicated, it means the drug has more than one purpose unlike gambling whose purpose could be more than one, entertainment and profit.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on July 24, 2023, 08:56:08 AMIf you agree, what do you think should be done to gambling abusers if there was a way to catch them?
