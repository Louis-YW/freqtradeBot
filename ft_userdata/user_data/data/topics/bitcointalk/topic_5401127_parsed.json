Imagine if the blockchain got outages like a few days or a week. Im sure that people will be very frustated caused by that. It seems like that if solana will be potentially become the next luna. People are slowly starting to distrust this project. So many negative reviews already appeared on the CMC live chat. This is another problem and people may leave solana for another blockchain soon.",

They must upgrade it successfully but it won't be easy. I think when their upgrade works effectively and successfully, $SOL will take off especially with support from FTX exchange.Meanwhile, it won't be easy time for Solana holders because there are selling pressure, price manipulation and fud.

Solana has dumped a lot but there are other potential altcoins as well which have been dumped more than SOL.For instance, FTM is a good coin but it has been dumped all the way from $3 to $0.38 currently which is almost 10 times the price.So I still think Solana is doing comparatively well even after the halt.",

How would I know that they won't do something that would be sort of like scamming? I personally hope that people would finally realize the problem and stay away from sol.",

I hope they find a way around this because it won't be good to see another top alts crumble. Maybe except bitcoin's blockchain. As with the issues, if falls on the hands of the devs to remedy the situation. This is not the first time, so they should have a least learn from the first one and find a way around otherwise this is going to be a huge problem for them in the future. I'm not generalizing, but I think the devs are just sitting around after they roll out their projects. They should still be 100% hands on on this so that they can see where the potential issues are going to come. Currently the price of Sol is down 7% just like the rest of the altcoin market.",
