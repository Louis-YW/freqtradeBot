      "body": "It probably depends. If you're going to believe that whales manipulate the market as much as had been suggested in the past (and still do it) then for larger coins like bitcoin they'd probably wait for times to do it when the market has low volatility, low volume and little order book depth so they know they'll push the price far enough in a direction to get a reaction.For smaller coins, all they really need is an order book without much depth and to work out how cheap it is to pump a coin if no one cares to buy it once it's been pumped.There's not a bad chance people who are bad at trading or annoyed they made a loss where they think they shouldn't have blamed whales and also a time where whales have been blamed for price manipulation and it was still speculated about long after as to whether it was whales or not. (the best way to tell would be to look at tiny timeframes of a second or 10 to see if all the move came quickly or didn't and only if it comes quickly would it confirm it's necessarily a whale).",

But whales need to respect market movment and only can do corrctions to some extent.It is bitcoin, not altcoin with low marketcap. Manipulation would be hard if compared.Quote from: AbuBhakar on October 09, 2022, 05:15:01 PMThe problem is not Bitcoin but the crypto trader that can be easily manipulate to sell or buy Bitcoin with just a simple signals.How are traders manipulating the market when they are only looking for ways to make profit from trading? Simple signal like? Traders are not manipulating anything in my opinion.",

This is common, and other forms include fake volume on the Exchanges which shows the project high on the market. The major manipulation trap is through creating fear among the common users.When something negative about cryptocurrency is spread around, common investors tend to sell fearing it'll not grow again. Nowadays this kind of manipulation isn't giving hands as everyone are aware of the market and know well about it.",

For all of the worry and concern, it is unlikely that any one person or organization really has any significant power to impact Bitcoin's overall value significantly. While BTC price may still be possible to manipulate, movements are far less pronounced than they were a few years ago. In the end, I think it is important to remember that someone will always be working to manipulate the market. But when it comes to Bitcoin, this is not an issue worth losing sleep over.",

Honesty, it was easy to manipulate the market if you have a lot of money and the capability to do it. But despite this situation, I have to complain about it because of the reason that these whales are also helping the market to keep alive and also for us to make a profit. Just I imagine that without their participation I can't expect such volatility and great development. As we are in this market where money is involved, certainly expect manipulations exist.",

It's normal that every market has a whale even though stocks, but I don't know if there's a manipulation in the crypto market, it seems you need a large fund for this, in order that you can manipulate the market price.Whales are whales, they didn't need to respect the market. Once the opportunity of making a profit is there, they will grab it, and they will laugh when they saw a weak hand selling their Bitcoin during the correction time.",

If they can manage this, then they will most likely be able to play the price of bitcoin, but in reality this cannot be done in the course of bitcoin, although it is possible to do and bitcoin is very different from altcoins. The amount of Bitcoin in circulation should be held 40-50% by the pope, and this is impossible. So no need to think about this, do the right trades, so that we can get maximum profit, don't worry about this problem.",
