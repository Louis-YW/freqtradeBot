      "body": "It probably depends. If you're going to believe that whales manipulate the market as much as had been suggested in the past (and still do it) then for larger coins like bitcoin they'd probably wait for times to do it when the market has low volatility, low volume and little order book depth so they know they'll push the price far enough in a direction to get a reaction.For smaller coins, all they really need is an order book without much depth and to work out how cheap it is to pump a coin if no one cares to buy it once it's been pumped.There's not a bad chance people who are bad at trading or annoyed they made a loss where they think they shouldn't have blamed whales and also a time where whales have been blamed for price manipulation and it was still speculated about long after as to whether it was whales or not. (the best way to tell would be to look at tiny timeframes of a second or 10 to see if all the move came quickly or didn't and only if it comes quickly would it confirm it's necessarily a whale).",

But whales need to respect market movment and only can do corrctions to some extent.It is bitcoin, not altcoin with low marketcap. Manipulation would be hard if compared.Quote from: AbuBhakar on October 09, 2022, 05:15:01 PMThe problem is not Bitcoin but the crypto trader that can be easily manipulate to sell or buy Bitcoin with just a simple signals.How are traders manipulating the market when they are only looking for ways to make profit from trading? Simple signal like? Traders are not manipulating anything in my opinion.",

This is common, and other forms include fake volume on the Exchanges which shows the project high on the market. The major manipulation trap is through creating fear among the common users.When something negative about cryptocurrency is spread around, common investors tend to sell fearing it'll not grow again. Nowadays this kind of manipulation isn't giving hands as everyone are aware of the market and know well about it.",

      "body": "there are many things going on in the marketsa true market of true user buys/sells.. would have different sentiments per platform.EG the group of buyers on a british market would want to buy at different times to that at a american market. so you would see peak volumes and offers at different timesalso english mining costs are different to that of american miners. so the sentiment of 'values' would be different. meaning the willingness for miners to sell for profit would differ to american miners selling for profit. and same for buyers,yet many markets price graph line up too coincidentally. they match each other too consistentlythis is where arbitraging comes in. these are not normal willing buyers and sellers. but traders in the middle playing each market against each other, using sidechans and stablecoins to move funds from one exchange to another instantly to take advantage of any price discrepancy to profit from the different spreads in each market...ontop of this there are the 'futures'/options marketswhen they do 'shorts' they sell the market causing a price drop to then buy cheaper. when enough do this they can make the price decrease. there are groups that act together doing this in a form of opposite to a pump and dumpthen there are the influencers. groups of people trying to push regular users to sell or buy at certain times that suits the influencers, not the userslastly, there are the exchanges that could but shouldnt insider trade. this can be done by simply seeing how many deposits totals they have per hour/day to calculate the possible market orders that may hit that day. some exchanges use silly KYC/AML requirements to delay peoples orders hitting the market by setting a delayed exchange time that suits the exchange, rather than let users insta-swap.they can also shadow trade. by putting small orders in before regular users orders so that the exchange itself always gets the best dealsthe last are not \"whale\", but instead \"wall\" traders. yes they have whale volume. but their game is to create walls of resistance a few orders below the spread to force the sentiment that the price wont go below or above certain levels pushing users to play within the wallsways to solve this could be that traders internal and external have to pay a fee to make an order. rather than charged a fee for having an order filled. i dont mean  an extra fee, just a change of when the fee is chargedthat way it would stop all the fake orders, wall orders and shadow orders that try to sway the markets because most market control is done not by regular traders that just buy due to their personal sentiment. but due to the wall orders and arbitrage shadow trading that sets and cancels orders to sway the regular normal users",

For all of the worry and concern, it is unlikely that any one person or organization really has any significant power to impact Bitcoin's overall value significantly. While BTC price may still be possible to manipulate, movements are far less pronounced than they were a few years ago. In the end, I think it is important to remember that someone will always be working to manipulate the market. But when it comes to Bitcoin, this is not an issue worth losing sleep over.",

Honesty, it was easy to manipulate the market if you have a lot of money and the capability to do it. But despite this situation, I have to complain about it because of the reason that these whales are also helping the market to keep alive and also for us to make a profit. Just I imagine that without their participation I can't expect such volatility and great development. As we are in this market where money is involved, certainly expect manipulations exist.",

It's normal that every market has a whale even though stocks, but I don't know if there's a manipulation in the crypto market, it seems you need a large fund for this, in order that you can manipulate the market price.Whales are whales, they didn't need to respect the market. Once the opportunity of making a profit is there, they will grab it, and they will laugh when they saw a weak hand selling their Bitcoin during the correction time.",

If they can manage this, then they will most likely be able to play the price of bitcoin, but in reality this cannot be done in the course of bitcoin, although it is possible to do and bitcoin is very different from altcoins. The amount of Bitcoin in circulation should be held 40-50% by the pope, and this is impossible. So no need to think about this, do the right trades, so that we can get maximum profit, don't worry about this problem.",
