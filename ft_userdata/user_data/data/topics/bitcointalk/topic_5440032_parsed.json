I strongly believe that bitcoin is one of the best investment someone can invest but the question is how can I do it I really need the help of this room pleaseYou can buy and trade Bitcoin in the exchanges.Example: \"Binance\"First, you have to make an account in the exchange or e-wallet that is available to your Country.Example: Binance2nd, Go to \"P2P\" section then click \"buy\" (you can choose a specific currency or choose BTC) then you can see the list of payment method. Just follow the simple instructions provided in your Binance app and you will immediately get BTC.If you want to hold your Bitcoin for a long time investment, you have to transfer it to a safer wallet.I recommend to use Electrum because that's what I'm using, just make sure to keep your private key and phrase where only you knows it. If you have a hardware wallet, it's much safer.Then if the time has come that price of Bitcoin is so expensive, you have to transfer it again to exchange in order to trade it.You can see the list of top exchanges here: https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/",

But bitcoin is one of the trusted crypto in the industry and you might not be bothered of potential scam like altcoins.Just like littlemouse said, you could use Binance if cex isnt a thing or issue with you, and he did suggest a dex for bitcoin trading. Might as well, focus on doing decentralized first, by incorporating yourself with how to handle btc in wallets. Then proceed only on cex, if you are comfortable already.",

Also, if you want to sell, make sure that you release fund, only after you get deposited in Fiat into your bank account.",

For how to trade with Bitcoin, you only need to use several large, well-known exchanges and try to buy at a low price or when a price correction starts to occur in Bitcoin, then sell it when the price has started to increase like in the past two days.

It's important to know that before trading because that's when you will determine if it's going to be a custodial wallet or if you are going to HODL BTC in a wallet you can control.The easier way is to buy it off-exchange and store it there. A safer way is to store it in a wallet you can control. That's the best thing so you can prevent possible hacks.It depends on what you're planning in the future and what you will do about it because that's going to be the deciding factor for you.

But for traders, what better option do we have? I don't see any 2nd option if you are a trader and profit from trading. Centralized exchange is almost the only option that exists in the market, DEX still cannot provide the optimal trading solution as CEX is providing. CEX is still essential for the market, by using them wisely, we can limit the risk.",
