      "body": "I think I love Cronos. It has got much more functionality in its smart contract deployed on the decentralized finance milieu. Much better than Ethereum or Binance Smartchain. And of course, the transaction fee is very cheap. But the problem is the RPC is buggy, especially the evm.cronos. APRs and TVLs on DeFi platforms are either not displaying or just plain wrong. The devs should sit up. I'm tired of complaining",
