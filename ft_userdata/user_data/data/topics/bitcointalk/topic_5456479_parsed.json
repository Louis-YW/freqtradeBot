You can still get the best attention by making comments and contributions to existing topics that you find interesting and you have something to contribute to the discussion,¬† most of us at our newbies time also make such mistakes of creating threads,¬† while some were applauded others were condemned but we quickly learn from both and the lesson has helped to shape our activities here in the forum,¬† it necessary to have a mentor,¬† someone you can look up to for correction and advise and also making sure to get engage with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related discussions more against other sub-board.",

As you have said encouraging each other is a good idea to moving forward but I think this would be very much appreciated when it is reciprocated. No one would be that happy when after you have encouraged another with all your might and strength and when it gets to you it is a thing of being ignored. It is very disheartening and disappointing to experience such. An African proverbs says \" when the left washes the right, the right reciprocates by washing the left as well\" it is natural and can never be ignored or bypassed.",
