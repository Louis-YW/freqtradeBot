  "content": "I have a great business opportunity for you. I reside in Europe and there are many Amazon lockers available here. You can buy items from Amazon and send them to me, and I will receive and sell them. You will receive payment instantly for whatever you send. Our primary focus is on items such as mobile phones, laptops, shoes, etc. We also have a high demand for gift cards such as Google Play, Apple, Netflix, and many more.In addition, we have many clients who come to us to pay their invoices.If you can pay invoices by entering an OTP, we can have a great deal. We are willing to share profits. If you're interested, please contact me on Telegram at https://t.me/nopmnow or @nopmnow.",

Your account is new, without a commercial record, so how do you ask people to send electronic things to you in the hope that you will sell them and then make profits for them?

It is a service that allows you to buy from Amazon with bitcoins. I have been using the service for many years. I second this suggestion.  I admittedly haven't used purse.io in several years, but I have had mostly good experiences with it.  The bad experiences I had all ended up in refunds, so I've never lost anything as a result.  In fact, I've even scored 30% discounts a time or two on big purchases.  If there's something you want but can't quite afford it and are willing to wait, this is a great way to get a massive discount in exchange for waiting and being willing to have the item purchased whenever someone is willing to do so.  This is probably the best thing that Roger Ver has been a part of for this community and I'm glad that it didn't become a Bitcoin Cash only service.",
