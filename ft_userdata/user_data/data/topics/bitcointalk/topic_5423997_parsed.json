Social media and fake identities have completely changed many people's lives, and I believe that my side of the story is the worst because the majority of marriages have ended because of social media and fake identities, and many young girls have become pregnant as a result of social media. Social media was not designed for fake relationships or fake lives; it was designed to be used for communication. However, many people have used it as such.",

Sadly, this is all what the social media has made the society turn out to be, everyone just wanna impress.",

      "body": "My day is that don’t be carried away by what you see in social media, believe whatever you see on social media at your own risk. 85% of most of the people and posts on every platform on the social media is untrue and this has made lots of people to fall into the hands of scammers. Social media in our society today is now the home of fraudsters and other fraudulent transactions which supposed to be a platform for positive promotions, advertisements of products, items and other professions that are beneficial to a lot of people. Whatever you want to follow on social media today, you really need to do your due diligence before venturing into it so as to avoid the story that would touch the heart. That’s why it is advisable to transact physically rather than believing whatever you see on any social media platform under the disguise of the scams. Although we have so many real people with good intentions on the social media today bet the bad ones had spoilt the reputations already which is why we all have to be more careful when dealing with people on the social media.",

The only problem with fake identity on social media is can be used to spread false information, harass or bully and publicly humiliate others. And, this will hurt the people easily affected by their emotions and this could lead to depression or anxiety. That's why people should be educated in becoming responsible and respectful to people when using social media and also controlling what they are saying to people. And, only good thing about using a fake identity on social media they express themselves freely also to protect their identity which can have anonymity, and privacy.",

Social Media has also worsened the desperation for Richies. No more morals, no etiquette everything is now a lifestyle as long as it entices our selfish desires and lust. I completely agree with you. Social media has created a culture of competition where people feel the need to keep up with each other. It's not just about sharing moments of our lives, but also about presenting ourselves in the best possible light. This has led to a situation where people feel pressured to create a fake image of themselves and to try to impress others.One of the most worrying things about social media is the impact it has on our mental health. Many people feel anxious or depressed when they don't receive enough likes or comments on their posts. This can lead to a vicious cycle where people feel the need to create even more impressive content to gain attention, which in turn leads to even more pressure and anxiety.Moreover, this culture of competition has led people to become more materialistic, and it has become more difficult to distinguish between what is genuine and what is not. In the past, people were more focused on building meaningful relationships with others and making memories, but now, it's all about the appearance of success and popularity.What we need to remember is that social media is just a tool, and it should be used in a positive way. We need to be aware of the negative impact that it can have on our mental health and our relationships. We should use it to connect with others, share our experiences, and spread positivity, rather than trying to compete with each other or present a fake image of ourselves.What do you think about this? Have you experienced any negative impacts of social media on your life?",

Moreso fake life is about telling lies and to tell lies is far expensive than we think because when you tell one lie about yourself , you will need another superior lie to keep the initial lie going and to make it accepted it has to be better. Snapchat has made it worst, hence the rate of trying to make one better in the eyes of others is almost eating some people up. Showing off with expensive borrowed cars, homes etc tempt those who can't control themselves to be envious and they try to do things to get into that level.",
