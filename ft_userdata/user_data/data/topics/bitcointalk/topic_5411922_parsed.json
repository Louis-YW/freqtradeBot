Because causes someone homeless and jobless, when there is flood people can not farm again so to feed or eat become difficult for people to live. In 2012 and 2019 Nigeria experience the worst flood in my generation. I have not seen such flood in my life. And in this year again NTA, CHANNELS and other TV stations are saying that flood will come but I doubt it because if flood would come by now we would have seen the symptoms of the flood although one of the symptoms has been detected which the flood from Pakistan. Now when people are suffering and crying for help in the flood period, industries are using it to make money. Industries like FOAM, RICE, BEANS, INDOMIE, OIL, ETC. These industries would be busy lobbying the government to buy their things and give to the victims. Then the politicians who are the major people that are using flood to siphon government money to privates use. Mostly the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.  This is a Community Nigeria, It has been taken over with floodBecause of the way they (Politicians) are using flood to in-rich themselves, I came to the conclusion that most of the floods are man made not from nature.",

I think I can agree with you on the last part, but although there's no proof, it's actually what a government of a state, esp where I'm from, are capable of doing. It's sad that they are comfortable making money off the pains of its people.  With all these problems hitting the people: flood, hunger, no shelter, the government seem to turn a blind eye to their plights, but what then can be done to limit such occurrence? Is it enough to wish these things away? I think it's time we get up and vote out such corrupt leaders who only concern themselves with enriching themselves with what ever means possible, and put in people who can put a stop to these things.",

Government is always playing and running after their seats and they don't care about people's sufferings. Recently Pakistan faced the worst flood in the history and 3/4th Pakistan were drown and sunk in water and still people are trying to regain their strength lost during that time .",

Only if our leaders can make good provision for flood victims so that in a suitation like this the people can still have hope in the government to provide them with shelter and food.The flood water is gradually reducing in my community but it has done so much damage people such as hiking the price of commodities and destruction of access road into the state. Life will not be the same for the flood victims since they will go back to square one especially the poor. It has become a regular since the past 5yrs.",

      "body": "Flood isn't a thing of joke and seeing pictures posted by @Agbe, I wept because I could only imagine how much has been lost so far from the common man and how much pains they could be going through right now.I also agree with @Agbe, that this flood especially that of this year was induced by man because I've heard rumors of some water banks been released intentionally and we should know that there is always an atom of truth in every rumors.In a country like Nigeria, the government kept talking about flood coming, but never made provisions for IDP camps or neither did they take any precautionary measures in controlling the situation.I also came across a news of how helps in form of money and other valuables were sent to the former president of that country because he was affected by the flood, leaving the common man.I was shocked and I really felt bad about it but I do hope we learn a lesson and try not to be sentimental while choosing the right leaders to take people out of these mess.",

      "body": "hundreds of years ago. the normal water cycle is that when it rains the rain then soaks into top soil of land and moves down rivers and streams in thin layers meaning easy to evaporate and cycle. where it would be like sunny day rainy day sunny rainy with small amount of rainfall each time. balancing out the ecosystem and temperature by mild small variationhowever industrialisation started to dam up rivers to store water for months in reservoirs and cities using up the water and plumbing the water into pipes. instead of letting it flow to evaporate in small easy amounts each daythis meant not as much evaporation thus less gentle rain periods regularlythese gaps of rain meant lands heating up more and then the beaches having sea water at low tides get warmer so even more water would evaporate in one go. more water evaporating in one go means a day later where ever the wind took those clouds eventually the more rain would then splash on the ground in one godue to the lack of rain days months before(drought)..the rains wont just soak or evaporate to just recycle the water cycle back to normal. instead it was wash away or collect.(flood) which cause issues evaporating..so again long periods without evaporation meant longer periods without cloud cover meaning it then got hotter meaning then it hit the tipping point of the waters of large reservoirs and beaches being hot enough to cause alot of evaporation in one go. and so that bigger lot of water evaporating meant more rain to come down..(bigger floods)yep.. nothing to do with carbon at all. yes hydro power generation from dam reservoirs and yes human caused.. but not due to \"carbon\"its to do with damming up rivers and plumbing/sewers that stopped normal evenly distributed water on topsoil to evenly evaporatetry it yourself. get 2 glasses of water of equal amount.on a sunny day put one glass on your back yard patio still in its glass.. and then spill the other glass on your patio.. you will see the puddle evaporates morenow see it as a big picture. that puddle would have made a small rainy day if you imagine your patio as a country. now imagine. not spilling the glass in second round. but collecting it into reservoirs. where you put 2 glasses on patio along side the fit days glass you didnt spill .where, if you had no puddle on second round (free flow of water in thin layers spread over land) then the lack of those rainy days and clouds to cool the land. means more sunny drought days on round 3,4,5,6,etc.. more sunny days to heat the land. meaning the glasses(reservoir/oceans) warm up until they evaporate all the water in the glasses of many days of stored water. in one go. (that did not be set free to evaporate over time.gradually)and suddenly it all goes up.. and what goes up must come down.. in one go",

On one particular night, I went to a friend's house and had to spend the night there. I returned home the next day and opened my door to find water in my room. My laptop, iPad, and TV were all soaked, but the most painful part of my property was my documents, including documents to my house and most of the receipts for my land.",
