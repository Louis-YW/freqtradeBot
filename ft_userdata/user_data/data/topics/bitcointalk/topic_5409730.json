  "content": "Let's assume we try to mine the next block after block No.749256 whose hash is : 00000000000000000009b06cb40e4302fc0dab3f8031f058351e904e14be2b45.  --> current difficulty is 19 leading zeros (76 zero bits=19*4) out of 256  --> the size of the population is N=2^256In big-endian representation, double_sha256 outcome should have 76 ending zeros. This is equivalent to saying that the leading 180 bits can be any number  --> total number of possible solution is K=2^180Let's assume we use one Antminer S19 PRO with a hashpower of 110TH/s for 10 min  --> total number of attempts is n=66*10^15One double_sha256 outcome that fulfills the difficulty requirement is sufficient --> k=1To sum up the mining problem, here are the parameters to calculate the probability of mining a block in 10 min :  N is the population size                                                            =  2^256  n is the number of draws (double_SHA256 checks)                     = 66*10^15  K is the number of known success states in the population          = 2^180  k is the number of wanted successes                                         = 1This problem is dealt with in probability theory and statistics by the hypergeometric distribution (definition from wikipedia): Quoteis a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of k successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N that contains exactly K objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. The formula for the calculation is available on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distributionIs anyone able to calculate the result for the example I have given ? The values seem too big using Python or Matlab.We find references to this early post regarding the difficulty of mining but it doesn't give a rigourous answer https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1682.0.Kind regards",

      "body": "Simple math.What's the expected chance a miner of X TH/s getting a block in 10 minutes.Miner does: D = X * 10^12 / (2^32) Diff per secondIn 10 minutes it does D10 = D * 600 DiffWhat is the current Network Diff? (i.e. the 'expected' amount of total network Diff per 10 minutes)ND = 28351606743493.8(which you can calculate from the hex value which is \"0x1709ed88\")So what is your expected chance of getting a block in 10 minutes? D10 / NDOr 1 in (ND / D10)However, your question suggests that the 10 minute figure affects the result.The only effect it has is to increase D -> D10 i.e. multiply D by 600.Mining is a simple random occurrence with simple calculations:Blocks are expected every: 'Number of Attempts' / (ND*(2^32))Since 1Diff = 2^32 attemptsHowever, if that 'every' is more than 2 weeks then no it doesn't work.Since ND is no longer a constant.You cannot determine even the next value of ND in advance.",

      "body": "Thanks @kano, @a1 Hashrate LLC2022, @NotATether.My intention was also to have a post that anyone googling mining difficulty can find.I recommend these two articles that studied statistically the mining difficulty problem :- https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/173483/1/SSRN-id3399742-2.pdf- https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3399742Conclusion is that the Hypergeometric Distribution is the correct model and not Poisson Distribution as commonly accepted (also assumed in Satochi's white paper).Nevetheless, I agree that the way I stated the problem is incomplete. We should also do the calculation \"knowing that\" there is competition with X hash power.Overall, I agree that the ratio of own hash power to the network hash power can be a good approximation.",

I've never found anything giving a better explanation to start with : https://medium.com/fcats-blockchain-incubator/understanding-the-bitcoin-blockchain-header-a2b0db06b515It's just the theory behind the process for bitcoin.
