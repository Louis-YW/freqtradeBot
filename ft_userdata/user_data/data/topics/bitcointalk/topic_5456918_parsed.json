Na better idea be this oh my brother, but truth be told, for anyone to consider either to receive Bitcoin as payment for goods or services, eh depend on how much stuff her or she dey sell or buy, because due to transaction fees and other charges, bitcoin no be the best payment medium for small scale businesses, wey wetin you dey sell na stuff between the range of #200 to #4000, but if wetin you dey sell na stuffs between the range of like #5k, #10k and above, then you go fit use Bitcoin & no wahala.. Because the aim of every business man is to minimize cost and maximize profit. But when it comes to the issue of placing advertisement, I will highly recommend you can put it in your shop, social media bio, or whatsApp status telling your customers that while you accept fiat, you also accept Bitcoin for payment.",

Creating awareness and promoting the adoption of bitcoin is one of our major goals. So far, there have been lots of enterprises from our local board here that are accepting bitcoin payment for quite sometime now and it has been positive and remarkable.I will like to call your attention to what you have said OP  \"so why I bring dis topic here say make una follow chuk mouth for inside di matter be say as CBN still ban cryptocurrency, \". Do not get things mixed-up OP. CBN never banned Crypto currency in Nigeria, they only restricted the banks from carrying out Crypto related transactions or payment. To the best of my knowledge, p2p platforms do exist on exchange and other forms too were Nigerians have been doing transactions but the truth is that nobody wants to identify publicly to be doing Crypto transaction  for the fear of the unknown but rather choose to remain silent doing things with Crypto and bitcoin. Everybody is just careful not being the scapegoat by the efcc and others.",

Na good thing to integrate other means of payment for your business like Bitcoin but before you do that you  go consider other factors like which type of service you dey render or goods wey you dey sell. If na petty goods you dey sell then the idea of using Bitcoin to receive payment fit no make sense at the moment because of high transaction fees. Your customers no go really like to buy goods of N2000 or N3000, come pay almost the same amount or more for transaction fees except you go use lightning network.

If high fees be barrier for small businesses to accept payment in bitcoin, den di acceptance of di coin for grassroot no go de easy, because why customers go want to pay more for di same commodity with cryptocurrency, wey dem fit to easily pay less pay with fiat.Wat if na goods wey de above 20k and above, di transaction fees suppose de go lower and lower?

Wetin this law means say you no fit buy Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin to your Banks. Why them come out with the law na dat time wey rumors been dey say some banks wan dey offer crypto exchange services. You fit run your business nothing concern CBN with wetin you dey do with your business. Nigeria never ban Bitcoin, na unless Tinubu come out to announce say all Bitcoin transaction are illegal na when you go dey reason to stop dey accept Bitcoin.You know how many businesses are operating officially for Nigeria wey dey involved with Bitcoin, your own no go different. Run your matters on the low avoid social media sha make e just be decentralized exchange between you and your customers because if you carry am go online and law enforcement agency see am dem go wan use you chop. Tax collectors go begin reason you and EFCC as well. You know Nigerian no dey like see person progress, na so dem go begin badmouth yout business wey go come dey attract unnecessary attention wey no go make sense for your business so I go advise you run the mata offline and make your cutworms donthe marketing for you when dem get better services from you.",
