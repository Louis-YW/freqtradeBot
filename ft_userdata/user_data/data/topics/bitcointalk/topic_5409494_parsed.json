I thought of this a few weeks ago .they could be made a lot quieter/smaller by having a container full of liquid helium that expands when the car wants to take off and compressed when it wants to land.There'd be a lot less of a risk for wings/prepellars colliding and perhaps less energy used if something could deliver enough of a force to recompress the container and keep it compressed.",

The case of flying car might someday become a reality if only it hasn't been produced yet. In the crypto world altcoins sre double edged and always expecting the worst while investing in altcoin keeps the risk minimal and the expectations low. Life is an adventure of risky decisions and sometimes altcoins move cents to millions of dollars",

Choose wisely.I find your single example not sufficient enough. I just want to point out that what we have is not \"high expectations\" but hope. We have hope and it keeps us going.

Choose wisely.If Elon Musk can say that A.I is not something humans should mess with....haha you know the rest.I totally do not understand the angle you are coming from, but I will react based on the industry we are into.First, technology is dynamic but it respects expectations. Expectations birth ideas as much as necessity does. However, most times technological innovations do not follow our expectations due to non common problems. While flying cars might be the problem of an over populated economy, there are people whose problem is that they can't get water from the under-ground and there are no rivers around.Then, in a related industries expectations are met. In cryptocurrency, I know more coins would continue to be created, many altcoins will die off and new ones will emanate. Bitcoin will continue to be the king for many years then it will be very necessary to make some changes in bitcoin. Blockchain will not fail and the world's finance will eventually depend on blockchain. What else are you expecting to know, a technology might come up to augment or eliminate bitcoin right? All is possible.",

It seems we are seeing a lot of developments in the crypto ecosystem in which solutions are provided to non-existent problems. That's absurd. There are projects that seem to offer nothing but a more beautiful world. I guess that's not what the people need. I guess what is being in demand are products and services that address actual problems on the ground. It should also be noted that problems are ranked according to how pressing they are. And this is probably the reason why crypto doesn't impress a lot of people.",

Future movies incorporating some high tech stuff like flying cars and many more. Although its fiction, people keen to believe that these will happen eventually and will be possible. Since its already possible to make it with various technology and innovations, but just like others said its not yet necessary or needed at the moment.",

That might not be the topic but using it to make a point, I might as well borrow that to make a point of my own.Maybe not in your generation but, did you ever imagine that humans would fly in the air someday (using an aeroplane of course), fly with large cargos, that someone could talk to someone over millions of miles using frequencies frequencies signals on telephones?There are so many difficult to imagine innovations that have come to past and I think crypto is the least of it. The only difference between these innovations and cryptocurrency is the fact that, cryptos excludes the government in its operation by not being centralized. Even at that, we are still heading somewhere with it and it's sure to materialise with at least 2 countries to have adopted it for a legal tender. Good and sustainable things takes time to develop!",

Choose wisely.Yah, I know about the crypto part and the unrealistic roadmaps and purported but unachievable usecases some of them brandish in their White Papers. It's called building castles in the air, knowingly. However, on the flying cars stuff; that isn't unrealistic. I've seen a few documentaries on that. If people could make aeroplanes and spaceships, I don't see anything hindering them from making flying cars if the pros outweighs the cons. The negative impact could be what interested parties are looking at and not going ahead with it, and not because it's not possible.",
