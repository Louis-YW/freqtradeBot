You are better off putting 20% down and getting 5 homes instead of 1 paid off home and then getting a line of credit for maybe 65% of its value. This isn’t really much of a secret, most people know about this already. Homes can be used a collateral for mortgages or if there is equity they can be a line of credit to borrow money.",

That's completely legal and it is a way to game the system. Right now the banks in my country let me do this and I am getting rich because of it. Of course somebody else has to pay for it and they are those who couldn't get any loans from the banks. I doubled my wealth doing this last year and it worked. Thanks for the cheap money bitchezz",

Each person will have a method, a formula, a path to success, no one is the same and you cannot copy someone else's formula and vice versa. Don't try to find the formula to get rich, keep working creatively, the results will come to you. If you are looking for a faster path to success then I think investing is what you are looking for. I am not saying that investing will definitely make you rich but it may be the fastest way to success than others, but investing is risky, so be careful.",

(Sorry tax avoidance for any LEO reading this)What are your secrets?Hehe, are you in IRS, or FBI. You must be in some organizations. (hehe) or maybe not. Well, how can you expect someone share his/her secrets with you. Well, the world and this life has only one financial secret to earn money which is doing work. When you do work you earn money otherwise not.I hope this secret will be enough for you. Other than that, if you are earning low and wanted to manage your funds to increase the money in your savings then you have to live a disciplined life. like less or no parties, less wastage of money on unnecessary things, buying things in Bulk instead of daily basis. Always, prepare for birthday parties will tight budget because most money goes there too. Some might not agree with me but that's true. Most of the people spend hell lot of money which seems unnecessary to me. You, should not fall prey to any debt, gambling, or any types of alcohol. Because such things are only waste of money and will eat your life away. Find a companion who could live shoulder to shoulder with you and help you in every ups and downs of life.  I know you might not expecting such answers but this is my secrets and you should also avoid illegal or big risky works to be financial independent. Because money is not everything.",

(Sorry tax avoidance for any LEO reading this)What are your secrets?Why would anyone want to share their financial \"secrets\" with you? Sounds more like those \"scam\" books and videos where they convince people that a secret exists and then tries to sell them something. There is no \"secret\" in financial success. You need to work hard for it. You need to earn it. If it was very easy, wouldn't there be like lots and lots of billionaires? And you can't become successful by taking loans. Nor can you become one by avoiding taxes. Play clean, work hard, and you will see yourself there one day.",

I also saw the growth potential for money that was invested in Bitcoin.... \"Buy Low & Sell high\" ...rinse and repeat that strategy and you beat any other investment option out there, when the Bitcoin price hits a new all-time-high price.",

Like my Relatives, Parents, Friends etc. Which is, if you have some money in your savings from which you could buy an iPhone 14 pro max and also with the same money you could start a business then. You should start a business.Because that business will give you experience and if that business runs up and made you quite good money then you can buy iPhone 14 pro max out of it too. But if that business didn't succeed then at least you will end up having some good experience of the market. But this pathway is for entrepreneur and for business minded people. Not for those who just wanted to make money and spend it on other stuffs which seems to be unnecessary. You should have a progressive and leading mindset. If not, then you should look for secrets like you are looking for. Like for shortcuts to become rich or at least making some money. I recently watched a video on TikTok that a smuggler was transferring 2.34 KG of Heroin to another country and got caught. And on investigation he said he was doing it for only 5000 euros. i mean really, for 5000 euros he risked his 5 or idk how many years in jail and that 5000 euros will be earned easily if he walks on the straight path not by following some secrets only in 2 or 4 months.",

Those who are in connection with the politicians whether they are local or national level, a business person or even common person could get up financial gains very easily. Imagine, you can have access to various systems and schemes that usually come our way while doing various businesses or any projects. With the time you can have insider information and have monetary gains easily.  This help in many ways to be honest. Various approvals that may restrict a business gets disappeared with such connection and makes it easier. So yeah this is one of the secrete that could help too.",

It may seem like I'm wasting time money on buying luxury goods here and there to look good and jump on the trend, but if you look at that side of the market you'll see just how much high end products can cost even if they are sold secondhand.

I always stay away from loans and debt and I focus on hardworking only, peace of mind is way better than anything in this life. My advice to someone like you is to start from somewhere, read some books, watch some videos and stay away from anything that won't give you money in return, like buying expensive things that don't matter.Save up some money and start a business, or learn a new skill that can bring in money and use the money to establish a business.",
