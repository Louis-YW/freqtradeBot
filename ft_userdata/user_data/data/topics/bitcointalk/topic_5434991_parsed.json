The tool in question is open-source and we can be sure that it hasn't been created to steal people's keys. So, it's not that anything you enter is recorded by the website owner. But since any online service and any online device is vulnerable to hacking, you should never use this tool online. If you use Iancoleman properly, it's safe. Using properly means downloading the source code and running it on an airgapped device.",

You never have to trust what you find running online.This being said, Ian Coleman's page also has, at its end, link for getting the files for offline usage. And if you get those, and use them offline, on a system with no persistence or which you'll wipe (not just delete) afterwards, then you're pretty much OK.And even so, if you are paranoid enough (which is not a bad thing) you'll read that the random used by such scripts may not be that good. And this may or may not be a problem. 99% of the cases it isn't.Is this the answer you were looking for?",

So don't do it!If you haven't done it yet: play around with Live Linux distributions. There are many, I used to recommend Knoppix but Tails is much more aiming at security and privacy. Download it, put it on a DVD, boot it, unplug your interent, don't add WiFi, and run IanColeman's site (or Bitaddress or anything else you need offline) from a USB stick. Turn it off when you're done, and all traces are gone from RAM (unless you tell it to, it won't save any data). If you still don't trust it, remove your hard drive first.",

So be aware! for me I'm gonna take my time to input my address manually than using that websites just to ensure that my wallet is secured from hacking because that's very common and no one can avoid it even in some trusted platforms..",

There is nothing stopping malware already on your device from altering what Ian Coleman will display, or saving anything you enter to file and transmitting it to an attacker next time you connect to the internet. At a bare minimum, you should use a live and amnesic OS such as Tails as Loyce has described above. Better still is to use it only on a permanently airgapped device which has been formatted and had a clean Linux OS installed.I would also note that in general using any website which relies on Javascript is a bad idea for generating entropy. Ian Coleman (airgapped!) is useful for exploring a pre-existing seed phrase, checking different derivation paths, etc., but I would never suggest using it (or any other website, even if airgapped) for generating a wallet.",

If most are not that techy, then does it mean more are prone of hacking for lacking of this security measurements. Or simply said that bitcoin and crpyto is just for techy people. Because if this is the case, then its one of the reasons why most people use exchange and other regulated user-friendly platform instead than learning the technicals.",

As I mentioned above, I think using websites for anything like this is a bad idea from the start, even if you are following all these precautions. Most users should download (and verify) a good software wallet such as Core or Electrum for small amounts, and get a good hardware wallet for larger amounts. If you know what you are doing then airgapped cold storage is even better, but I don't recommend this for non-technical users and I certainly wouldn't recommend generating cold storage from any website.But as OP was asking, if you want to use Ian Coleman, then on an airgapped machine with a clean OS is the only safe way to use it.",
