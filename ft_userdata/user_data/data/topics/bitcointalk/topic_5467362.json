  "content": "A lot of apps now exist with preference for users from beginner or pro features to rewards/bonuses. Like music apps, chat apps, gaming apps, gambling apps, graphics and photo design apps. The designs and services is different from creation or same for those offering similar service  with only slight adaptations, like the boom player and Spotify music apps which serve same purpose, but with different designs adapted to suit a users device and preference.The thing now is this, upon using any one of these recent apps, a time always come when the most interesting features get restricted to only premium subscription users.  Where no subscription is made, the user is limited in the use of the app and is bombarded with lots of advert pop ups.Am curious to know, is there some notable app(s) created for whatever purposes which has a premium subscription payment plan for any of its package and accepts or allows crypto or BTC payments for the package?",

      "body": "Hmm, not familiar with many of such applications but I do remember that one of the most used and famous services provided by the Internet Download Manager in my region for which I'm familiar from a reasonable timespan, IDM offers its subscription purchase through the BTC. For more, I think in almost all digital-casinos BTC is accepted as a payment mode.Moreover, I'm familiar with a couple of third-party services that provide OTT platform subscriptions in the BTC, also a couple of VPNs (Nord, Ghost) also do offer their subscription to be paid with BTC. Even though now here the third-party premium tools providers as well accept BTC. Its really not concerning nowadays. When a big fish is handy in the game then it might gain some hype for the rest of the application I think it really doesn't matter if they allow BTC as their payment mode not. In social media apps to provide their services, they need to follow the policies of the state/government. Just imagine in the gaming industry GTA-6 officially recognizing the BTC and their game premium currency for special events.",

The reason is that most of the applications are available on either Google PlayStore or Apple AppStore and both of those don't really accept Bitcoin payments. The only best way to avail the premium features of those applications with the help of BTC payments is to purchase Apple gift cards or Google Play gift cards with the help of Bitcoin payments. That's the best way to unlock those premium features with the help of Bitcoin payments.",

Buying it with btc added an extra level of privacy as i even bought that btc with cash and that vpn service didn't give up anyone's identity, they didn't even collect ips. So it would have been very hard to track me with that setting. Not that i would even need that layer of privacy, but i wanted to hide my id from everyone it as a principle.",

What if we all start hitting up app developers whenever we fancy upgrading to their premium versions and ask them to accept Bitcoin payments? Maybe this has to do with the Play Store policy. They also need to set up a payment processor which can add more fees, and even if they decide to use open-source software they still need to weigh the cost and time to do that. I do use stores that accept crypto, although most of them are marketplace and not an app. Some games that are not listed on the Play Store also accept crypto. Based on this I believe the key reason why not all apps accept BTC or crypto is simply because the profit is not that much for them, hence why there is no incentive to do so. CMIIW.",

If developers get a bunch of Bitcoin requests, they might consider adding it as a payment option, making it more accessible to users. Worth a shot, right?It makes reasonable sense to be able to call up a developer when we intend to upgrade to our premium versions, but it's not like their contact details or portfolio is  advertised everywhere. Had it been there is a dedicated channel or company which have developers who attend to issues that can arise from premium subscription using btc or cryptocurrency payments, it would have been genius. Unless they are easily available then I can only imagine.It would be a nice development to see BTC payment options available for premium subscription other than the old method of credit cards or PayPal account being used as payment processors.",

If you are trying to subscribe on some analytical service with a high chance it would accept crypto payments. Even if the service itself is fully about traditional markets.However, It is always better for services to have a client's card tight to his account and have all bills paid automatically rather than waiting till the client sends you his crypto.",

They lure people in with cool features, but just as you're getting used to them, they change the rules and make you pay or deal with a lot of ads. They make money off of our FOMOWhat you really want to know is how apps that accept cryptocurrency work. A lot of sites now accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since they have become more popular. One company that lets you put Bitcoin into your Microsoft account is Microsoft. Even though this isnt an app itself, it shows that big companies are taking cryptocurrency. Services like ExpressVPN and NordVPN accept Bitcoin payments. VPNs arent exactly fun music or game apps, but they do work with Bitcoin.But the mainstream app business has been slow to adopt cryptocurrency because it is volatile and there are problems with how it is regulated. But as the world changes slowly, you can expect more apps to follow suit.",

I don't think OP is referring to a service like Bitrefill. Judging from how he asks if there is any app that offers a subscription with BTC, OP is looking for a service like Spotify that accepts BTC. I do agree that he probably needs to expand his target if he wants to spend or use his BTC.VPN service by nature is quite friendly with crypto since using fiat can expose the user info (which is probably a negative thing for most of their customers). While other services are starting to accept BTC, most of them also require KYC aggressively.",
