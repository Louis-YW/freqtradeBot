  "content": "This is the most bullish and many Bitcoin trader believer is relying on this chart for there personal belief. Now that its on verge of destroying the long time pattern, What so you think will gonna happened on Bitcoin price once this extreme bearish signal finally confirmed. Even pandemic didn’t make it to destroy this pattern before. We might see another lows in case this pattern becomes invalid since many traders is looking on this and holding on for a long time as TA is a self fulfilling prophecy.Keep safe and I hope it will bounce.",

Most investors will jump right into the exchange to buy more BTC at this price. This price of BTC is too attractive to resist and if you really think it's going to touch 10k then still you should start DCA right now. Who knows may be you will not be able to buy at that dip when it comes.",

As you said, it can be classified as a self-fulfilling prophecy so it can be unreliable since it depends on the averages of the past prices. Still a good thing to use if you believe in BTC though, as long as you don't bet everything on it.",

DCA will allow buyers to earn more bitcoin if the price drops lower, but I would not fully believe that bitcoin will hit another low around $10K. We should expect the market to recover for some time to come despite the belief that there will be another dip next year.That rainbow chart has been broken, and I can't really tell what will happen next. The price is feared to go down, but for whatever it is, I think now is the time to invest. DCA will be important if people believe that prices will down further, but it can't hurt to invest everything now.",

If we do really tend to look at and analyze that Bitcoin rainbow indicator then it didnt really been able to have a breakout eversince but the recent one is really going off into the line which is somethingthat we cant really be able to determine whether it could hold or would be totally breaking that point!. There's no way that someone could make out some conclusion but i cant really blame out into those peoplewho do really believe that this is already the bottom but its not 100% precise and dont make yourself too optimistic but considering about entry or buybackthen the current price isnt really a bad number for you to get in.",

Personally, I have never trusted the Rainbow indicator. I mean, someone can draw it from many different angles and curvatures to fit the narrative of the Bitcoin price trend over time.That is very correct, anyone can make a different rainbow indicator and so the angles or curvatures may vary from one person to another.As this market is still unpredictable despite of over a decade of existence, we can't tell what will happen next. This rainbow indicator for me is also very subjective, we can't treat it as the ultimate indicator per se in deducing some conclusions.Consider other indicators as well in forming some conclusions. Anyway, these conclusions are just merely conclusions, it may or may not happen in the real scenario.",

You don't have to be a Bitcoin programmers, an outstanding technical analyst to believe in Bitcoin. By reading more about global economic problems especially inflation created by governments, and reading Bitcoin's Whitepaper and its Controlled supply, your belief should be enough to start.If you are still wondering about Bitcoin and have yet believed in it, read The bullish case for Bitcoin",

I’m not a believer of this chart too but since I always seeing this picture on every Bitcoin post on my wall, I start to believe that many traders is checking on it as basis for the Bitcoin future movement.Breaking the pattern after many years of being accurate is really alarming especially on the current times when the market is experiencing uncertainty due to the recent shit event. I will view this as warning but not a financial advice. It’s still good that we do safety precautions while we still have time.",

I think there is also a case of criticism toward this indicator since it uses an old model and as mentioned by someone above, a curve-fitting method. I think someone also meme'd this to death saying the next rainbow is going to 0$, like what you've seen in everyday fud while we are in bear market. In fact, there has been a new rainbow chart released recently. Don't know how reliable this will be either, especially if the dev keeps changing it when the price movement changes.",
