I sympathize with Ukraine's effort to regain control of their country, but this isn't going to help them. Be careful how you advertise that thing. If you haven't noticed, you are already ruining your account by doing it outside of the altcoin boards.

Also, the silver-colored avatar belongs to Pmalek (I don't want forum users to get confused on this).If you're really interested... you can write to n0nce and he'll do a custom shade for you (I think he's okay with it).",
