If you save three seed phrases and don't save any of master public keys, you will need all three seed phrases for making any transaction from your wallet and as mentioned by LoyceV, your wallet would be like a 3 of 3 multi-signature wallet. You should save master public keys too, so that you can be able to spend fund even if you lose one of the seed phrases. Assuming you have seed phrases A, B and C, for generating your 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet and spending fund from that, you need:Seed A, Seed B, MPK Cor Seed B, Seed C, MPK Aor Seed A, Seed C, MPK B(MPK = master public key)",

Even if he lose the Public Key [all of them], still he is safe. With individual seeds when you try to restore the wallet the first Master Public key will be it's own Public key. This way you can collect all three public key and restore the wallet.",

You should keep the master public keys too.If you have a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet and you have two of seed phrases and nothing else, you won't be able to restore your wallet. As I said in my previous post, if you have seed phrases A and B, you will need the master public key that is derived from the seed phrase C too.",

With a watch only wallet they can not move the coin so you are safe.You are correct in saying all the master public keys only allow the creation of watch only wallet which cannot spend your coins, but such a wallet also completely compromises your privacy and makes you a target for the attacker who was able to compromise your master public keys to now attempt to compromise your seed phrases.Quote from: unknowncustomer on May 04, 2023, 07:34:34 PMI can write the 3 seeds on a paper with a pen but what about the pub keys Too many characters and a huge risk of mistyping.You have three options, ranked in order of security from best to worst:1) Write them by hand carefully, double check your work, and then test that you can recreate the wallet from what you have written. If you can, then you can rest assured you have not made any mistakes.2) Print them using a dumb printer.3) Save them electronically.",

The seed phrase can generate the master public key. I did not understand the question correctly before. But according to what o_e_l_e_o posted, I understand that unknowncustomer wants to create multisig wallet offline. Never mind that I did not understand it that way before because that is not even the purpose of the creation of multisig wallet.I will just prefer to make it simple for myself and create a standard wallet with just one seed phrase instead and I can use passhrase to extend the word. Having two more seed phrase backup in different locations instead.The purpose of multisig wallet is for someone having more than one devices, or like an organization that set it up for the purpose of paying. Why should multisig wallet should be offline when its online safety is very high because of the multiple private keys on different devices.If seeing it that a seed phrase can be lost, also the master public key can be lost either and the coins would be lost forever.But if having three devices, like a laptop and two phones, it is an encouragement to setup 2-of-3 multisig wallet after knowing how to protect yourself from hackers and protecting your three devices. If you lose one seed phrase, you can setup another 2-of-3 multisig wallet and move your coins their immediately.If you do not want to let your private key to be created online, there is nothing bad to get yourself a reputed open source hardware wallet and use it to setup the multisig wallet instead of creating a paper multisig wallet. Better to do it in a way that if you lose one seed phrase backup, you will still be able to setup another multisig wallet and move your coins there.",

The seed phrase can generate the master public key.Yes, but doing so is pointless. If you are going to create or restore the wallet only using seed phrases, then why have a multi-sig wallet at all? The whole point of a multi-sig is to remove the single point of failure. Each wallet should only be created or restored using a single seed phrase, and the master public key from all the other shares, so that any single wallet is insufficient to spend the coins. If you are going to create or restore your multi-sig by putting all three seed phrases in to the same device, then all you have achieved with your multi-sig is increasing the size of your transactions and the fee you have to pay.Each seed phrase should never leave the device on which it was generated, other than to be written down by hand as a back up. The only thing which should be transferred between devices are the master public keys.",

A 2-of-3 wallet allows you to lose one seed phrase and still be able to recover your wallet, provided you have all three master public keys. If you don't save the master public keys, then you need all three seed phrases in order to recover the wallet, even if the wallet itself is 2-of-3.You should absolutely back up your master public keys alongside your seed phrases. Without a copy of your master public keys, then you need to recover every single one of your seed phrases, which defeats the point of having a threshold number of signers.",
