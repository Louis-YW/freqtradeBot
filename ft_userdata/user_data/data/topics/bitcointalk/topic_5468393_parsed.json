There is no website, no discord, on Github all the “sources” are in zip archives. The SC ticker is already occupied by someone else's coin Siacoin. It all looks very strange.@miningrelease",

I have not invested in projects that pre-mine and then list them and dump them on the public. If you want to do a project, if someone is harmed due to a mistake you made or an attack, the project developer must cover that damage. It must provide confidence to investors. If you try to develop the project, that community will provide the necessary support for you to develop some projects in time. There are a couple of projects in this Ghostrider algo that work well, but unfortunately the developers have the mentality of open the network, list it and throw it away, which prevents the development of these projects. It loses its functionality and becomes history. Of course, the person who develops the project will make money after all, but he will leave this financial expansion to the community and the rest will come. This is what we want to say.",

Did you develop your POOL from scratch?Lol, so you decided to fuck up all the miners who rented rigs and make them lose money by resetting the chain (you did not even announce that you resetting the chain) because you are an incompetent dev who doesn't test his own code before launching(even now at block 1200 you have 0.01 reward). This proves that you're not trusted, and second, why the hell do you make another coin if you already have TaiChiCoin, go and develop on that chain you stupid, oh, you need some more money.P.S: My pool is not a coin, when there is a problem with my pool I pay the miners from my own pocket \"I don't reset the 'chain' \"",
