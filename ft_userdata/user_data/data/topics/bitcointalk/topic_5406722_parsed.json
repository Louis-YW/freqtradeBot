  "content": "This is not a discussion thread. The thread serves for detailed reference of the feedback to yahoo. Hence, it's locked.1. Slandering. He claims - I decided to be a big asshole to anyone who had questioned on bitlucy ANNQuote from: yahoo62278 on July 17, 2022, 04:35:04 PMRoyse had claimed to be a partner and the site had some questionable issues pop up. Rather then answer users with a cool head, Royse had claimed to be a partner and the site had some questionable issues pop up. Rather then answer users with a cool head, Royse decided to be a big asshole to anyone who had questioned them. Same as this mixing service if ya ask me, just plain unprofessional. I made 54 (+/-1) response to the ANN thread which had over 38 pages of conversation log.Troll like bislom, Betesports and few others were hurting their best from the beginning. After 17 pages: - I had a response for a case which needed to be responded (1, 2). There are no sign of I was being an asshole in the response. I was providing a solution.- Explaining the situation to a user (3). Again with a good manner.- Reply of an argument with providing solution again (4).- Announced the termination of bitcointalk with bitlucy and highlighted the google form to get better visibility for it (6).- It does not look like cool head is absent (7).8 pages of response and I made 5 posts on the  1st reputation thread before I created my own thread (call it 2nd reputation thread) to give the brief of the story.- I wanted to make a point of the users that they had problems with other casinos too, it's nothing new etc before I was providing them a solution (8). Nowhere I was being asshole to response.- Posting an update for a concerned user with an apology (9).- Maybe I sound a bit of asshole when I said I don't need to prove myself to others too but it's no near than yahoo's claim of being big asshole to anyone. I was polite enough to express how I was feeling (10).I became an asshole (11) to Yahoo and JollyGood (5*20) + (7*20 + 6) + (38*20 + 11) posts. They were crossing the line with their bullshit arguments for example the lamest one is demanding the chats to be in public. I know what I did and how I did. Only saying word seems unfair so I found it's best to spend enough time to collect reference. Yahoo's claim of me being a big asshole to anyone (indicating to ANN thread and probably on the 1st reputation thread) is completely lie.Yahoo's intention is clear that he is slandering.2. Wants to exchange the negative feedbackQuoteThen Royse opens the thread explaining their side. If you bothered to read the thread, I was very empathetic and was supporting them at 1st. Then, Royse decided instead of answering a few questions and trying to clear up my concerns, to attack me and basically say I was stealing their business. I'm sorry but that company contacted me, I didn't contact them. If ya act like a baby, i'll treat ya like 1. Royse fucked up and instead of handling the heat, they decided to make it personal. If they wanna act that way then I have no more use for the situation. Maybe an apology from Royse should happen.The red tag was left few minutes before or after the comment from him but 100% after the response I had for him.Quote from: yahoo62278 on July 03, 2022, 03:25:04 PMI will not respond here again, it looks like you just want to get smug with me. Good luck with your ventures on the forum, make better decisions!!!!Trust feedback are not exchangeable to benefit ones own interest like keeping hostage for some demand or in exchange for money.Yahoo wants to exchange the red tag for the apology he is demanding now.",
