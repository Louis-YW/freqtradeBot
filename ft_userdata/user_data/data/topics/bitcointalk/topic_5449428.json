Whitepaper, plagiarized, is indeed a major determining factor, but it is not the only factor that we just have to look at it to determine. In a sense that just because a project's whitepaper is free from plagiarism it doesn't instantly translates as the project is legit. I've meet many project with no traces of plagiarism but the project is still questionable. For instance, there was this project that propose to pool funds to buy company shares --in India, if I have to be specific-- from an \"experienced\" trader in US. Their whitepaper is well written, the profile matched my background check, but upon further investigation, that CEO doesn't even have an in-depth knowledge of regulations in India --that's readily available on simple internet search-- that made his proposal rather obsolete. They're never to be seen and heard on this forum anymore after I exposed this fact.",

Jones who \"replied\", asking people to verify through him.

I'm not a scammer and don't enjoy seeing other people being scammed. In fact, I'm a big proponent of transparency and accountability - so your accusations are unfounded and unprofessional.The notion that you worked hard on a project for two years does not necessarily mean that it can't be a scam. The whitepaper is a crucial component of any project, and if it contains plagiarized content or misleading information, it raises red flags. While I can understand that not all developers are proficient in writing whitepapers, it is still their responsibility to ensure that the content is accurate and not plagiarized. It's not just about the wording in the whitepaper. It's about the overall quality of the project, and how it stands out from other projects in its niche. It is not uncommon for scammers to hire writers on freelance websites to create their white papers. This means that even if your company hired someone else to write your whitepaper, you still have some responsibility for ensuring that it doesn't steal content, ideas or solutions from other projects. How would you feel if someone stole your work, which took years to complete, and passed it off as their own? Would you consider such a project to be a scam?As for your request for better research, I can assure you that my research was thorough and accurate. As you can see from the OP, I have meticulously listed out the various sources from which the content was copied verbatim, and have provided a side-by-side comparison to clearly demonstrate my findings. If you feel that my research is flawed, please let me know where and how I should improve it. I will gladly review the content again and make any necessary changes.",
