Currently, the financial system of every country is fully centralized, aka controlled by government. If they opt for Bitcoin, then they have to sacrifice their control over the financial system.Of course, we can't say how the future will be, but right now, it looks very much difficult that governments will accept Bitcoin. Quote from: MusaPk on February 14, 2023, 05:27:19 PMIMO we must think wisely about when to invest and when to save. Like you pointed out that if you are student and not have solid financial background, in such case saving is the wise decision. Since you need cash to pay for your fee, accommodation and food charges. Once this phase is over and you have a job then one can start thinking of where to invest. Saving and investing both have own benefits but we have to think rationally about what to choose under given circumstances.Quote from: MusaPk on October 03, 2022, 03:39:59 AMThank you so much for including me in this list and giving me this honour. I am very happy to be part of Bitcointalk community. Quote from: WatChe on September 26, 2022, 03:32:50 AMThank you so much for timely payment. More can be added. I know that people have the right to create several accounts, but is it allowed to join different signature campaigns using alt account? or Appling using more than one account?",

You cannot join the same sig campaign that you already have an account in. I would also be bold enough to say that applying to the same sig campaign with multiple accounts should be forbidden, but not all managers may agree on that.",

Also you can't complain about their alts as you didn't directly grab their wallet connect.The alts don't verify how they transferred their signature campaign promotion payments.I went to their local board and noticed one thing that they used to post the signature campaign post on their Pakistan local language board. So it is important that all members of the community want to join the signature campaign at the same time. So their Proof of Authentication posts may have some similarities.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232519.msg61598893#msg61598893 | Bitcoin Mixer | Signature Campaign ~ Up to $100/week][banned mixer] | Bitcoin Mixer | Signature Campaign ~ Up to $100/weekhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232519.msg61638754#msg61638754SellDefi | Earn by selling files - Signature Campaign | Reward up to $75/wThe evidence you brought is not enough to prove alts.
