Now, my goal is to manage it better and avoid any unnecessary damage to my finances.I'm curious if any of you have faced a similar situation and if there are tools or methods you've found effective in controlling crypto gambling. It feels like most platforms lack daily limits or deposit controls, making it a bit challenging to stay on track.Would really appreciate any advice or recommendations from those who've been through something similar.",

      "body": "My man, in the end casinos won't completely exclude you from depositing and permanently ban your from the platforms, we all know that they benefit from the volume of users, so the more users, the better for them.If you want my personal opinion, the best thing you can do right know to help yourself to control the urge is to talk about it with your family and friends, people you can trust, so you can get support and help from them, if you keep your problems a secret you are more likely to relapse and even sign up on other online casinos to continue gambling. Another advice I could give you: Try to reduce your liquidity so it would be more difficult for you to gamble, for example, if you have an account in some exchange, try to keep your satoshis in a locked savings plan of 3-6 months. You can also convert your cash into precious metals and store them by your own. The point of it is to increase the steps you would need to fund your casino accounts.I hope any of the things I said helps your with your personal and spiritual struggle. Good luck ❤️",

Yes, it's going to be a challenge to stop our crypto gambling, and I don't know if there are tools to really help us. So the best thing is to really take control of ourselves not to gamble, simple as that. So it has to start from the gamblers themselves, so why not discover new activities to make your self physically and mentally busy so that you won't think of gambling?Or just enjoy you life mate, have your love ones always beside you and let them be the motivation for you to not gamble at all. Let to prioritized thing in your life, or maybe a yoga class will help you channel your energy and totally forget about gambling.",

Take a look at yourself and just find some ways to distract yourself from gambling so that it will help you to have your own manual method of self excluding yourself from them. And if it doesn't works, try to disable the casino websites on your devices but I guess that won't do the help because you might just able it again when you feel the urge that you want to gamble.Trick yourself by doing something else and hobbies that you haven't done before.",

Literally go for a serious hike to wear yourself out etc. work more hours might even be useful to reacquire some of the money lost, set yourself objectives in those positive tasks.",

There’s such tool like this that will help you avoid gambling rather than completely getaway on any form of online access that will lead you to gambling or put your money on a financial manager that will control your expenses. The best way to counter gambling addiction is when you don’t have accessible money whenever you have the urge because it’s very hard to avoid gambling especially when you are alone and you have all resources available to do it.Have a good social life and busy schedule to fill all your vacant time that you can use for gambling purposes. Relying tool that you are still the one in control on how setup is useless. You need someone to look out for you since addiction can’t be done by self control without a guidance by someone that doesn’t have any influence of gambling addiction.",
