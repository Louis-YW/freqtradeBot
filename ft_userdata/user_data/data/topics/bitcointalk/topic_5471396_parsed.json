A client program cannot expect HTTPS connections to nodes to be available on any basis, because there is a lack of such support in the Bitcoin Core client itself. Although there's a BIP I read somewhere that might allow the use of an alternate security protocol.",

I believe it has to do with the same reason we don't encrypt information with nodes' public keys in the Bitcoin network; it might be trivial to execute a man-in-the-middle attack. I found these two:- https://stackoverflow.com/q/12385240- https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/SbajPhgcdqkThe TL;DR as I see it, is that security tokens provide better levels of security and are easier to implement.",

You can't compare these when it comes to the security level but you have to see it from the use-case perspective.",

These things will not work because it would not be sure.WHY?RPC is slow and not really designed for it. Core is really not designed for it either.Think about how long it takes when you have to rescan the blockchain for something. And as you discovered, it's designed for single user desktop use more or less in terms of security.And if someone has access to the PC and can get to the bitcoin.conf file, you already have other security issues going on.-Dave",

There are many feature which geared towards developer for commercial service such as bitcoind, RPC-JSON, REST API and various tutorial/script provoded on Bitcoin Core on directory \"doc\" and \"contrib\".Not saying it does not. Or that it is not good software. And there are many things it does well.But if you are running a public service you should have something very robust with a ton of security between the internet and RPC commands to core.Core is the back end, there are a lot of things you can put in the front end to keep is isolated. Which was the original discussion, about RPC security.That was more or less what I was trying to say.Can you run a block explorer just with core? Yes, with some limitations but dumping everything to a database works better.Can you run a public web wallet for people with core? Yes, but it's going to be a logistical and security nightmare if you don't put a lot of other things between it and the internet. And there are just flat out better ways to do it and just talk to core when needed. -Dave",
