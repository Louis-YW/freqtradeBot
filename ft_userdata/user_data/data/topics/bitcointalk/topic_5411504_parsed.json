  "content": "Hi there!I made Cryptyles, a daily educational puzzle game about cryptocurrencies where your goal is to match coin logos and names.It runs directly in the browser, desktop and mobile, and is completely free to play.How the puzzles look like:https://i.imgur.com/cIAkyBu.pngThere is one puzzle per mode each day and it's the same for everyone.If you need help with a puzzle you can use hacks at the cost of energy, which is replenished daily or by winning games without hacks.After each game you will see game tips and crypto facts that explain terminology from the crypto space, so even if you lose you learn something new each time.While playing you will unlock more features such as new modes and discoveries that track the coins you discovered, your crypto knowledge and more.You will also accumulate ingame currency that you can spend on minimalistic crypto wallpapers like these:https://i.imgur.com/IyHlH0K.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/pZMhjSh.jpgThe game can be quite challenging, while it is more about deduction than knowing all the coins, you should set the difficulty to easy if you are new to crypto or don't know many altcoins.I appreciate any kind of feedback! The game is still in development and I intend to add more content over time.Good luck & have a nice sunday everyone!Edit: Can anybody tell me how to make the images show up embedded in the post rather than as a text link? Seems I'm too stupid to use forum software hah.",

      "body": "The idea looks nice:) It seems a little strange that you can't pass a level more than once in 8 hours, even if you messed up, because accidentally skip the hint and didn't understand the rules. Maybe it'll be a good idea to add training try?",

      "body": "Hey, thanks for the feedback!The idea of daily puzzles was popularized by Wordle and the New York Times games, probably not known by everyone, but I quite like the approach of playing a game in short bursts every day, that's why I designed Cryptyles like that. Puzzles reset every day at 0 UTC, but once all modes are unlocked there are 3-4 puzzles each day to play.I can imagine the game might be confusing if you skip the tutorial message hah, I'll try to think of something to not make it closable by accident. You can also click on Help/? at the top to view it again.The first mode is actually already the training mode, but in a future update this will be made more clear and easier (the whole game difficulty will be made a bit easier by default too).Thanks for giving it a try!",

Just checked the game it is very entertaining!  I thought I will recognize them all at once, but it was a little harder. Anyway it was fun! Great job!Yeah the game is definitely challenging. Even in the easy mode where the coin pool is limited to 200 or so top coins, there are a lot of coins that not many people know.The best advice I can give is to play this as a puzzle of logic and deduction (nobody knows all the coins), set the difficulty to easy on the home screen if needed and also use hacks when stuck on a difficult puzzle.In a future update I plan to make the game a little bit easier though.",
