I have been into this social app called MEEFF(recommended by a friend of mine), and some of the people there dislike the idea of bitcoin and crypto. So, I was wondering why, but didn't bother to ask them since it's their own preference, and so it cross into my mind that \"What does BTCitcoin needed in order to become a mainstream payment system? \"I know some of you would say improvements of Security, Scalability, and User Experience, but aside from that, What is the most needed for BTCitcoin right now?",

People who don't like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies because they obey the government, if the government doubts and bans bitcoin, those people will never learn about bitcoin. And I think the possibility of bitcoin becoming a mainstream payment method won't happen, governments won't let that happen.",

For Bitcoin to go mainstream, 100% of the people do not have to use it, it just needs to be easily accessible anywhere and available as a means of payment by merchants globally. There would still be preferences by people who prefer fiat, altcoins or some other means of transacting.Quote from: karmamiu on March 02, 2023, 07:05:30 AMI know some of you would say improvements of Security, Scalability, and User Experience, but aside from that, What is the most needed for BTCitcoin right now?Security and to an extent, user experience is not a problem with Bitcoin. As one of the most secure networks it only relies on the holder to use it the proper way and the user experience depends on the wallet you use to store you coins.Scalability is a work in progress and is one major barrier to adoption, along with volatility.",

But even if bitcoin was more stable, there is another ((much bigger)) problem and that is people, as dealing with bitcoin means that you take responsibility in your own hands, and that's something majority of  people don't like/want. They prefer sense of false security by giving someone else their money so in case they forget pin of their debit card, they can just go to their bank and get another one, while we know that you can't do that with bitcoin.After all, bitcoin doesn't even have to become mainstream payment option to be useful.",

That way, people will start seeing it as verifiable payment method, which will in turn make lot's of them wanting to know more about Bitcoin, this way it help to mediate whatever doubt they might have.",

And these banks are running way back like from start. It would not be an easy task to shift people from traditional banks to modern finance. All We and you can do is to spread awareness and before spreading awareness among your friends and relatives you should also know the basics. So that, you do not feel bad when they hit a question you do not know. I would like to suggest you some basic concepts that you might choose to start a conversation about btc or crypto among relatives and friends who are not familiar with the truth of digital finance. Start from, Blockchain and how does it work along with the uses of blockchainIf your audience is not a techy one, then teach them the working of Web 1 and Web 2 at least because they must have used these technologies. Web1 and Web2 must gave them the idea then move to the centralization and decentralization mechanism and ask them what could be the possible pros and cons of these system might beThen try to explain blockchain again, but now teach them the basic functioning too like how crypto uses blockchain for decentralization. How it provides you the full custody of your assets and how no other person could tamper with the information of yours in smart contract ( teach them about smart contract too)Once you tell them the basic. Move to use cases of block. i must say tell them the basic 5 use cases of blockchainThese applications of blockchain will open there eye and they could be able to predict the potential of btc and blockchain that it could have. Because once i am also run away from blockchain and BTC. WHY? Because i did not know these basic questions and one more thing i must include. I was not sure that this work is halal or haram, (These are terms related to my Religion Islam) I can interpret them for your understanding. Halal means Good and Haram means not good. That simple. So as a newbie i do not have the resources and do know where to look and what to look. So in 2018 i started cloud mining but left it. How i started that's a dumb question. because i only fall prey to scams. So i left it. after 2 years in 2020. One of my friend explains me the basics of blockchain and crypto he invested his time in me. he open zoom app and started to teach me free of cost. for that i am thankful. But ITs just a hint story for you. To get started and instead of ignoring there comments about thnigs that they do not know and you know that. Then i must say its your work to tell them the rights and wrongs so that they could meet up with the pace of technology.",

I do get your point coz personally the main reason for me  why it's never unachievable is because of its volatility. That reason alone is enough for people to be hesitant/against on using or implementing it as a mainstream payment system.",

It's not literally half, but according to data for 2023, even around 35% of the world's population does not have access to the internet at all, while it is questionable how many people have a permanent and high-quality connection to the internet. Many members of this forum from some African countries have exactly this problem, their internet actually depends on whether they have electricity, and this makes their activities much more difficult - although this is not something specific only to Africa.But even if we take the 2/3 who have access to the internet, looking at it as a whole, all researchers say that less than 5% of the world's population is in some way involved in cryptocurrencies, and of that number there are certainly many who have invested only in altcoins.When you draw a line under all that information, then your question cannot get any kind of positive answer, regardless of which aspect of the problem you are talking about (if the problem exists at all).",

People can only adopt something when they are fully aware of it although some might be skeptical about it but at the end they would see reasons why they need to adopt it. This is still applicable to bitcoin. What I basically know and see is that government policies strongly affect the bitcoin adoption in various nation's. Some people are yet to understand how bitcoin works not to talk of accepting it as a means of payment for services. We should know that bitcoin is volatile hence many people finds it difficult to accepting it because of the uncertainty and expectations of price fluctuations.",

Cryptos are new, and while some humans try to push the boundaries of what's possible for humanity by inventing something new or going somewhere new, there's also this totally natural reaction to new as dangerous, threatening. It challenges the status quo, and many feel like if status quo is fine for them, they shouldn't endorse those things that try challenging it. As for what Bitcoin needs, I think it's secured enough as it is, it will need more scalability one way or another for an increase of its adoption as a form of payment, and user-friendly interfaces similar to online banking wouldn't hurt either. Another this it lack is, despite everything, more awareness of what Bitcoin is and isn't, how it works and how it's different from stocks and from fiat alike.",
