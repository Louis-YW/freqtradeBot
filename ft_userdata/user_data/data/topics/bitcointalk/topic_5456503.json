And we all know that most of the tourist visitors don't bring cash with them, for security reasons, so they have their credit cards to used and pay. But bitcoin payment could be another great options as well as it was designed to be a payment scheme by Satoshi himself.However, it seems that Bangladesh government is very strict as far as crypto goes and they totally put a blanket ban on your country. So it might take some time for them to legalized and the chances are slim, in my opinion.",

But my dreams will remain dreams because Bitcoin will never be legalized by the government in my country.Your intentions are good because accepting Bitcoin in your proposed business will attract more crypto-friendly tourists and also make more people know about Bitcoin. I also perceive that you are still a student. My advice is that you should focus on your studies for now but don't give up your dream of starting the business. You have to also note that running a business and education both needs attention and dedication which is why you need to finish your studies first before starting the business except you have competent hands that can manage it in your absence.QuoteBut my dreams will remain dreams because Bitcoin will never be legalized by the government in my country.Bitcoin is banned in your country not because the majority of the people in Bangladesh dislike it. If you carry out a poll or research the people's views on the use of Bitcoin, I guess many people will want the country to legalize cryptocurrency because of the decline of the value of the Bangladeshi taka. But the government which is made up of a few people feels cryptocurrencies are bad for the economy. Maybe the next set of political leaders might have different views about Bitcoin and legalize it. You don't have to lose hope because nothing is impossible.",

My father has organized a food hotel next to that sightseeing spot. I sometimes spend some time in that hotel between studies.In my view, Why this is still happening there because the Government there still sees the volatile nature of the market where Bitcoin and potential speculative bubbles raise concerns about the impact on the economy and its value is not controlled or influenced by any central authority. This lack of control may make governments hesitant to legalize it, as they may prefer to retain control over their national currencies and monetary policies.On the other hand, governments also have a responsibility to maintain financial stability in their countries because governments may prefer to focus on traditional financial systems to ensure stability and protect the interests of their citizens.Quote from: 2Pizza410000BTC on June 16, 2023, 02:01:22 AM I've been nursing a dream for as long as I've been on Bitcoin forums.

But my dreams will remain dreams because Bitcoin will never be legalized by the government in my country.However, I believe that perception will change over time and there will be an increased desire by governments to explore the potential of cryo-currencies taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that allow the use of legal cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I myself am optimistic about that because every country and government like Bangladesh has competent economists who can see and pay attention that this landscape continues to evolve over time. If that comes true your dream of using Bitcoin for your pizzeria you will come true.",
