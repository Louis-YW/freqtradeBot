  "content": "We are fans of different football clubs, and whenever there is football banter, we never fail to take sides with our respective clubs. We stand by them no matter what because that's what being a fan of a football club is all about - unwavering loyalty. However, not all of our favorite clubs perform well. A typical case study is Chelsea, who have had one of their worst performances this season, currently occupying the 11th position. The challenges they have faced this season are unlike any other. Just last night, they were brutally defeated by Manchester United, who showed them no mercy, to the extent that they didn't even celebrate one of their goals. As a gambler and a die-hard fan of a club that has been having a terrible season, would you bet against your club, knowing that their loss would be your financial gain? Or would you stay loyal and not bet against them?",

I also not bet every match, only few match which I think worth to bet, if there's no worthy bet, I wouldn't place any bet. But I would choose to watch my favorite team rather than other match I had bet, usually I only watch the replay on the other matches. If someone favorite team is Nottingham Forrest, they already suffer huge loss if he keep bet their favorite team",

In other occasions I prefer to bet a symbolic amount, something like 2 to 5 dollars just to bet and have the emotion of watching the game worthing a few bucksBut I don't remember in the recent past having bet against my team (if I had, I would have already won a good amount this year  )",

I am not even of a particular fan in sport, info for strong ones and nothing attached. Example, I supported Arsenal this season, but that does not mean that I will not support another club next season to win EPL. I supported Manchester City last season. When Manchester City and Arsenal was playing their second leg, wouldn't it be stupid if I go for Arsenal? It would be stupidity. There are some seasons that I do not go for any club at all.",

Or would you stay loyal and not bet against them?Two different versions of FANATICAL and CLUB, these two things are born in the bodies of fans/lovers of sports clubs especially football etc., now we talk about betting against or challenging our own club, there are usually two understandings to my knowledge for such a problem.1. Gambling Some gamblers don't care and don't stick to the club they love, they see more of a club that has the potential to win, even if the club that is competing is their own favorite club. it's called professional gambling, they understand different problem clubs and gambling.2. Fanatics, this is worse, most of them when gambling loses or wins, potentially or not, they stick to their stance/support for the club they love. We often see this option, if you lose a bet because your favorite club loses, anarchy and riots ensue.Conclusion: for me personally, even though there is my favorite club, but for gambling I prefer and consider a club with a chance of winning, I put aside my favorite club, gamble money at stake not fanatics, that's my principle.",

I will buy fan tokens or watch the game live to show my support for my favorite team not through placing bets on it while I know exactly that they are inferior on the enemy team.I always use my data analysis on my favorite team to bet in my favour whether it's with them or against them. We can't do anything if our favorite team sucks this season and the only way to enjoy watching their match despite they have a rough season is to bet against them so that you can still be happy no matter what the result is.The Team Lose = Happy because your bet wonThe Team Win = Happy because your team won",

But if the discussion is about making money, for a gambler they side who would likely win and they just have to look at which one has the advantage. The reality is that a club also lose fans whenever they constantly lose. We're attracted to winners.",

As a gambler and a die-hard fan of a club that has been having a terrible season, would you bet against your club, knowing that their loss would be your financial gain? Or would you stay loyal and not bet against them?I have a slightly different opinion and attitude towards football and football clubs, because I don't consider myself a fan of one single team. I root for one or the other, depending on the current opponents, positions in the standings and just some moments, such as the team's perseverance and desire to win. I am pleased to watch the football process itself and enjoy the spectacle. Therefore, my answer to your question will be peculiar.I would lightly bet against a team I sympathize with for financial gain. And that's why. Any bet is always aimed at making a profit, not a loss. There is no place for sentimentality, favorite teams and other nonsense in any bet. Only cold calculation works here: I bet money - I want to win. If I saw that I could break a good jackpot by betting against my favorite team, I would not hesitate to do it, ignoring all my emotional experiences.Betting should not be mixed with club loyalty to avoid conflicts of interest. If all the same mixed, then act for the purpose of obtaining benefits, ignoring sentiment.",

I support real madrid but when it comes to placing sports bets I have to be people who know how to separate feelings because I analyze the data of the two teams, for example I had to analyze which of the two teams has the best squad, clearly that the answer is manchester city, which of the two teams has the better defense and attack, clearly it is manchester city, so the deeper I got into data collection the greater my inclination was to bet on manchester city, and it does not mean that I would be against real madrid, that's not it.my intention when I place a bet is to make a profit, of course, one should not think that  Gambling are things to obtain profits, it is nothing like that, but whenever I have the intention of placing a bet on a game I analyze the game with the the objective of making a profit, there is nothing to put feelings on, but when it is a game in which I will not place a bet, then I keep watching and supporting the team of which I am a fan, by that I mean that it is necessary to know how to separate things, one should not bet in any emotion-based team, this is the worst mistake of all, as soon as the person does this he is doomed to lose everything in the short and long term",
