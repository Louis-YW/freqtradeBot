And yes they tagged me as well that time, but they removed it after they figured it out why i fell on that scam wallet because i have a lot of proofs that time.. But really we are now in 2022 and you bring me up again? Sorry i was new in space that time that's why it happened.   But try to check my history OP before tagging please.Edit: here's the link to prove you that i was in the red tagged way back 2017 because of that wallet but it's already solved.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1702409.msg22107721#msg22107721I have considered it and I have also studied it before I made this report. If previously you were involved in problems with these 5 accounts [masterwakokok7, addy4u, Ararbermas, geniabelty and markowpowlow] but now your problem is different.Now 4 accounts [Ararbermas, Mhedz, MoneyIsDebt, YOYOY] using the same address [0xad3df2892d663ba5167d891ccbc0668aa94338e2], not this [0xf902aa3a62f9e28878129e1a8f1eb71e4fd7a88c].So, can you explain why the 4 accounts use the same address?Code:0xad3df2892d663ba5167d891ccbc0668aa94338e2",

You can't link accounts based on an address they post, anyone can post an address I've posted, but that doesn't mean they're my alts.Well, that's true, but you can't really expect us to have signed messages from the same address from a bunch of bounty abusers. After all, posting the same address and/or the same social media profiles in bounty campaigns has mostly been enough evidence for finding alt accounts and busting bounty abusers in the \"Known Alts...\" thread for years. There are always exceptions, of course, like this one. But I think that's rare.Here's another point of view:Quote from: Xal0lex on January 23, 2022, 07:36:04 PMIt's simple. If two or more accounts have the same information (cryptocurrency addresses, email, twitter, telegram, etc.), the banned account is checked first for matching information. If the banned account has the above information mentioned later than the non-banned accounts, then ban evasion is not considered. This is done to avoid mistakes.As I understand it, the moderators consider that using a matching element (in this case an ETH address) is enough evidence to prove ban evading (depending on who posted first).Quote from: LoyceV on August 08, 2022, 06:24:52 PMA better solution is to only use solid evidence when linking accounts.I agree. There is no doubt that it is better to have a solid evidence or more than one piece of evidence that complement each other. That's why I always like to use matching elements in posts as a basis for deeper analysis (registration date, forum activity, token transactions, etc.) before making a decision. I don't recall ever having a false positive, and in case that ever happens, I will always re-examine all the evidence. Your and Tryninja's tools are a huge help and I agree that the posts in the archives should remain as they are, as true to the original as possible.",

You can't link accounts based on an address they post, anyone can post an address I've posted, but that doesn't mean they're my alts.A huge number of users have been banned based on this principle. And not once have I come across any complaints about it. In any case, I have not seen any serious complaints. The thing is that no one will check whether the address was published on purpose or the address really belongs to the alts. This is practically unrealistic. But if after the ban the user will write a rebuttal in Meta, then the moderators will consider this case. But then again, it is almost impossible to prove.Again, if someone publishes your address, it will be after you have published it. In any case, the publication of your address from someone else will be later than yours.And anyway, what's the point of publishing someone else's address? The user will be playing against himself. After all, his post will be published later anyway, which means he will be banned in the first place.Quote from: LoyceV on August 08, 2022, 06:24:52 PMHere's theymos' address: 1NXYoJ5xU91Jp83XfVMHwwTUyZFK64BoAD  That doesn't make me theymos!No one is talking about that kind of thing. Matching elements from the profile as proof of a connection between accounts is not considered, IMHO. Matched items should be placed exactly in forum posts.P.S. Well, if someone dares to publish your address without your knowledge, the global moderators will surely ban you",

It got them connected because they posted the same address, but since the wallet was confirmed as a fraud wallet, then I think we have found the endpoint to solve this case.Regarding the advice to delete the wallet on your archive site, again I do not insist. You have the right to keep it as complete and accurate as possible.So now, I have removed the negative tag on the above 4 accounts and the problem is solved. So I will close this thread and Ararbermas can use this thread as a reference for the future.",
