Furthermore,  his advice is exactly what he is doing some is walking the talk and not those who propound theories they don't follow. Finally, if Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will reach $1 million,  I will no doubt because there are multiple indications that it will happen. So I will encourage everyone to invest their spared money wisely just like MicroStrategy is doing... follow the whales.",

Sure. Does he know things we don't know? Probably. But I don't think it's anything of significance or that would influence his decisions... After all, the guy has been buying for years now.So when he says he's not going to sell, I kind of trust his words... but then you never know if he can ever be forced to do so since the money is not from his own pocket.

He understands that bitcoin is the new generation asset which the value is still increasing due to its limited supply and decentralized nature. He is an economist and understands that due to bitcoin potentials and trust on the project, more people will continue to adopt bitcoin for the safety of their future, since fiat is getting weak.",

But I am not worried because on the one hand those of us who own MSTR shares know that the company's success lies in buying bitcoin and never selling it, and we are not going shoot ourselves in the foot. And on the other hand many large companies are controlled with much less than 50% of the voting power.",

Even the US president elect Donald Trump made similar statements about Bitcoin a a video clips a watched recently, he said never sell your Bitcoin, so Michael Saylor is building on that path and I think this is the highest financial advise the can give to their followers, and sure this guy's will be buying Bitcoin at whatever price same with you and me, Bitcoin at $100kBTC is still very cheap, and only those who do not have the spare money to put away into Bitcoin will see Bitcoin price to be very expensive.But in the future when there is a lot of cash flow and excess cash, we can comfortably put $1 million on Bitcoin without looking back or thinking twice, the joy then is that we have the money to keep stocking up more Bitcoins regardless of the price, Saylor is someone who have been bullish on Bitcoin for all his life so I am not surprised by this statement, On the selling of his Bitcoin starch, I think that one will be story for another day since that decision rely solely on him and the condition that could push him into considering selling some of his Bitcoin at anytime.",

It can also mean that we should buy more and hold so that he can have more profit or there will be enough liquidity for him to take profit properly.We can’t denied that big player like Saylor will soon turn like Elon Musk that sell off his holdings once he have opportunity to do it because they are here to make profit not to pure hold.I doubt he will take profit in bulk but I doubt either that he will keep on purchasing without considering on taking profit.",

It's good to see him and his company with very strong belief in Bitcoin, like \"Bitcoin is the end game\" and their diamond hands to buy and hold bitcoins.For us, it's up to us for consideration of our own financial conditions with which we will have to make our financial plans, investment plans that can be different than Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy. We can invest our money in bitcoin, do DCA too, but we will come to time of taking profit in future. Because we are not rich like them, and we will have to need money to use in future.If you are rich already, you can invest similarly to Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy.",

I mean though, even for average investors like the rest of us, Bitcoin could really go and pump the price.Now if we look at what the future lies ahead, $500k is definitely our next target. It could be in the next halving or in the next, but if you got to that price, obviously, we will made a lot of profits.So for  this bull run, others may sell, but for diamond hands like Michael Saylor, it might not the best time to sell but to continue to accumulate.",

It does not harm MicroStrategy and its model if Bitcoin just have a bear market like past cycles, but if Bitcoin break its bullish year trend since 2009 and start several years of bear market, this model will be broken.As an Bitcoin investor, I don't want that super bearish scenario to appear, and maybe Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy did not believe such terrible scenario will appear too.",
