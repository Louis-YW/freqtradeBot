  "content": "Hello, I am trying to transfer my few coins from coinomi to coinbase. I transferred the coins before but the transaction stayed as pending, maybe because of low gas. Now I am trying again but I just get the error mentioned on the title. I tried to cancel the pending transfer by sending myself 0 coins with the same nonce but I still get the same code.Any ideas on what is happening or how to fix it?Thank you.",

It is indeed an ETH transaction. I couldn't much information either. If it is the reason you mentioned, is it something that I can try to fix? Or just wait?",

If it is the reason you mentioned, is it something that I can try to fix? Or just wait?Which means it is an ERC20 token transaction. You have not broadcasted the transaction at all, but when you want to broadcast the transaction, it brought up the error. If it is like that, that means you need to send ether to the ether wallet address on your Coinomi wallet be able to cover the fee to make the transaction.In every ERC20 token transaction, ether is the gas fee that would be deducted. Send ether that would be enough as fee to the wallet. After, you will be able to broadcast the ERC20 token transaction and ether would be deducted as fee.",
