  "content": "A declaration by Binance CEO- CZI cant agree more with this man, when other people are busy shouting \"Bitcoin is dead\", CZ is saying that that is the best time to load and reload your Bitcoin bag, every dip is a buying opportunity but its rather sad that many people dont understand this, they want the price of Bitcoin to just keep going up and up, this is not possible because what drives the price of Bitcoin is not some algorithm but people, real people, its just like in a debate where majority carries the winning vote, your action on the Bitcoin market determines what your vote is, you buy, your vote goes to buy and the higher the buy votes, the higher the price goes.On the other hand, you sell, your vote goes for sell, and the higher the sell votes, the lower the price goes, then the good news is that the lower the price goes, the higher the opportunity to cast your buy votes because at some point, the buy votes will always go way higher than the sell votes which means price will go really high and then you who casted your buy votes when every other persons were casting a sell vote (thereby dragging the price down), will get to make good profit.LINK TO TWEET",

      "body": "Headlines like \"Bitcoin is dead\" comes from government regulated newsletters and non-investors who don't understand the mechanism and use of Bitcoin so they propagate this news and blind their minds from seeing the buy opportunity ahead in which every dip. CZ understands the price chart and how prices moves so all he sees on his chart is a buy opportunity. Bitcoin is one asset that can't return valueless. There must always be a new bull run and a higher ATH",

I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I am hoping that bitcoin dumps a bit more in price for a longer period of time so I can stack as much as possible amount of sats thru freelancing and signature campaign.Also, there is an obituary of bitcoin post saying \"bITC0iN iS dEaD\" -- if you don't mind me sharing HAHA..- https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/",

Yet always Bitcoin comes back to life.  I appreciate CZ doing this kind of fight, it would best come from the known personalities so we can get more demand. We know who the enemy is trying to topple the market of Bitcoin but in the end, they always fail and will be silenced again once another ATH comes. There's really a big difference in the type of investors now, especially the young ones, the more the government brings it down the more they will research it, buy it, and support it.",

However, they'll never know that this was a great opportunity for the people who wants to start crypto investment. It was the fact that the majority had closed their door towards crypto while they just say they will invest when their corrections. Well, Binance is really honest with us. He did encourage people to invest while the market is dumped, a big credit to the owner, CEO,  and team. However, they make benefit from this once these people use their platform.",

This topic never seize to come on the forum during this season of bear.

This bearish season is just part of its volatility cycle. It happened already before and we've heard the same sentiments from people. Those who fear this season are those who haven't known Bitcoin yet. If we've been investing with Bitcoin for years, we already had this kind of encounter and it's actually another opportunity to buy while others are in fear.",

When so many people or certain particular person/parties say about \"Bitcoin will be dead\" and other similar FUD about Bitcoin, people start panicking. Then, the price will be dropped, so many waves of panic sell.But, for some other certain people, this can be an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin and collect them during the crash market, at a low price. Why? Because we believe in Bitcoin and want to hold Bitcoin for the long term. This trust can lead us to hold more Bitcoin and enjoy the market when it's a bull later",
