  "content": "I believe this is the right place to ask such a question.What is considered a good collateral for a personal loan of less than $900/BTC for a duration of one month, in addition to other cryptocurrencies as collateral?-A reputable news and opinion website where the individual themselves has been actively involved until today.-Full access to that website in a way that the website owner cannot remove the borrower, but the opposite may be possible (if such an option exists).-A Twitter account associated with it, having 5,000 genuinely engaged followers (although some spam bots may be present).-A Rumble channel associated with it.-A verified account of choice as collateral.-A fully verified bank account.-A fully verified Coinbase account.-A fully verified Google account (linked to the website).-Fully verified casino accounts.-Space for advertising on the lenders website as a form of collateral.-Control over his website-Control over online shops such as Etsy, Printful, Printify, Shopify, which the borrower has set up and are fully verified, as they intend to generate passive income through them (although new sellers typically have to wait around 45 days before receiving payment).-A verified Localbitcoins account.I can extend the list further. Anything where the borrower is officially registered may potentially be considered as collateral. Are any of these valid collateral options? Or does someone get´s where the lender is at this point and has some advice after reading this, much appreciated. Here or PM.",

      "body": "I wouldn't consider anything on this list valid collateral. I don't think anyone cares about KYC, since people can buy these, probably for less than 900$. It's about the ability to sell the collateral if necessary.So if lend you 900$ and you decide to not repay me, can I resell the Coinbase account for 900$? obviously not.Verified accounts are probably riskier than anything else because if the account is verified using your real identity, you can always claim it back.",

In my opinion, none of the items you have mentioned can be considered valid collateral for a loan. When granting a loan, lenders typically require collateral that holds significant value and can be easily liquidated and converted into money to recover the loan amount in case of default. Besides, offering some of these KYC accounts is probably even illegal and against the terms of service. (What is the point of a verified Loclbitcoins acc now anyway?)Quote from: Freedom4All on June 25, 2023, 01:52:15 PMCould the risk to lose a established newswebsite and anything connected to it and even your full personal details, a colleteral for serious people?All that what you mentioned hold subjective value to their owners. Lenders generally look for assets that have objective market value. For example, \"full personal details\"... What use would that be to the lender?",

If the loan is for a business-related venture, it might be worth considering alternative options such as seeking an angel investor rather than a traditional loan.By the way, if you were truly an \"established\" person in this community, you might not even need collateral for relatively small amounts (like $900). Your name and reputation alone would serve as sufficient insurance. But since you are a newbie, that is out of the question in your case.",

Things which valued the most by forum user is the only acceptable collateral here like I mention previously.You can just sell your collateral on the marketplace instead of asking loan using that collateral if you really need the money now so that you can get money from the real value of your supposed to be collateral.",

Nobody is going to go through the troubles of selling your personal accounts so that they can recover their funds. If you think the verified accounts are of any value, then try directly selling them for $900 instead of using them as collateral to borrow money, and you will see how hard or easy it is to get them sold.",

I doubt if you will be able to get a loan using the mentioned collaterals in this forum. The next issue might be your reputation because your activities in the forum matter a lot. How will you feel if someone just knock on your door one morning and you don't even know the person and the first thing he asks from you is a loan without any valid collateral? You will not give the person the loan because you rarely know him. Nobody will give a loan to a stranger in this forum. After all, you might disappear without paying the loan because you have nothing to lose. You reputation in the forum can be collateral and as you can see you dont have it for now.",
