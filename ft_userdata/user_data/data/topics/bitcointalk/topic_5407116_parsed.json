My advise is to filter everyone out before you hire someone to work and be sure they all have the background otherwise you might get someone very cheap but the product might not be good. Best of luck!!!",

But if you are going to pay using altcoins, the Marketplace (Altcoins) board is should suffice.Another option would be to go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/. Beforehand, if you might want to discuss or want to find a reference and some network about the job/services, you may want to chime around within a Service Discussion board.",
