Many new investors tend to follow supply more. You should know that there are many low cap altcoins that can't even sail the market in bull seas.I haven't been here for a long time, but I don't think much has changed in recent years. You can collect hundreds of different low-cap altcoins, but there is still no guarantee that any of them will make a 100x increase, and most will likely end up worthless. In fact, I believe thousands of altcoins fail all the time. Statistically speaking, you have a better chance of success in gambling than finding a low-cap altcoin that will achieve a 100x increase.",

Basically i do looks at liquidity when they have enough liquidity there are every probability that such project could make something better more in the future, do we talks about their total supply and circulating supply? This also positioned the coin in a better chance to hit good prices whereas the supply is very low then surely there could be scarcity of the currency which could makes it soar.",

You should know that there are many low cap altcoins that can't even sail the market in bull seas.It's actually a trend that many did follow and many have also become successfully profitable with this strategy. That's why for some, this could lead to more profits upon doing so. And you'll hear them say that there's a gem there and here where they've found it. And that's why you also people should invest and follow what they've been doing. But no, that's not how investing should be, whether they're for the low-cap altcoins or higher caps, lower supply or higher supply. It doesn't matter, what matters is you know what the crypto you are investing and you're not blindly following the herd because you have your own way of determining what's a good project to invest and what's not.",

Low cap is not a pointer to a potential coin,  what make a coin to stand out is in the availability of it liquidity providers in form of an existing ecosystem to support the coin in the market.",

Been there before during the great ICO hype. I held bags of shitcoins, but not a single one of them went to even x20 in the next bull run. The ICO hype was no more, people had moved onto DeFi's, NFTsHaving part of your portfolio contain top solid coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum as well is a good strategy not to completely lose out in a bull market.",

And getting your investment out with some profits before you leave the some of the bag untouched rising for the possible moon. But one thing i've noticed is that. You might get few 1000x in the whole time you are doing them, and they might be worth more than year of trading high cap coins.But most of the time you will lose, and just be glad if you get out before you lose 100% of the initial investment.

Many new investors tend to follow supply more. You should know that there are many low cap altcoins that can't even sail the market in bull seas.Regardless of whether a coin is a low cap or high cap, the key point of choosing what coins to invest depends generally on coin characteristics and overall market performance in a different market trend. Remember that \"hype\" is always associated when we talk about \"x100 profits\" and \"bull run\" therefore, expect that even a non-potential coin can have a good volume with just hype alone as a reason.Moving forward, an enhanced and improved DYOR should always be the priority. We will really end up testing the waters with different coins as no one can predict accurately what coin will surprise the market in the future.",

I try to collect the low cap altcoins as many as possible before another bullrun that can occur anytime but it must be noted if i were only collecting reliable low cap tokens from the market. There have been thousands of tokens available in the market but most of them are scam tokens. The next bullrun may able to give same profit as the last bullrun which was happening 2021.

You can get your seat ready for the upcoming bullrun. Even though there were some that may stuck in the same place during the bullrun but i think that the big bullrun will be greatly pumping majority of crypto in the market. Even some shit scam coins can also be pumped due to the hype in the crypto.",

Many crypto traders out there like gambling, and don't know the fundamentals and charts. They just assume the price will become 100x like they did play crash and slot. So, it's better if he just gambles and sits down on a chair to play button bets then invests low cap altcoin which is clear to be a loss.",

Many new investors tend to follow supply more. You should know that there are many low cap altcoins that can't even sail the market in bull seas.I've been in the crypto world for some time already, but I only tried to invest into low cap altcoins once, and that's when I tried to invest into a meme coin called SAFEMOON. It has a low market cap at that time, tried to invest a small amount since meme coins at that time are hyped. I thought that I can get profits into it, but I didn't, and in the end I lost money. After that, I already said that I will never invest into low cap altcoins, but will focus on established coins only.Who will think that low cap altcoins can give you x100 profits? Newbies? Ignorant ones? Even they don't expect that thing to happen. Getting x100 is almost impossible, and the only way for you to get that is when a project just launched, you bought the token at it's sale, and it pumped. Overall, investing into low cap altcoins are even worse than you putting a bet on a team which has a lower chance of winning. Getting profit in low cap altcoins are more risky, but on the other hand, it can give you more reward. It's either you take the risk, and invest into them, or just simply focus on top coins.",

You have to also calculate estimates regarding the size of the capitalization and indeed if we look at the market where the price of altcoins is indeed tempting and attracts our emotions to buy a lot, not just one but almost all conditions, as you said, however, I also saw the hodlers besides what you said. just make a plan.",

So you need to pick which one to buy and hold for bull run. Not all will pump but if ever you pick a good coin with a high chance to do 50x to 100x you could definitely make a lot of profits and money like what happened on last bull run. Possibly many are collecting now while every alts are down badly. You could always buy low and sell it later. Doing dca isnt bad as well.",
