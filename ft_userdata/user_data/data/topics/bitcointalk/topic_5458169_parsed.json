      "body": "Awesome challenge! First to reply. I would be keeping an eye on the challenge picks you get to post. This is going to be the very first challenge I'm going to see and track by myself from the beginning and possibly see to the end.  Hopefully, I would play some of the picks you post by myself. Btw, Goodluck with the challenge, I hope you meet the target in the end. QQ: Why do you stake the entire budget on a single pick as opposed to spreading it to multiple picks?",

I skimmed through your posts and it seems you have tendency to always go all in / bet with high amount which is pretty interesting. Also saw one of your post that you were going to withdraw all your balances and leave Stake (?) and turned out you are still betting with themQuote from: NAPK1NS_RA3 on June 30, 2023, 10:07:44 PMSpecial shoutout to married couple Joel and Fernanda for sponsoring this challenge!Kinda wonder why they would want to sponsor this",

      "body": "Interesting but would you be betting everything or all out in every match or some sort of diversification on different matches? 'coz if it would always be all out bet, I doubt you'd reach it without fail. You can have a good analysis of the matches, good instincts and good reasoning but this is gambling; no one is certain of winning no matter how low the odd is. Anything could happen in a match, as we all know, that even underdogs could be triggered by luck and end up winning the game. But I would want to give you a good luck on this. Bravery, still , but not advisable indeed to all players. Quite of a big amount also, but if that's under your tolerance then you're good.",

He might be busted at some point of his all-in bet but he is really good on building his bankroll from small to huge amount. He only have a problem when he is close to goal.

Really big odd for over 1.5 goals but hope you get it so i can see what will happen after.It seems so, he will do all in bet with his bankroll after every win. The goal is so big, to make $4M from $40k, the risk is also big but I guess this number is not that big for him. At least he is ready to lose the initial bankroll, hopefully he will be lucky enough to win all his bets till he reach the goal. @OP Good luck with your challenge and I hope you will not be greedy in case you reach the goal. I mean you will stop once you reach the goal because you might be tempted to do more and more especially when there is a match that you think like a guarantee win match at the time you have $4m.",
