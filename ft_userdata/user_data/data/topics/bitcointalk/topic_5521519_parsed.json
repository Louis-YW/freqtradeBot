I think this news won't come out without having proof and validation. Even if he's worked in private practice for years but asked to do again public service through it, someone who's got a call for it will accept the offer.",

So yeah, it's a good choice to be the SEC chair.But it seems that he is very reluctant because it's obvious that in short amount of time he might not clean up the messed of Gensler. But if he will make a U-turn and become pro-crypto himself, then it will be a smooth sailing for us as he might have to favor us or maybe implement decisions that are going to be with us and maybe those that are pending cases might be dropped as well.",

You should, because you don't want to see a name that doesn't understand what is the function of SEC or have a background on digital or crypto itself. In this case the name of Paul Atkins has both of that characteristics. He is a former SEC chair under George W. Bush and has founded a digital company and has been doing private services involving financial institutions.Hopefully he accepts the job as he has the background to handle and for sure he will be friendly to crypto and that could be his first mandate. And usually the SEC will be under the President, although it could be a separate entity himself, but he or she could be go to the political agenda of what President Trump wants to, that is to be as pro-crypto as he can be.",
