  "content": "Barely a month ago I sat down one evening in a cafe with my gym coach and we had a scholarly and political conversation as we munched down pastries and sipped on beverages in an attempt to regain some of the calories we had lost on that day's workout session. In the heat of the conversation, a door was unlocked in his mind as I watched him go down on his the Shawarmaarma roll---he suddenly had a what-if moment when he shared an absurd idea with me about having a product that could close down all the gym outlets(paraphrasing...).At first, I thought he was tired of his job and possibly depressed but after suppressing the titanic urge to interrupt him for a while, like every good idea, what started flat absurd began to sound fruitful. And by the time my bottle of water got 70% low on content, we had already gone through a whole business plan, asking and answering questions and complementing each other for being so smart.The evening did not end as another normal evening because I recorded it in my diary as a special day. As a matter of fact, after the meeting, I went straight to my team and shared the idea with them.Today I am happy to share the result of 3 rolls of shawarma and two educated minds. I worked with my gym coach and the relentless bright minds at Bromuno and we came up with Macoach. It is our very first product to reach the production stage.What do you think of it?",

Many people have good ideas, but they never record it, they never work to bring it to life, so the idea is wasted and waits to meet another person that will make it work. Many products and services that we enjoy today all started as ideas that the people who had them, worked on and we have them to thank. whenever we have god ideas, we should always ensure to try to make it work especially when it is an idea that betters life and improves standard of life. People who work on ideas are necessary for the progress of the society.",

      "body": "Congratulations on the successful launch of your first product, Macoach! It's great that you were able to turn your idea into reality. This shows your enterprise and determination.Starting a new business or developing a new product is always an exciting and risky process. It is important to remember that success is not guaranteed, but it is such initiatives and innovative ideas that lead to progress and the achievement of new heights.If you and your team have carefully developed a business plan and see the potential in your product, then that's great. However, remember that successful product implementation requires not only an idea, but also effective marketing, promotion, and meeting the needs of the target audience. Be prepared for challenges and adapt as you develop your product.Good luck to you and your team with Macoach! I hope your product will be successful and benefit your customers.",

Sometimes we have to make ourselves like others as I'm not sure for that it would be done every time and every aspect of life but we have to do it a little. And also if we do something we have some idea for doing the thing as you gave an example of the person and the door that is all about the things and ideas we have.We don't take steps until  we have given somethings better to write and until we have given something better to speak through. But still we can trying our best for a good time and for the business of our will in which we feels so comfortable.",

What you just do is called motive bringing dreams in to reality.Quote from: WillyAp on November 24, 2023, 11:39:27 PMMost ideas are just that ideas.

Before Satoshi Nakamoto, created Bitcoin, I'm sure that the concept was just a thought until he began to see the potentials of it and how to invent it to become a reality, also the geniuses that thought about the possibilities of creating electric bulbs, aeroplanes and computer, it was all thoughts until they eventually made them to become realities. The human mind have so much capacity to make almost everything to happen, but most of us are too lazy to put in the brain work.",
