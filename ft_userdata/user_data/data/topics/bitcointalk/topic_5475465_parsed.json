  "content": "Hey y'all..I made a transaction to another subsidiary wallet and I was charged with a high txn fees - the gas fee was as high as $11 and I reduced it through an enabling tool on TW.. mind you, the weight and size of this dustcoin is 450 and 195 respectively.The problem now is, the txn has been pending for over 11 hours now and I had to use VIAbtc accelerator to quicken the confirmation process, only to be told that my adjusted gas fee is too low to be confirmed...I was definitely looking for ways I could adjust back the gas fee and I stumbled on CPFP. I don't know how to initialize that to correct the fees and so on but I need your help!! Is there a way out???Edit: I meant to say \"tnx fees\" not gas feesSandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Spend part of the unconfirmed transaction to another address on your Electrum wallet, or if you want to send coins to someone. Use a fee that is high enough that can make the two transactions to be confirmed. I mean the unconfirmed (parent) transaction and the (child) transaction that you just want to make now.To accelerate a transaction using ViaBTC, the transaction fee supposed not to be less 10 sat/byte (around 18.5 sat/vbyte for 1 input and 1 output if you use segwit addresses).If you used wallet that support RBF, you only just need to have increased the fee and that makes it simple and not using more fee as it is in child-pay-for-parent.Recommended wallet to use: Bitcoin open source wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF)",

Because your wallet is not supporting RBF, I will advice you to do CPFP. Or if you can wait, import your wallet seed phrase from Trustwallet (sender's wallet) to Electrum and wait for like 2 weeks. The transaction would be dropped from mempool and you will be able to rebroadcast it again.",

TW doesn't enable RBF transactions and I don't have an idea on initializing the CPFP like I said...Yes you‚Äôre right Trustwallet doesn‚Äôt have an opt in RBF but since most of the nodes actually enable full RBF this days you can still replace your transaction and the full RBF node will treat it as a replacement. This guide contains an information on how to do that on electrum  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474986.msg63198878#msg63198878 but you must pay attention to the server switch till you connect to the node that enables full RBF. Now the simpler option is the CPFP which is easier. Since you control the receiving address just make sure you have funds extra on that funds on that receiving address wallet and then import the seed into electrum. You will notice an unconfirmed transaction just click on it and spend the transaction into another address or to the same receiving address with a much higher transaction fee that would cover for both transactions.

But you can do child-pay-for-parent on Exodus. Quote from: https://www.exodus.com/support/article/1480-bitcoin-faqs-learn-more-about-btc#extra-feesWhat if I get a warning about paying extra fees?If you try to send out your Bitcoin from a transaction that is not yet confirmed on the blockchain, Exodus will warn you that you are paying higher fees for spending an unconfirmed transaction. This will create a CPFP transaction.You'll also receive this warning if you are sending out lots of UTXOs or a very large sized transaction that will incur higher-than-usual fees.CPFP transaction fees are higher to incentivize miners to include the transaction in the next block mined. Make sure you‚Äôre willing to pay the extra fee before proceeding.If you don't want to pay the extra fees, you can wait for all of your incoming transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain before sending a transaction out.The child transaction can be into your own address, or using one stone to kill two birdy if you have a transaction to send to someone.",
