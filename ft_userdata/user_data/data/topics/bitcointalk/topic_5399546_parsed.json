      "body": "Good luck with your crypto mining business venture. I understand that though cryptocurrency in general is not being banned in Canada, you can not expect a very friendly treatment from many people in the government either as many of them can be concerned on the supposedly environmental impact created by mining due to its big demand for power...not unless maybe if you are the one providing your own electric requirement. Still, a good entrepreneur can triumph against all odds.",
