Recently I saw the review of iPhone 15 series and I noticed that titanium has a higher melting point which is 1668 °C. I have not seen people recommending metal like Titanium on this forum. Is it not better than stainless steel? Another question is that I found out that Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metal on the periodic table, which is 3422 °C. Is this not the metal that supposed to be used for seed phrase backup? Or is it very expensive and not affordable?",

It is better than stainless steel for all the things we care about - melting point, corrosion resistance, reactivity, strength, and so on. It is a bit more expensive, but not as much as you would expect to just buy a small plain plate of reasonable thickness.Having said all that, stainless steel is cheaper and still more than sufficient for our purposes.

From normal environmental temperature around 40 °C to like 200 °C is not easily but I meant if temperature already reaches to 1400 °C, I am sure it is a very serious situation which already out of control.
