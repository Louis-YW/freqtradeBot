I took a look at a couple of football and basketball matches that were streamed last night on your demo sites. Unfortunately, I wasn't satisfied with what I saw. I am not talking about the quality of the picture here, but my focus was only on the delay from live events. According to my tests, it was over 30 seconds for some matches, which makes the service unsuitable for my needs. Even my IPTV was faster at times.  Do you have any faster streams or do you know some particular leagues/sports where the service might be faster?",

That's correct and that's the problem. Deep down I didn't expect it to be any different, but I did want to check it out just to see if by any chance they are pre-production streams (not sure what the official term is). From time to time, I have access to those and they are faster than cable or satellite transmission. I can't name any names though.",

We do not have such a broadcast, I was excited to hear that there is such a thing. I really hope we can reach that technology together.for now we are doing a world-class business and it was not possible to see better, if you come across, please show us.I'm so glad to meet you and have a chance to chat, my friend.",
