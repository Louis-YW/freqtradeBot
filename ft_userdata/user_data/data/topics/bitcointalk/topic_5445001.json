Your serial is already reserved since you purchased 1oz coins! Everyone who purchased a 1oz gilt has those serials reserved automatically until they tell me they don't want to keep that serial number.  I am giving past buyers the opportunity to keep their old serials if they choose. Sorry if this is confusing to people, but most people want to keep their serial numbers so I am trying to avoid issues by doing this. No auctions KW also there is an insert that comes with the coin where it has all the coin info, and a QR code you can scan and find your addy by serial number. I am at work today so I will responding to questions when I can thank you for your interest in the coins",

Happy to see a very reasonable price for a full set here.",

Thank you Suzuki,PM ICT, Yoda, Caribbean treasures  The available serial numbers list has been updated! The list will be changing regularly as some 1oz gilt buyers bought multiple coins and wont keep all their numbers, and some may switch numbers. Some may pass on the coins as well so it is hard to keep track of all of them, but I will keep updating as the info flows in",
