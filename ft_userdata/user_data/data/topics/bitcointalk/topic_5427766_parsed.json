These are listed below. 1) For PC users, Install Electrum wallet and that follo simple procedure and you will find your Wallet address that will be Segwit and usually initiated with the becl address code. 2) Use Binance cause Binance supports Segwit deposit address and that's so simple and Binance helped me very much and that is simplest method to get Your BTC address.",

Usually initiated with becl?That's wrong. Native segwit (bech32) addresses always start with bc1 and nested segwit addresses always start with 3.Also, electrum is available for android phones as well.

For real? I will generate 10 bech32 addresses through other trustable wallets (where I even control my keys) faster than you who register for one binance account and kyc it to get an address lol.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on December 10, 2022, 06:47:09 PM any exchange should support segwit addresses. True. Although some exchanges like bybit, bitget, phemex are yet to support it.Also, for mobile users, I'd recommend mycelium and bluewallet (supports lnd as well) as they give you full control over your keys (unlike exchange wallets).",

Most of the services these days have segwit implemented while only a few didn't.When you have segwit on almost all the wallets, why do you need Binance?

The protocol upgrade brought up a number of benefits, such as improved transaction speed and block capacity. In addition, SegWit solved the so-called transaction malleability bug.As of June 2020, Bech32 349 is supported in many popular wallets and is the preferred address scheme. Visit this thread to know about more details about segwit wallet : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5402207.msg60336158#msg60336158You can also visit this thread for know why you should use it which was created by 1miau Why people should be using SegWit addressesI would like to say OP that what wallet you are using that is Centralize wallet I would suggest you that if you want to hold your funds for long  then you can avoid Centralize wallet and use Decentralize wallet  And there are many trusted decentralized wallet like you already mention  Electrum wallet you can also use trust wallet, and I think you will get more fund security in decentralized wallet than Binance where your funds are centrally controlled and  in decentralised wallet the withdrawal fee  lower than Binance. But you can use centralized exchanger based on your needs, segwit wallet supports few more famous exchangers one of them is kucoin. But even there you have to pay high withdrawal fee.",

But of course it's not a secure storage address because you'll never have the key. Remember that those are not your keys, they are not your bitcoin, so if someone wants to have a segwit address as long term storage then they need to have a proper and trusted wallet.",
