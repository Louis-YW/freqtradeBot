And one thing you will notice now is that a lot of new managers are coming and they are bringing a lot of new projects here. But most projects are scandalous. My point is, you don't have to wait for these scandalous projects like theirs. Your project may be a little less but the project you have come up with should not be as scandalous as everyone else.That's why I like everything about you. Go ahead, love you boss",

Wow! In the past, I used to make simple drawings and paintings. Not for commercial purposes though. Looking at the previous participants, if I can still bring the best out of myself, I may have a chance in the top 10. Maybe I should challenge myself to create one or maybe two since I am not busy these days.",
