  "content": "QuoteTexas is banning 10 large banks and 348 investment funds for allegedly boycotting fossil fuel-based energy companies critical to the state's economy, a move critics said could cost taxpayers in the Lone Star State hundreds of millions annually in higher interest costs.The state's blacklist released Aug. 24 follows West Virginia's decision in July to ban five banks for the same reason. Such actions come as some Republican-led states are cracking down on corporate social and environmental policies the states perceive to be politically driven.Banks that Texas put on notice earlier this year went to great lengths to show that they are, in fact, investing tens of millions in the fossil fuel industry, but some failed to convince the state. Texas and West Virginia have now banned BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, from doing business with the state.Texas' exclusion list of so-called Annex I companies also includes BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse AG, Danske Bank A/S, Jupiter Fund Management PLC, Nordea Bank Abp, Schroders PLC, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Swedbank AB (publ) and UBS Group AG. The 348 investment funds belong to banks in the U.S. and Europe.Large pension funds such as the Teacher Retirement System of Texas will now be required to divest from companies and funds on the list, as will a multibillion-dollar public school fund.\"A vibrant Texas oil and gas industry is a stabilizing force in today's economic and geopolitical environment,\" Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. \"My greatest concern is the false narrative that has been created by the environmental crusaders in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street that our economy can completely transition away from fossil fuels, when, in fact, they will be part of our everyday life into the foreseeable future.\"The Texas crackdown came on the heels of Florida's Aug. 23 decision to bar the state's $186 billion pension fund from considering environmental, social or governance factors in investment decisions. Other Republican-led states are expected to follow suit.Loan costs soaredSteve Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, said such state efforts are escalating in part because of the groundswell of investors demanding change. For example, in 2021 ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, investors managing $52 trillion in assets urged nations to phase out coal, and many institutional investors have pledged to gradually reduce their carbon footprints.\"The market is speaking, and there are some states that want to put their thumb on the market,\" Rothstein said in an interview. \"Texas taxpayers, unfortunately, will have a burden of hundreds of billions of dollars based on this decision.\"A July study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School estimated that municipalities and other public entities in Texas paid between $303 million and $532 million more in interest on the $32 billion they borrowed during the first eight months after the anti-ESG laws Texas enacted in 2021 took effect and some large banks had to cease bond underwriting.https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/texas-bans-10-banks-348-investment-funds-over-fossil-fuel-policies-71842914https://www.npr.org/2022/09/01/1120457153/texas-ban-on-firms-who-dont-invest-in-firearms-and-fossil-fuels-are-cost-taxpaye....Texas claims international banks and investment firms were deliberately boycotting fossil fuel based energy. So they banned them. They also blocked pension funds from investing in those banks and investment firms. If the article is accurate, the disvestment block will be replicated in other US conservative states. Blackrock is one investment firm making news headlines recently. They were one name people might recognize announced under the ban.Their rationale for this ban claims it is not scientifically rational to try to completely replace fossil fuels with alternative forms of energy at this time.I'm not certain that I believe this news is accurate. It has been completely normalized for Bill Gates and china to buy up large swathes of farmland in texas. Without lawmakers doing much to discourage or oppose the sales. Its a little late to be opposing these measures. Its a little late to be passing laws which carry the potential to raise production and reduce cost of oil. It would be interesting if it were possible to read a complete narrative of all of the events that led up to this.",

      "body": "In 2019, texas was a 22.9% oil and gas exporter from the US (this is the last bit of data I can find but I didn't look much because I doubt it's changed).If you're from the biggest exporting country of energy and you make up 22% of those exports, you're going to do everything you can to stay there...Texas are a state that have been very anti climate in most of their bill passing too because of this.I'm guessing the state legislature has been paid from oil companies (probably not fairly) for trying to ban investment firms from being invested in if they're going to invest in sustainability or have sustainable policies.You might also remember the news last year about texas having blackouts for a long time because their energy grid is unreliable and isolated... Sustainable investments have gone from producing zero interest and functioning at cost to actually start delivering good profits (it was a change that happened during the pandemic).",
