Am I have to keep it forever and let it be there?   I don't recall any Titan coins being dated after 2017... thinking the 2017 0.1BTC were the last coins they produced, and all were PK (Private Key) from what I have seen.Can you share the COA/hologram code to me in PM.. I can verify if it is a PK or 2FA for you Quote from: Lesbian Cow on September 10, 2023, 03:57:56 PM0.1 BTCCurrent high bid",
