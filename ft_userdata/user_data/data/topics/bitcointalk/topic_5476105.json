You will look for the pair of BTC/USDT and then buy bitcoin. After this what you have on your wallet is bitcoin and not the pair. So to move the bitcoin to another address either exchange or wallet you just transfer using the withdraw option and to the new receiving exchange or wallet address. So there is no such thing as moving a pair.",

In crypto exchanges like Binance USD is represented by stable coins such as USDT, FDUSD,USDC. You can exchange your USD for the stable coins and then use them to trade Bitcoins and other assets such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDCIf you want to cash out, you can sell your BTC, USDT or USDC for USD on their customer to customer marketplace.For EUR and GBP, they have no stable coins on Binance for example, so you can directly buy and sell Bitcoin using EUR and GBP as in BTC/EUR or BTC/GBP.",

I don't recall any crypto exchange that focuses on fiat trading pairs, except maybe in the forms of stable coins like USDC-EUR, etc. I assume you only have GBP to deposit but the exchange doesn't provide a trading pair for that? Can't really give you any meaningful suggestions without knowing what exchange you use, as mentioned above. At the very least, you can do P2P to trade your fiat if you can't move to another exchange.

It should be noted that too many exchange processes are also costly. I think you can simply trade BTC with your local currency on the local exchange.",

Usually local exchange market have own fiat currency like in my local exchange with IDR pair, its only available for selling bitcoin with BTC/IDR pair in my local exchange and can't sell on other exchange with this pair.

Depends on different blockchain, waiting time can be small or big but surely it will not be immediately.

You want to trade your GBP to BTC right? then go to BTC/GBP pair and trade then after that if you also want USDT after you trade BTC then go to BTC/USDT then trade. This is repetitive process so for sure you could easily learn this. But also try to see if there's an option on all of this in the exchange where you want to trade so you can make a successful trades with those pairs you want. Also if you are still confused try to ask more regarding on what you want since people here are open to answer your question so you could learn from us here.I know trading is confusing but if you are done with you first trade for sure you will know how to do it on other pairs.",

This is not a case of combining BTC and GBP as there are no address options that combine such a choice. BTC yes with a BTC address but otherwise GBP depending on what network provides the GBP coin service. Stable coins are usually ERC20, BNB, or TRC20 depending on choice. So do you understand correctly that a pair of coins does not mean a combination of one coin?",

FYI, pairs like BTC/GBP or BTC/USDT are set by exchanges to facilitate the exchange between BTC and GBP or BTC and USDT (and vice versa), and the market price is typically displayed there. Pairs on exchanges are not like currencies or cryptocurrencies.... therefore, they cannot be transferred.Something that can be transferred from one exchange to another are BTC, GBP, or even USDT, with the condition that the relevant exchange supports deposits for the specific currency. Not all exchanges support every currency, so choosing an exchange that supports the currencies you have and the ones you're targeting is crucial. Local cryptocurrency exchanges are often more user-friendly.The only advice I can say to you is : try exchanging your BTC for GBP (or vice versa) using the BTC/GBP pair. This way, you'll gain a better understanding of how that exchange works. Also, try making deposits and withdrawals to understand its functions firsthand.",
