      "body": "It wasn't exactly a classic user error, because the user didn't know in advance which route his transaction would take. It was not a transaction from one user wallet to another. He wanted to exchange USDC for USDT using an aggregator. The aggregator routed the money to the Uniswap pool, which didn't have the right liquidity and that transaction turned out to be so clumsy. There's more of a trust error here than a transaction error, so don't trust aggregators too much.",
