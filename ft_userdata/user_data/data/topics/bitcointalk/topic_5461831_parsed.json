Well, here is mine, IP should be secure like there are many layers on internet and only the experienced ones or the most careful ones will use the IP in only severe conditions and if they would have used then they must have secured the connection first. As, i think it must not be a preferred way back then well that's what i assumed from this because many legendary members are so careful in such cases.So, the best practice must be sending on Wallet address instead of IP where both parties have to be online while making the transaction.",

But considering that in today's available wallet softwares addresses are used not P2PK, they convert that pubkey to different address types and the website is redirected to the first one that has been used otherwise show the default one which is P2PKH.The bug is where their indexed database counts balance in P2PK outputs as the P2PKH balance.",
