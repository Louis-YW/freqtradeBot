A new account created same day when this thread created then go straight on this thread to post and place bet on a manual bet casino?You are just making your thread more shady by doing this self bets just to show someone already place bet. Casino offer this kind of game in automatic payouts. Why we need to go back on old days gambling with a newbie owner that has high risk of running away all the funds. You have nothing to lose here unless you can escrow some funds to cover your bankroll for players safety.",

It's a good practice to have transparency and security measures in place to gain the trust of potential players before it can be successful. It's also essential to have a plan in place for scaling this as your game gains more players. I think you can further improve and make it successful and trusted with the feedback and suggestions from others here.Good luck with your new casino game!",

Majority of the gamblers here are into Bitcoin so why not add it?I think as you start, just like what they say about an escrow that's much better. The concerns of having that deposit for websites like yours isn't complete with the trust.I know that you do understand that and you're trying to build your reputation in here, other than that if you're able to overcome that and prove everyone wrong, you'll also earn it.",

There is a very high chance of this being a scam and it is very obvious. Not only obvious but very lazily set up, as if by a child. No escrow, no third party assurance of fair-play? Cmon OP, you have got to try harder than that lol. No legitimate casino would offer something as shady as this. Send your coin to his wallet? What certainty is there that you will ever see that money again? Everyone is free to do and act as they choose in their life, but I have given my warning and it is up to you to decide whether or not you wish to follow it or not.",
