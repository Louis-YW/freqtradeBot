To answer your own question or start a spammy discussion ? Scientifically, if you are weak enough you will have heart problems regardless of what field you are working on, let it be trading, business or regular 9-5 job. So stop believing that trading is risky for your health if you yourself are not serious enough about your body. All you have to do is regular exercise and you'll be fine, speaking from my own expirience !PS: Could be offtopic but sry, judging by the recent threads you are making continuously, you seem like a butthurt spammer!Quote from: mk4 on November 29, 2022, 06:02:19 AMDafuq is this. Screw being careful and mind conditioning â€” if you get heart problems, immediately go to a cardiologist lmao.Exactly this ðŸ˜‚",

What is happening in the crypto market right now, is not something that will cause you heart problem as a potential traders, because this market price situation will not remain in the market forever which many people need to understand it very well to stop worry than to be patience with their holding. I think, this is the time to face the risk by continue holding your coins until the bearish season is over for traders to embrace incomes.",

I thought you had a heart problem. This seems difficult to answer for me as I don't have heart problems, but I am sure there are users here who can answer this question. The only thing I can think of about this is that they already know how to handle themselves in this kind of situation, like when they are losing or when they are super happy because they won big, and that usually they take medicine when they feel that something is wrong.",

      "body": "If it were me, I would pause to heal the heart problem or emotional trauma rather than continue because health matters are far more important to me. So far, I've been able to handle it pretty well and haven't had that problem and hopefully, I'll never have one because every investment I make has a risk behind it. And luckily, I can deal with it if I have a loss investing or trading so it doesn't take a toll on my health. Maybe I will experience disappointment but it is not prolonged and I can still handle it well.So before you decide to invest or trade, you must prepare your mind as best because the risks we face will follow our every step. If you can handle it, you won't have to worry about the appearance of that health problem and won't even be affected by the loss and just a moment of disappointment.",

It is good for your eyesight too as well as reduce your stress level. Most important, investment helps you rich, not trading. Most of traders end with serious net-loss but it's obviously that to invest successfully and gain profit, you must have knowledge, patience and very disciplined.",

I'd say something that's considered a joke can happen.No, this isn't ridiculous but it does truly happen for real because crypto's movements are unpredictable. It can give us a heart attack when the price drops at a very low point, we can also get shock when the price rises on a very high point. It happens because they are highly volatile. If you have a heart problem then its better if we won't deal with it for our safety.We must remember that health is wealth and it's more important than money because once it's lost, it can never be returned again or your life can be bought back no matter how much money you have. Mental health problems is also known here but I think this one is more manageable and not really a life threatening at all.",
