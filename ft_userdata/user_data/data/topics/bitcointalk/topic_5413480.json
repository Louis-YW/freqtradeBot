  "content": "There are three (3) Rays that transmit network in the globe. The rays are:Gamma Rays: 5G networkBeta Rays: 2G, 3G and 4G NetworkUltra Rays: ¬†Light EnergyMy main discussion here is 5G network with bitcoin transactionGamma RaysGamma Rays: This is the 5G network producer. And 5G network brought covid 19. The world technologists (scientists) have been looking for a way to improve/fastest way to transmit/transact information in the digital space/field. And finally 5G network was discovered in China by scientists of different fields. Such field were: ¬†The Pharmacists, these were the group who inserted the covid 19 (Corona-virus) to the network to infect humanity. Businessmen in advance countries who supported the project financially for their selfish interest. Biochemistry who created the chemical combination and the bacterial in the network and finally Engineering scholars (Physics), these group created the speedometer of the network. 5G network is the fastest network as of now. And covid 19 is moving with 5G network so covid 19 transmission is very fast as the network. The day when the network was launched in Wuhan, China, those who sponsored the project in another countries switched off their cell phones. 5G network does not used normal phone but there is a specific phone manufacture for it. That was why it didn't affect anyone other person at that time but within those people that using the phone. As they launched the network, within one (1) minute, those that were using the phone died and those who did not died instant transmitted the virus to their families, friends, neighbours etc. And from there, people had started dieing so with the fear of some people they left China to another countries, there the virus started to spread to other parts of the world with the travelers. Gamma Rays produces the fastest network in the world and covid 19 transmission is the fastest in the disease diplomacy history. I also heard a story that in British 5G network Mask were burned down Therefore, The speed in 5G network is the best option for bitcoin transactions. I made a transaction on Monday with Electrum to a friend and it took ¬†almost 1 to 2 hours to reflect on the person's wallet. ¬†Although, I also look at the fees and the number of blocks the coin will transmit before going to the recipient wallet, but that not withstanding, if the network is very fast it wouldn't spend some seconds to receive.  5G with Blockchain transaction you can see some infoGamma Ray   Beta Ray   Ultra Ray",

      "body": "Also all these travel at the same speed in a vacuum.We only use microwaves and Radio waves for communication (and only microwaves are used for phones) - I'm pretty sure that's because of the limitations of processing them (light has also been used but not at a frequency that'd compete with microwaves - it's been used for convenience) and the heat they'd give off. Xrays and infrared are more used for static images/signals ehrte you can send one message that's repeated for a specific period (eg using a TV remote).@franky1, I read that badly and was trying to work out what butterflies did to make microwaves .",

How long it takes for your transaction to confirm has absolutely nothing to do with your internet speed. After all bitcoin transactions are normally very small in size (less than a kilobyte) and it doesn't take that much to upload and then propagate them throughout the network with \"normal\" internet speed.Dial-up internet speed is 56 kbit/s (8 kbyte/s), even at half that speed for upload that means it takes 0.28 second to upload a 1 kb transaction!It is all about (1) how congested the mempool is in general. (2) how much fee you paid compared to the rest of the transactions in mempool. (3) your transaction itself and whether it had any unconfirmed parent(s), non-standard input, etc.",

If you want to send bitcoin to someone and you want the transaction to be very fast and be included in the next block, why making use of low priority fee, you can make use of high priority fee and your transaction would be included in the next block.I will advice you to always check the mempool (like https://mempool.space) to know the best priority fee to be used.",
