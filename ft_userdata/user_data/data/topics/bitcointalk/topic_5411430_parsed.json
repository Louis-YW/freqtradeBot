I didn‚Äôt want my obituary to be, ‚ÄúHe died getting a quote on the yen.‚ÄùCyberyen is a challenge to everything that is happening in crypto today.A challenge to all the newfangled blockchains under the centralized control of a handful of infantile people who grew up on \"HelloKitty\". And also to all CEXs that involve people in speculative activities, pumping out money with the help of actively popularizing exchange tools.‚Ä®Money cannot belong to one or some group of people, money has always been the nodes of relationships between peoples, a measure lying on the scales on the right and left sides, to establish harmony and balance.‚Ä®You were given a vector for the development of a decentralised world, but you turned around and ran after fake brilliance. Don‚Äôt bottle yourself in smart contracts. Take back your freedom, stop listening to any specialists with limited and populist knowledge.POW+radio is the solution.‚Ä®Raise nodes wherever possible, Connect nodes together with a signal, Envelop the planet.

See attached file for more detailsFirst lines with blue background, those are the ones mentioned manually in the validation.cpp file at subsidy information.The lines below that. from the orange background one, those are the ones made automatically from the halving set to be every 100,000 blocks.It ends up with a max supply of 161,186,999,998.137 coins, for a mining phase of approximately 7 years, with a block time of 1 minute (approximately for the time).

As it turned out, there are many owners of ‚Äúdormant‚Äù Scrypt ASIC miners in the crypto community who have lost their relevance.During the discussion, the idea arose to make Cyberyen available to solo miners, that is, Scrypt ASIC owners whose equipment has become unprofitable for mining coins with high difficulty.We would like to finalize the Cyberyen code where any Scrypt ASIC could participate in a live block search competition and where mining pools would lose their relevance.We ask the community to join us and take part in solving this design.Cyberyen is open to everyone who wants to participate in the development of the project.https://matrix.to/#/#cyberyen:matrix.orghttps://github.com/cyberyen/cyberyen",
