  "content": "Hi ALL!July certainly is silly season in a lot of sports, from F1 driver moves to European Football transfers and sponsorship deals!As you may have seen, Arsenal and Sportsbet have come to a mutual agreement to move in different directions, but we still have the will to want to be involved in EPL action!Let's have a bit of fun and get our tin foil hats on and crystal balls out, lets see if we can predict where the Sportsbet.io sponsorship roulette will end up! I'll pop out a few free bets for the right answers and interesting answers.Answer these 4 questions and lets see how close we get!(assuming we close a deal by July 31)1. Which Club do you think Sportsbet.io will sponsor in the 2023/2024 English Premier League?2. Which Club would YOU like Sportsbet.io to sponsor in the 2023/2024 English Premier League?3. If NOT EPL - what other European Club would you like Sportsbet.io to Sponsor?4. What Southampton fixture would you like to attend \"Beers with Steve\" during the 2023/2024 Championship Season?Best of luck all and Ill announce the closing date if and when I get an answer myself  Max July 31st.",

      "body": "Wouldn't be fair to 'guess' the 1st one 2.) I'd like Liverpool ofc, but that's way too expensive. I like the Luton shout from bullrun2020bro, new teams in the league are always interesting to track.Although I'm all Liverpool, I do like Newcastle as a club - they've got a huge and loyal fanbase, are a proper english team and they have invested smartly and are managed fantastically.3.) I'd love Ajax. Borussia Dortmund as well, of course - clubs with a proper footballing tradition but not the european cream - I don't really like the Barcelonas and Chelseas of the world.4.) Soton - Liverpool, ofc. Or Soton - that new club I hope you get!EDIT: obviously, I meant in the Cup - considering that Soton is in the Championship. In the league probably Leicester?",

Brentford - a club that does things its own way, strong connections to betting industry and Ivan Toney could be a perfect face for Sportsbet. We all know how much he loves betting¬† 3. Some club with great supporter base like Borusia Dortmund. Other than that my local club Rijeka. I am sure we can make some kind of a deal here¬† ¬†4. I thought SB deal with Southampton is finished. Glad to hear it isn't. I would love to attend any match in championship. Never watched championship game live so that would remove it from my bucket list.",
