There are still some tokens that can be mine alternatively to ETH with good marketcap like RVN and ETC which is a great alternative for PoW mining. This token has been running for a long time that you can guarantee that your mining power consumption will always be paid properly by good profit.",

Now the bag is worth $1  and can't really say I'm surprised.Will definitely be a learning experience but regarding profits I don't think so.

If you want to own babydoge token, you can spend some money to buy it for fun and wait for your luck. There is no point in mining shitcoins that have no usecase and can disappear at any moment. There will be a lot to lose to you if babydoge dies, with the unpredictable meme its death will never warn you to prepare. Meme is the riskiest coin on the market, it's not worth the investment let alone mine it.",

I am not sure though if Baby Doge is really a proof of Work coin because according to coinmarketcap it uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism. If a coin is mineable there should be a profitability calculator somewhere on the internet and there you can check if you make profit with that coin. If you already have the hardware and you make more profit from mining then the electricity will cost you, then i think you can do nothing wrong.I don't think though, that BabyDoge has a future. It's a useless shit-coin after all.I would probably just use Nicehash i think. That way you are always using the most profitable algorithm for your hardware.",

Do not let yourself a victim of another shitcoin that will only be hyped in the beginning and end up losing its value in the market. Just like dogecoin, a lot made profits in the start but eventually as the time goes, dogecoin loses its hype and so its value, and most likely those who made profits in the start are already experiencing losses by now. I suggest you avoid this project as much as possible and just learn to invest in other established altcoins instead.",

It's just going with the hype of Dogecoin and taking advantage of it hoping that they can gain the same popularity that Doge has. Any coin being related to meme coins as for me isn't reliable and they're something that we should get rid of. We all know that not all meme coins especially the new ones could survive the current market situation that we have.  Meme coins will always be shitcoins in the end, and there have no changes from the start. Although there are some meme coins that made exceptional profits at the start, but obviously they fail to sustain it for long. The reason why investing or mining meme coins are not advisable as it could only result more into losses than yielding profits. If possible, always DYOR first before creating decisions. That way, you will never fall mining such meme coins with no bright future.",

We are all here for profit which is a casual thing to have which it would be understandable that we would really be seeking on something which couldgive out those kind of chances.Meme coins or mining them arent really that requiring too big hashpower.Its up to you if you could bare up with the risk with thoseresources on just mining babydoge.",
