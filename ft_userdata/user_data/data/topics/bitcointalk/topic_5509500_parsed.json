  "content": "It would appear that there is now about a 50/50 chance right now that the next President of the United States will be promoting a product that will compete directly with Bitcoin. Trump's history of self-dealing is well documented, and his second presidency promises to be completely unconstrained by US law since voters would be consciously choosing a convicted criminal who has evaded prison only because of his voters. This has huge, huge implications for the future of Bitcoin.As president, Trump will have complete control of the US government in a way that no other US president has (which is exactly what his voters want). Even without Congress, Trump could direct agencies like the DOJ, SEC, and others to effectively make Bitcoin illegal in the USA in order to pump up his own coin, which of course won't have the \"problems\" that Bitcoin and other cryptos will have be said to have.Trump could make himself the world's first trillionaire by doing this, and the anybody who knows Trump knows that the only thing he has ever cared about is making more money for himself.Could Trump \"kill\" Bitcoin? No. Could he cause the price of Bitcoin to retreat by 90%? He could do it in a single late-night tweet.If Trump wins, folks, you might want to... diversify your investment holdings. Just saying... https://x.com/WalkerAmerica/status/1835865372408361210",

It's like you will have one or another at similar probability.Almost like a flip of a coin. Six of one or half dozen of the other. Even steven. A tossup. QuoteAbout past activities of Trump in cryptocurrency engagement, it's not new and we don't need to wait till his latest interview to know what he did with things in cryptocurrency industry. Maybe some people knew about it and most of them are people who have been in this space a long time, at least last several years in last market cycle; but some people did not know about it before the interview.While there was speculation about what Trump would do, this news broke yesterday and this was the first that anybody knew about Trump's plans to create his own coin publicly. Quote They are more probably new cryptocurrency participants who have been joining since 2023 when the bear market came to ending and started its warm up for 2024 and 2025 bull run.Absolutely. But none have a good chance of being President of the United States, with absolute control of their party and a voter mandate to operate above the law.QuoteI don't see impacts of Trump approach and regulation in his next presidency, if he gets elected, is terrible for Bitcoin. With my vision as Bitcoin and altcoins will co-exist and grow together, I see no bad thing from Trump's next regulations, if he will be in the White House again.Certainly there will be no bad things for Trump's coin. As for the rest of the market, well, who knows. Anything that gets in the way of Trump's coin being the most valuable in the world will obviously be a target for US regulators.Quote from: pawel7777 on September 17, 2024, 04:18:31 PM[...]No, Trump will not have unlimited power to force all the agencies to peddle some shitcoin. Why not? Remember that Trump tried to overthrow the US government and his voters don't care: they are going to try to reelect him because of his disregard for US laws. Trump has been indicted on over 100 criminal counts, and they will all be dropped if he wins the presidency. For somebody like this, the law is absolutely meaningless.QuoteAnd even in some political fantasy scenario, banning Bitcoin would have the exact opposite effect on pumping whatever coin that is.In other words, to successfully pump his own token, he would have to create a crypto-friendly environment first.So you don't think the president announcing a crackdown on Bitcoin would effect the price? Seriously? And the US absolutely is a crypto-friendly environment. I'm not sure what else he or any other president could do short of using the US federal governemnt to specifically pumping a certain coin e.g. Bitcoin or Trump's coin. QuoteBut if we're fantasising about (any) president having a complete control and bad intentions - he could just outright take everyone's money.It actually wouldn't be that simple, as any sundry dictator across the world could tell you: a direct crackdown on property rights like that would sink the markets and be counter-productive. The most lucrative thing for Trump would be much more subtle, e.g. enabling his own crypto and denigrating the others.I have personal experience \"competing\" with the CPC years ago. They didn't just directly steal our product because they didn't have to--and doing so would have scared away other companies from investing there. China simply passed innocuous-sounding laws that greatly advantaged our CPC-controlled competitor, and disadvantaged us. In just a few years, our product in China was toast, and 90% replaced by the CPC-supported product. We eventually pulled out of China because there was no way to \"compete\" against the government there.In the case of Bitcoin, it will be much more volatile since almost the entirety of the market price will hang on US regulations since so much of Bitcoin is owned by US-based holders. Michael Saylor could easily be convinced to support Trump's coin and sell all of his Bitcoin if the price was right (he'd suddenly find all kinds of tax advantages for doing so, or maybe the DOJ investigation suddenly launched against him would magically go away). The same goes for Musk and all of the other billionaire Bitcoin whales. All of those guys are just in it for the pump-and-dump, and Trump could easily offer them a much better deal if he has the US government on his side.",

And I presume they tell him to throw anybody who doesn't agree with Putin out a hotel window. And they told Putin to make that helicopter crash with that dissenting general. And they told Putin to invade Ukraine.And these \"people\" are, of course, 100% pro-Bitcoin and would never let anything bad happen to it.That's some amazing stuff right there. I mean, usually we hear non-stop conspiracy theories here about how \"people\" are secretly against Bitcoin and secretly need to stop it because it... upsets the Illuminati's need to control the world through the US dollar and interest rates (or something). This is the first time I've heard of a world-wide conspiracy to protect Bitcoin. That's a new one .Anyhow, back here on Earth, Putin absolutely controls Russia and its nuclear stockpile, and Trump absolutely controls one half of the US political system, and he will absolutely control the US government if he wins, and the US government will respond to it's political leadership not a secret cabal of jewish people (their space-lasers notwithstanding), child-eating cannibals, or whatever else.

Most Bitcoin is held by US citizens who are compelled to follow the laws of the USA lest they be imprisoned. The reason why crypto is the biggest US donor to the US elections this cycle is because the US government's continued support of Bitcoin is absolutely critical to it's maintaining current price levels.Quote[...] also, we need to make sure that bitcoin is what we should recognized as part of what we needed to attain some level of achievements in life.Most people, I would assume, hold Bitcoin in order to make money.

Again, I suppose if you don't hold Bitcoin for the money, but rather as a curiosity, then you probably don't need to care about the US making Bitcoin illegal in the USA. But that's probably not how most people look at Bitcoin. Most people look for a return on investment, not a massive loss.",
