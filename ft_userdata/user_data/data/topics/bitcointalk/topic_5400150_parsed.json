  "content": "Hey, I just wanted to share something I saw today. As you probably know, Ukraine won the Eurovision this year. And you probably also know that Ukraine is quite crypto-friendly and has been increasingly so during the war. Today I saw this Instagram post by the winner of Eurovision Kalush that they're doing a charity auction to help the army. They're selling the pink hat to a random person who donated at least 5 EUR (so, it's a typical fiat thing) BUT the auction for the Eurovision mic is both in cryptos and in fiat, and whoever donates the most gets the mic. I don't know if any of you are interested to take part, but I thought it's an interesting contest to share, as it is yet another example of usage of cryptos, and a Eurovision mic is also an attractive prize. Unfortunately, I think that crypto donations are in ETH only, no BTC, which is why I'm putting it in the Altcoin section.The Instagram post is here: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd-aAKrotr6/.The bio of Kalush has a link to addresses for taking part in this thing.",

There are two transactions so far, both quite small. I think it was their big mistake to make crypto donations in Ethereum, and not in Bitcoin. While Ethereum is #2, it is much less popular in Ukraine and probably in other countries as well. Just to give an example of the difference, a Ukrainian foundation that helps the army got 477 BTC of donations (currently almost 14 million dollars), but only 753 ETH (less than 1.4 million dollars).Edit: I think they've changed the description from yesterday, actually, and now the mic is not for crypto donations, but for an NFT auction? Confusing and weird to make changes along the contest...",

And its winner was the Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange WhiteBit.com, which, together with its community, transferred 900 thousand dollars in cryptocurrency and, accordingly, received a crystal statuette of Eurovision 2022. According to the organizers of the auction, the money raised will be used to purchase a complex of PD-2 unmanned aerial vehicles for the armed forces of Ukraine.",

Already, some are suggesting that the new trophy may also be sold at a charity auction.",
