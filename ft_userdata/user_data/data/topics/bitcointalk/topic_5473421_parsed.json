  "content": "Hi guys I dont know how to give a proper title but here is the story Initially, I wanted to send some of my bitcoins from my wallet to the exchange for my needs.when I looked at the fees on mempool.space I saw a lot of unconfirmed transactions and crazy fee prices.I saw a strange transaction, he only sent around $0.2 and used a lot of fees, at that moment I immediately knew that it was a transaction intended to spam the networkand moments like this usually occur when there is a spike in the price of bitcoinmy question is1. Who is carrying out this transaction? There is a bit of a conspiracy, in my opinion, it is the pools who want to get a lot of fees, especially since this happens when there is a spike in the price of Bitcoin.2. Do you think this transaction will stop? I want to send $50 and require a fee of $15  whatttttHere is the image and address that I found https://mempool.space/address/bc1plqdm0ndmnfzgzhfd8jcm6xrfmdur3j36cxnsj3rrfqdlz0mvczeqch89pzhttps://mempool.space/address/bc1p0jk9wyzkuspp7pcpmalcexlpxgn2rua2m7w6hhr260rpk8ceyg9qewku7dhttps://mempool.space/address/37q5GbpAX6ZJgcVNh9G71CCBTA7tfkk9LE",

Whilst the fee spike in May was historically large, it has since cooled off, and both total fees and their relative share of miner income remain relatively low.Both metrics have lifted above their typical 'bear market' levels; total fees have increased by 216% from ~12 BTC/day to 38 BTC/day, and the the proportion of the miner income from fees has increased from 1% to 4%. Both are meaningful increases, however are still small in an absolute and historical context.",

Until NFTs were invented, people would go to auctions to observe physical art and would try to acquire it. They still do, I guess. Digital art is important nowadays. It can be used in websites, digital marketing etc. However, I think digital art can't be valued properly through NFTs and it can't be properly protected using them.Digital art is convenient. Mistakes can be easily erased. But, the purpose of digital art in my opinion can't be the same as this of the physical art.In general, I think digital art can't be equal to physical art because they have a different purpose.Physical art has flaws that can't be easily undone. Physical art can be portrayed in your living room easily. It has a smell. It is actual art. The way you maneuver your pen or brush can lead to something unique.",
