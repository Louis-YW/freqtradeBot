So for me, I am expecting a market recovery in the year 2023, before the Bitcoin block halving.Any thoughts?",

Well we are still trading below the 200 WMA and that was also a reliable indicator.It works until it doesn’t.",

As adaseb mentioned, I posted here in January that Bitcoin is about to touch 200 WMA, and then that will be the bottom.You know how things went, it's now a resistance as of now for Bitcoin. Also considering the economical conditions of the market, I think the bottom is not in actuality.",

Sure it’s possible because it no guarantee.It's actually very different if you pay close attention, the logarithmic scale has been tweaked to fit the support line, as opposed to a support line fitting any traditional linear or log scale. It's some bizarre form of logarithmic, as generally a logarithmic scale to connect these lows is done with a curve, not a straight line. A straight line logarithmic support trend was otherwise broken a long time ago.Not forgetting the other obvious flaw, it's only really connecting three lows, but the third isn't confirmed by any means. So by connecting two lows together to predict a third is nothing more than a coincidence for now. For sure it'd look good if $17.5K would be the low, you could almost consider it relevant then.",

Well if it happen before then yeah, this could be a super cycle, a theory that has been posted, but not really gain that much attention specially after the S2F model fails.So if ever we hit $70k-$100k in the next bull run, then there's no super cycle, just the regular 4 year cycle that we are accustomed to.",

It cannot be winter forever. Sooner or later, this bear season will pass and the bull season will come in. It's the normal cycle.

Apparently we just got to FOMO, not even bubble territory \"sell\", which out of all the things I'm not of fan of about this chart - particularly the upper band that should be more regressive and not parallel to the lower band - is probably about accurate imo.Quote from: Fundamentals Of on July 07, 2022, 04:26:08 AMAnother chart that tries to make sense of this bear market in a positive way. There are a lot of this kind of chart on Twitter. It is probably to somehow relieve the pressure and fear or even panic of a lot of Bitcoin fans. Think you explained it better than I did earlier, it's simply just a way to show that there are bear & bull markets, two ends of the same cycle. One thing I have noticed that I'm not convinced by is the idea that sub $30K is accumulation, but somehow sub $6K in 2018 wasn't accumulation, only around $4K. Kind of irrelevant maybe, but just an example of how the 2018 low apparently wasn't the lowest price for accumulation.",

For example the S2F model was broken in March 2020, which Plan B itself wrote about, but then it miraculously worked again. These models show well bitcoin's past and that it has been in an uptrend for more than 10 years, but no more. If it falls to 10k for example, the model will change, but will still show a similar picture.",
