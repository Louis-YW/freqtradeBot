No its not but there are people who are really that prefer or do likes to get something in return even though it isnt really that big but at least they are getting in overall total wager.This might sound interesting for some people but majority wont really be that interested much for this one.Its actually depending on someones preference yet in overall promotions are just good for hooking up people and setting up almost impossible wager requirements. rakebackis different though but its not really something for you to get excited on.",

I've never benefited much from them, as the imposed goals for input or bets are often above my playing standard.but I recognize that for those who bet more often and with higher values, these incentives can greatly help the player to have more opportunities to win.",

By your experience, have rakeback ever been profitable for you?I just ignore it, I commented it in another thread. First, because rake has gone up considerably just as rakeback has gone down since I started playing more than 10 years ago. But also the rakeback implies to play much more hours so the winrate is affected. It's not worth losing bb/100 winrate to get a little rakeback. In most cases it will be break even or even EV-.Years ago there were very good rakeback programs like Pokerstars Supernova, which was not the only one, and people were compensated to play more for what they got in return but nowadays not.",

Unfortunately its not how they do it because that would cost them a lot of money. One would have to stick playing in the room for hours so while you lose large sum, you get lucky if you receive $100 for rakeback. You'd enjoy rakeback when you are in a real offline casino.",

All gamblers knows about rakeback, no need to be a pro. In very simple explanation, rakeback is just something that you get back based on how much you have wagered on the casino. Rakeback is an important thing to have in casino, real players cares about it as they can get something back if they lose while wagering or they can get extra money if they win while wagering.",

But this does not mean there is any advantage added to win but just a way someone lose and be given some amount back and plaay with it.

By your experience, have rakeback ever been profitable for you?I always take them if it falls under the games i'm playing and there's no wagering requirement behind it because I remember there are casinos that offer these cashback and rakebacks but there's a wagering requirement. It's best to go for them as much as possible since it's one way to reduce your losses. My only experience with rakebacks are from Stake's vip feature and with the cashback, there was a time when casinos would have a dedicated day for cashback and they'd return a portion of your losses if you deposit on the same day.",

Makeback is a guarantee money base on your wager which means this is fair distribution of bonus especially if you are wageeing hige amount while in tournament, There’s no guarantee that you will win and get back the portion of your bet.
