There's quite a lot of blockchain related companies too that seem to go missed in mentioning these types of companies too (like uniswap and bisq) just because they're not incorporated but may turn out to be good long term investments (of course, nothing's guarenteed and uni seems to have done badly recently).There's only a handful of companies that come up with a Google search too, marathon and dcg/foundry seem to get a lot of mentions.",

      "body": "Companies developing any services or products based on crypto currencies try to create their own currency or token, and not use bitcoin. This model was most often used by startups during the ICO boom. This is beneficial in that it allows to control, for example, emission, like this the binance does by burning its tokens periodically. Bitcoin are unlikely to be used by such companies as a basis in large quantities, because it is risky to use technology in their project that is beyond their control. Also, it is not known how the regulators will react to this. I think such companies can use btc as a means of payment, but nothing more. In principle, even this would be a huge leap forward if giants like Apple or Microsoft take this step.I would not include hardware wallet manufacturers among the companies working on bitcoin (of which there are quite a lot), because this is a niche product.",

I'm wondering to which extent Bitcoin is moving away from a pure speculative investment to more daily life use-cases.I've found that on the web regarding the companies that I've listed in my first question:“We’re building lightning walls where you can wrap your websites with a layer of digital energy to protect it from cybersecurity attacks,” MicroStrategyI see another project called Nostr: \"This self-driven monetization structure can have major implications on bots, spam and bad actors in general, both on the user level and protocol level. In the way that Bitcoin’s protocol discourages bad actors by nature of its very code, Nostr developers are actively working to bake security and honest action into its technology.For example, some builders are looking into implementing costs assigned to relays, as a paid model that incentivizes honesty and reliability via proof-of-work models. In this potential design, for someone to send messages, they would have to post collateral in order to do so. This way, if there’s a bad actor, the reward could potentially be retracted as a consequence.Combined, this would allow for a type of social network that focuses more on building instead of censorship or centralized incentive structures.\"Remittances is also a use-case, El Salvador has been pushing Bitcoin on that basis.As you mentioned, most crypto-companies want their own currency and sometimes I fail to see how Bitcoin will become the de-facto crypto-asset given that it seems that not many companies are working on the Bitcoin layer.",

It is not bad at all.Bad is with altcoin projects that launch their tokens on blockchains that they did not build up and try to write well-worded white paper to attract people who are looking for hidden gems to join. Most altcoin projects fail to do what they write in white papers and roadmaps but millions or billions of dollar from investors lost in those projects.Bitcoin is a biggest coin and has biggest communities in crypto so you can not count enough how many companies have built up their products on Bitcoin blockchain.",

It is my first time ever I have been informed about it.I usually visit two websites when I need to find versions of Bitcoin Core.https://bitcoin.org/en/https://bitcoincore.org/The first website is a first one I knew and learned about Bitcoin Core but I did not visit it often after theymos announced the domain updates and changes of Bitcoin.org and the forum.Occasionally I knew about the second website that is more related to Bitcoin Core team and wallet software.I think it is really worthy to note none of those sites and including Bitcoindevlist.com are official websites of Bitcoin.",

Indeed I was referring to companies whilst many projects are developed by anonymous teams and not necessarily through a old fashioned company.I've read in the book of Andreas Antonopoulos that the payment use-case in bitcoin network is the initial use-case, same as the e-mail for the Internet.  It would be great to list here use-cases of Bitcoin other than payment and store of value, that could trigger the next wave of adoption.I'm thinking of securing websites and social media (you pay some satoshis for each post so bots are pushed away as it becomes too expensive to run them for spam).Kind regards",

Bitcoin was created to be a decentralized digital currency and a mode of payment or store of money that is not under the control of a central authority.And I think even though there are thousands of decentralized applications built on top of a lot of blockchains that came after Bitcoin, Bitcoin is still the best in the market and has it's significant value and its place at the top. So even if it doesn't provide the necessary tools and options for general utilities of any industry, it will still do way better than its competitors out there.",

Im not sure if they still have that option ? Since saylor still supports bitcoin, maybe it should. And paying in bitcoin to work for a company means it could be considered as working(providing service) on top of bitcoin?Not sure about theblock though. Do they have employees ? Lol",

I'm currently reading the second book of Antonopoulous and he says that Bitcoin is much more than payments. I also tough that the main use case was payments and store of value and that the fact that Bitcoin is not turing complete was limiting the use-cases. That's way I'm investigating on other use-cases currently under development.",
