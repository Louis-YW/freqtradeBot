  "content": "Hello!I wanted to ask if any of you have any ideas/thought inspirations for potential business ideas (own small store/shop) related to or involving Bitcoin?I'm aware that I could simply offer Bitcoin as a payment alternative... Of course, I would do that as well, but I'm looking for something with a bit more connection to Bitcoin.Perhaps some of you have cool and exciting ideas that we could discuss, or maybe you've visited an interesting business idea during a trip abroad (e.g., El Salvador, Venezuela, etc.) that could serve as inspiration.Thank you very much for your responses!Yours sincerely,DrHodler59",

For instance if you're in car detailing, you could make wraps with bitcoin related stuff and place them on people's cars if they want to drive with their wallet QR code on a bumper and such. I've heard that reselling and refurbishing used mining equipment can pay well, but you have to know how to do it.",

Maybe he will feel far more comfortable doing something else on the lines of what what was suggested by coolcoinz because it removes intermediaries but that is for the OP to expand on.",

Already some of the businesses here locally accepted payment and offered some kind of discounts in Bitcoin.I'm not sure what kind of business ideas you are asking.",

      "body": "If your idea is a small store/shop as you wrote in the OP:I don't know where you're located, but many people do not have access to a store selling goods covering basic needs (clothing, grocery articles) with Bitcoin and for a competitive price. Most stores in my country which accept Bitcoin either only offer a limited range of mainly high-priced and imported goods (for example phones), hospitality (hotels/apartments for tourists), or they are demanding a large premium (think of the Amazon resellers).Entering this niche can be a business idea, but of course you have to research if the market with the goods you're wanting to sell is already saturated. Also research which gift cards are sold in your country via Bitrefill, because gift cards of course compete with physical goods.Alternatively you could provide gift cards yourself cooperating with businesses which are still not accessible on sites like Bitrefill and could have demand from Bitcoiners.If the goods you're selling are low-cost, I would also suggest to accept other cryptocurrencies like LTC or XMR, because they are more convenient due to their lower transaction fees.",

As a business operator, you must consider some things like.How the customer payments in bitcoin, to your business wallet, will be stored. It relates to security of your business fund, treasury that must be secured and safe.What will you do with customer payments? Do you store it as your business investment in Bitcoin or will you have to sell it to get money for your business operation?It decides your plan to hold your bitcoin from customer payments or sell it immediately after receiving.Marketing, how do you attract customers to your business and convince them to use bitcoin as payment method?If you have to do discount for them, it can affect your business budget, net ROI.As customers, they have to think of extra on chain transaction fee if they use Bitcoin blockchain as payment method. They will have to ask whether your business take care of their on chain transaction fee.Customers will not be ready to pay extra fee.Lightning Network can be a good choice for business with not big transactions from customers.",

And if you are looking for business ideas based on bitcoin, the same way children's toy designers rely on superhero movies to create models of Marvell or DC superheroes, you can also take advantage of this idea with bitcoin. It will all depend on your field and expertise as well as the demand in your area, as coolcoinz suggests: physical coins, logos, toys...For example, in my country, some fashion businesses sell clothes, hats, shoes...all with bitcoin logos or related to cryptocurrency. In addition, there are cafes with spaces and interiors designed with bitcoin logos or images, and Lego bitcoin models are displayed around the cafe...",
