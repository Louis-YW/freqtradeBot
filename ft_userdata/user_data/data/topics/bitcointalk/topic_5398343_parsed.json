      "body": "I will prefer polygon over aave. Polgyon was a blockchain token and this means the ecosystem that used polygon is far bigger compared with aave. I will not say aave was bad but this is only a token that used on its platform. You will not see utility for aave token in another platform. The usability was also being limited unlike polygon which can be used in various blockchain of platforms. Aave has some limitations to the its holders",

(ethereum 2.0 could hurt polygon significantly)Eventually it is not that it can damage it, what the ETH network has to correct is its high fees and make congestion not a problem, but I understand that the ETH2.0 programmers had withdrawn and to be able to do the update it is a very hard and arduous job that takes a long time, even so the programmers are at 100% almost 24 hours a day there.For now, the Polygon network is the one that many developers want to develop all their projects over there, but I would not trust myself, the ETH network has much more time, and where the scalability problems are completed well, it will be the best network of all.",

(ethereum 2.0 could hurt polygon significantly)Both are having the same risk and which thing that makes you think if aave has less risky compared with the polygon. I don't even see that right now. I may be wrong about this but again i think that aave has the same risk as polygon although both have used different business model. Ethereum 2.0 was still only a speculation. The blockchain may be merged next months but again the result is still a big question whether it will significantly change the problem of ethereum or not.",

I also thought so and if these two cryptocurrencies were compared for now, many people would definitely choose Matic because of the reason that the Polygon network is still very smooth and Matic also still has the potential to be owned by everyone.",

Several testnet projects as well as alternative ethereum networks for their NFT transactions prefer the MATIC network as a cheap, secure, and easy network. Yes, maybe the two are not much different but MATIC is growing faster than AAVE, although AAVE definitely has its unique advantages, but still some people want to choose the one that the majority use.",

I know that aave was a very popular defi but i will try to remind you that if aave was only fully working when you are using its platform. So many defi in the polygon blockchain were adopting polygon or matic as the main pair as well. You can see which one that gives more benefits to the holders. That's why polygon is very promising at this moment. It doesn't matter if it was second layer but the fungibility of polygon was a lot compared with aave. Aave is not so good to be compared with polygon",

Yes MATIC is a coin that is being used every time a user interacts with any smart contract on its blockchain which gives it a pretty big use case. AAVE is a land/borrow protocol so this means that you use it only if you need to do that. Yes MATIC might bring more money to investors and yet they are bought great projects that will provide good service to its users depending on what the user is looking for.",

Many experts are too optimistic about both of them.https://currency.com/aave-price-predictionhttps://zipmex.com/learn/matic-price-prediction/Well, keeping them seems to be profitable if the said prediction is right. But somehow, we can't deny how volatile is the crypto market, we can just overthink that it all goes that way easily. Investing them still risky, we can't just rely on how these crypto experts say but also have to consider the ff; - market volume - the role of the said project in the market - market review",
