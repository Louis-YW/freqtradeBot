Due to the price drop that the main cryptocurrency has had.According to data published on his Twitter account by the President of the Republic, Nayib Bukele, 2,301 BTC have been purchased, in which a sum of $103 million would have been spent, at the current exchange rate.Twitter: https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1536800544894902274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1536800544894902274%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcriptotendencia.com%2F2022%2F06%2F17%2Fla-reserva-de-el-salvador-de-bitcoin-pierde-mitad-de-su-valor%2FHowever, the best-known cryptocurrency in the market experienced a sharp drop since last Saturday with a loss of 17.14% yesterday compared to the previous day, reaching its lowest level since December 2020.QuoteIMF insists that El Salvador must eliminate the BTC lawAccording to what I just investigated, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the entity with which the Bukele government was negotiating an agreement for up to $1,400 million, urged the country to \"limit the scope of the Bitcoin Law. Eliminating its status as currency of legal tender\" and also expressed \"concern\" about the issuance of cryptocurrency-backed bonds.Source: https://latin-american.news/el-salvador-loses-more-than-half-the-value-of-its-reserves-in-bitcoins/",

IMF might laugh for Bukele, since they are already warn him to not buy bitcoin. After all, bukele buy at the peak of the bitcoin price. If bitcoin pattern is the same, it may still take a few months to see bitcoin price going reversal. Bukele & el-Salvador must be consistent in storing their bitcoins, because if he sells, for example, at current prices, it means he has wasted money that should have been enough to build infrastructure in his country.",

Although, if they don't hold through the dip, we might see Bitcoin go on sale even more. Since, its confirmation bias for a lot of people, that if it fails in El Salvador they'll see it as a risky investment, which will never be adoption by serious businesses or countries again. I'm definitely not saying they're right in thinking that, but they will absolutely think it. I don't mind the price dropping a little further, but I'd rather El Salvador cutting their loses not be the cause of it as it could significantly hurt adoption in the medium term, at least from a legal tender point of view.",

In my personal opinion is because Mr.Bukele is aware that it is not the same to invest in Bitcoin as a company and as a country. El Salvador invested a modest quantity of money and yet they were target of a FUD campaign against Bitcoin adoption in the country, having organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund frowning upon such economical choice.The adversaries of Bitcoin and decentralizaction are already quite annoyed by the fact Bitcoin evolved from a project for internet crypto-punks into an asset held and traded by companies, according to them that was never supposed to happen, Bitcoin was supposed to be a \"scam\" from the beginning in 2009. You could imagine how shaken they felt then El Salvador took the first step forward from asset to National currency.It is not the same for the media artillery aiming to a company holding unrealized losses than a country being in the same position. Shareholders expose themselves to risky seeking profit, the people of El Salvador are not shareholders.So I think it was just Bukele being cautious.",

Probably the government have got 2301BTC which could've been increased through the process of buying low and selling high. There is a dedicated team within the country allocated with the task of work related to bitcoin. In the short period of time El Salvador have experienced criticism, but it is strong enough to make plans and have got the ability to overcome the situation believing in the growth of bitcoin.",

But the fact that its price already reached $60,000 is an indication of its potential to increase again.",
