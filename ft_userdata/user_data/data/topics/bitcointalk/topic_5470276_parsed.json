Someone could break into your house or your room where you have hidden it, find it and steal it.If a thief actually breaks into your house and requests for your seed phrase then that is no ordinary thief but rather someone close to you that you might have discuss your holdings with so the best will be to stay on a private about your holdings. And if the thief actually just sees Randomly then it was your lack of proper storage that caused it. Quote3. You lose your seedphrase and never find it again, or you forgot where you hid it, etcThis can be solved by having a one or two more back up but most importantly it will be hard if you actually have significant amount on that wallet because you will regularly remember and check that place.

You can't do that with bitcoin or crypto. Once your bitcoin is lost it is lost forever and you cannot call someone at the bank to help you. If someone robs you of your fiat money on the street you might lose a couple hundred dollars or something, not a big deal to lose such a small amount because that's how much people carry around at most. Most people don't walk around with thousands or millions of dollars in cash they keep most of their money in a bank. But a seedphrase could have someone's life savings stored in it, even millions of dollars worth of digital assets. It is much easier for someone to steal a seedphrase than for them to break into your bank and steal all your money.",

It provides zero redundancy and greatly increases your risk of loss, not to mention still creates a single point of failure on creation and restoration of said seed phrase.If you want to require access to multiple back ups in order to recover your wallet, then use multi-sig. Multi-sig effectively solves all five of OP's concerns. If you lose or throw away one back up, you can recover from the others. If a natural disaster destroys one back up, you can recover from the others. If someone steals one back up, not only can they not access your coins, but you can recover from the others.
