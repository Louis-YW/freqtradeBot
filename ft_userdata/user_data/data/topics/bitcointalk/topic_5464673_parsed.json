Aside from Bitmaxz explanation.Probably, There’s no enough liquidity on the exact price that you set up for your stop loss that forced exchange to marker order your position to the nearest available liquidity.For example you stop loss at 1.5$ while the next price with liquidity during the price spike is at 1.4$. Stop loss will just trigger your sell/buy order as market order when the market price trigger your set stop loss price. It doesn’t mean that your order will keep selling on the price that you set on stop loss. It still depends on the available liquidity on the orderbook.",

This could happen during thin market liquidity or when the volatility is high. You should plan your trades better next time.However, it's not a condition that should persist, some brokers/exchanges use this to scam clients under the guise of slippage, so if this persists, you might want to change your dealer.",

When the market is at extreme levels of volatility and the market crashes then Stoploss will not actually save you much from losses if there is not enough liquidity in that exchange. If your stoploss trigger is not enough liquidity in the orderbook, then the order will not be filled at the price you set the stop loss at, but will be filled at the price below that, at the price that the order comes in the orderbook.

I used to experience this scenario, It has both positive and negative effects on your trading, meaning if this scenario were to be that the price hit your t.p level, it would, in the same way, add more profit to your portfolio way above your take profit level, and it usually occurs as a result of a huge spike in the price of an asset when the market experiences high volatility in the price.  Therefore, to resolve this, and if you are using the Binance platform to trade, there is a button that Binance added to their trading platform to solve this problem which is called price protection, This prevents your stop-loss and take-profit setup from going way above the set price level,  you can make use of it by switching on.",

Trading with limited trading pairs is one of best ways for trading with Spot. You will not have to spend too many times to analyze many things for those projects you are trading with. By trading, your positions will be affected by news so you must follow up news as well that is time consuming.If you trade and ignore news, it's not good as sometimes with fiascos like Terra, Celsius, FTX, you must follow up news to cut loss and reduce your loss.",

When a company goes bankrupt or a shitcoin goes to 0, stop losses are useless and you lose everything. The best stop loss is prevention by don't touch shit coins and mintable tokens. Because mintable tokens can be minted by developers so if they want to scam and have their reasons to mint more tokens, they will do it.They will not be harmed because they prepare everything behind the scene. Only investors who don't know why and when developers mint more tokens and dump on the market.When they mint more tokens, stop loss won't be able to save you. If you exit, jump in again and more minting happens, you will lose more again. Terra crash and Do Kwon minting then dump on Binance is an example.",

This is always the feeling when the price bounce you out on a stop loss and do a reversal to work in your direction but have you thought of if you didn't put it and the price continue against your order and finally close your capital? Always use stop loss, it is better to trade with it because you have the assurance to meet your remaining capital when you lose the trade.Quote from: promise444c5 on August 26, 2023, 04:31:33 PM I had some scenarios of my stop loss being pushed down a little bit incurring  me more loss what could be the possibilities.

What do you think, that market makers will allow you win easily? Nah, not that easy. The big players know how to hunt SLs because they know where retail traders expectedly place their SLs and they want to sweep off those liquidity in corrective manner before heading to the same direction price was headed earlier. I said they know where most retailers place their SL because they look at Support & Resistance and wipe them off. That's what happened to you. To avoid such a scenario, what most traders do is wait for a break of the Support or Resistance level to place their trades and not place them exactly at that spot. Wait for a break and then place your trade.",
