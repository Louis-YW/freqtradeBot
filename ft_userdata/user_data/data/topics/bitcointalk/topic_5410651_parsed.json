But like any serious investment, you need to put your money there and forget for a long time, so you don't feel tempted to cashout it for whenever reason you might be currently facing.",

People are investing in the existing token which will not make them all become the next rich person. The quick rich scheme was only for people who are actively looking for hidden gem. I should remind you that those big marketcap coins were also starting from nothing.",

The thought of many not just the newbies was that when they hear crypto, it's all about being rich overnight and a scheme that they can easily take advantage.But little did they know that this is a typical market just as they knew before and it's hard if they have zero knowledge on it because they're like investing into something that they didn't now.I think the percentage and statistics of the people that are believing about it as a get rich scheme had gone down due to the bear market too.",

People should learn that most newly launched projects are just short term gains for the owners, marketers and influencers and not the investors. The long term value of any such project is absolutely zero.QuoteLet's be guided... But who will guide the newbies? We forum members who have learnt the basics should try to make them aware.",

Before, I also hold just 3 coins of different projects, mostly the known ones. But now, I cannot even keep up with monitoring every coin I bought, and some accumulated through different means. Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB. These 3 will not be gone in my portfolio. Those are the coins that built the crypto world and very soon they will be more valuable as more investors come in.",

Trader or investor should really not depend on any influencer though you can get their ideas and analyze it on your own so you can know if they are telling the correct signal or not, again it will still depend on your own analysis. Cryptocurrency can make you rich over time, there's a lot of ways here to become rich and honestly being a bounty hunter can still be a good source of crypto.",

In fact, many people believe that their meme coin could be the same as bitcoin, or even beat bitcoin someday. well, I assume that they are too hasty. even with very little knowledge of crypto, they sometimes dare to invest large sums. sometimes, this leaves them with a deep loss. well, I just hope that we can all be wise and realistic investors. we will never know what will happen to the investment that we have if we do not do in-depth and continuous research on the project.",

Genuine coins/tokens like Bitcoin are actually aimed to grow steadily over time and earn genuine acceptance. Investing in coins like BTC, Ethereum, and the likes takes time to reap its benefits, most cases it takes years. Such investments that take years to yield results are obviously not a get-rick-quick scheme. it is important for those new in crypto to realize that genuine investments may take time to yield results and should not be confused with the hype that goes with some meme coins that only benefit few/project owners who are able to tract the meme coin and cash out immediately, and leaving the other investors at loss.",

I agree with you though that many are entering the crypto market with completely wrong and exaggerated expectations. Of course it is possible that you will find the gem project that will make you a x100 or maybe even more of your initial investment but the chances of finding that one project are very slim because there are just so crypto projects out there now. If you are new to the market then the chance of picking the right projects are probably even slimmer because you maybe will still follow the advice of crypto influencers that are just shilling their sh*t-coin to you.",

Unfortunately, they hear many stories from people, especially on social media, telling them they can get rich by investing in crypto. This is what makes people out there interested and start investing in crypto with the hope that they will become rich people too. This mindset needs to change and people out there need to understand that there is no get-rich-quick scheme but they have to work to get rich.Let's hope these people realize it and think twice before they invest in crypto so they don't go astray.
