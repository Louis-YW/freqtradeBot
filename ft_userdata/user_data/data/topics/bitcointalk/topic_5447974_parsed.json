I don't know much about them but it appears your collection could be worth millions. Is the market liquid and viable at these prices? From what I hear these are like a status symbol for the elite online, most of the music industry, fashion, social etc have these now, or did at one stage.Personally I just don't get it, but that's just me All the best for your sales",
