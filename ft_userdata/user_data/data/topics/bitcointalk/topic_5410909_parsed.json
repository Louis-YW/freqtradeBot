  "content": "From the news I have come across, it seems that the former employees of terra form labs who developed the controversial Terra luna and UST have no escape. The Soul southern prosecutors office has issued a travel ban on Terra Luna employees. This is to prevent them from leaving the country and escaping potential cases and investigations against them. Many were also affected when Terra Luna and UST collapsed in Korea. And the estimated Koreans affected are around 200k Koreans and the employees of Terraform Labs are also annoyed, but other employees are willing to cooperate if necessary.According to the report, the passport of the CEO of terra luna may be invalid. Currently living in Singapore. But despite this, they were able to launch Luna version 2.0 up and down the current movement. But Do Kwon still denied that he cashed out multi-million dollars before Terra Luna collapsed.Referrence:https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/20/terra-creator-do-kwon-faces-prosecutions-in-south-korea/https://cryptopotato.com/terraform-labs-terra-staff-reportedly-under-investigation-by-south-korean-authorities/https://forkast.news/skorea-blocks-ex-terra-employees-leaving-country/",

One of those projects who gave millions to investors but also damaged a lot people especially those who are new in this industry who were carried by the waves of 'hype'. No matter how many times we say \"learn from this\", there are always people who are getting caught off guard. No one expected? I'm sure there are people who managed to foresee what happened. Still sorry for those who lost ton of money. I've also read an article wherein a person took his life out of his frustrations with this project, which makes 'it' fresh at this moment.",

I heard the government would soon put Kwon on trial, but I didn't know the truth. Better not to try to risk investing in Luna for now and let them sort things out first. Many other coins have the potential to give us an advantage while we wait for further notification from the Luna team. But if you still want to invest in the project, I just remind you not to use big money because we don't know the risks.",

Those who have already lost money in Luna have to move on and save themselves some sleepless nights of worries while investigations into the fraud continues. It is a shame that some employees of Luna aided that scam which has make alot of investors loose money. This scam is the talk of the town in this year's cryptocurrency events.",

Imo, there is no hope for this project, i know quite a lot of people are still hodling this coin and waiting for a miracle to happen, and i wouldn't really blame them, but those i'd blame are the people who still bought after the crash occurred, expecting a different outcome from the project, it is just basically rinse and repeat, with people hardly ever learning from the experiences of others.",

Do kwon was facing a huge problem and he may go to the jail as soon as possible. Terra luna collapse was a very very bad thing for a lot of people. I will not be interested to see the latest update caused by whole of news are about the process to bring do kwon to the jail. I just wanna see the result whether regulators can take a good step for the victim from this project or not. Billions getting wiped out in a few hours. That's worst thing.",

It shows that he is afraid when he returns he will face the law, it is clear that he is avoiding responsibility.",

But those who have lost a lot of money, hopefully you guys received the money that you lost here.

Overall, if you invested into Terra Luna, your money will not get compensated anymore so just move on and don't read articles regarding Terra or Do Kwon because it will only piss you and make your day bad .

Yes, it is very sad to see so many people whose lives have been ruined because of LUNA. In some cases, the investors even committed suicide. The investigations carried out by South Korean officials also don't seem very helpful, because in fact, Do Kwon is still out there enjoying the money he made from the destruction of LUNA.",
