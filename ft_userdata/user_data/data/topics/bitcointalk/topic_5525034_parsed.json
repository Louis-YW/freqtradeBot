  "content": "I just wanted to share some thoughts on the adoption of Bitcoin in general. I do believe, we are still very early. Most people do not even know what Bitcoin is or see it as a scam whatsoever. I think Bitcoin will easily see the $1.000.000 in the 2029 bull market. Now we have MSTR, Blackrock, Trump, and governments who plan to create Bitcoin reserves. We have never had that before. The 2025 bull run will be different from everything we have seen so far and it will probably continue until late 2025. Perhaps, we won't even be talking about Bitcoin in the future anymore, but about Satoshis, because it will be impossible to get a whole Bitcoin or even just 0.1 Bitcoin.  I do believe, holding 0.1 Bitcoin will be considered a significant amount in the future. You can probably buy a house with that amount of Bitcoin. Just think about where Bitcoin was 10 years ago. It really has just started since the 2021 bull run. I'm 17 years old, obviously missed the 2017 and 2021 bull run. But I have the opportunity to invest a couple thousand dollars this bull market, even though I'm not 18 yet. I will not miss that chance. I hope to be able to get 0.1 Bitcoin until the end of 2025.  My ultimate goal is to get 0.21 Bitcoin. However, for me being able to accumulate a whole coin, is already too late.I do this not only for me, but for my family. For my children and grandchildren. It might be scary to get started and investing thousands of dollars, you worked very hard for. But trusting the government is a thousand times worse in my opinion. Just look at the Euro or Dollar. The government can just print as much as they want. It's ridiculous. That's also why I'd never sell my Bitcoin, but just buy more and HODL. I don't care if it will drop 80% whatsoever. Because in the long term, it will increase in value. That's simple math. So I just wanted to share my opinion in general and think most of you would agree. P.S. if any of you has a job opportunity for me to earn some small amounts of Bitcoin, write me. Maybe you have a company and need some help, doesn't matter what.  I'm always interested in things like that.",

Nowadays, Bitcoin is already widely known globally regarding the answers to the questions what, why and how about Bitcoin.Those who consider Bitcoin a scam are not nonexistent, but a small number of people.We think it is still early, for most others think it is too late. The future of Bitcoin will be even greater and the amount of 0.5 is not the amount that everyone wants but more. The analogy of 0.5 can buy a car, a house and others that have been missed in the minds of people who are still Bitcoin investors now.Just because it is expensive for people new to Bitcoin, it means Bitcoin is a good way to get rich quick. That is wrong.",

However, it is important not to invest out of fomo surely Bitcoin still has a long way to go hence all the peace of mind is needed to grow such an asset class.",

That is always the case with most people who do not know about bitcoin, which is when they see that the price value of bitcoin in the market is too expensive, that is when they will decide to buy bitcoin to save and that is how bright their thoughts are, which for me is too late for them to buy.It is not the right mindset to buy when the assets that you think will give you massive income are expensive. Let's not be like these types of people who have this kind of mindset. So if that is your plan, then good luck with your plan.",

I do not even think that it will breach $500k on its next bullish cycle but that is just me, who knows Bitcoin will shame me and hit $500k in 2028 (that would be better).  But yeah, it is a free speech forum so anyone can utter out what is on their mind.The Bitcoin market/industry is still young and yes it is still early for adopters.  Countries are just starting to appreciate the opportunity Bitcoin Industry bring.",

It's driven by halvings, media hype, and big players trying to trick the little guys. What's the difference now? There are more people and more money, but there is also more resistance. Not only do governments keep an eye on Bitcoin, they're afraid of it. As more people use it, they will fight back even more strongly by adding more rules and cracking downYour goal of 0.1 BTC (or 0.21)? Doable in every way. Just be persistent and follow through. But listen up: just adding sats isn't enough. Get good at the game. Lightning Network? Privacy tools? Self-custody? You have to have these; they're survival tools. Bitcoin isn't just something you can hold; it's also about freedom and safety that regular money can't provideAnd fiat? It's going down. From 2020, the US has created more than 50% of all the money in the world. That's crazy. Bitcoin doesn't just protect you from inflation; it gives you freedom. Getting rid of the middlemen and taking charge again. Think big, but start small. It will mean more than just wealth to have 0.21 BTC by 2029. It will mean you saw through the hype and had the guts to stick with it. That is the real move of power",

Is just for you to be patient enough and focus, and you will see you will be profitable on it. Bitcoin has already come a long way all we have to do now is follow it gradually. We don't know where bitcoin will go in the future, simply invest and leave it for the long term, and you will undoubtedly achieve your goals. With all of this, we are predicting that bitcoin will reach 200k or 1m in 2029. We don't know what he will be during that time or whether the price will decrease, dip, or increase, we are just imagining,  but it is very advisable to invest when you have enough funds and invest large amounts so that whenever he increases, you will be sustainable.",

There were people who missed 2009/12 yet they didn't killed themselves, some managed to secure bags of bitcoin but they dump it big time when there seems to be little increase on the market, and today they are regretting for their silly acts.Doing it slowly or in lumps is a question of the fortune the one has - you can DCA big sums according to your budget, but to somebody else - that would be pennies. The most important thing is just to keep on buying and accumulating. Accumulation means if he has the money at hands because from his post there is no enough funds to keep accumulation, tho one can DCA with any amount provided he has little income coming by the ends of the week/month with this his accumulation process would increase provided he is not being aggressive while accumulating.One thing we must understand that bitcoin is accessible by everyone provided you have the money availably ready you can buy as many as you can, but the only that made people not to invest on time is the cause of lack of believe, trust and poor understanding regarding to bitcoin that is why we must study to have the knowledge of what we are venturing into. There were people who criticized bitcoin years ago but today I wouldn't be surprised if they don't owned bigger larger size of it in their custody.",
