  "content": "There's a theory circulating around that FTX was a laundering operation for the democratic party. SBF's parents are closely tied with the party and he donated a lot of money to their cause. Democratic senator Warren is anti Bitcoin and so is Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, who is also a democrat.The mother, Barbara Fried is, according to Wikipedia: \"a co-founder of the political fundraising organization Mind the Gap, which advocates for Democratic Party candidates and funds get-out-the-vote group\"The father, Joseph Bankman \"was involved in FTX, including raising funds for the firm before its bankruptcy\"He also has close ties with Elizabeth Warren and helped her with tax legislation. According to former FTX employees, Sam had access to all wallets and his parents were using it to help run political campaigns for the party that doesn't like anonymity, freedom and being your own bank. Makes you wonder how much access into the company books his parents had. Remember that they're both professional lawyers with a lot of connections. It's hard to believe that a lawyer with access to the company wouldn't know that the books are being cooked, unless he was doing some cooking himself. Then there's Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda that, according to Sam, lost all the money.QuoteGensler's former colleague at MIT, where he is Professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management, is Glenn Ellison, the father of Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend.QuoteThe general counsel of FTX, Ryne Miller, also used to work as lead counsel to Gensler at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11438875/Questions-SEC-chair-Gary-Gensler-agency-miss-signs-FTX-collapse.htmlThe connections are just too obvious.",

All I thought was they have a lot of backing and think they have that kind of power with all the access and relationships; it's safe to say that there is something fishy about it. It's going to take more work than being able to continue with that operation, knowing that there's an underlying motive behind it.

Dems and Reps didn't even realize that FTX.com isn't actually under US government since it's registered in Bamahas.

Predicting elections sometimes is very difficult, therefore these business owners make sure they sponsor leading political parties so that they can gain favor from anyone that finally gets power. I am sure this was SBF's strategy.The alliance between top business executives and the political class makes it very easy to manipulate the world systems and the common men are left to suffer from the consequences of these actions. People have lost so much money because of the actions of these influential actors. It is becoming clearer every day that decentralization is the most potent force to counter these economic manipulative forces.",

We all know that SBF was giving billion dollar loans to his associates. There's a good chance the REP donation wasn't approved by him and I'm almost sure it wasn't initiated by him, otherwise he would've donated himself. Also, the Gensler angle is sitll valid. He even had a conference call with SBF. IMO the SEC is dirty, just like FTX and the parents of SBF who were buying properties with the money he stole from the company. All this shit happened exactly when the banks are starting CBDC tests in the US and at the same time World Economic Forum pushes for cashless transactions. It may look like tinfoil argument to you, but SBF's father wrote a paper about cash and its role in creating tax loopholes.SBF's father was against cash and financial freedom and SBF had the same opinion. By accident it's the opinion preached by Klaus Schwab.",
