  "content": "As Bitcoin reaches $100k, more good news are coming as we hear that Trump has officially appointed a new SEC Chair in the form of a Paul Atkins. For any Bitcoin/Crypto enthusiast out there that doesn't know Paul Atkins, I do not think we do need to worry and here's why:Worked as a Lawyer in a New York Law firmJoined SEC as a staff for two chairmen (Richard C. Breeden & Arthur Levitt)Appointed commissioner of SEC in 2002 until 2008 during the George W. Bush AdministrationFounded Patomak Global Partners, a consultancy firm specializing in fintech and crypto companies, after he left SECCo-chair of Token Alliance, a listing platform focused on connecting blockchains and crypto exchangesIf you are not yet convinced this is one of the many services Patomak Global Partners, which he founded, provide: We advise cutting-edge crypto-native companies on how to manage risk and maintain compliance as they launch innovative new products. We also serve as a trusted advisor to traditional financial firms and Fortune 500 companies on how to leverage digital assets for growth.While this is the mission statement of Token Alliance which he is a co-chair of:Our mission is to promote the acceptance and use of digital assets and blockchain-based technologies. Through education, advocacy and working closely with policymakers, regulatory agencies and industry, our goal is to develop an environment that fosters innovation, jobs and investment.Needless to say, he is experienced and has credibility. Most importantly, he has long been an advocate for digital finance and regulatory practices. I am no Trump but I do think he is the perfect choice. We are about to see a overturn of how SEC functions and I for one is very excited. $100k mark is just the beginning and it can rise more with the help of SEC on our side.more sources:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_S._Atkinshttps://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-paul-atkins-the-cryptocurrency-advocate-nominated-by-trump-to-lead-sec-7175886",

It is encouraging to have a commission that is not anti-crypto and does not pass regulations that are negative to the industry, but Bitcoin does not need the SEC or government by its side to grow and people should not get the idea that they play a part in future growths.- Jay -",

Bitcoin Increased during his time from $15600 to over $70000. Do not forget that. I am not saying that as the government is becoming more crypto positive that the price of bitcoin will not increase but do not forget that we are also in the bull time. When the bear market will come, it can not be bypassed or it will be very hard to be bypassed.",

Rest assured, Bitcoin doesn't need the government's approval to succeed. It was doing fine without spot ETFs in play. But the government opening its arms to crypto, will make industry grow faster. This means higher market prices for BTC and alts within a short amount of time. With such impressive results, comes a greater degree of mainstream adoption. There will be FOMO everywhere. Hopefully, Mr. Atkins gets confirmed by Congress to help lead the SEC in the right direction. Kudos to President Trump for choosing the right people to lead in his administration.",
