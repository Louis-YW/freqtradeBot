  "content": "Scam: Integrity Concerns at Stake CasinoBackground:I engaged with Stake  casino, employing a predetermined script for progressive betting in the blackjack game. Suspicious patterns emerged as higher bets correlated with increased losses, raising doubts about game integrity.Evidence:I meticulously recorded gameplay data, documenting bets, outcomes, and associated hashed server seeds. This revealed a disturbing trend of escalating losses with larger bets, suggesting potential manipulation.Support Interaction:Contacting Stake 's customer support, I sought clarification on the observed anomalies. Initial responses were vague, attributing issues to technical glitches. However, as I persisted and presented data, explanations shifted. The support team asserted that each bet required a unique hashed server seed, a claim at odds with industry norms.Casino Link: Stake Stake  Scam Rigged Provably",

And it also means that Megaplay.io didn't give you enough time to collect evidence. But if you don't have enough proof of how exactly this site scammed you, it's hard to come to a conclusion, if you can, try to collect some more proof. Their representative exists on this forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3508147 , so hopefully they will give a statement from their side here about what actually happened to you.",

I wonder why, you can't even have access to it by typing the bet ID somewhere Casino often delete game history that happened few days ago if you are active on betting. You can request it to their support if they have backup but I experience same thing on other casino that I’m playing. It’s not a good proof that they are cheating by hiding your betsI'm just concerned on how come the bet ID is not searchable if their games is probably fair. Nevertheless your assumption that they are manipulating the result just because you lose huge bets doesn't prove your accusation. You can try betting using same amount and provide huge sample with fix winning percentage to test the fairness of the game. A single or few sample for a probability based game will not help you determine whether the casino is rigged or not.",

I suggested he should post this on Casino.guru and include the evidence he has just in case he doesn't want a lot of people seeing it(from what I know only involved parties can see important evidence).",

Here you are again with another complaint with no back up evidence after claiming to have recorded them all while playing with the casino. At least that could have served as a clear evidence against the casino you are wanting to make case with here.Most times this calls for questioning and if care is not taken your complaining might not be taken seriously anymore as members would take note of your activities as  not reliable and insincere. Do well to always back up your complaints and accusations with verifiable proofs for backup. With it the attention you desired would be given to you accordingly otherwise you would not be taken serious.",
