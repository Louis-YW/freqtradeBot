But I like to play grand theft game and god of war kind of video games. The video games I saw in the site as samples of the main games in the apps are SAGA games not 2/3Ds. They look like children games. But I will try them to see the out come of it. You can add more advance games so that people can visit the apps and play the games.",

      "body": "Before I move ahead with installing these games, I just want to ask: are they all totally free to play and earn, or do I need to deposit some funds first before I can be able to play and win those mentioned SATs? Because I currently have a limited or nonexistent budget for online games. So I will like to know how it works and if it's where I will just spend my effort and win some free cash, even if it's very little. It's worth having fun and also earning little.",

I think most of those games are working on free play to earn principle and if that's true then count me in as a regular player fot those games. I would like to know that is there any minimum earning cap after which one can withdraw the money or a person can withdraw the satoshis without any caps?I think the concept of earning satoshis is a new thing in such games because in gambling games the things are different but with those games a skilled player can earn enough per day. The young generation is highly attracted towards video games, and it would be a gold mine for those players because they can now earn by playing those amazing games.",

Sounds good and the games remind me of my childhood. Probably it is good if I try all those games, my favorite games there are the snake and the tiles which I think most people know if you were in 1990's childhood.I have a question, how many sats minimum amount you can able to transfer that sats into another wallet? Probably because it needs a large amount before you can withdraw it.",

Aside from that, I see that those games do have cool graphics like the standard games we are seeing today and the best part is, users can earn Bitcoin. Although don't expect much.",

Still there are tons of kids out there that might be interested on this, I just hope they are not asking KYC withdrawing coins because this definitely will be a scam when someone finds a way to use bot or AI to keep playing while away from their screen.Theres got to be a more interesting games or they could add an internal casino?",
