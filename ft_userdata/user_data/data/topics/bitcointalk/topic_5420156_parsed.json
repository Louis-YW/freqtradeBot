If you are asking if the creator of the piece will sweep any amount loaded above face value, no, that sure never happen. The private key to unlock the loaded coins should only be ever exist on the coin itself, usually under a hologram, they should not exist anywhere else and the creator/mint shouldn’t keep a copy at all,",

It’s about time to re-organize my bitcointalk reference links.20 out of 2520 it is then? Crazy rare piece! Also good to know silver version is more rare than ceramic, I always thought it’s the other way round.",

He ordered 100 ruby bearings to start with but unfortunately the bearings didn't turn out as red as he liked. With the 100 ruby bearings he created 20 Ruby Labyrinths, numbered 01/250 - 20/250.I can see the perfectionism at play here, looking at the pictures of this piece, the Ruby color is slightly lighter than the red he opted for in the insignias and texts. This is exactly why the Kialaras are so sought after, Max holds himself to an ideal far above the rest. Good luck with your sale!",

I really hope they don’t pop upOther than just a \"simple\" coin, Kialaras are such intricately detailed works, I doubt anyone right now would go through the insane hassle to try and fake them.It would be so much easier to fake a Cas or other high-funded tokens than a Kialara.Even tempering with it (like replacing the rubies or gems from other Kialara products) would be way too complex compared to easier targets. I highly doubt we have to worry much in that regard for now.That being said, it's ofc always a good idea to be cautious when buying a 2nd hand crypto-collectible and check for any inconsistencies.",
