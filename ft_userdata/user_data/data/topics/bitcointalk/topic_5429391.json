But, buying new tokens is more risky, it can even become a scam in minutes. DYOR/DWYOR",

You will find information about which exchange it is listed on as well as other essential information. But investing in altcoins or shitcoins is very risky, you should consider carefully and research yourself before investing, and don't listen to anyone's advice to invest. And it should be emphasized that you just did the right thing; you did not put crypto assets on a centralized exchange.",

Binance is one of the popular exchanges that has a lot of alt coins, but there are also other exchanges that offer a large number of alt coins, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bittrex.To find an exchange with most alt coins, you can use websites such as CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, which provide a list of various alt coins available on various exchanges. You can also check directly with specific exchanges to see the full list of available alt coins.",

Where can I check the exchanges with most alt coins?Thank you in advanceThere are many exchange platforms in which you will find thousands of altcoins and meme coins, but you should have experience in determining these currencies that you will invest in, and through CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko you can find the markets through which the currency is traded, through my experience I see that the best exchange platforms For meme coins, it is Gate.io. As for most altcoins, they are KuCoin and Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit. You can read the advantages and disadvantages of each exchange platform and all the details about them, and then determine which platforms you will choose.My advice to you is to stay away from meme coins, as they have no value and carry huge risks.",

Having said that, I would suggest you to continue holding your Bitcoin which is most precious & secure crypto currency, though currently its price almost 80% down from its ATH price but as predicted by many prominent market analysts, it might hit $100K in the next bull run which is likely to happen in 2024.",

( I'm not a fan of these tokens)But for best altcoins, kucoin exchange is best IMO.Many such projects in the last bull market were listed only on the kucoin Exchange but later they got listed on binance as well. I still recall some of these project's names. Dego, flow, kadena... I'm not saying, all altcoins listed on kucoin are good projects, yes there are some garbage too.

Where can I check the exchanges with most alt coins?Thank you in advanceIf you want to use a centralized exchange for your trading then maybe you can try Kucoin. They have a lot of coins listed and a lot of trading pair supported and they are among the top crypto exchanges out there and they have also recently published their exchange reserve data so they are pretty transparent about their holdings in this chaotic times.That being said if you want to trade meme-coins then you should probably use uniswap or pancakeswap because most of those meme-coins get never listed on the big exchanges. That is also the reason why i would suggest to never touch those stupid meme-coins. They have zero use-case and 99% of them are dead again within a few weeks.",

We get lot of assurance from the network considering there are hundreds thousands of miners around the globe working to mine that particular coin and this trying to make their way up to keep getting more coins. Such alts are best investment, we always have security of market depth as well as we know very well that miners got our back. Somehow they look safe to me.

Never hold these meme coins in your wallet because they are not worth it to hold for a long period of time. It is already mentioned above, it is on coinmarketcap.com and you will search there for the exchange and the coins that you are looking for, every coin has an option of which exchange do you wanted it to trade. For trading, nothing is good other than Binance, this exchange becomes a leading exchange that you will commonly hear about here, you are safe on that exchange but never hold your coins there, after a session of trading just withdraw all your fund and keep them in your wallet. Always have your own study and don't rely on other's opinions.",

Just be careful with the small tokens though, they usually ended up as a scam token so choose wisely.",
