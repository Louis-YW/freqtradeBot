  "content": "Even if I have bought some bitcoin a few days after the launch day, there is a 99% chances that I would have sold the Bitcoin, the enemies of holding Bitcoin for a newbie is 1. Market manipulators 2. My own psychology Market manipulators must have made me want to wet my pants, in the past years there are many FUD about Bitcoin, calling it another bubble, this could have made me give up. We all have our demons too, I could have listened to them, saying, sell, sell, sell, you dummy, this thing is going to die and you will lose all your capital. I believe it's a good thing to have grown with Bitcoin all this past years and have grown the confidence to hold through any weather, Bitcoin have proven itself to be the best solution to decentralization. Now I don't hear my demons trying to confuse me to sell, I was there once, I knew how it felt to believe in something you don't have trust in, today I've made up my mind, to always be with Bitcoin.You are not too late, you just find the reason to keep supporting Bitcoin, to keep holding your Bitcoin bag. My confidence in Bitcoin is now 100%.",

I have been watching since 2016 when price was ~700USD only and look at today's price as comparison to that.Do sell at the high and then buy back at the low. That should put in some positive energy back in you and it is the way to multiply your total capital.",

Its crypto nature to have a volatile market that you wouldn't be sure in decisions you make. The basic of trading is to \"buy low, sell high\" if you'd put your money as investment and not scared to risk it since its better to invest the money that you're afford to lose, then maybe you're in the moon already.Its fine to have experiences like this I always consider them as character development since you can always learn from it. For a long time you'll have wise decision making and good calls.",

Bitcoin has all the potential to generate pprofit for its investor but it is better to know that risk is present than to be too delusional with its market price behavior. Holding is indeed the best thing to do but question is, how long can you endure a bearish market trend. Just now, the market price dropped in an instant. Will drive or wagerness alone be enough to make it? Ofcourse not, patience will always be needed to succeed.

But in the case of Bitcoin, there are a lot of those who sold it in the early years. I compare this to the idea that not everyone is destined to be rich. I had many cases when it would be necessary to catch fortune by the tail, but unfortunately, I could not be in the right place in time.In the same way, it can be said that you cannot be one hundred percent sure that at some time you will not be able to be true to the word that you said in your post. There are unforeseen circumstances when people are forced to sell everything, even their favorite bitcoins.Therefore, take it easy, I always see people who swear that they will be faithful and one hundred percent sure of something, too self-confident. And as they say, self-confidence is a very dangerous thing.Hold bitcoins for as long as possible, but don't create a cult out of them.",

There are still more Bitcoin halving to occur, and since it takes place every four years, some one who is always buying Bitcoin with DCA strategy will always make profit during Bitcoin halving because it's believe that during Bitcoin halving, the price always go up.",

Newbie usually very gullible on trading which always watch the price moves every seconds which creates psychological effect whenever they already notice a price pattern. They usually sell the moment the price went up then wait for the dump which sometimes never occur. Newbie trader won’t buy token that they recently while the price keeps pumping.

In addition, of course, to fear and uncertainty.Today the situation is very different, even if Bitcoin falls to 3000$, my belief will remain that it will inevitably rise to a new ATH.",

Because one thing certain is that the likes of \"Laszlo Hanyecz\" who sold his 10,000 BTC for just mere 2 pizzas back then in 2010 will always regret ever making such decision back then if only he is still alive today, and likewise many will do the same come next 10yrs from now, if only they keep allowing the \"market manipulators and their own psychology detect when to buy and sell Bitcoin.
