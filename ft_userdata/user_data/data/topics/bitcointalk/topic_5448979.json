  "content": "13 years ago, having a bitcoin on a casino site as a deposit method was only a pipe dream; I'm sure a lot of effort was put in during that time by certain users here on the forum; some of those contacted gambling companies are now out of business, but Bitcoin never stop running. Bogdog.com was a well-known fiat casino back then, and they are now one of the largest that accepts bitcoin and cryptocurrency as payment. I hope Jimboway is still living to see what he recommended 13 years ago come to reality.It sounded ridiculous 13 years ago when he came up with the ideal because few people believed Bitcoin would be this big back in 2010.There are so many strange things going on with the US dollar right now, I believe that the US dollar will be backed by Bitcoin someday (the Us dollar being backed by faith is not enough); it may not happen now, but it will happen in a few years.. sounds ridiculous right?Russia is ready to develop a new global reserve currency alongside China and other BRICS nations",

If there is any means growing any stuff to a rapid growth , i think gambling is one of those means although i wont accredited the massive growth of bitcoin to gambling but atleast it played a major role and today many people are enjoying this advantage, well there isnt a casino yet in my place thats accept bitcoin as a means of payment and thats because of the crypto ban in my region but i believe like you stated itsÂ  only a matter of time and bitcoin will definitely stand as the number 1 currency and it would be accepted by the government in areas that have shy away from it.",

Bitcoin is still struggling in US economy because of some so-called experts who think that Bitcoin could be the cause of US Dollar devaluation. But in future there are some chances that United States and other countries are going to accept bitcoin as a secondary tradeable currency to fiat.If all countries of the world accept Bitcoin as a legally tradable currency then things will be different in crypto world. The volatility of Bitcoin will not remain the same and it will be treated as an asset just like gold.",

We certainly already understand the weakness of the Dollar, so no need to debate it anymore. So if we talk about the dollar backed by bitcoin, I think its mission is impossible for the next exact 10-20 years, it could happen in a hundred years when our grandchild inherits all our bitcoins. 1 important think is only if world war 3 does not occur, because when happens the Internet and electronics has shut down because of EMP (electromagnetic pulse), and maybe take decades or hundreds of years to build the world again like today.",

There's a lot of opportunity that it gives right now but back then they aren't used that much yet. Just like the Bitcoin, he's idea might sound silly but if you look forward right now its successfully adapted by people to use Bitcoin as transactions. It's much convenient to use Bitcoin as payments online and also less fee, if you think of it before with its value then totally people wouldn't buy it. His idea for sure gave an impact to the market of Bitcoin as many users use BTC for many transactions, he's actually genius for that.",

Not going to happen. The US dollar isn't backed by faith. It's backed by the US army and the CIA. It's backed by the fear of the USA(the so called \"deep state\"). There's no need to back the US dollar by any financial asset, because this way the FED money printing machine won't be limited by anyone and anything.Anyway, 13 years ago this guy made the right prediction that Bitcoin is going to be widely adopted by the gamblers. It's funny that he asked for donations. I guess that begging for BTC donations wasn't banned on Bitcointalk back in 2010.",

I could agree with your second statement though, time is on bitcoin's side but I still have reservations about it surpassing USD, maybe if USD becomes less powerful in terms of global trade due to more countries trying to get out of the USD as reserve currency game.",

It is good that Bogdog.com evolved with time and began accepting bitcoins and cryptocurrency. Some companies have failed and gone out of business mainly because they refused to rebrand, repackaged and evolve with some important trends, so their profit reduced and they went out of business, over shadowed by the presence of new businesses with trend.

Bitcoin won't become a base for dollar's value any time soon, I agree on that point with some others in the thread. As for China and Russia, it's been thankfully almost a year since that announcement, and I don't see anything that's come out of it so far. The USD is still strong enough to attract international attention without turning to cryptos, and maybe turning to Bitcoin would actually diminish its strength in the eyes of many countries that currently have faith in the USD precisely because they know that Bitcoin is not something under a superpower's control and can be very volatile.",
