  "content": "For upto 2 years of my stay in this forum, I discovered that the reason most ban appeals are not granted is the format or content of the appeal. This is not an official standard of making an appeal, but a hint that could help anyone make a better appeal that is able to warrant a profile to be unbanned by a moderator. I will discuss this topic in two subheadings; What you do wrongly  How to do better  WHAT YOU DO WRONGLY  Wrong caption: Some persons may argue that this does not carry weight. But I feel that on the altar of appeal, every little thing matters. You wouldn't know if the moderator is like The Sceptical Chemist who could be offended by a misuse of a punctuation mark Lol. The caption should be \"Ban Appeal\" and not \"Unban Appeal\" Wrong content: Funny enough I have read a ban appeal which read this;  I am unable to post with my account because I received a message that my account was banned. Please can an admin unban my account? No compelling reasons for unban: Just like what is discussed above, some victims of ban do not present any strong reasons to be unbanned. They most times base their request on emotions. Such posts read like this  Since my account was banned, I was unable to eat and sleep because I love Bitcointalk so much that it has become part of me HOW TO DO BETTER  Honesty: Here, you are expected to state clearly the reason of your ban. Be it because of plagerism, spam or spreading of malware. Some people fabrics all manner of lies or even pretend they don't know why they were banned just to confuse the community. They forgot that the moderator at the backend of the forum already know the reason for ban and the possibility of unban. Present Reasons to unban your account: Take the ban appeal like someone appearing in the law court to appeal life imprisonment or capital punishment. You should be able to convince the judges that you deserve a second chance.In the case of the forum, you can say this;I have been a member of this forum, since so so date and before your account was banned you have contributed to the forum in the following ways; You have made such amount of reports. You can link hillarousandco thread  You have been an active scam burster and link thread  You have written such amount of tutorials and guides, provide link  And other good contributions you can remember This is the best place to make moderators see chances to unban your account. Try as much as possible to attract community support: If 80% of people who are discussing in the thread supports your ban appeal, your chances of getting unban is great. State the reason you committed the crime that led to the ban: This is strong area to be remorseful and re-assure the moderators that such acts will not repeat again. It could be in the following form; I did so much research and I couldn't differentiate my words from the ones copied and I forgot to insert links Another person got access to my account and shared malware, I am now in control of the account and such a thing will not happen anymore  I made some low quality posts when I was not well and they got reported. I will step up my post quality from henceforth. I am actually not conversant with the bumping rules The above are samples as your own case might be different. But if you have nothing to say keep mute than making up stories that are lies. Any form of lie will reduce your chances of getting unbanned. Strategic bumping of the appeal thread: Don't bump your appeal carelessly, else it will becoming annoying to read. Have a good timing to bump. Maybe during new year, during moderator's birthday, when another user is unbanned or during any happy moment in the forum.The above methods discussed have helped many people get their accounts back. I decided not to link the profiles of such high profile individuals who used the methods above for some reasons of old scars.I will be happy if this guide will help some banned profiles to be recovered, but the best is to follow the rules and avoid the ban as your chances of getting unbanned is very slim. Also remember that matters are treated on case by case bases, there is therefore no constant yardstick to measure the severity of your offence and your chances of getting a second chance.",

      "body": "A very nice and useful tutorial for the ones who have been banned on the forum and want to appeal the admins and moderators to get a second chance to use the forum. I have also seen that the ban appeals aren't made in a professional way and they reach like that they don't really know why they got banned. No user gets banned from this forum without any valid reason and the banned account owner knows the reason very well but still acts that he/she hasn't broke any rules. It's always better to be honest and admit your mistakes rather than acting in a way to avoid your own mistakes and blame other for your ban. I have seen some members who were banned from the forum and they acted in a way that they weren't really sure that why they were banned. Those users don't really read the rules of the forum and continue posting the things which aren't allowed in this forum.It would be better to read the rules first in order to avoid breaking those rules. Once again the ones who follow the rules don't get banned and if someone has broken a rule in unconscious way then that person should accept his/her mistake and make a decent ban appeal. That way the member may get another chance if his/her mistake wasn't of a severe nature however if someone has consciously broken the rules and avoided the rules altogether then that person may not get another chance to use the forum again.",

      "body": "This is great thread, a good report will actually increases a ban member from getting his appeal granted. One thing I would say I notice about ban appeal not getting granted on this forum is that many do this banned members before getting an approval would have broke another ban evasion rule mostly by creating alts and continuing with there activities on the forum, so when they start the appeal and the community begins to dig them the evasion gets revealed and the chances of getting an appeal approved gets slim. So the other thing aside a good report is to read the rules and make sure you are not doing any action that will result in ban evasion.",

This is very far from he truth. Ban appeals are not granted cause most bans are legitimate and the banned user actually broke the rules deliberately, sometimes they broke it multiple times and they are not net positive members to the forum.However you construct the appeal and the support you get will not change the verdict.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5089777.msg48896084#msg48896084If you are bannedYour ban message may have an email address which you can email. If not, then appeals are unlikely to be accepted.If you are banned, this is the most ideal way to appeal it. A thread in meta can be made to support this and get the attention of mods quicker.",

      "body": "I won't consider myself an expert, but I think the major reason for an appeal of banned account not being been granted is actually because of the severity to which the account was actually banned. For starters I normally see all this ban appeal as a waste of time because before a moderator actually bans an account maybe the users is always frequent on the act that lead to his account been blocked and if that's the case, I think no matter how well you wrote the appeal, it's probably just a waste of time because there is enough evidence that warranted the account to banned.",

Maybe during new year, during moderator's birthday, when another user is unbanned or during any happy moment in the forum.Well explained, although I can only wish that banned users would take the \"precious\" time to read it.To be honest, I believe that about 95% of banned users are aware of why they've been banned, and expecting them to be honest and admit their mistake might not always work.However, for that remaining 5% (and that's being optimistic), those who found themselves on the wrong side of the ban hammer might indeed benefit from being honest in their appeal.But most of all, I couldn't help but applaud at the idea of \"strategically bumping\" the appeal thread, especially during the \"moderator's birthday\"—that's quite the creative approach! but I mean really?Why not also consider appealing for an unban as a Christmas gift or on Bitcoin's anniversary day? And of course, New Year's appeals could be seen as a unique way to kick off the year.",

      "body": "Yea, this is a very detailed explanation and a helpful thread, @OP. Some of the ban appeals I have read don't usually contain much of a good reason as to why they are appealing for an unban. Some people don't talk about how productive they intend to be after their account is banned; sometimes, the way they even write their appeal ends up annoying some memeber who have intentions to support them. In one appeal thread I was reading some months ago, almost everyone commenting there was against the OP. The reason is because the OP is not a good poster, and they said there was no reason to even unban someone whose post is just not adding any value to the topic. If someone takes their time to read through your thread and write a proper appeal thread, they can have the opportunity of getting a second chance from the moderators.",

I’ve read some recent ban appeal requests and frankly the OPs often try to sugarcoat the situation or act ignorant. This doesn’t help their case, as far as I know there hasn’t been any recent case of any account being unbanned this year. I think it will be more difficult to get consideration if the offense is plagiarism because the moderators often times do not ban accounts on cases of a single plagiarism, there is usually more than one plagiarism reports before they ban the account. A ban appeal is brief and sincere. It shouldn’t be treated as though you’re making post for merits, don’t make unnecessary comments to avoid the going off topic and derailing the thread. This is Theymos opinion on ban appeals; Quote Quote from: Theymos If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.",

Yes I believe even if a person has committed plagiarism, if he owns up to his mistakes wholly without making excuses for his actions, I think he will stand a better chance of getting a listening ear. I feel a way about regarding plagiarism to be the same as or equivalent to a crime. Stealing a person’s work is wrong and perpetrators should be punished by all means, I just don’t feel the need to exaggerate or make it sound like offenders are going to jail. IMO I think the forum take plagiarism offense more seriously than other bad activities that are happening in the forum, I think accounts that have been tagged and proven to be scammers should be banned.",
