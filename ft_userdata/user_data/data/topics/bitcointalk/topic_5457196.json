Everything about bitcoin discussion should be done openly on this forum. Take time to learn about bitcoin yourself if you do not want anyone to scam you. Start to read about bitcoin paper online. Paper like this ones:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp",

      "body": "@mocacinno is right, you just put a big target on your back by posting your email in a public forum. Also, I assume that you are technology knowledgeable so you should've considered learning about private message in the forum, that way, you can still talk to people and at the same time safely give your email to a person if you think they are trustworthy enough. Pretty cool that you're 64 and knows how to navigate online forums, if you're a real deal then that's pretty awesome. On the other hand though, it's kind of fishy that you give your email away knowing that scammers will use that to get to you, either you are some scammer too that plans to promote something through email correspondence or you plan to send some trojan to the people who will contact you through your email, I hope my suspicion will be proven as nothing but suspicion.Quote from: stevenjohnstone on June 22, 2023, 11:47:07 AMim just learning the teconology of bitcoin and trying to learn with the forum if you can help me please email me at stevenjohnstone@mail.com I dont know how to access forumsIf you want to learn about the forum, you can probably have a good time browsing the Beginners & Help board.Here's the link to that board, just click it: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0",

Just post all your questions here since this is the safe place where you can ask any information for free. There would be a lot of forum users will answer your questions so stop dealing using email thing since its kinda risky especially we are dealing with crypto.",

Personally, I might be wrong but won't take the op seriously as I feel he/she is up to something.",

As a newbie, your can ask questions of inquiries as to how things works on this platform here. There you would see some questions asked by some newbies and they got replies and I believe your questions are not different from them. There are also response there too which you can read for better understanding.2. Dropping your email address requesting for tips through this platform is very wrong which I believe you must have been called to order as it exposes one to possible scam and hack attempt. This act of yours looks suspicious as you are a newbie with no activities and reputation for a backup. You can do your own research rather than waiting for email tips as this would keep you more sensitive on the case matter.Lastly, I would advise you edit your post removing your email address as it is not necessary for the kind of post made here by you. Such email is not welcoming and others might have risk.",

      "body": "Why OP has to keep on spamming his email for someone to contact him and teach him about Bitcoin? It's because there is probably some ill intent and plan of his on who's ever gullible enough to teach him about Bitcoin. Isn't it hard to access the forum if he already did some posts already and also made this thread alone? It's likely that if someone contacts him, there's already some sort of scripted replies that he'll make for that guy to get into his scheme. Because if I'm a newbie and I do really want to learn about Bitcoin, the first thing that I'll search is through google and that's a vast of information for most newbies. And if still I am not satisfied yet, the next website that I'll go is YouTube and search those videos about bitcoin for beginners.",

No matter how many years you accrue to yourself here, on our forum there are people older than you who are quite independent and do not write nonsense.

If you truly want to learn and you don't have any hidden plans, you should learn it publicly so other newbies members can also be following you to learn at the same time you are learning it. The Bitcointalk forum is a place where everyone comes to learn or contribute by helping others with answers or suggestions they may have, so it is seen as a chat platform where things about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general are discussing. If this forum is where everyone can learn, I think any discussion should be discuss publicly. and gain, why did you decide people to message you in email, why not forum private messages? This really looks very dangerous.",

The fact that you are old and new makes you more susceptible to receiving a lot of spam mail from scammers trying to convince you what to do and what not to Do.I would suggest that you be careful not to trust all the emails you are going to receive. By the way, I don't know if you are real about your age or not, but if you are, since you already have the zeal to learn about Bitcoin, I don't think you would be limited by your age to read very well and also watch some videos. which I will suggest you read or see the contents below, it was suggested to me by a friend here, and it really did help me.Jameson Lopp Bitcoin ResourcesBitcoin for Beginners by Andreas Antonopoulos",

As if email is not enough you also included your age, what's then stopping you from adding your full name and house address maybe any one who have information about Bitcoin could come directly to your door step and teach you face to face maybe that could even be better than sending it directly to your email. Their is actually no need in dropping your details here. If you need any information they will be drop for you here, this is Bitcoin forum any questions and matter relating to Bitcoin is being discussed here, all you have to do is ask the question and watch the thread filled with responds from different members.",
