I understand that most platforms require a minimum of 100 to do copytrading, right?are there any other options besides bingx to start with less than 100?Not to sound rude or anything, but if you can't scrape together a $100 maybe you shouldn't be thinking about investing just yet and instead focus on developing skills to increase your earning potential. Just saying.That being said, I think eToro allows deposits of less than $100, I think the minimum was $10 (depending on your location and deposit method) but not sure - but might be worth checking. And remember that majority of traders on such platforms would lose money.",

Maybe you should start with spot trading and buy only bitcoin or other top coins. Keep away from tokens with hyip or apy because they most times end up as scams and will cause you to lose money.

However, Etoro seems to have a feature for copy trading, and Mati Greenspan who also a former worker of Etoro also provided market analysis years ago I don't know if he's still doing it.Having said that, I will advise you to DCA $100 in BTC instead of the copy trade.",

Before I am curious about copy trading and how it will work, so I tried it is the Etoro exchange platform which is very popular and the most suggested exchange here before --so I give hints on it. Until such day I realized that we need to move on with the strategies and skills that we have used. But the eToro platform is very expensive because there is a minimum amount to deposit and to start copy trading. You must have a minimum amount of $200 before you will be able t do a copy trading on that eToro exchange which is I think not bad if this is your first stepping stone to learn in trading.",

Copy trading have helped alot of newbies and have also liquidate the trading accounts of most of them. It's risks is  censorious and not advisable to trade if not having enough funds in trading accounts. Top experts trading pattern varies with contrasting view of the market, the whole process is just commonsensical and running at a loss would triggered prompt gloom-ridden predictions.",

So, there would be multiple hidden catch within those copy-trading schemes. Otherwise, we would have got many millionaires here.I remember, to avail copy trading feature on some exchanges, we need to pay a subscription fees which again adding another layer of losses to your capital before you open a trade. By the known fact of 'pro traders also hit stop-loss time to time', I guess we need to copy all 100% trades of a pro trader, otherwise we may miss some profitable trade but will copy a losing trade with all our capital.",

Then I'll go ahead in futures, to level up the thrill and profits, but of course you have to prepare yourself, study more, to avoid liquidations as much as possible.
