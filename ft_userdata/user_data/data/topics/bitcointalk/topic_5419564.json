  "content": "Labyrinth - The decentralized escrow platformLabyrinth eliminates the need for trust while transacting on the open blockchain. A complete, decentralized solution based on multisignature and time-locked transactions.Labyrinth Core (LAB) is an open-source, Bitcoin-derived digital currency that serves as the core of our escrow service. It supports the latest features as but not limited to Dersig, Schnorr, and Taproot.Labyrinth Escrow is a platform where multiple parties can transact with each other, under predefined conditions, without the need for trust. This is possible due to conditions being set and executed similarly to smart contracts. The entire transaction validation happens on the chain, rendering the usual escrow attacks impractical.TrustlessTime-locked and multisignature transactions ensure strict execution under predefined conditions.SecureThe platform relies on blockchain consensus rules, ruling out any unauthorized spending.DecentralizedCore transaction logic relies on blockchain nodes, and critical service availability is guaranteed.TimelineQ3 2022Starting development of Labyrinth Core blockchain, Windows, and Linux wallets.

We don't really know what is your development experience, but if you check the code you'll see that this is not just a copy-paste project. Every good developer out there will conclude the same.",

Sure, let me clarify the versioning so it's not confusing.The second argument indicates the version, you should aim for the highest one available.The third argument of the filename indicates the platform for which the release was compiled.The fourth argument indicates whether the wallet has GUI or is command-line only. QT means GUI, daemon means command-line.The last argument indicates the type of executable. P2P has no wallet functionality. It's used to run your own seed node.For exaple if you want to run the GUI wallet on Ubuntu, you need to download labyrinth-v0.1.0-ubuntu-qt.ziphttps://github.com/LabyrinthCore/Labyrinth/releases",

It ts likely that the machine you are installing it on has some misconfigured settings.
