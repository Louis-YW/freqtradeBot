A lot of people on this forum seem to be in their 30s and 40s too.You need a bit of an ability to learn, the rest can be self taught. I'd suggest learning well before you start investing a lot though - the technology can be unforgiving. If you give it 6 months or something to leaen how things work you'll likely be taking less risks and making more informed choices about whether an investment is a good idea and something you can manage well.",

Now it worth a lot.And think farther: do you expect to live more 5-10 years at least? I really think so.This being said I see no good reason you would not invest in Bitcoin. Of course, make sure you invest only money you afford to lose or at least to keep locked in bitcoin for long. And please invest if you think so, not because of strangers' advises over internet.Plus, if you can leave it to your children, even better.Make sure you set up correctly your wallet, hacks, scams and phishing are real. Easiest is to buy a hardware wallet and keep your coins there (and make sure the backup seed is always stored offline in multiple copies).",

However, in bitcoin, it's different because for one the market is very volatile, and we have this so called cycle, so in just a matter of 4 years you could get x amount of your investments if you get in at the right time, just like what we have today, in a bear market accumulate and waitÂ  till the next bull run in 2024-2025.As for inheritance, this article is a good read: https://news.bitcoin.com/death-bitcoin-digital-inheritance/",

      "body": "Can you answer a rather strange question? Do you know how long your young colleagues, who told you that you are already too old for Bitcoin, will live? Do they realize that none of us know what will happen tomorrow? So calm these self-confident young men; you may outlive them all. Therefore, boldly invest and do not think about the timing. Bitcoin was created for everyone, and by learning it, you only develop, further improving your brain and body.In addition, at your age, there are already more opportunities, which cannot be said about young people; there is already accumulated capital, which can many times exceed what young people have. Thus, your output from holding bitcoin will also be greater; you just need to wait for the appointed hour.",
