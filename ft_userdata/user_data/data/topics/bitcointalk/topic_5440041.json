It's very good for longterm plan.Actually, I still have many coins on the list when a sudden bull run hits then profit is on the way I just focus on the 3 coins that are making hype right now because I want to know different suggestions or opinions from the forum but yeah it seems that Shibarium thingy is just false hope because the bull run is the only answer for some coins to make the certain value increase, Quote from: X-ray on February 16, 2023, 01:31:32 PM Rather than dogelon mars and why didn't you consider floki? it's getting hyped due to the elon musk's tweet pretty much the same like doge and shiba.

The number of real worthy cryptos are only a few. It looks like the algo stable coin that you are talking about is the luna's stable coin but we all know what happen to them.I wouldn't regret for those coins because there is still no assurance that you can sell them on time as being greedy is already the nature of the humans. We should be more careful during the bear run than on the bull run because it was the bear run is the time for accumulation. Once we bought the coin that we think has the potential to skyrocket, we should also monitor them regularly so that we won't missed on selling them at the perfect time.",

Bottom is around there but has yet been confirmed. Market will have to be retested two or three times that means we will likely see it fall to bottom area one or two more times. I believe it will do retest not only one but likely two times.In bear market, it is bad to jump into altcoins and predictions with altcoins then pick them for your portfolio. It's better for you to pick them after bottom is in and market turns to bullish again.When will it be bullish by a new bull cycle? Look at Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Overlooking the first two meme coins on your list, which I find highly speculative as coins that will simply fade away overtime, personally I find Stellar one of the old \"blue chips\" (like LTC, XMR, IOTA, BCH and others) that has been in a sustained downtrend against BTC/ETH since 2018, over 5 years now. They will all therefore struggle considerably to regain any relevance in the crypto market. I reference those other coins as like XLM, they were all in the Top 10 back in 2017/2018 and have since been loosing value compared to the rest of the market, especially Bitcoin. Only Ethereum and Cardano still remain in the Top 10 since 2017 bull market high. You can spot these coins a mile out, they all made similar highs in 2021 compared to 2017, ie all still down 65% against Bitcoin since back then.It might look good against USD with such long-term consolidation but in reality I see it as simply a wide range (10-20x) that traders will use to trade from bottom to top in the next bull market. Ultimately, even if these projects do have good fundamentals, it will be overlooked by their failure to gain sustained value since their inceptions. This is why for me, these are coins to stay away from, not even risk trading.",

But as history says, that only happens once or maybe hardly ever twice in some cases. For Shiba, that already happened when those who got in earlier made hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit while those who invested when it was at the highest lost almost more than a third-half of their invested capital.So I doubt if Shiba can be revived again and give a chance to those who had lost a great value of their investment during it's rise to at least get a little compensation for their patience if they are still holding on to it.",

      "body": "Investing in altcoins can be an excellent way to diversify your portfolio and potentially earn a higher return. However, predicting the price of altcoins can be difficult as they are often more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It is essential to do your research and carefully consider the potential risks before investing in any cryptocurrency. Additionally, it's vital to remember that various factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, and regulatory developments, can influence the value of altcoins. It's also worth noting that investing in altcoins can be riskier than investing in larger, more established cryptocurrencies due to the higher potential for market manipulation and possibly fraud.Before investing in any altcoin, it's a good idea to do thorough research on the project, its team, and its growth potential. It would be best if you also considered the liquidity of the altcoin and the possibility of it being listed on major exchanges.I think these are the best examples of altcoins that have shown promise in the past:- Ethereum (ETH)- Binance Coin (BNB)- Cardano (ADA)- Chainlink (LINK)- Polkadot (DOT)- Ripple (XRP)- Stellar (XLM)- Dogecoin (DOGE)However, it's important to note that past performance does not guarantee future success, and it's essential to do your research before investing in any cryptocurrency.",
