FedNow is a payments service the Federal Reserve is making available for banks and credit unions to transfer funds. https://federalreserve.gov/faqs/is-fednow-replacing-cash-is-it-a-central-bank-digital-currency.htmThe FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash. The FedNow Service is an instant payments service provided by the Federal Reserve, launching in July 2023. FedNow will be available to depository institutions, such as banks and credit unions, in the United States and will enable individuals and businesses to send instant payments through their depository institution accounts. Instant payments allow individuals and businesses to send and receive payments within seconds at any time of the day, on any day of the year, so that the receiver of a payment can use the funds almost instantly.

In Russia, such a service has been operating for a long time and unites many banks. I can send a transfer anywhere in Russia in a few seconds from the bank application on my phone. Is there such a system in America and how long does it take for your partner to receive the payment?Perhaps this is a fast payment service, and perhaps CBDC will then work on this platform.

This is clear proof that the banking system is not giving customers the needed service, hence the Central bank wants to cover these vacuums. I think the American banking industry is going through a lot of problems that they want to showcase this service to divert the attention of the public from the main issues. This is because this fast service is also offered by commercial banks in my country and their transactions sometimes ate reliable. But the Fed didn't guarantee that this service will never experience any service downtime. Let's see how it goes.",

International payment systems cannot boast of such speed. If a similar FED system were launched in Russia, then I could explain.A digital ruble should soon appear in Russia, but the function of processing centers will be performed by existing banks. Therefore, it is difficult for me to compare the FED with the digital ruble, and say that these are similar systems and the same processes are taking place in all countries.",

The digital ruble should already start working in August in some renions, but banks will act as service and payment operators. There are many issues of lobbying so that banks do not lose profits. FedNow also does not have the ability to provide technical support to users and solve problems, and they need bank offices and their employees to do this.",
