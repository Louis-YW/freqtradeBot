      "body": "This is easy. Mr, Theymos is the wiser person. My reasons are, first doing DCA is a the most effective method when one is trying to accumulate because the average entry price balances the return on either loss or profits. Then secondly Bitcoin is bitcoin and no other cryptocurrency can be use to diversify it. If you are investing in other cryptocurrencies you are just trying to gamble some amounts to get more profits which is proportional to also losing it since Alticoins can‚Äôt be trusted. But with bitcoin there is almost more certainty that it will increase after bull run and if it doesn‚Äôt then the other Alticoins suffers too so diversification there doesn‚Äôt work. But wait Mr. Theymos been the wiser one, where I have I meet this name before",

If after Bob buys bitcoin, the price continues to rise, then Bob is luckier because he bought more bitcoin at a cheap price. Meanwhile, the profits obtained by theymos will be less if theymos only buy 50% of bitcoin and the following month when he want to buy another 50% it turns out the price is already higher so theymos are forced to buy bitcoin at a higher price than the previous purchase.However, the opposite condition will occur if after buying bitcoin the price falls then Theymos will be luckier because he can buy 50% of bitcoin at a cheaper price.",

For someone to have $10,000 that is ready to be used for investment, buying with that money is the best decision to make, IMO.¬†This is because when there is money with someone in their bank account or in their hands that was supposed to be used to invest in something and you enter the DCA method, where you plan to buy $100 on a weekly basis, there is a possibility that you might end up using some of that money on the process before you will be able to complete your buying order, which makes me see this part as not completely secure.¬†Then, for the aspect of altcoin buying with some of the money, it might look like a good one, but the success behind this is based on the investor's choice of tokens because if the wrong investment decision is made, those funds are gone, and it's a wasted effort.¬†But when you use the money all at once to buy bitcoin and secure it in your wallet, you might even be lucky to buy it at a cheap rate, and the only thing you need to know is how to securely store it.it until you are ready to take some profit.",

Bitcoin already has enough stress to think of than adding a whole lot more of stress to it by buying Altcoins that may increase during the bull run or may not. Which shows Miss Alice is wise but not wiser. And theymos with his DCA strategy is fine but the price this season is always going to sky rocket so since they all have 10k to invest the DCA is wise but not wiser because by ¬†the time ¬†he buys for every week with a 100 box he won't meet up with 10k to buy before the market skyrockets so if calculate properly the wisest among them should be the one who put it all at once leaving himself no worries in the upcoming bull run.",

      "body": "Easily Mr. Bob because DCA is bad in the bull run as you will be buying less and less coins as the price is growing, while buying all the coins early is maximizing the profit. And buying half of a portfolio of literally random altcoins will surely be a loss. Buying hand-picked set of hyped altcoins is a better idea, but it's a very high risk investment, and you not only need to pick the \"winners\", but also sell at the right time. Buying BTC alone is much simpler and is quite effective if you can play the bull run right.",

Miss Alice goes 50% bitcoin and 50% random altcoins.Mr. theymos goes with bitcoin but $100 weekly DCA.Mr. Bob- All in with $10k to invest on a bull run, just like on what mentioned above, on which on the time that you do find yourself that invest on peak pricethen you would really be ending up on having negative on which it might cause for you to have those impulsive feeling which might lead into cut losses, but if you are someone that could hold up then how long you would be able to hold up? Another cycle? Thats too long i would sayAlice-Diversification would be always that best, if you do invest 5k on Bitcoin on a bull market and invest on 50% on other alts then probability on on making profits is there. It would really just that matter on how well and wise you are on taking up profits on the time it do hit up your target.Theymos-Weekly DCA would be ideal yet you wont really that mattering on the current price whether the market is in bull run period or on bear.The main difference here is that you would really be receiving different amount of coins basing up on the trend that you are into. In bull then less, in bear then it would be more.",

Miss Alice goes 50% bitcoin and 50% random altcoins.Mr. theymos goes with bitcoin but $100 weekly DCA.Well, both have risks in what they will do, but among those three, I think the wiser is Mr. Theymos. Well, it's because it's good to do DCA now a days with the current state of bitcoin. If you are watching the bitcoin price, you will notice and see the sharp movements of bitcoin, either up or down movements, and from that, it's good to place a position on those down or sharp decreases in the price of bitcoin so you can have multiple good positions and a good profit. If I were to choose the second, maybe miss Alice simply because if you are waiting for bitcoin, as its investment is long-term, you can use other coins to do trades or holdings as well, but altcoins are too risky. That's why it is second. Last is Mr. Bob, simoky, because if you put all your capital in one coin and one position, it will increase the risk because your fate will be 50/50.",
