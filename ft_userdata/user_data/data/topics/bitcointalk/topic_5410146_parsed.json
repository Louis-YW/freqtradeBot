  "content": "Hello, ladies and Gentleman. I was researching the web regarding my own upcoming project as I plan to make it my biggest one yet. (Bulding an open-world 3D Metaverse on Unreal Engine 5, integrated with NFT's & more)Meanwhile, while browsing, I saw that a lot of people have ideas of creating projects, but they don't know how to fill/raise ICO/IDO/Private Sale and launch their project to the market. Who am I? Well, I'm just a regular person that has created a few multi-million $ worth of projects and I'm know in the space where ICO's/IDO's and Private Sale happen as the nickname - The Batman.  I'm an experienced Full Stack Dev/Project Manager/Professional Marketer & Project Owner with a lot of ties.I'm the person who can definitely help you launch a project successfully and you can make a lot of $, while your community makes a lot of $ as well. I will work only with people who will either undergo a KYC Procedure (To me & to the Launchpad Platform) while launching their project or Publicly Reveal their Identities on their website, etc. I can verify that all of the statements above are true by sending a transaction from my wallet.FEE: I will charge you 3,000 USDT + a percentage of the money accumulated from the IDO/ICO/Private Sale.I could also help you with the following: CoinMarketCap + CoinGecko listing under 24 hours. CEX Listings on almost all of the top tier exchanges. Verified Badges on Twitter/Telegram. Trending in Twitter (Worldwide) & a lot more. Contact: https://t.me/indigoeth/Best Regards, The Batman",
