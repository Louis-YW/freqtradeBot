  "content": "Welcome! In preparation for the upcoming launch of our original game Double, we're performing this seeding event to ensure fairness and immutable rolls. For this seeding event we are following a similar approach as Stake.com.  As part of our fairness we generated a chain of 10,000,000 SHA256 hashes where each hash is the hash of the hexadecimal representation of the previous hash. Being the last hash in the chain: b7c50c70656b9ff7e26b43e8e278d8d0104be29645361bbe9c3684d852e63a81Script to calculate Double roll:Code:const { createHmac } = require('crypto');const TILES = [  {number: 0, color: 'white'},  {number: 11, color: 'black'},  {number: 5, color: 'red'},  {number: 10, color: 'black'},  {number: 6, color: 'red'},  {number: 9, color: 'black'},  {number: 7, color: 'red'},  {number: 8, color: 'black'},  {number: 1, color: 'red'},  {number: 14, color: 'black'},  {number: 2, color: 'red'},  {number: 13, color: 'black'},  {number: 3, color: 'red'},  {number: 12, color: 'black'},  {number: 4, color: 'red'}];const getRollFromHash = hash => {  // random number from 0-15  const roll = parseInt(hash, 16) % 15;  const tile = TILES.find(t => t.number === roll);  let color;  switch (tile.color) {    case 'white':      color = 0;      break;    case 'black':      color = 2;      break;    case 'red':      color = 1;      break;  }  return {    tile: roll,    color: color  }}// these will be the 10M pre generated rolls to be usedconst hashChain = [];const gameHash = hashChain.pop();// It's the hash we're gonna be using of the result of a yet to be mined block on the blockchain #813,955const blockHash = '';const hash = createHmac('sha256', gameHash).update(blockHash).digest('hex');const {tile, color}= getRollFromHash(hash);console.log({ tile, color });We’re gonna be using a BlockHash that hasn’t been mined at the time of this post, we’re expecting to use Bitcoin block 813,955, this to prove we have no influence over the outcome of the game. Please guys feel free to quote this post so this will be all set in stone.Looking forward to show you guys Double very soon!",

Welcome to the forum!Just wanted to give you a friendly reminder about the rule we have here to keep things organized - One thread per site ONLY!  I noticed you started a couple different ones for your seeding events, which is totally understandable! But to keep the board neat and easy to follow, it'd be great if you could keep them all into one main thread for your casino and  that way people can find all the info in one spot.  You can check out the sticky thread at the top of this board for more details.",

      "body": "Op we appreciate you for bringing Double to the forum. We are waiting to see the casino with the events that follow. Op you are bringing a new gaming method, but the fairness of the game cannot be discussed now because we have not seen and participate in the game. Op in the website you have to explain how the game will be played so that people can follow up, because this is new to many. You can also explain it on the ANN thread too. Once again you are welcome.",

If that is so, then I am sure no one can doubt the fairness of the game.",
