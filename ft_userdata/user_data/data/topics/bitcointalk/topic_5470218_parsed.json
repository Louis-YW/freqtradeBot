Only trade with reputed merchant, after you dun verify say the merchant na verified one you need trade with those wey get reputation, you go see am for their profile, how many trade dem dun get, their rating dem based on how many trade dem dun complete and so on. No released if you never received, if you release coin to dem, dem go likely scam you so e better you wait to receive money before you process the releasing of coin to dem when you dey sell. To avoid network wahala use microfinance banks and not our main banks wey sabi get Network issue so dem no fit use the excuse of network to scam you. Most verified merchant also use microfinance banks so dem no go get network wahala  To increase your privacy, no dey trade with only one marchant and no accept to send them your number or go offline trading because dem fit scam you and no platforms go dey to  protect you through escrow. Avoid high rates and read the platform rules on protecting yourself when you dey trade so you go fit follow their guidelines and not fall a victim to scammers because dem plenty for all this platforms dey look for their next victim.",

The scam wey I don notice for the WhatsApp trading group wey I dey use before I come dey use Binance be say some scammers dey impersonate real traders. Dem go change their names to a recognized trader wey no dey active for a while. When you want sell your coin, them go accept to buy and if you send the coin without cross checking the profile against the real traders them go scam you.",
