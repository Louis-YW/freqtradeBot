I see some famous social media user bought $2M of LUNA as an investment but right now his current asset in LUNA is $1,000 but it goes lower as of now so I think it is lower than $1,000.",

DO not imagine for a second that it will ever recover, reality is that it's fully gone and will never recover. We have seen death of a coin, and it was always known. Anyone who has invested into any other algorithm stablecoin before would know that the system doesn't work, sure the \"logic\" of it may look solid, but if you use enough money then you could take all of their money and make their stablecoin go down, so the algo fails when put more money than the system has against it. If you knew this, you would have stayed away from it and that is what I did, I learned my lesson a year ago, so this wasn't new.",

I'm also surprised on what happen to Luna to since they are one of the top coins I looking up to and its really sad to see money burned for many investors due to this situation happen to them. I wonder what Do Kwon do some counteraction on this.Also the reported suicides are fake base on this article https://www.thereportertimes.com/technology/fake-suicide-news-went-viral-after-terra-luna-coin-crash/ so best not to believe what you read on internet without any proof.",

If LUNA are able to burn huge number of their supplies and this revival plan becomes a successful, there's a chance for at least a $1 with LUNA, maybe before the year end especially if the whole cryptomarket recovers.",

      "body": "This is an unfortunate situation in the crypto space. I pray this situation does not repeat itself again. According to binance LUNA algorithm failed leading to de-pegging from USD. At the moment, IMO recovery depends on the team and what lead to the de-pegging. If the team mean well for the investors they can make some concerted effort to recover. When the unfortunate incidence happened, Binance communicated to LUNA team, but there was not response from LUNA team, thereby making it difficult for Binance to take some steps that may have helped the situation. At the moment, I am yet to hear any news from LUNA team what went wrong and the chances of recovery. LUNA recovery will depend largely on their decision.As regards those who lost their assets on the LUNA and UST investment, I will advise no one should hurt himself or herself. I always believe that once there is life, there is hope. Secondly, it has been discussed in this platform a number of times that you should always invest what you can afford to loose. This is one one the most important investment adage that should not be ignored.",

Luna will never remain the same again even if it survives because the whole model has collapsed, I expect ANC and UST to go down. Most investors already lost their money but if they invested the amount that they could afford to lose then they should be fine, for others who overinvested they should remember that there is more to life than money and they should speak out and get help from their loved ones.",

Probably they put all their savings in luna and become hopeless coz of the situation which is reason they committed suicide.  I hope you all guys stay calm and relax! Infact luna is a legitimate project so for sure they will make a way to fix the problem.  And stop wasting your lives coz of as long as you didn't sell you still have a chance to recover all losses.  Just keep believing and don't lose hope.",

There are no statistical data to back up this claim, which means it can’t be true – even though some people believe otherwise!The news of “8 Confirmed Suicides due to Luna Coin Crash” went viral on Social Media. The story initially started popping up in Pakistani-based media outlets and then made its way onto major Crypto-related Twitter handles – though many have called out these accounts for reporting fake information as they were never able to confirm any such thing happening at all!Media outlets all over the world were alerted to this controversial story when a Twitter handle claiming ownership of Luna Coin released a statement on their website that eight people had killed themselves due to its recent plunge in value. The first source for viral claims found among those who believed it was legitimate? A Pakistani user @republicdotpk with more than 10 thousand followers!8 Confirmed Suicide Due to the $Luna Crash. Why Luna Crashed? Truth & Reason ExplainedThere are no confirmations anyone has suicided because of LUNA crash. So far, the only one to have died on this story is LUNA itself. News and social media profiles telling the opposite are just trying to profit income and popularity through clickbait and fake news.About LUNA's recovery I'm not sure, because it seems the ecosystem doesn't work at all. Stablecoins must be attached to fiat currencies instead of cryptocurrencies to maintain stability in price while keeping the environment safest as possible for investors. Anyway, Terra's CEO has come to his twitter saying there is an action plan which consists in \"deploying $1.5 billion in capital – in BTC and in UST – to defend the peg\".",

I doubt that it will recover soon, history tells us that if a altcoin (shitcoin) reputation has been damage, either by rug pull, a lawsuit by SEC (you can make an argument against XRP) or any other things, it will be hard to recover.And as we can see in Luna's case, this seems to be pre-meditated and might have been plan after all, just saying.
