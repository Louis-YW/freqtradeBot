The view that migrating everyone to electric cars would be a great idea but mining BTCitcoin would cause a lot of damage to the environment, what a bunch of jokers trying to find a cause and then rally against it. FYI many miners are using renewable energy and if these sort of discussions are created thinking BTCitcoin will change from POW to POS, then it is not going to happen.",

The need to put cryptos in the frontiers of environmental degradations is something I would never understand. Of course crypto minings consumes energy but its not as bad as it seems.What happens to the actual production of these energies with regards to the fractional distillation process. There are a lot of emissions at these points too and have depleted the ozone layer far more before the cryptocurrency innovation and still, no drastical step have been taken to its mitigation.I think most if these anti cryptos be careful of the sort of messages they put out because it would result in an unbelief in the system even when it works someday. They shouldn't promote certain messages out of grudge.",

Until Airlines stop being subsidised by the governments and start being powered by electricity I don't think this is going to change - one of the biggest polluters, especially per person.Reminds me of how members of the World Economic Forum flew their in their private jets to discuss how to cut greenhouse emissions. QuoteMost of the other electricity being produced could go to being 100% renewable within a year, there's just been little incentive on governments to do it (there's also been less of an acceptance of making global power grid structures like the Internet has which would also greatly reduce and standardise everyone's electricity costs - even if companies have the option to withdraw).The whole world to go green in a year? They'd have to spend their whole defense budget on that and still wouldn't make the deadline. Some countries would be able to do it in a year, others that rely on coal would not. You can't for instance go 100% solar because panels don't produce any power at night. Wind power sucks because it requires a lot of copper to make the generator and copper is expensive. QuoteGovernments banning crypto mining might be a misdirected influence attempt from certain countries to monopolise on the mining industry further than has already been done too - as crypto mining with non renewables was already fairly infeasible in a lot of Europe especially from sources that aren't nuclear or renewable. I'm sure there's a lobby of banks feeding this narrative that crypto isn't green and therefore politicians shouldn't associate themselves with it.",

Even if mining activities are somehow halted, it will not automatically address and solve the environmental issues that they claim bitcoin is causing. I always say that the people who hide behind this reason solely to criticize bitcoins are hypocrites, and should seek clarity. Just as safer alternatives are being sought to address the environmental challenges that other factors contribute to the environment, the conversation should be more about how to safely mine bitcoin without damage to the environment, the solution and not the problem.",

Just look at this comparison:QuoteIn general terms, utilities are accepted as they add value to society. Their energy consumption becomes less a question of morality than one of basic human necessity. For example, household tumble dryers in the U.S. consume 108 TWh of energy a year, while Bitcoin uses 62 TWh a year. The graph below illustrates similar comparisons with other socially-accepted utilities, such as data centers which give us access to Netflix and popular gaming platforms such as Playstation, for example.[1] https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/crypto-energy-consumption/",
