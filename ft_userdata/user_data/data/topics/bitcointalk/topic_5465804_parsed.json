The only way that a user can remove the neg-trust in his profile is when the person that gave him/her in the first place decide to remove it, you can’t remove yourself neither can other members do it for you.Another thing I have witnessed is, when you’re wrongly accused and given a neg tag and it’s obvious that it was not worth a negative tag a DT-member can counter the tag with a positive tag i.e write against the negative tag so that anyone going through your trust feedback would be able to know that you were wrongly accused.

That is what the Reputation board is all about. Once you feel you have been wrongly tagged, you create a thread on reputation board and the members will look into it, if it is true that tag was actually wrong then those who left the tag will definitely remove it or at most change it to neutral base on the new information they finds out. In a scenario where one user who creates flag doesn’t wants to change it after substantial evidence has been found then other DT members will oppose the flag and if the number supersedes the supporters then it would not be visible.

      "body": "The first thing you should be clear about is the difference between trust feedback and trust flags. The trust feedback is what you can see in the profile in green, red or black. Green is for positive feedback, red for negative feedback and black for neutral feedback. In theory red and green are for managing trading risk, for example if you make a successful trade with someone on the forum, you can leave positive feedback. If, on the other hand, he scammed you, you leave negative feedback. In this case it would be convenient to add a trust flag, which you have a whole thread to read about. Trust flagsAbout the rest I think you have been answered well, like if someone leaves you negative feedback, you can open a thread in the Reputation section, although I would recommend you to send them a PM first asking them to remove it, and whether they remove it or not will depend on the person.",

DT members remain in principle, they do not easily revoke Red trust on accounts that have committed violations that have been determined in the forum.",

If you believe that the feedbacks posted by a user are wrong, you can simply distrust the user, so that the feedbacks posted by him are not shown as trusted feedback for you.

I need answers...This trust system makes this forum environment feel decentralized. The trust system is not moderated so anyone can give you a negative or positive trust but a trust rating from DT members matters. It's not like a centralized authority where the leader selects whom to trust and others follow his commands. I saw DT members arguing with each other on different topics. So if a DT member puts a negative trust rating with inequity then sometimes other DT members talk against it. So they always try to be careful when putting a trust rating on someone.",

Bear in mind that Trust counter values (positive; neutral; negative) display values based on your Trust list. The vast majority used the default Trust list, whilst a reduced set of people use a Customized Trust list (like I do). The values one sees on these counters may differ to those seen with a default Trust list (i.e. I could be seeing +0 / =0 / -2 whilst you could be seeing +0 / =0 / -1), and the feedback could visually move section from Trusted feedback to Untrusted feedback or vice-versa). The counters show only values derived from your Trust list (be it default or custom), and correlate to what´s seen on the Trusted Feedback (meaning not under the Untrusted feedback section). Since, as said, most people have a default Trust List (level 2), Feedback from the DT network (up to level 2) are what count towards the Trust counters for the most. That’s why, in general terms, people are more concerned with trust received from DT1/DT2 than with trust received from other accounts. Note that DT members vary over time, which may change the impression of the received feedback one way or another.And no, trusted feedback has historically not always been used in accordance to what it was intended for (commerce related). For example, my trust profile has a bunch of positive feedback which is not commerce related. It also includes 2 negative ratings under Untrusted feedback, both retaliation for having tagged them first.",
