We have a browser with lots of features, an anonymous messenger, support for content creators.By the way, did you know that if you create a channel on our platform (it's like creating your own server in Discord), our ecosystem will pay you from $0.3 to $1 for each active member of your community.We are a high tech project and you are given the opportunity to represent us at cryptocurrency conferences.You can message me on Telegram @JoBraver",

      "body": "What you wrote sounds very lucrative and interesting. I am interested in opening up a dedicated channel exclusive for the Indian community. I would then like to ask how do you guys pay for the community that is active in your ecosystem. Do you guys pay in Bitcoin or your own native token? I have no issues getting paid in your native token but others will have as they are here for Bitcoin. The reason for me asking you such a question is to understand where exactly your token is trading? I would need others to know that payment is not complicated. Next issue would be if those exchanges have mandatory  KYC policy? It is hard to convice a community in these times to follow an altcoin. If you are paying in Bitcoin then it would not be an issue to get a huge number of community members in your ecosystem. Do reply to my question! If you want members from our community.",

They have chat, mail, browser and the last time I checked they were launching music streaming within thier platform. Thier ecosystem is fueled by thier native token Crypton($CRP). The token is currently traded on a few exchange and is listed on CMC. You need to download it on your desktop or mobile device to access Utopia. I have participated in its review and found it intresting. You can visit their website to know more about it. If you are interested in participating in the review campaign then you can check this thread, the campaign is being managed by joeperry.",
