If you take a look at this post, you will notice several internal links written under the Other sources section. They are all clickable in the post, except the last one. Here is a screenshot of how it looks now just in case OP changes and fixes it.However, quoting the post or previewing it before a quote turns the last link into a clickable one as well.Screenshot below:My question is, why is that? Why is the link in the original post not a hyperlink but if you quote the post it turns into one? @theymos what's an easy way around it without manually adding the hyperlink code?",

While in the above heading he put only one space.Good point, but how can you explain that the link is now clickable after quoted and still have double space.Example link  https://quillbot.com/grammar-check   with 2 spacesExample link   https://quillbot.com/grammar-check   with 3 spacesThe easiest explanation is, Our preview allowed us or allowed the link to be clickable because it is a simple link for example a link of some topic we used to insert in between our discussions or under our news as source link. Those links also turn out to be working in preview. Other then preview I can say for sure that it is not workable just because of two spaces if they will be reduced to 1 then link will be workable but in preview I think the rules or previews are made in such environment which allow all the links to look as workable instead of the following ones. These will not be look as workable.  Well, the one scenario in which links are not shown working are:Example:https://quillbot.com/grammar-check   with 0 spacesExamplehttps://quillbot.com/grammar-check   with 0 spacesEdit--> WTH links are working now. (why I said links are working will be elaborated later after hearing more from you).",

I should have done the same as you! If the moderator sees fit to put everything together, ok. Sorry. I won't edit, so as not to defeat the purpose. I went to your topic, made several posts with letter spaces, without spaces, followed links and everything worked.How do you create the space for this not to work? This seems more like a typo, perhaps due to the browser or operating system, than this idea of spaces in writing.A few more tests, to enjoy the post:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465210.0 1spacehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465210.0  2space  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465210.0  2spaceTo work?

A good example is found in the thread I mentioned at the beginning of this discussion where I noticed this problem for the first time. Have a look at this post. It's been edited many times. If you scroll all the way to the bottom of the post, you will notice the Other sources section. The last link in that section has two empty spaces and is clickable. You might think everything is ok until you see the code. OP used a hyperlink to make the link clickable.
