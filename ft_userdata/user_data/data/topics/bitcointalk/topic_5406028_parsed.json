I don't expect it to be overly (or at all) accurate, it was only for the safe of the discussion.My point was that you can easily find pretty good numbers for a bad scenario. Whether that would indeed get to happen... that's hard to say...I expect both highs and lows stop following the old patterns (although there's too few data to actually correctly call that pattern).

Whether that would indeed get to happen... that's hard to say...My point was around the same if you try to apply a pattern to find out a result that might be close you're not going to like the outcome on the other side and you're not going to like it if you project this pattern even further. If we indeed would see a small decrease in the ratio from low to high, even a 3x would still be a disaster long-term, imagine a dump like this if BTC would be around 300k for example, a few tens of trillion evaporating from the markets. I would need a ton of popcorn to get over that, and probably a second job...With this myriad of numbers and time stamps and formulas, I wouldn't be amazed to hear someone is drawing a line to 100$! Someone else than proudhon. But, I'm quite sure Bitcoin will make a move that will break all the patterns next, either going down below everyone's expectations or flipping back and for a few times between 20k or 40k,or something else that as always will catch all experts with the pants downs and will turn one whole Amazon forest worth of charts into toilet paper.
