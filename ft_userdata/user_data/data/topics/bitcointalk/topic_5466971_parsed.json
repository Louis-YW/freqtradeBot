  "content": "Hello!I have a innosilicon t2th+ that is not hashing. I set the pool and worker and it only says updating settings. I leave it on for about 2hours and it does not go past through that setting. It also does not appear on the pool. I have tried resetting it with no improvement. Anyone knows what is wrong?",
