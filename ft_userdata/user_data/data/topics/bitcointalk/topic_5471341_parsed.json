If you are trusting binance is having problems, everything connected to binance is affected. And when binance fud starts, even if TWT wouldn't be in reality in any danger, markets eventually see the connection and dump everything they can. As fear plays a major role in investing and day trading. Just a connection makes it tainted. Sol was tainted by FTX, even though nothing on that was their fault. Sol is as good coin as it was back then.",

The more demand and use for the token increase, the more the price can increase as well. So for trust wallet token their token is being used for staking and other service which holders benefit by holding it, so their is no connection between now trust wallet token price can be prevented from pumping as a result of BNB being placed at the top, unless binance decide to do their manipulation on any of those tokens, nothing can't be done by them.",

If I'm to pick between the two mid-cap coins then I'll probably pick ADA strictly because I think it has better network security. Solana may have the high TPS and cheap transaction fees but that's not enough for me to invest. The outages in the past made a lot of people lose interest in keeping SOL for long term.",

Now, this is actually my first time to learn that Binance had acquired TrustWallet for good...I must be living in the cave to not to know this news. Anyway, back to your main question...I don't any reason why Binance or CZ would prevent TWT from reaching its highest potential with price especially in 2024. When you own something, you would always be happy to see its value rise...and you can even sell the tokens you are holding for that platform so as to cash-in and get benefitted with its rise too. Therefore, it is good for the interest of Binance for TWT to maybe one day reach $5 - now this is just my speculation and don't trust a naive like me.",

The connection between BNB and TWT is irrelevant, if you ask me. Although TWT exists on Binance BEP20 chain, it has no direct impact on it asides the fact that CZ is connected to the both projects. TWT is for me, is a good project to DCA but you still have to do your own research on that.TWT moons with or without BNB so their pumps should not be compared neither are they hinderances",

The only main question here is that on when it would happen for this cycle?Would it really be playing around pre-halving or post-halving time? About on TWT then i dont see any connections or reasons that it would really be affected significantly knowing that TWT isnt really just that listed on Binance alone. Lets say that it does have that liquidity but considering that other exchange does have it then i dont see for it to be that giving a huge impact unless if FUD would really be that on extreme extent then it could be possible.Mooning or dumping then it would really be depending or according into those external factors on which it would really be just that right that we would really be able to see different conditions basing up on the things that we could really be able to see around. There's no such thing about assurance on whats the condition or the value of a certain project if its really that been attached with some exchange issues.It might be giving some effect but it would really be just that temporal.",

And it is not surprising that if the volatility of BNB and TWT interact with each other (TWT is also part of the BNB ecosystem), like the story of the collapse of LUNA, FTX... then the products inside how miserably they all failed. Regardless of the time, we all have benefits and risks in the process of investing in crypto. From a long-term perspective, I think TWT will probably achieve good price increases in the future, but in general, I think Predictions about it all depend on Bitcoin's main reaction to impact on different products.",

Other altcoins in their Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for me will not matter anymore.Yes, the primary crypto that can benefit under it is BNB because we need it to have the other. BNB is still the main token of Binance so yeah we can prioritize it more than the BSC. Maybe for you, other tokens in the BSC chain is not important anymore but there are people who are actually rooting on them. They trade and invest on it. Maybe TWT is among those tokens that they prioritize because it is owned by Trust wallet and then it has a connection with Binance. Maybe the coin can benefit as well if BNB/BSC is doing well. I don't see a reason why they will prevent it from pumping. So @OP, just go for it and good luck on your journey.",
