It's the duty of the community to do that and instead of wandering, shouldn't you be doing something that would benefit bitcoin and the community by talking about it with people that you meet? Also, you don't have to worry that the whole world knows about it, that will come to that point eventually because we all know that a word of mouth will be like a plague and it will spread in an exponential pattern. Another thing that you should consider is the fact that you should see this as an opportunity for you to invest in bitcoin while it's notoriety all over the world isn't that big because once it does that, you would regret it because the demand will be surging which means that the price is also going to surge more than you can imagine, this current 60k price of bitcoin is going to be nothing compared to that.",

Old people (bless them) do not really need to be using all this as it’s not exactly necessary to live at least for now. They can survive without using bitcoin however the new generation would definitely be welcomed in to a world where digital currencies are the new normal hence why they have the most to learn about bitcoin.",

Many people lived rich and fulfilling lives before bitcoin came along, so why should they care about bitcoin? So we don't need to ask everyone in the world to know about bitcoin and own it if they want to have a good life. Besides bitcoin, there are many other ways and investments that can also help us become rich and each person will have their own suitable choice. Bitcoin is not the only path to wealth, so we do not need to force or impose our thoughts on others.",

There are several factors that affect a person's level of knowledge about Bitcoin such as internet access, education, age, income, and the country they live in.Some developed countries do dominate, the level of awareness about crypto or bitcoin higher than developing countries and are still constrained by difficult internet access and lack of education. Here are some recent survey results:- YouGov Global Survey (2023): 86% of respondents in 11 countries know what Bitcoin is. https://business.yougov.com/es/content/46119-cripto-mexicanos-interes- Gemini Survey (2023): 70% of adults in the United States know what Bitcoin is. https://www.gemini.com/- Bitwise survey (2022): 26% of adults in 18 countries have basic knowledge of Bitcoin. https://bitwiseinvestments.com/crypto-market-insights/the-bitwise-vettafi-2023-benchmark-survey- Finder survey (2022): 41% of people in 27 countries know what Bitcoin is and how it works. https://www.afr.com/technology/fred-schebesta-s-finder-claims-its-crypto-product-wasn-t-money-20231004-p5e9mcIn general, knowledge about Bitcoin is still concentrated in developed countries.The level of awareness continues to increase around the world, along with the increasing adoption and media coverage of Bitcoin.Quote from: Volimack on May 12, 2024, 03:28:52 AMMany countries don't know about Bitcoin but if they know about its use, they will definitely use Bitcoin.

The demand for Bitcoin has increased with the approval of ETFs.But it also needs to be adjusted to the needs and how the economic conditions in the country. Not all countries will accept it well, because it is related to regulatory issues, even in my country the regulation of crypto is not fully allowed and is only a commodity asset. With ETF approval, it also would not guarantee increased adoption or regulatory changes, perhaps just as early acceptance and introduction as possible.",

We need not only developing nations but also developed ones to embrace it.

Because they can just grab their phone and do some research, some don't want Bitcoin to be successful out of the box because this will give opportunities to those who have no degree as well. I am talking this from experience, this is what the educated ones around me are showing, they knew I have no degree, and they do, so how can I be the one to tell them that something actually works?
