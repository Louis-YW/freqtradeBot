  "content": "If you have logout from your Bitcointalk account and are trying to log in once again then this is the screen that you will see. The problem here is that you need to clear the CAPTCHA if you want to log in. In general, what we do is just click or tap on the blank box and the tick mark appears in a few seconds. Then we click on the login button and it is done. Have you ever thought about how CAPTCHA works before clicking on that box? Do you know how it decides that you are a human? I can tell myself that I was not aware of how the authentication process works. I did some research and found a few articles and I was practically aghast at what they wrote about CAPTCHA verification. QuoteThe way that reCAPTCHAs work is that they track your online activities in a way. Google compiles the data collected from users that are selecting images in order to prove that they are human and puts it in a library that can be used to monitor how the internet is being used on a regular basis, and there is a lot of controversy surrounding the anonymity of this data as well as the fact that Google is basically profiting off of people proving that they are not bots whilst not giving them an option to opt out of what is essentially a data collection scheme.Article link.Okay! Now as I have understood the harmful effects of this verification method I wanted to know how to bypass it. Again I did some forum search using the forum search button and found a topic by theymos. Quoteou can now bypass the login CAPTCHA by bookmarking the link generated for you here: https://bitcointalk.org/captcha_code.phpIf it causes problems, I might restrict it to Jr Members and above or something, but currently, anyone can do it.Thread link.There are other ways to bypass the CAPTCHA apart from what theymos has said mentioned on that thread but I think the best way to do that is to use the OPERA browser and use its free VPN, to begin with.",

You can't bypass any captchas if you use Opera browser with or without VPN, and with Tor browser and VPN there is bigger chance of getting more captchas.There is no real way you can bypass this, but if you don't want to do it all the time than just don't log out from bitcointalk forum.Have one dedicated browser and use it only for this forum as logged in, but I don't recommend using propriety browser Opera that is full of junk and ads.",

This has two interesting properties: it works on Tor (which bitcointalk doesn't have and has a not-so-great-solution) and it's most probably not provided by Google.Those with better skills in inspecting web pages may want to take a look; maybe even come with some interesting ideas (or, why not, implementations - )",

I believe it's Monkey Captcha.A not so great solution for admins since this kind of captcha can easily be automated. There are even scripts for GreaseMonkey to solve them automatically. (There are also websites making money for each captcha solved by users)Generally speaking, Google captcha is a nightmare, but hard to find something better than Google. It's considered the top notch solution so far.Tor tried to fix this long ago, but can't do much, since it's rather up to Google to solve it. The controversy about it: well I'm honest, if I'm google I would do the same since it helps to improve my product and I'm making bank.Not the same if I was running a kind of charity project, working for free Look like OP forgets to consider than Tor browser hides your IP address... including to the captcha service...",

As for Opera Browser it sucks, the browser is full of ads and even if you use some ad blocker this browser won't work perfectly, it seems like Opera Browser is making money through the ads.",
