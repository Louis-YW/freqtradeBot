Well, I don't mean XPR can not move as fast as that as you have explained but I think this is too quick for all this to happen and we are not even already in the bull market. It is very true that all this will happen but I think it's going to take some time or if the market is pumped, we might see the market doubling in price again if things works positively.",

Sure it did win the case against SEC and we have seen that price went as high as 82 cents++ and I think that could be the highest price that it has reach for this cycle.So we will have to see first how everything will run. I mean after that, they hype has been gone, and almost all crypto is down. Bitcoin is below $30k as of this time. We will have next year to look though, if it will hit $1.00 then good for us. And perhaps when we start the bull run it can definitely go higher. But we don't know the time frame for that.

Maybe it will occur once we hit $1.the $1 target price in my opinion is not hard to achieve for this coin. given that it is currently #4 in position and they partially won their battle over SEC. now, if their issue with SEC will be totally over, it can easily hit even to 2-3 bucks or more than that. but if you are a holder, you need to keep close with what's happening with their case. it will give you an upper hand whether they are heading to positive or on the other end.",

But thinking it reaches high like other projects and turns bullish, that seems impossible and I'd never witness it. Honestly, we have nothing to expect more from the XRP price to rally high, it remains at that level below $3 no matter what we do.

Its still a partial win against SEC but if this one would be completely close down and considered that XRP completely win against SEC then it might really be shooting up its price to those possible prices that it hadn't been able to reach before but of course its not an assurance because everything would really be depending or basing up on community demands and recognition basing up on such condition or situation.Its really that hard to make out some conclusions specially on this very unpredictable market on which prices could really goes up and down without being expecting for it to happen.For someone who do really still believe on XRP's potential then it wont really be that bad on accumulating since we arent still on a bull run yet.Usually these fundamentals or positive news do pop out on the time that the market would really be having that bull run cycle.Trust me, those news and fundamentals would be floating everywhere when the time comes.",

More attention is being pushed than I thought it would be soon, but it's clear the price movement in this market we need to look back on. When the news easily has a pump force of tens of % or even hundreds, but conversely if the news is not favorable, the bad news will still have to happen. And most altcoins are watching the movement of bitcoin during the current period closely, so the top price situation is a quick push and then a discharge that leaves everything as if nothing happened.Although I personally am also very supportive of the turning point of the XRP event in the crypto market, perhaps I am not a fan of FOMO so I can only judge from my point of view without wanting to embed it.",
