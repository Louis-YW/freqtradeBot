Otto de Voogd is the world's self-proclaimed first bitcoin refugee. Why? Because about six (6) years ago, he fled Estonia for the Netherlands after being threatened with imprisonment for being a staunch bitcoin advocate and for running a bitcoin exchange BTC.ee. What actually happened was that at that time, the Estonian government wanted to regulate bitcoin trading and other digital currencies. Otto de Voogd's company BTC.ee was one of the crypto companies targeted by the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit. His appeal to the Tallinn Administrative Court and the Tallinn Circuit Court to operate a bitcoin exchange which was turned down twice. He therefore, had no option than to flee the country or risk being imprisoned for 3 years. Indeed bitcoin has come a long way. Do you have a similar story to share?Source",

Imagine it being more than ten years ago in existence here, and the self-proclaimed one is not the first, IMO. It's going to be hard to verify, though.I think that's just the part where it's just gaining traction, and back then, countries are finding ways to regulate it. They just probably haven't found a solution yet at that time. No one wants jail time, for sure.",

      "body": "It's the first time I hear about this particular case. The site of the old Estonian exchange is still live, but it's no longer operational. The man moved to The Netherlands and started the same type of exchange there and called it CoinEra. https://coinera.eu/. That site is also still live but non-operational just like the Estonian version. He did write an announcement when he closed it down mentioning he never experienced the issues from Estonia in the Netherlands.Interesting case. Estonia has lately often been tagged as one of the most crypto-friendly nations in the world. Looks like that wasn't always the case. Probably the root problem was that the government wanted to tax the traders but Otto didn't make it easy for them.   BTW, your newsbtc source is unavailable.",

Financial immigrant, but definately not refugee ast that would be resrved for people who are fleeing extreme conditions, not just one financial law of their country. As for financial immigrants, they were present from the creation of the financial system onwards, and crypto isni exeption, with pribably much more undocumented.",

Probably the root problem was that the government wanted to tax the traders but Otto didn't make it easy for them.   I don't think many countries in Europe are that friendly to startups (perhaps it's the same.for the rest of the world). Removing things like tax audits for their first few years of operation (in innovative markets) does seem like a much better policy as the company would still be finding its feet.Quote from: TheNineClub on August 23, 2022, 07:55:58 AMAs for financial immigrants, they were present from the creation of the financial system onwards, and crypto isni exeption, with pribably much more undocumented.This is quite well documented with global companies trying to exempt themselves from regulations and tax too (though it can be done on individual levels - I'd guess there are pitfalls to both along with the benefits they receive).",

Do you have a similar story to share?SourceThere must be other stories available but I have one to share. But in my store I won't use the word \"Refugee\". Zebpay was the first ever bitcoin wallet and exchange service available in India. They were doing business when there was no rules and regulations available for cryptocurrency in India. So as expected, Indian government started attacks through the banks and their bank accounts were frozen. The owner of Zebpay was a true visionary and he knew that if he tries to fight a legal battle in India, he will have to spend the rest of his life on this. So he simply moved to Singapore with some of his initial employees and registered his business there. Now he is operating in more than 30 countries excluding India. Can we call him a willful refugee??",

They probably moved to some of these fancy islands with favourable taxing plans.Non US citizens have it even easier, since the IRS doesn't follow your ass all around the planet. All you have to do in most cases is live 6 months out of your country and that's it, you are now paying taxes on your new country. If it is considered a tax haven you may need 4 years but there's tricks around this too.",
