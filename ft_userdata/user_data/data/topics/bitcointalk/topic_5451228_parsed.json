They will definitely not let you lose access without leaving you without support. If you have a phone number linked to a record or email, then you will be able to prove that it is you. It is easy to transfer all the data to a new device, just copy the export file. I recommend it unequivocally.",

In the process of following each discussion I've come across authenticator security issues.In my opinion, who is still a beginner, your recommendation is not to maintain security.

In my country, that mobile phone number (SIM CARD) is have limited 1 month and must be recharged before expired next month, this situation is a problem also, especially if there is internet at home and forget to recharged mobile phone number (SIM CARD), then expired that can't be used it anymore, So if expired, we can't receive sort message or SMS to recovery Twilio Authy Authenticator, then all lost.

If the community did not report shady malicious things with that application, it looks good enough. For close-source applications, nobody can verify codes.",

It's closed-source as well so you have to trust everything is okay on the background.Quote from: https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036077534-Authy-Backups-Password-RecoveryOnly if you enabled a Backup Password can we know what 2FA accounts you have added:For accounts added by a scanned QR code, the Authy app uploads the QR code. QR 2FA account sites/providers are free to decide what data is in the QR code, but typically this consists of the site name and the user name or email address.Ease of use is nice but it does come with a cost, sadly.",

      "body": "When we talk about security, we shouldn't care too much about convenience, just because we want to be convenient to use at the expense of our security and privacy. That's not worth the trade-off. We should not trust anyone but ourselves. I see many people still using Authy and Google authen, that's really a warning to all of us. As I know, Authy was hacked by a hacker eight months ago. Although it hasn't caused any serious problems, it shows that hosting 2FA on online storage services is too risky. And there is no guarantee that they will continue to keep your 2FA data safe in the future. Google Authen is also a good 2FA app and quite popular because everyone trusts Google's reputation. Many people think they are large corporations, so there will be no problem, this is also the next misconception. Even national security data can be hacked, Google data is nothing, don't trust them too much because anything can happen. More importantly, both are closed-source applications, they collect user data without our permission, and we won't know what they will do with our data, so that's a true risk to us.I used 2FAs in the past because I thought they didn't collect data and it was open source, but then thanks to @o_e_l_e_o I learned that they collect our data. So I switched to using Aegis Authenticator and am satisfied, and it deserves to be a genuine 2FA app. My advice regarding passwords, 2FA, we shouldn't trust anyone or any organization, keep it to ourselves. Sometimes manual conversion or backup will take time but will bring high security for us. Use open source apps like Aegis, Tofu, and Raivo instead of closed source apps.",
