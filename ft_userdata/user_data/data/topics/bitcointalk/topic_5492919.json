I am confused as we have encountered such congestion issues before due to spam by BRC20 tokens. We are now nearing the halving event in less than 5 days it isn't very clear for me to find the reason. If I move my head to understand this problem, I think it is because of the upcoming halving. If I calculate the dates then it is evident that the Bitcoin price dropped suddenly due to the attack by Iran and now it might go much deeper into the red zone due to multiple factors. Can you lay down the reason if not explain why things are not looking good or the reason why Bitcoin will not continue to go up? I understand correction but it does not look like a correction to me.",

Even that will not be enough to push the feerate to its current range. My best guess will be BRC-20 spamming going on in relation to the coming halving.",

Or there is some new type of Ordinals spam that is happening. My advice is to wait a few days and it should go back down to 10-20 vbyte which it was prior to this huge dump.Basically if you need to do any transactions you should just use L2 like on the ARB or Poly network on Ethereum. Nobody really uses bitcoin for micro payments anymore. Since 2017 that was never an ideal option. Its just for large payments these days. Switch to an altcoins or use L2 networks.",

I think you might not be too far from the truth but I think the Ordinal hype although has died down a bit still seems to be around probably would be here till after the bull run. If you check the DdmrDdmr site for ordinals weight percentage in block you will see them taking at least 40% of the block weight which signifies they are very much causing the congestion too. You can also check the mempool.space and on each blocks you will find dust amount of transactions which are for ordinals in there. The congestion is yes due to FUD around the market crash that happened but there is not significant evidence that Is selling that is happening, could be a movement to a safe wallet, because since the market drop the last 30 hours or so have seen the price of bitcoin in a ranging pattern rather than falling if it were to be selling happening",

Before doing a transaction, check your fees if you don't want to experience hassle. I'm not sure if the BRC20 spammers are back or there's another batch of it as what I've read about the Runes, no idea at all.If you're transacting some mini transactions, use LN but if you don't know how to and you're going to do it with the actual Bitcoin network. Brace yourselves if you can take the fees or not.But most likely, it's too high and we just can't throw fees like this.",

This is not the first time we will be seeing this happening, if you compare the bitcoin transaction fees compared to other cryptocurrencies, you will see that despite the high rate currently ongoing, bitcoin is still far better than some of the other crypto networks in terms of affordable transaction fees, just keep track on the mempool and when things get less congested, you can return back to making your transactions.",

If you are just new into this crypto space specially with Bitcoin then it happened already in the past and this isnt the first time. If you do want to priority your transaction then you would really be needing up to raise up the fee basing up on the mempool on which it would be normal that miners would really be prioritizing into those people who are willing to pay up higher TX fee. It do really sucks? Yes of course but there's nothing we can do because network congestion like this could happen anytime, these following reasons;1. Normal network congestion - tons of people who do make out transactions2. BRC20 spam on networkSo far i havent seen any news in correlated with BRC then i would take this to be that typical network congestion, if things doesnt get worst then it would be settling down a day or two but if not then it would be taking up a week or week+. It does depend, not unless you would be paying up the free upfront.",

They must know about it and be well prepared for their transaction plans.First, they have to always check mempools like one time a day or if they know that transaction fee is cheaper in weekend, they can check one time a week on weekend days like Saturday or Sunday.If they see cheap transaction fee when they check mempool on Saturday or Sunday, they can make on chain transactions to either consolidate their small inputs. This is a good preparation for future transaction when they need to move bitcoin to exchange account for selling.If they don't take advantage of cheap transaction fee for consolidation, later they will have to pay more for transaction fee.I believe demands from Ordinals, BRC20 enthusiasts will not last forever.Bitcoin Transaction Fees - Everything in one",

It has some use as a currency, minority, because some of us buy directly with Bitcoin sometimes, but it is, as you say, mostly an investment.Apart from the problem of network congestion and fees, solutions like LN are not feasible for large-scale mass payments, and, above all, if you can pay with fiat currencies as easily as you can today from your mobile, and with the upcoming launch of CBDCs, why are you going to spend your valuable Bitcoin instead of depreciating fiat currencies? It doesn't make sense. Besides the legislations don't help either because almost everywhere in the world you have to pay capital gains tax and to be able to calculate if you have capital gains on every small payment or it would be a mess or you would have to use specialized software to track it all.
