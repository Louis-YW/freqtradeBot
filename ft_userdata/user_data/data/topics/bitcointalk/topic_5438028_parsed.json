Bitmain has been doing this for years with many ASICs.So most likely the difficult won‚Äôt change by much. It will just move to a different home. I don‚Äôt think they will invest more money into building more of these ETH ASICs because the profits are not the same as before. And compared to sha256 these have probably a much lower margin.",

I know and agree that most people would not list their hardware in Ebay,I personally have kept all the equipment but turned on I only have 100 Mhsh from my over 300 Mhsh rig and that is mining ETHW+ZIL,I am also staking ZIL in Atomic Wallet for a nice 15% applied yearly interest.There are options already and I think the GPU mining community just need to make up their mind and switch away from that ETC that almost everybody is mining,that coin has never brought anything good,well except the time the coin got to all time high of 179 dollars and those who mined it when was like 3 dollars had over 2000 or more of such coin and made huge money.I think that another scenario like this one can happen to ETHW too if all the hash rate of ETC comes at this coin.I also hope for a new coin but unfortunately so far things are not looking good for such a development.",

And I don‚Äôt think that the owners of video cards 3060-3070 are mining this coin now.I am mining ETHW as for me there is the real possibility for it to at least go back to its initial all time high of near 142 dollars for a coin which was back in September 2022 and I am an owner of Rtx 3060 ti cards so why not try.Ethereum Classic I was mining it but always exchanging to other coins and that was my mistake so I lost the opportunity to made money there when ETC hit the all time high of 179 dollars for a coin.I don't want to miss another opportunity and I have about 7 ETHW so far but there is no way I am going to sell or exchange them,I am keeping them until they grow in time or they completely fail.For ETHW mining, one of the worst 5600xt graphics cards from Sapphire. From the wall when consuming 83 watts, you can get 38.5 megahash. If you increase the hashrate, then the consumption increases to 100 watts. But on the market, the price of two 5600xt video cards is equal to the price of 3060ti.I have 119 watt in the wall from the 3060 ti at 61 Mhsh which I think is a great performance/consumption ratio and for 83 watts getting 38.5 Mhsh from that Rx 5600 Xt does not look that bad,well except the price which should not be equal to the 3060 ti,maybe the Rx 5700 xt/6700 xt may justify such price and still not completely but of course these cards are with better hash rate than 5600 xt and with very little difference in power consumption.I would buy these cards if they were like 150-200 dollars each one as 5 of these would give me 200 Mhsh almost and just 415 watt electricity consumption which I think is one of the best options to continue mining your favorite coin.I don't sell the 5600xt graphics card for two reasons. This is a good hash rate for Ethereum forks with low consumption and very low cost in the used parts market. In my country, such video cards with a guarantee cost 150-170 dollars, and there are a lot of offers. Look at the prices in your markets, I would recommend sapphire.Unfortunately where I am there are only high end cards in the used marked also,there is only Rx 6700,6800,6900 and very few Rx 5700 Xt-s here,we usually only have Sapphire or Powercolor brands so Sapphire which I agree is the best brands for AMD cards is widely used here.The prices though are much higher than that,some people here at 150 dollars are selling Rx 580 8 GB cards so here prices do not drop as much as in other parts of the world,people are attached to their things and want the highest possible monetary value for them even when the time of such device has passed.A good thing though,Nvidia guys usually sell their cards a bit cheaper and that is why I have mostly Nvidias now in my rig,I have shut down the AMD devices.",

If you have such prices, then it is more profitable for you to bring video cards from other countries and sell them. This will give you a good profit.",

This will give you a good profit.Right now I am in Albania from some years,relocated here for work and it looks like will be staying some others too as my child is growing up here.Yes whenever possible I have bought cards through Ebay but there is a lot of corruption in the postal office here and one time I have ordered a good one,and received one that the fans were not working,probably some guy at the customs or post office did it as the seller in Ebay is someone I have always bought and his feedback speaks for him.This happens rarely but it is enough to stop me from buying abroad.For Powercolor I am very happy with the performance of the Rx 6800 XT as I have three of them and they all run super cool even in the middle of the summer.",
