  "content": "The Republic of Uzbekistan is one of the few countries in the world with a formed regulatory framework for regulating the circulation of crypto assets. Based on the  regulatory legal acts, the Agency issued the first licenses to formally permit two \"cryptocurrency retailers,\" Crypto Trade NET LLC and Crypto Market LLC, to provide services associated with cryptocurrencies. Under the regulations, cryptocurrency exchanges must be licensed in Uzbekistan. Licensed providers are required to verify users’ identities and store data about every transaction for five years. Forcing exchanges to get licenses allows the government to track and tax them. From January 1, 2023, Uzbek citizens and companies are legally permitted to conduct transactions only with licensed cryptocurrency exchanges. I guess Uzbek citizens who are not comfortable with being monitored will bypass any restriction by using VPN to access foreign exchanges. This is a drawback of using centralized exchanges.

      "body": "Forcing KYC upon everyone and obliging exchanges to store all transactions for 5 years sound harsh. Not to mention that the legal choice for people in Uzbekistan is limited to two platforms... I guess it's not surprising, coming from an authoritarian regime, that they want to restrict and control their citizens, but still. Maybe you're right that a VPN can help avoid the requirements, though.If only these two exchanges are legal, does it mean that storing coins in a noncustodial wallet and performing transactions directly from one address to another is illegal, or do the requirements apply only to exchanging currencies? I'm asking because the op says from the beginning of next year, only transactions on licensed exchanges are legal.",

The main problem is when the government and these companies take no responsibility when things go wrong like when the exchange is hacked or when they decide to run away and scam their customers.Even worse is when they give empty promises so that they can create a false sense of security for their customers.",

If the government wants to control or to a large extent oversee the activities of these exchange firms, then they should also take higher responsibilities. Just as Central Banks regulates commercial banks and assist clients in the recovery of deposits when such banks goes bankrupt, the government should also insure deposited funds in these crypto exchange firms.   The government should not just enjoy the huge tax generated by these firms and fail to protect their citizens. Sometimes most of these exchanges are connected to some powerful government officials that benefits from the raise and ultimate fall of these exchange companies. Uzbekistanis should ensure they use these platforms for daily transactions but bitcoin investment or huge funds should always remain in non-custodial wallets.",

I don't think so, it's not forcing either its requiring them for them to operate their business on such industry and country. Any government regulating exchanges will always monitor financial aspects to tax them. That would even be better for crypto users to convert fiat to crypto or vice versa in legal way. Regarding the non-exchange transactions as illegal seems a bit harsh but not surprising. Although some crypto regulation do the same like this, indonesia and australia do like this if im not wrong.",

Only a few remaining that's okay without kyc but has a limit for its withdrawals and probably other features.",
