It is a big risk with decentralized exchanges where liquidity have to be provided by community and mostly by project teams.If a project is legit, it is fine but if they are scam, they will do rug pull sooner or later when they complete their scams.QuotePerhaps in the beginning, there are just few rug pulls but as it grows last year, probably the rug pulls and scams become so prevalent.Anyhow, altcoin market is that volatile, anyone project can claim that they have been hacked, inside job and then all the money gone...The number of rug-pulled projects on decentralized exchanges will be higher in bear market. Developers and scammers will do that to get money back and enjoy their lives within bear market. They will wait for another bull market to launch new projects and exit again.",
