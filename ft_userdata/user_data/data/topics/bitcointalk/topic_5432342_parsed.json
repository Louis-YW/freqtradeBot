Why not share your ideas publicly instead? Tell the community what you want to do and how you want to do it. That way you can get feedback and insights from people who are experienced in app and website development. Maybe your idea is good but could become even better when it's discussed. Maybe it's awful and will never work but the feedback you receive could make you take a different path.",

Im all for being transparent and sharing innovating  ideas to the community but I wouldn't appreciate someone just taking it and claiming its theirs. I guess that makes sense in some way. But at least you can give some hints without explaining the methods and ways you suggest to improve the crypto exchange industry. How will your exchange be better than the competition?  Can you list a few problems you see with the current way that industry operates, and what are you planning to do differntly?Marketing is immensely important. A good idea needs to be out there. People need to see it, hear it, read about it, and have its name and brand stuck in their head. If not, they are just going to run to something else they see that is shouting louder than you saying how good they are.",

Yeah, I think OP is looking out to creating a cryptocurrency wallet between vendors and clients and such wallet won't be able to make payments to another cryptocurrency wallet except to a person that owns the wallet. Considering that paypal can't send money to another app except paypal. Since you are giving out the tip of the iceberg of the idea, It'll be difficult to conclude accurately what solution you need actually. From my perspective, to achieve such, you need a different network, I think you'll have to create the safecoin for it on a different network where users can only make peer to peer payment on the network and you'll be the exchange that'll help them get fiat using a bridge to send the coin to a regular network like blockchain that can enable you change it to fiat.",

The app would only host one main coin that I would like to create as a  safecoin for people to use as currency for the venders. Why the need to limit the app to one coin? I don't think there's enough appeal for that since users and vendors would be forced to use your coin and need to swap if they want to use your platform. Why don't you allow anyone to use any crypto they like, but provide an incentive to use your own token instead? For example, if they use/stake your token, then they'll get a 10% discount for every transaction.This idea is not new btw, lots of decentralized exchanges/marketplaces use the same incentive to encourage users to use their own tokens. But they don't limit the usage of other cryptos, so they can still earn from other sources. Btw, what your project does is act as a payment gateway for marijuana vendors, which will probably compete with other payment gateways such as BTCPay server. Have you seen them before, and find what makes your project stand out other than the support for other cryptos other than Bitcoin? CMIIW.",
