Then its value started at 0.0058$ and now its value is around 0.26$ something and BGB is its ticker name.As for what you are asking if you can use the copy trading formula? it depends on you mate, if you believe in copying your trader, just go. But if you have doubts about the trader you are going to copy, don't do it, and vice versa, it's that simple.For me, it's different from crypto trading where you do the trading yourself, because then it seems like you don't learn crypto trading and you don't improve, the organic way of trading is still much better compare to copy trading as for my opinion.",

But I need to tell you, it is not good to rely on others in the long run, no one can be better than yourself. And one more thing: as a newbie, it's not easy to make a profit in this market, so what you need to do is to limit your loss, so just use a small amount to get used to everything. Newbies need to experience it all to get what they need in the long run.",

Copy trading on the afore-mentioned exchange has been productive for me. I don't know how they get their team of elite traders but I feel they really good at what they do and the often reward campaign for both elite traders and followers is more of an incentivizer to the traders. So, I will say \"give it a shot\"",

Look for references that you can find from YouTube or websites and try to practice it yourself. To be a good trader, you must have commitment and do it independently.",

Expertise about trading will take time, and the less you force it, the better for you, just let it flow easily even as you are serious about it. Also, I would like you to continue trying automated systems like copy trading and all that alongside it, and before you know it, you get to know the best ones to choose even as you get better at trading. You may want to look beyond their percentage performance as well, it could be deceptive, you need the time they've survived the market, their maximum drawdown, the risk level and much more before you can be certain of their earning performance and the safety of your account.Many of them would do well for a while but make you lose the whole money in your account later, so the management part is so important and this can only be known if you study the strategy for a long period. But I have not seen anyone who says they are successful with the copying trade system of crypto exchange in the long run.",

I don't know about bitget if there's a commission from the person you copy but it's not giving me confidence that someone I'll just copy his trades and I'll make money.IMO, if this is the thing nowadays then many have became rich through copy trading but because of how's the reality about it, you'd see that many still struggles with trading. This is the reason if you want to learn trading, learn and do it on your own. Otherwise, just accumulate, DCA and hold.",

But from this formula you will later adopt the trading strategy by yourself when you understand the signals yourself and start trading from that day you will do well. I didn't know much about trading at one time, I got idea about trading from my friend for some time then I thought about trading on my own now I can get idea about trading myself and can do trading. But always remember never be too greedy in trading platform and when you are too greedy then definitely you will not succeed in trading platform and even if you lose patience you will not be successful in trading platform.

The process to learn is very important in this field because eventually it'll lead you to more good trades and very impressive profits. But if you'll just rely on someone for your trade he might give you some good profits but then you'll completely rely on them and their portfolio will be like yours there is no chance of something different happening from your side of mind. You'll eventually enjoy trading in crypto once you learn along with the earning option and then you can teach others as well and save them from making bigger mistakes.",

But as some members are saying, don't expect a lot from copy trading. Yes, there is no right formula in trading because of the volatile nature of the market which is why this copy trading style never works effectively. For learning purposes and exploring, that can be beneficial but in terms of profit earning, that is doubtful. Because there is one way that we are able to achieve success in trading and that is to rely upon ourselves, not others. In fact, old traders didn't use this strategy because they already found out that it was not a working style in trading.",

Not only that but it was also being shilled around the forum from time to time, though hearing it doesn't mean that we will now use it.In terms of giving an answer to the OP, we can just search it in the web like if Bitget supports copy trade but OP is also asking if he can use it. Well as a non-experience trader, it may have a pro and con. Pro is you can trade and profit immediately if in case you pick up a good trader but the con is we can lose due to lacking of knowledge. Between exchange and app, apps can indeed give us more convenience, especially we don't have a PC or laptop.",
