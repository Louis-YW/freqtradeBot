  "content": "I have a Trezor T model connected to the suite. It works but I have a problem with the balance showing a different amount to blockchain explorers. I have a extra 0.0042 in my account on my Trezor but I have checked all addresses and I only have 1 address with Bitcoin in it and that is the one that is displaying around 0.0042 more. What am I missing? I have not touched this wallet in a while and I am worried that it might have been compromised. I have updated the firmware today and it is still showing the same 0.0042 difference. Should I try sending some btc to a address to confirm that my trezor is working? and has not been compromised and showing a wrong balance because it has been hacked? I find it hard to believe that my hardware wallet has been hacked because it has not been accessed since creation. The seed was created at initial setup and was backed up and no btc has been transferred from my address it just shows the wrong amount on the suite. I have tried the web suite and the app they both show the same amount. I do not want to post my address but does any one have a idea why I am seeing more in the suite then the blockchain explorers? I have checked with blockchain.com and blockchair. I have only 1 address/account on my Trezor. I have added new addresses to see if 1 was hidden but it is not. I have no hidden addresses. Does hardware wallet calculate different?",

      "body": "If you have ever sent any amount from the wallet you probably have a change address. These are called \"internal\" addresses which do not show in the trezor interface. The only way you can find this out is by using the pubx id and inputting it into a block explorer. If the amount matches then it is a change address. These are automatically handled by trezor and is normal behavior. You can find the public key in your receive tab. Go onto it and you will need to click \"reveal key\". The public key is safe to copy and safe to give to people but it does have privacy issues because if you give it to some one they can track your whole transaction history but you are probably not concerned because you already have put 1 address into the explorers.

Your last (few) outgoing transaction(s) might confirm if this is the case on a block explorer (see if there's an address an amount of funds are sent to is there or not that you didn't choose to pay yourself). trezor should change this because it is confusing. If they displayed the internal addresses it would cause less problems for new people.",

Electrum can easily show you what's real.You download it from https://electrum.org , run it together with your Trezor HW (Standard wallet, then Use Hardware device), in Tools->Preferences you set the base unit from mBTC to BTC, also set View->Show addresses, go to the Addresses tab and click the Balance column's header to sort by amount (you may need to click twice to sort descending). Then you'll see what addresses have money.Plus, the window's footer area tells the sum / full balance.",

Should I try sending some btc to a address to confirm that my trezor is working? and has not been compromised and showing a wrong balance because it has been hacked? As long as Bitcoin explorers are showing wrong balance and not any new TX from your balance you are safe, all you have to do is make sure that your wallet is syncing because it seems to be a sync issue.Connect it to Electrum wallet and make sure that the green button is working which mean your wallet are full sync.If you confirm that your balance is deficient, then it is most likely that you downloaded firmware from an unknown source.",

Did you check what Bitcoin amount is exactly showing on Trezor Suite app?I wouldn't trust all bitcoin explorers (mempool.space is not bad), and maybe there are some unconfirmed transactions or change addresses that are not shown.Maybe try to to reset and resync of Trezor Suite, and install latest version v23.2.1Quote from: Macadonian on February 16, 2023, 11:33:03 PMI have not touched this wallet in a while and I am worried that it might have been compromised.

Compromised how exactly?You can easily check you addresses and see if there are any outgoing transactions, and I hope you didn't enter your seed phrase on some shady websites.Using Trezor wallet I would suggest using passphrases that are not stored anywhere for better protection of your coins.Quote from: Macadonian on February 16, 2023, 11:33:03 PMI find it hard to believe that my hardware wallet has been hacked because it has not been accessed since creation.

Quote from: dkbit98 on February 17, 2023, 05:14:50 PMI never had any problems with Trezor Suite showing wrong amounts, but it's literally impossible to see different amounts for address that didn't have any transactions...It's a pretty common question, because change addresses aren't typically shown, which is what I suspect is the case here. Although, the suggestions above are pretty spot on, and you'd be able to verify if there are any hidden change addresses which don't show up via Electrum or the public key. However, I consider exposing your public key to a third party as a major privacy risk.My Trezor does something similar, but it obviously requires sending a transaction for it to use a change address. OP sounds like he's asking about an address that he's only ever received Bitcoin on. If that's the case, I wouldn't know exactly what's happened without seeing the address itself.",

If your wallet was hacked somehow, it would be empty and the transaction history would show outgoing transactions that you didn't make. A hacker wouldn't leave anything in it, especially not more coins than what you (thought you) had. Besides, if you have a genuine Trezor, and no one knows where your seed backups are, you can't get hacked remotely. If your backups are on paper/metal and safely tucked away somewhere no has ever looked, we can rule out that someone stole your seed. The Trezor T is different from the Trezor One in the way it displays your seed. The Trezor One requires entering the words on your computer, which could represent a possible attack vector in case of a compromised device. But you are using a Trezor T, where the words were entered on the HW during the onboarding process and not a computer. The advice about checking your account at the correct derivation path in Electrum is what I would do. Check the coins, addresses, and history tab and you will probably remember what you sent, where and when.",

You are right! thank you for the information I checked and it was a change address that trezor was not showing. That is very confusing.
