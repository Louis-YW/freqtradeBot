There are a lot of people in the world whose monthly income is lower than 100$. And working as a telegram community usually does not take all the time on free time community can do other freelance work. All the people in this forum are not rich and the value of time of all the members of the forum is not the same. And one more thing working with a lower budget can increase the value of the portfolio later the person can work at a higher rate.",
