  "content": "I don’t have that good knowledge about mining just few basic things and that i can mine using different devices and each device with a specific power and also how easy the coin we trying to mine. I saw that new blockchains can be profitable in their first start because it’s easy to mine it even using an average device. So i want to know what do i need to start mining. I didn’t want to mention the new blockchain but I’m sure it’s obvious so if someone has a video tutorial or a simple way i will be thankful",

Just like starting a command  task on my device beside my wallet.You have to know first what kind of algo the Altcoin has , is it scrypt algo or other one ?Mostly you need different devices (Miners) for other algos , there are just a few that can handl a few algo in one.If you want to mine with a GPU mostly the miner software has the basic starting command in there foulders.",
