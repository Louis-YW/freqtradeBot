  "content": "I'm not sure if this the right place for this, but i have an issue i'd like your assistance with:The blockhash doesnt get sent from the new blocknotify, to a new stratum server i set up.It works perfectly as intended on my the server where blocknotify, coind and stratum are all present. I had a dedicated stratum newly set up on another server, and the stratum works, but blocks aren't added to the db due to the lack of a blockhash which is supposed to be sent by the blocknotify.What could i be missing? Is it enough to run blocknotify on my primary server, or do i have to run blocknotify on the new stratum server as well?My current config run on each coind:\"blocknotify=/var/stratum/blocknotify URL:PORT COINID %s\"(URL:PORT & COINID are placeholders, not the actual config)",
