OFAC claimed the smart contract mixer has helped to launder more than $7 billion worth of cryptocurrency since its creation in 2019, including over $455 million stolen by the North Korean-linked hackers Lazarus Group.When the mixer was sanctioned, it affect innocent people that wants privacy, even though if truly it is used for the illegal activities, but how about the innocent people. I have read in the past that stable coin company, Circle even freezed the coins of Tornado Cash users. Coinbase is in lawsuit United States Treasury Department about the sanction on Tornado cash. Why? Read it in full:  https://blog.coinbase.com/defending-privacy-in-crypto-e09db33dece8And according to what I saw on the news: QuoteCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a statement that Treasury went too far, taking “the unprecedented step of sanctioning an entire technology instead of specific individuals.” In addition to claiming the sanctions exceeded the department’s authority, Coinbase argued the measures:Remove privacy and security for crypto users;Harm innocent people; andStifle innovation.Are regulators not overdoing?Is USDC company, Circles right about freezing of Coins linked to Tornado cash users when not requested? Stables coins like USDT and USDC can be frozen on noncustodial wallet.",

Any of you remember when Circle used to be a company that made it incredibly easy to buy bitcoin at a reasonable price using fiat?  Man, the new Circle sure ain't the old Circle--but I've known that for years.And yes, regulators are overdoing it in this case.  But as much as I hate Coinbase as a company, I give them much respect for not just caving in to the Treasury Department, which is probably what a lot of other exchanges/services would do.  I think fair regulation can only come about by challenging regulators in court when they start forming opinions that might just affect thousands, if not millions, of people.  Also, the US government (or any government for that matter) doesn't want anybody's financial transactions to be private.  They'd love it if they had access to every single bit of information on every citizen in the country, constitutional rights be damned.  There have been recent examples of that with Edward Snowden's ordeal and many in the past, including J. Edgar Hoover's reign of the FBI and his hunt for communists.  Fight, Coinbase, fight!!",

If you do not use bank for fiat transactions, if it just by cash, then you can be more anonymous. Banks requires KYC. Other organizations require KYC too.Centralized exchanges that is in a country that works like other stock and forex brokers might not have options than to make KYC compulsory because of the threat from regulators. Centralized exchanges are different from mixers. This thread is about how regulators are appearing to be too strict by sanctioning a mixer which they supposed not to be sanctioned in a way they are becoming threat even to good people that want privacy.Regarding centralized exchanges, there are more options you can go for like decentralized exchanges.",

Playing the good guy who cares about privacy while actually being a centralized service that requires KYC? I get it that they must do KYC, but still.This lawsuit will be interesting because it's not just about Tornado Cash. Given that it's a crypto mixer, it is likely to set a precedent for treating other crypto mixers as well. It does seem to me that crypto mixers literally do what's called money laundering (the mechanism is that of money laundering), so even if some use it for noble causes, it might reasonably be outlawed, but I am not sure and I'd love to see what the court decides.",

Although they are not really the ones who brought the treasury department to the court, at least they are putting their money where their mouth is by funding the case. And they're really brave to stand and spend for what they believe in. There are not a few personalities and other entities who have openly voiced out their disapproval of the blanket ban. And yet rather than opposing or resisting a powerful government agency for what is obviously an unfair decision, many have acquiesced. As a matter of fact, a number of them have voluntarily taken steps in support of the OFAC's decision.Coinbase's decision is worth appreciating! I hope this encourages others, especially huge and influential crypto-related institutions, to also stand up for what is fair and right.",

Criminals are always looking for ways to move money about and trying to clean it after whatever method they've used to acquire it. It's a very real threat that any responsible government should be investigating and trying to take steps to minimize. It is how fraudsters get away with millions each year, how violent gangs are able to stay out of banks and how other nefarious activities are able to take place. As long as laws are designed in a fair and reasonable way, nobody should fear them. The people who make the biggest stink are sometimes those who are trying to avoid things like paying taxes which is a necessity to live in a developed society.",
