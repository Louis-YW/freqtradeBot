What other cool new lighting apps are you seeing out there?This could be really interesting, and there is no registration or any kyc for doing this swaps! I heard about GetAlby extension when it was posted in out local board, but with this swap ''exchange'' you can easily turn bunch of shitcoins and stable coins into lightning.Do you know if there are any extra fees and risk with doing this?",

What other cool new lighting apps are you seeing out there?https://blog.getalby.com/lightning-swap-app/There's no doubt that the popularity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded in recent years. This innovative new technology allows for secure, anonymous transactions between people anywhere in the world. And one of the most popular uses of bitcoin is for gambling and betting.There are now countless websites where you can bet on sports, play casino games, or gamble on just about anything. And with the rise of mobile devices, it's now easier than ever to wager on your favorite team or game no matter where you are.But what about using bitcoin for more serious betting? For example, what if you wanted to place a bet on the outcome of an election or stock market? That's where lightning swaps come in.",

      "body": "In my opinion, it all depends on what is your main reason for getting into cryptocurrency. Is it just to make an investment? Then maybe owning bitcoins might be a better idea. However, if we are interested in spending our coins, then any of these flash exchange apps can definitely be a viable option for all.Yes. It is very interesting to discuss this flash exchange application. If you don't have much experience with bitcoin, this can be a very good opportunity to get some coins without actually buying them.",
