You could also make spv watching only versions of wallets (with bitcoinj or electrum but you might forgo some privacy this way).",

If you use HD wallet, you also could export both receiving/change address along with it's BIP32 index.If I don't have the password for private keys, and I have public addresses from that wallet, I cannot export private keys, but I can scan public addresses for phrases used as brain wallets.

Brain wallet converted to WIF can be one of the private keys in wallet for which password was forgotten.A brain wallet is a wallet on its own. You don't import it to Bitcoin Core and then treat it as another wallet. You've decided to make a brain wallet, because you find it better to either store in memory or in paper a password instead of a wallet file.

Spreadsheet should be able to handle a lot of data if that's what your talking about. Plus, you don't necessarily need to use spreadsheet software, and could spit the information out in Json, and import the data you want into a spreadsheet for better reading, and only limiting it to the bits you need. I'm not even quite sure what you're trying to achieve with collecting most of this data? The typical user doesn't necessarily need to record most of this data either. Some could be useful I suppose, but is probably overkill for the average user.",
