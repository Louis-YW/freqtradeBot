I currently have one script installed in my Tampermonkey browser extension that puts the forum on dark mode, I can't recall the thread where I saw and copy the code from, probably got it from the search option in TamperMonkey itself.Here's a screenshot of this thread in dark mode.I would have love to share the code with Op but I don't know how safe the code is and I won't be the cause of someone losing/getting their info stolen. Btw, I don't use it i only just turned it on for the sake of this thread only.",

Put your browser to dark mode or night mode under it's settings3. Activate the eye care function/button under your notification bar for those using mobile phones4. Get a privacy screen guide/protector to all reduce the concentration of brightness to the eye5. Reduce your active login time or always take a break while on the screen for too long.",

Kiwi browser can do the job for installing plugins such as BPIP.org or stylish extension to customized the theme of the forum. Stylish is the best extension so far on modifying the forum appearance since it gives freedom for user on customizing all elements on the website appearance. I’m doing it all using Kiwi which also supports developer tool option without heavy loading like opera.

Dark mode was requested many times since this white background is very stressful in the eyes at night. Use stylish extension to get the perfect result for your preference. All dark theme available for Bitcointalk varies on dark shade that might still not suit you.",

Stylish extension was at some point pulled from the shelves of some vrowsersncause it was allegedly a spyware which steals user information. This is a risk with any extension out there, especially those offered by Google or other privacy intrusive platforms.If you can't find any you trust, then it's not worth the risk to use a potentially harmful extension to achieve dark mode on your device.",

I think we should prioritize safety than the dark mode, I just tried putting my device and also my browser through the settings on dark mode still it did not affect this forum site, but generally the browser in actively in a dark mode.Well an alternative for this to reduce the harms on your eyes is to put the device on eye care, reduce you brightness or some even more care is getting a blue ray glasses.",
