  "content": "whitelisting in cryptocurrency is a way by which developers allows investors to participate in some events like Airdrop, Presale and others in the coin/NFT and also the addresses they allow for accept for withdrawal. Among the reason why whitelisting is important in cryptocurrency is the fact that it helps developers to place restriction on those allowed for events like presale, withdrawal and others in order to avoid spammers and unauthorized access to such events. Though whitelisting acts as a good security measures but the fact is that the transparency and fairness can be questionable since it can be manipulated or hack, Here are some ways to identify bad whitelisted projects :Know the risk involved in whitelisting, this will make you more cautious in any of these projects  Check for reviews for other investors  Check who are the project managers in order to know how far they can go for the project Avoid whitelisting projects that request for your personal data and also which are not sincere about the actual requirements for participating in such events  Check if the project whitelisted is really from the official website/social media, we have seen alot of false airdrop after a legit airdrop/ presale as ended from scammers who claimed to be doing another round for such events. Doing your own research and avoid social media hypes what other ways by which investors can identify fair and transparent whitelisting?",

Many of this project are nothing, it is also important to check their offical website if there is office address and copy right. Presently , there are thousands of project that starts well but still die at the end, it is mostly adviced to Stick to Bitcoin. If you fill like investing in other shitcoins do that with sense. Recently I begin to wonder why anyone will like shitcoins when we know well that every other coins/ token is linked to Bitcoin price movement since every other coins is transacted as a pair to bitcoins. Shitcoins only do well during Bitcoin bull run, then by pump and dump scheme.",

They're meant to allow everyone to participate since they're decentralized but for project that aren't hiding their centralization then they don't have an issue with me but i don't see any benefits with whitelisting because if I wanted to invest in any altcoin, I can always get them when they get listed on an exchange and trade then for  profits. Investing in Presale isn't the best advice either because most of the projects mightn't get listed on exchanges or give profits as you're anticipating.
