Cryptocurrencies that have adopted it might currently operate normally (in a manner of speaking), but their future's success in decentralization is highly questionable (if their present isn't bad already).",

This is not only in Bitcoin mining, but in all currencies that use the same Proof.The EU Parliament had proposed moving the protocol from a proof of work to a proof of quota. The reasons explained are the large amount consumed by mining farms with the inability of green energies to meet all the mining needs of energy. There are countries that ban mining for the same reasons.I am not advocating Proof of Stake because I know this will make Bitcoin more centralized but I would like to know how the problem of excessive energy consumption can be overcome in the long run.",

The reasons explained are the large amount consumed by mining farms with the inability of green energies to meet all the mining needs of energy.Which we all know are pure alibis. The real reason is control, something they don't have with Proof-of-Work. If they cared about the environment, and their intentions had a purely humanistic character, they'd have grabbed the entire financial sector, which consumes much more than Proof-of-Work does (and is capable of consuming):Quote from: What’s the Carbon Footprint of Fiat Money?The modern recession and the boom-bust cycle that drives it is entirely a creation of fiat money. Governments intervene in the allocation of capital, randomly starting and stopping a fire hose of credit that whipsaws the real economy and destroys real lives. Just as the cost of a five-second delay in a footrace can be measured in distance lost, the cost of a recession can be measured by the resources it will take to rebuild lost wealth. Bitcoin, by taking purchasing power out of central banks’ manipulation space, can reduce or even eliminate their ability to cause boom-bust cycles.Even Bitcoin’s worst critics allege the distributed network consumes no more than 86 TWh per year, of which perhaps 16 TWh might be Americans, with much of that green energy. It would take between 500 and 1,000 years for Bitcoin’s energy use to even approach the 2008 crisis alone. With another recession permanently on the way, over and over again. That 500 to 1,000 years’ worth of energy goes on top of the 8.4% of GDP, the 80,000 bank branches and 470,000 ATMs and those skyscrapers.These ratios suggest that central banks are vastly more polluting than Bitcoin, indeed more polluting than the worst industrial offender you could imagine. Bitcoin, by implication, is among the most green technologies humanity has ever invented. Indeed, if Bitcoin even slightly reduces central banks’ ability to cause recessions, it could pay back every watt many times over. For example, if Bitcoin reduces the odds or magnitude of central bank recessions by just 2%, Bitcoin would actually save us far more energy than it uses – it would be net carbon negative. But, no politician talks about that. It somehow raises no interests.  Quote from: coupable on August 22, 2022, 06:50:14 PMI am not advocating Proof of Stake because I know this will make Bitcoin more centralized but I would like to know how the problem of excessive energy consumption can be overcome in the long run.It can't. The network needs energy. That energy comes from difference resources, most of which are sustainable according to the Mining Council. But, just like nearly anything humans utilize, it requires energy to operate properly.",

I'll give another example: Printing paper money costs nearly nothing. A $5 bill costs the same as a $500 dollar bill; yet, they are valuated differently, because the monetary policy isn't down to you to decide. The cost of minting the money is irrelevant, what matters is that you can't alter the supply by your own will.",

The reason people don't buy air is because it (the supply) is abundant. no. i have made no mention of the market at allthat is where you are confusing things i categorically mentioned the $12k minimum cost on the planet for mining. which is not the market price. its the under lying store of value that no one will sell below because no one can acquire coin via any method right now below this COSTas for supply.. meaningless too.. thats the realm of speculation of a market above the underlying value storewhen people think something is rare they are willing to pay a premium ontop of the underlying value. but if the underlying value is low then the premium above that is lowtake a coin called \"bitcoin plus\" which is only $3...yep they have less then 200k coin supply but the price is only $3. thats because its PoS with a low underlying cost at the bottom thus all the speculation above it is causing small changes. ..oh and even if there are 19m coins in the true bitcoin circulation.in 2012 there were only 11million coins .. yet the price was lower.thats because the market price has nothing to do with coins in circulation. the market price is dependant on the coins and only the coins deposited into an exchange and not only that. only the allotment of coins actually on the market orderbooks.simple economics.that said.. some speculate that because PoS involved locking coins up to stake. it would mean less coins available on market orderbooks thus a supply lack meaning a hype of speculation due to orderbook supply lack vs demand. but in the end because PoS coins have no real large value cost to back up the underlying cost. then all the speculation ontop would only be a Yx of underlying cost. as there is a limit to how many multiples of underlying cost someone is willing to pay before they decide they will jump into the stake side for cheap coin to sell for profit.",

This is not only in Bitcoin mining, but in all currencies that use the same Proof.I like this explanation by Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard book. A single football match requires an enormous amount of energy to take place, which includes not only football stadium maintenance, but also broadcasts on TV, advertising, movements of fans, and all the people who would like to watch a match either in a stadium, TV or some pub. The problem is if you DON'T like football or sports games in general, then according to you, all the energy that is being spent on all these activities goes to waste and only damages the environment, nothing else. Yet, other people don't consider energy wasted because football games are fun to watch. The same reasoning can easily be applied to bitcoin or other important innovations or technologies that the ESG mafia considers useless, purposeless, and wasteful. Other people, however, who recognize the value and importance of decentralized unstoppable payments and undilutable savings, don't consider the energy spent on bitcoin mining wasted.Bitcoin never will switch to Proof-of-Stake because it is designed to be an alternative to the traditional financial system, not its likeness, which Proof-of-Stake evidently strives to become (Ethereum merge is a perfect example of this flawed model).",

If you fork bitcoin, and create say Bitcoin Cash, and somehow it rises in value, it's because instead of demanding BTC, some people demand BCH. Demand is transited to another asset, and selling later that and buying back BTC won't make a difference.

Price = Cost + Profit, agreed, but it just not works the same in currencies, that's true for products whose supply can change by anyone. Proof-of-Work goes to the same basket. On the other hand, Proof-of-Stake doesn't. You can't print ETH without paying a present owner, therefore you can't alter the supply which is what drives the price.Quote from: franky1 on August 22, 2022, 09:12:42 PMoh and even if there are 19m coins in the true bitcoin circulation.in 2012 there were only 11million coins .. yet the price was lower.So, by that you conclude that supply is a pointless measure?

The only consensus algorithm that has proven its reliability is based on attaching evidence that energy has been spent and the effort has been put to make a block valid for everyone else. In PoS and other flawed \"consensus\" algorithms, there is no way to determine which block is valid and which isn't because there is no connection to the real world whatsoever. Maybe it is more efficient in the sense that almost no energy is being spent to produce a block, but that also means that a block itself has little to no value. The main goal of having a consensus system is to make everyone in a system agree on some \"true\" statement, which is only relevant for a system in nothing else. In the PoW algorithm, the truth is spoken by those who have proven they have a right to make a statement, and this right is always temporary, whereas in PoS if you have invested enough money, you get permanent voting power. The former system is competitive and objective, the latter is oligarchic and highly subjective. Hence, in the latter case, it is slowly but surely moving towards centralization of power and inevitable takeover by those who happen to have more power and money.",
