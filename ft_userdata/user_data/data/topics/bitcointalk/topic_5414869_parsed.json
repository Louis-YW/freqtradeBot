You have to be prepared that you will lose a lot of money, and think in advance what you want to do. Try to use some kind of management with your bank role, and certainly not play with large amounts. Play with money like you've actually already lost it so that it's really just for fun. In the long run, making rational decisions is no longer possible if you want to win back your lost money. It would be better not to start at all to prevent problems. Or don't play online and only take cash to a casino for entertainment.",

I too have seen hell when I started to gamble, I lost a lot too and become addicted until I finally realized that we should not chase money with gambling, it is wrong. Yeah, we must always think of the future and use only the money that is free of obligation, and better to divide the free money so that it can also accommodate our future activity in gambling.Quote from: seleme on September 25, 2022, 08:06:10 PMQuote from: Frankolala on September 25, 2022, 07:59:33 PM  Ouch, this is not appropriate source to gamble since you shouldn't touch the money you can't afford to lose. As you explained, you have to take winnings after 2 hours of lucky session and stop being greedy for more profit, eventually loss streak will find you in such turns. Anyways, this expensive lesson should be remembered next time you wanna gamble with money you have to use for something else. I never gamble the amount I can't put back in case of loss, so think twice before deposit in the casinos. It already happens and I believe OP has learned his lesson well.  It is a good thing that he realizes that what he did is wrong and comes to share with us the horror of using money that is allocated somewhere in gambling.  It is much better to suffer such thing than getting addicted to gambling because having the latter will surely destroy your future.",

There are really circumstances in our life that suddenly change and beyond our control. And if we including gambling, and used the money that it's supposed to be used on other situation, then the problem arises. I think for me the worst is just gambling all the money that I earn when I had job, after payday I would go run to any landbased casinos and going home empty. Think about 2 works of hard work going into drain in less than an hour and you don't know what to do next because you don't have money in your pocket when you go home. How can you cope with the basic necessities like food and then you have to pay the bills? It's just really stressful and everyone should learn from these kind of mistakes and not get addicted.",

One thing about trading and gambling is that people that are not married risk more than the people that are married. The kind of ways a married man would think is different. It would be very absurd if a father gambles with his children school fees. That is a very bad thing to do. A good father would want to pay bills too. But when it comes to people that are not married, they have the kind of mind to risk more, but the risks can later put them in trouble. But be it a married person or not, gambling should be done in a responsible way that will not become a problem for the gambler.",

That was the way I saw it back the as I happened to have had the sponsorship and backings of my parents. I knew I had left the Co.fot of home to get a degree. Not because I was all consumed about the idea of schooling but I knew education to some length was important and so I gave priority to the things that would see me through the process and that meant, not taking chances with my tuition fees.Once it was at hand, I always find the time to free myself of it and sort other means to get the extra cash I wanted. Those I could gamble with to make more of it hit definitely, not my tuition fees and surely not to be homeless by joking with my rent.It's simply priority.",

Unfortunately, we all been in similar situations due to the nature of gambling, just don't deposit the amount you can't lose and it will be OK in the long run. Otherwise, you will prepare a deep trap for your future finance. True, and when our initial bankroll got depleted let us be disciplined enough not to top up our bankroll with our remaining money because it will only trigger a continuous tapping of bankroll when our bankroll is depleted.",

At least now you know that you do not gamble the money that you need. You must only use the money you can afford to lose. Luckily for me, I did not go through that, yet. I have lost a lot before, but that money is not allotted for anything. It was an extra for me. And I always keep it that way. But unlike you, I did not start real gambling until I was an adult, so I have some self-control over the amount of money and gambling habits. You started young so you are a bit impulsive.",
