  "content": "I think everyone is aware that ads sometimes have malware injecting something into your computer, and clicking pop-ups might also help stole your crypto if you are not careful, well here is another victim that shows even an experienced person sometimes makes mistakes, and teach us to double check everything before clicking, because once you have done it, there is no turning back, this is for newbies to be more aware of where they click or website they go.https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-ads-delivered-malware-drains-nft-influencer-s-entire-crypto-wallet?fbclid=IwAR0ZRjY95ytRQgOQpBoJyFebPQDJlMQpt_ruLjJE6uSdu68V5C1YydKcH0II hope this will help newbies and experience people not to be complacent when dealing with your crypto via the world wide web.",

Ads are very risky especially when you click it wrongfully. Having ad-blocker may make the risk lesser.When it comes to advertisements we should always double check the link or else go to a new tab and search about that ad since you're risking your login credentials.I use brave browser when it comes to crypto cause it way safer than any browsers out there and I only uses chrome when comes to social media.
