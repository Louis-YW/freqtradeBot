Thanks for the fake review, anyway.

Trusting a \"store\" with my money that refuses to even pay its advertisers after a job done. What could possibly go wrong, Steve?",

Advertisers are paid to get the word out about your product, nothing more. If your service or product are good, you will get sales. If it is not, then it's not the advertisers fault.",
