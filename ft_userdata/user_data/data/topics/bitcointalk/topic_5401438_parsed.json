      "body": "Congrats on your win, your ticket should pay out 25 units in total as it should include your original stake, if the return is below that amount you should contact support and ask for a correction. Sportsbooks rarely have that type of mistake but I guess it still happens once in a while. I remember being in a similar situation but in my case, they overpaid my ticket and they told me to keep it since I was a regular on their sportsbook.",

There is where I find myself today. ¬†Need some other senior members to sure their calculations as well. Appreciate your Time and effort. That's unusual, did they provide an explanation? Or they might have their own rules regarding their markets. If that was the case then your bet was split between place and straight if the payout was only 12.5 but I barely bet on horse racing and I usually see one of the two being offered so I can't say if there's actually a sportsbook that lets you bet on two markets in one go.",

      "body": "I don't bet on horse racing so I am not that familiar with its rules, or whether there are peculiar rules involved. Even the odds format is not the usual. But 5-1 is quite easy to interpret. It would either be your $100 would become $500 or it would win you $500. Either way, since you placed 5 units it must at least be 25 units not 12.5, which is only half of what you should have received. In fact, if Ontario Racing applies the same rules, your 5 units should give you 25 units plus your original bet, which means you should be receiving 30 units all in all.\"Example #1: A horse that wins at 5-1 will return $5.00 for every $1.00 wagered. If you had placed the minimum bet of $2 on that horse to win, your payoff will be: $10 (5 x 1 x $2) + your original bet of $2 ‚Äì for a total of $12.\"[1][1] https://ontarioracing.com/betting-101/understanding-odds",

Much appreciated.¬† it's really strange an error like this! never heard before a similar situation. because most of the gambling sites have an automatic way for this kind of calculation or payouts.And any trusted bookmaker will pay the right amount if they will seen this bet...in case you will not receive it or they will not provide a valid explanation, open a scam accusation about this site and provide full details https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0",
