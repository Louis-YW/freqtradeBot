  "content": "So, I have a new computer, and haven't used my electrum wallet since I bought it. I recently won some money online and wanted to put it in my wallet asap. I found the old app in my new computer and opened it. It opened without a password and no problem. I send the crypto, it showed up in the wallet. All good. But I noticed none of my old transactions were listed. Ok, next day I try and load the wallet, NOW it wants a password. Doesn't take my old password. I'm wondering if I forgot? Tried several variations. nothing. So, I open new electrum wallet using my seed phase. Works just fine! All my old transactions are there, except the latest one. So my wallet says empty. I realize I now have two electrum wallets. One is showing all old transactions, and the other in \"default-wallet\" and it still says password incorrect and will not let me open it. What do I do? I have money in one account and its not connected to my electrum wallet and I have no idea why? I didn't start a new wallet when I opened the older app, and I have no idea why it didn't merge. Help!!!",

      "body": "Has anyone else got access to your computer, is there a chance they could've made a wallet too?When did you send the transaction to the new wallet? Was it long enough ago that you forgot about the process of doing it (surely you put a password in then)?There's not much anyone can help you with without more information as you'll either need your nmemonic or your password to open the wallet (or a private key but I doubt you'd have been shown one of those by Electrum).",

Tried several variations. nothing.Electrum doesn't have a central server for wallets, the server that you see in the network menu is for finding transactions and verification purposes,the wallet files are saved in your PC's disk, usually in: electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#where-is-my-wallet-file-locatedThat said, there's no way for others to set a password in your wallet remotely unless your PC itself can be controlled remotely/physically.Quote from: rosebudpetta on January 01, 2023, 10:21:09 PMWhat do I do?

I didn't start a new wallet when I opened the older app, and I have no idea why it didn't merge.It's not the first time I've heard from newbies of Electrum wallet suddenly asking for a password but there's never been a bug in Electrum that does that.Most of the time, it's a user who got confused, failed to remember what really happened, not telling the whole truth.Please provide as much info as described in this sticky topic: [READ BEFORE POSTING] Tech Support Help Request FormatFor now, try to look for other possible wallet files.There's a chance that your old Electrum wallet is a \"Portable Version\" which uses a different data directory which saves the wallet files in its own wallets dir.It's usually the \"wallets\" folder inside \"electrum_data\" folder inside the same directory where electrum-portable executable is located.",
