People can as well go for stable coins like USDT, there are loaners on this forum that can lend Bitcointalk qualified users stable coins like USDT. I remember when I needed money in the past, I borrowed in USDT. Loaners even on bitcoin lending board do give option of stable coin, or the borrower can dialogue with the loaner.",

The bad thing about this is that I think it's not going to do any good as I've commented in another thread. That account was useless anyway, with only 1 merit earned and was not generating income from signature campaigns. The only thing is that he won't be able to scam anyone on the forum, that's for sure.",

At first I asked him whether he has an account on bitcointalk or not. He replied that he isn't interested in Bitcoins. I have asked the same question again, but he has cleared the chat history and blocked me on telegram.The user ‘anog’ has used the same ETH address in the authentication post which he has used in the loan application. Perhaps, the telegram account still belongs to him. @shasan, try to reach him on telegram. Perhaps, he will block you too if you message him on telegram.",

You earn $500/week and planned to repay the loan within 20 weeks. But when BTC increases to $60k+, it's not anymore possible for you to repay the loan within 20 weeks, nor even within a few years.

So there is no space for anything flexible, even the debtor should compensate the interest for the entire period.this just confirms my rule, that the loan must be taken in the currency in which you receive your earnings. however, it is clear to everyone, there will not be any re-payment.",
