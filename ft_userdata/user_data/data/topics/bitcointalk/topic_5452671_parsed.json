And you're promising that the exchange will operate 24/7, but man if yours is the only one to operate 24/7 than what about others. You forgot to mention that all of the exchanges operate 24/7 and their fees are very competitive. It would be better if you mention the fees and other details of the exchange because that would be helpful. However, if you are really proving a good exchange than best of luck. And, surely if your features and rates are really competitive then you might get some users. But, to be honest, it's really hard to trust a new exchange these days because every once in a while a new crypto exchange emerges and promise to serve the customers better than the competition, but when users add their funds to the exchange then it would be impossible for them to without the funds again. That's why trusting is also a big issue for new exchanges.",

If this isn't a failed marketing attempt to attract clients then it most definitely is a scam.True. As soon as I've seen the design of the website, it's not like what I'm expecting when it has claimed to be the \"best\". When such claims has been said and there's no proof to what they say and even show some hefty amount of money as if they really have it but upon having a first look at it, there's really something wrong with it. Much better not to do any transaction if they keep on enticing this way.",

Let us say that it wasn't intentional to put wrong numbers and even if you've \"corrected\" the wrong numbers, still the numbers are unbelievable based on the new image and the past image that has been posted. Having $10k+$10k of USDT is believable and as well as 98 Litecoins but having that Ethereum and Bitcoin, you really have to prove that you own that a lot while your website doesn't look professional.",

It is hard to trust a new exchange regardless of how fancy your marketing is, especially if we can't even verify it ourselves. My previous question about rates is also unanswered, unless you mean these trusted partners of yours also decide this rate. Your reassurance doesn't really make you more transparent IMO.
