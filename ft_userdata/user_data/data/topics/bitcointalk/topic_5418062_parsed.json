  "content": "Hi, I'm writing my Extended Essay at school about Squid Coin's collapse and what it says about the cryptocurrency market. For my research I would like to ask Squid coin users to complete a really short survey (here: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/FBHH8PH). Please can you help me to find out how to contact squid coin users? I am struggling to find anyone to fill out my survey. Thankyou very much.",

There's is only a little chance for you to get a legit reply from telegram as most people there will ignore any random DMs to them thinking that it will be another coin offering or scam. It's really nice to see someone make a report in such a case because you are not only giving people information but also you will gonna prevent them from doing the same mistakes. Good luck with your schoolwork, hope you will get an outstanding grade.",

I believe that you will get a very few of surveyee here about squid coin knowing that most of the users here has a good knowledge about crypto and won't risk their funds for that shtcoin. There are useful links above that guide you to the messaging app that SQUID coin community are using, It would be a great help.",

Thankyou very much.Really shocking that there is someone who do like this kind of survey. But OP, I think you could try to go on their official website and join their socials. But I doubt that these users will still be active for example on telegram. Probably these member there are now just bots keep spamming. Its a dead coin that has been used for pump and dump so I guess its not that worthy anymore. But for the sake of your survey then go for it.",
