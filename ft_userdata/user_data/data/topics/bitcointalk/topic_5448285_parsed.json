Before I started playing in casinos, in my free time I played 2048, I somehow think that in casinos this game will be a success, the game should be with a cashout.  What do you think about it? How exactly could casinos have an edge with this?It's literally skill based game and anyone with a brain would beat the house constantly. It's a cool game but not every good game is suitable for casino. Not even as p2p version as you could bot that game easily so it would be just smart bots against smarter bots. In order this game to be a casino game it should need radical changes and it would end up being a whole different game in the end.",

Most gambling platforms would surely lose some profit if they put out this game on their list. Plus, what would be the mechanics of how you would win money? Would it be progressive rewards as long as you're in the game? For sure, people will just code AI to beat the game and this will be shut down almost easily.",

It's skilled based though? Maybe if they added some new rules or some factors that are influenced by luck, such as adding x number tiles with number y every z turn, the maybe. But it would still be highly reliant on skill and not luck. Most casino games, even those with some skill required like blackjack/poker, still heavily relies on luck and not skill. With the case of 2048 (and even with some adjustments), the game would still be heavily reliant on skill and understanding. Even introducing a time limit wouldn't make it any different imo.",

If it has a cashout option then we could see the game being similar to Mines so you can play each round cautiously but it still lacks an extra feature or mechanic that would give the casino an edge. If there's no way to add any changes to the game then having it as a PVP game would be the only option but it's better we avoid that direction because most gamblers aren't interested in playing PVP and it's not easy to make the PVP games successful.",

If these games are skill-based games, I don't really know because I've never played them and if so, maybe the casino will make a difference to these games so that players don't win easily and apply the house edge will still be on the casino's favour.",
