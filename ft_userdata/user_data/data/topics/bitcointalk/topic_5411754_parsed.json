But the pay is low, especially if you are from a developed countries like Europe or US. If you have money, you can buy bitcoin and hold for like 2 or more years. You can use money to make passive income. You can buy at the wrong time, but this is not the wrong time, so it it advisable to buy bitcoin now.If anyone tells you that you can make money from gambling or trading, be careful, both can take than give.",

If you have the capital to invest, I would rather recommend you invest in Bitcoin in a long term, it's a perfect way of investing when you purchase in a DCA way.",

You can't generate money as well because you aren't the head of either Federal Reserve or Central Bank. You can only make it thru working actively or maybe thru passive income.Why asking here? I mean with many jobs that are being posted in different online job website like Upwork or Fiver, you asked here? Is bounty campaign not enough to cover your expenses? I'm not judging you, only asking, but are you one of those people who left their job for bounty campaigns?",

I wouldn't recommend anything that relates to trading if you're looking for \"earning\" money since that requires money in the first place before you start, so go do some regular jobs. Minimum wage jobs would probably be your best bet but if you have the skillset then you can probably go up and receive better wages. It's gonna take time but that applies to everything imo.",
