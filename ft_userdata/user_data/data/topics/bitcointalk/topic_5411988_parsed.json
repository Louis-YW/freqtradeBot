  "content": "I'm developing a free forum service which will be consisted of a plugin, a front-end and a back-end. I need some feedback from the community to know how should I orientate this project. This is how I currently think about it: Users can tip each other via Lightning by either using lightning invoices (BOLT 11), lightning offers (BOLT 12) or keysend. My server will hold no funds, it will only act as an intermediary that'll exchange invoices, offers or nodes' public keys. To have your tip shown publicly (like merits), you'll need to pay in invoice, because that's the only way my server can know the money is sent (other options like offer and keysend don't interact with my server*). I'd like you to complete this form so I can have a better idea of what you'd like. Please make a post, replacing \"Y/N\" with \"Yes\" or \"No\" according to you.Â  Code:1. I would want such service: Y/N2. I have a Lightning node running: Y/N3. If yes, I use: (Choose: \"Core Lightning\", \"LND\", \"eclair\")4. If I don't have a Lightning node running, I'd still want a tipping service with an option to not hold custody of funds: Y/N5. I prefer paying in: (Choose \"invoice\", \"offer\", \"keysend\", \"other\")6. I want my tipping be shown just as merit (i.e., \"merited by BlackHatCoiner (8)\"): Y/N7. If such service was available I'd submit my node to earn tips: Y/N* Paying an invoice is neither known exactly by the intermediary, but installing a Core Lightning donation plugin and make it connect to it, makes it possible to know if someone paid it.",

Those that have expressed interest in it will use it at the very beginning, but since there isn't going to be a lot of users using it in the first place, those users will likely drop off in the long term. Generally speaking, not many people are willing to tip others for good information, a select few are more willing to give money for people that solved their problem, but with the internet these days, that's becoming less true since the information is already out there for free. Also, it doesn't help that Bitcoin is literally treated like it's gold dust around here. The idea is good, and I could imagine it would be really fun to participate in, but in reality no one is going to want to continue to give tips in the long run.",

We already have merits, how far can this go? I mean, if we didn't have merits, it'd make (again, little) sense to have a tipping page for established members. It also seems like most established users don't have Lightning node, which is very disappointing. From this very page, 8 (established) users have submitted the form, and only 1 does have a Lightning node running. Seems like we're still early. Lightning users with a node can't just pause there.
