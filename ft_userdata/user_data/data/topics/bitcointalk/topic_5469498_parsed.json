  "content": "LOL I've been wondering for a long that the app I have on my phone is my wallet and all that. I had no idea that I had misunderstood this. Let me now explain what I recently learned about your wallet.Let's start with the fundamentals of wallets for people who are new to this area. It's not a wallet in the conventional sense, whether it's Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic, or any other program you consider a wallet. Actually, you can use these wallet software to securely maintain and access your cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other blockchain assets.Your private key or seed phrase is what makes up your wallet.For illustration:It provides the option to produce a seed phrase or private key when you install Metamask.Other programs like Trust, MEW, and Atomic may all access your ETH if you use the same seed phrase across them all.Therefore, the next time you download a wallet app, you won't need to create a new seed phrase; instead, you can import the one you already have to manage your current funds across different apps.It's important to know that seed words are incredibly versatile and let you manage assets on any platform. Your phone was lost?No issue. Get a new one, put your seed phrase in whichever wallet you choose to install, and then. Because no other entity has access to your information, it cannot be hacked or copied.Blockchain technology is so revolutionary because of this.It's also important to stress that you should never give someone your private keys. The only access point to your blockchain assets is through your keys, which ensures their security.",

Because no other entity has access to your information, it cannot be hacked or copied. If you lose your phone, someone might gain access to it, penetrate a weak wall of security, and get to your wallet and keys. You shouldn't recommend to people to keep using the same wallets that a 3rd-party somewhere might be trying to get into.But even if you are the only person in possession of the keys, it's still not the best way to use the same seed across multiple wallets and devices. Why? If one of those wallets gets hacked, it's as if all your wallets got hacked because they share the same seed/keys. If one wallet turns out to have weak RNG or malicious developers who backdoor it or make it vulnerable, it's as if all your wallets are like that. Ultimately, you lose your coins. It's better to spread them out among wallets generated by trusted software/hardware on safe devices.  Quote from: Macoach on October 07, 2023, 06:36:44 AMIt's also important to stress that you should never give someone your private keys.

So alternatively you can call them wallet as the name implies but someone to say that aren't wallet then you are trying to complicate issues among those who doesn't have a deeper revelation on how they are being configured and operated. Yes there is nothing argue about all you said, technically they are correct but analytically the noob needs to follow due processes to understanding more better. But however you need to keep your keys and seedphrase out of your phone to another device or flash drive maybe to your system, and before your phone to get misplaced or stolen you needs a solid password otherwise if your phone isn't in security lock then there are every probability that someone can use your phone to transfer all your assets if your phone is without a good security locked.",

Don't go around doing stupid thing on your phone, make sure you import recovery seed into a phone that's brand new, because old phones are unsafe, you never know the type of person that used the phone last. Avoid stupid keyboards on play store, they might have access to every words you type on the phone and that includes you improving your recovery seed into your crypto wallet, better stick with OEM keyboard.I am used to creating wallet offline and the day it goes online is the day I am ready to sell everything in that wallet, I monitor using my public address only, it's safer for your crypto wallet to be offline than online.",

Read the replies above, even if it is your phone, it is a bad culture to be importing your seed phrase or keys on different devices, it creates redundancy to that seed and should any of the phone or device get caught with malwares that get your seeds them been even on other phones will be exposed. Develop the culture of storing them offline or in single device and then use watch only wallets on the others if need be Quote from: hugeblack on October 07, 2023, 10:27:57 AMIt is not an option to produce, but if the wallet does not give you a private key, it is most likely closed source and therefore you cannot trust it. Avoid using any closed source wallet, it is not well audited and there is no option to extract the private key.It is actually hard to extract private key from some closed source wallets except maybe you use the mnemonic seed to extract it from ioncoleman but there are some that can actually gives one the private keys. But the biggest thing in avoiding closed source wallets is the fact that you can even be able to see the source code and most of them make changes unknowingly to the users. One can’t even find out how is keys were generated or even maybe they have back door to store it. Closed source wallet should be definitely avoided",

So, there should be always some locks inside the mobile phone like fingerprint on every app, whether that includes your wallets which you are using and this also includes the YouTube channel information if someone has any. So, all this information would be safe. But the seed phrase you have imported should also be saved on a USB, or in your laptop, and should be at least in three places. For example, if you lost your mobile phone and your laptop got dead, then it will be present in your USB. I hope you understand!",

Well, both ways a good discussion it is, which most of the newbies don't question about. As they think they are storing their tokens on some drive or servers of the TW or any wallet. The only thing that matters is you should consider a non-custodial wallet for your tokens or coins. Because \"if you don't own the keys then you done to own the tokens or coins\". Simple as that but if you chose the way of having seed phrase to yourself then you are the only person who will be responsible for the loss (if any happens) you will be keeping track of your keys and must make sure that it did not fall into the wrong hands.And if you choose a way of custodial wallet like of some exchange wallet where you don't have the chance if keep a key for yourself because they are the ones with keys. And they can lock or do whatever they want to do with your tokens. How scary is that? But many repeated exchanges have built enough trust among users that people don't even hesitate to store thousands of dollars on those exchanges.",

      "body": "We all took things as wrong at the start so no tension and accepted the new technologies I am glad that you are making efforts and learning the potential of decentralization and non-custodial wallets. Because those who will learn these basics things and how much benefit these features have for an individual then they will automatically start to accept the fact that banks are doing wrong to us. They are using our assets for their own benefits and besides this, we all should follow a single statement that those who have the keys are the real owners of the tokens they have. This means if you are using a custodial wallet where you don't have to get the key instead you are just relying on some wallet and giving your funds to them and then you are taking risks just like holding your funds on centralized exchanges. But there are some pros and cons to it. For example, if you are storing your funds on cexs then you are no longer the real owner of your own funds but if they get lost and the cex you have chosen is a reputed one then that cex will refund you like the Binance and others. But they also refuse to refund so do not rely on others while you have the facility to be your own manager of your assets. Be your own boss and owner of your own assets and never depend on others in the case of tokens.",
