So if you already did KYC on binance and binance is the best crypto exchange, i would rather try to stay with it. I recommend trying to convert GBP to USD using any online cantor or inside the banking account, if the bank has such an option, and sending $$ to binance. You can also try to use bitcoin ATM - https://coinatmradar.com/ i see there are some available in UK.",

Unless Binance finds an alternative partner to Skrill Limited (even if these limitations have nothing to do with government intervention).",

Instead of accumulating power further, GHash.IO stopped the pool from accepting more participants. The mining power shrunk, and decentralization of the bitcoin network was reinstated.Initiated by our team, the first roundtable of bitcoin miners concluded that, for open finance to live up to its promise, industry participants must uphold decentralization. For that to happen, a broad adoption of cryptocurrencies must take place.Since then, we’ve dedicated years of work to making access to crypto and blockchain technologies simple. When CEX.IO was the first to let people buy and sell Bitcoin with a credit card, we were just getting started.We are indeed the UK-based crypto exchange but we have offices all over the world. Concerning our policies, here is a page with all the licenses and regulations https://cex.io/legal-security. If you have any additional questions - we would be happy to answer them.",
