The scam you are promoting is a common ponzi scheme in which the income of early participants is paid out through the investments of new participants. On this basis, you get a negative tag so that everyone can see that you are a scammer.",

      "body": "it is very visible that you are offering a ponzi investment, looking at the plans you offer are not very attractive although we all know that you should not put money into these ponzi schemes, but I will talk about what I saw on tv a few years ago about the people who they looked at these ponzi sites as a gamein those times (a few years ago) these people who looked at hyip sites as a game they did math that a ponzi site with 150% return plans in 30 days and managed by an experienced administrator could at most last 2 to 3 cycles of payment and classified this ponzi site as being a high risk investmentI honestly don't even see what part of the ponzi site could have any advantage at that time and not even in this time and I don't understand how the police don't keep chasing creators of hyip sites",
