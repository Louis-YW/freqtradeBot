Its 2022 you know? This joke is not funny anymore. Flying spaghetti monster was also a joke and some people did not get it and after more then a decade few tens of thousands of people are Pastafarians. Don't be one of them. Shib is not a good coin to invest. Its not even a good coin to speculate on because its too manipulated.And its too soon to call \"ALTCOINS JUST BOTTOMED\"",

It is straight to the point and not boring us with meaningless bullshit. \"Alts bottomed out and shib to the moon\" Everything a pro trader needs to know is packed in this sentence. First of all, it lets us know that the alts have bottomed out. Which means, almost any alt you get now will make you money. Second of all, he is informing us the best alt of all alts, shibcoin, and how it is going to moon. Hedge fund managers should hire this guy. He knows his shit.",

When Shib goes to the moon it will be chaos for the whole crypto industry.It's not like I underestimate them, but I do.   I have been a supporter before but reality will strike back and that's when you will realize it's not the future of cryptocurrencies. Not Doge and not Ethereum, it's all Bitcoin. How? Altcoins pump when Bitcoin is up. It means a lot when you are monitoring price fluctuations daily. This is just another attempt to hype Shiba.

Only time will tell, and we don't know for sure. People who say Shiba will increase are speculating about it, and with the bitcoin price still below, it's hard to say for sure that Shiba can rise again. But maybe @OP still believes Shiba can improve, just as we still believe bitcoin can increase higher. But bitcoin is different from Shiba",

Its better not to risk anything yet because you could lose money instead because of some predictions and analysis that it has bottomed. Don't think that it will suddenly shoot to the moon if indeed altcoins had bottomed, it doesn't work that way. The prices could stay as is for a long time. It needs another big event for it to at least swing.",

But I guess they will fall on the stupid people because why will they invest on a meme coin like shib when there are so many great quality coins out there. Maybe some didn't classify their selves as one but they think they are wise to drop the support once they already got their true intention. With the description laid out by the op, there is no need for us to view the link.It will only be a waste of time but I don't think a single visit can count as a views in youtube but you will need to watch the video first without skippings for your views to be counted. There might still be shib supporters in the forum who are interested to see the video.",
