  "content": "Everyone know Russian businessman are using cryptocurrency. But no one ask how they turn Russian ruble to cryptocurrency? They use Sberbank and in exchange they took Webmoney. Not only Sberbank Russian Post, Russian card and wire transfer is also available to turn them into Webmoney. And here comes 1Xbet, they are accepting Webmoney. Webmoney giving everyone 12% to 20% and even more. So customers are refusing every payment method and taking Webmoney giving USDT,USDC type stable coin. If you give them cryptocurrency they will give you best extra % they can. And that's how Russia is using their brain again and collect their war money. They are doing is silently. 17 August they exchange 980977.93 WMZ only by exchanging USDT, they have other payment option as well. Is their any way it can be stopped? ? ?",

People are exchanging 100k from per account , per day. And Webmoney is usingmostly in betting sites. Most probably you can answer this question, What 1xbet do with this huge Webmoney? they exchange it? That will cost them huge.",

Who is paying this 20% extra commission?Even if what you claim is true, you have not provided a single proof of its validity. The 1xbet site was launched by a private company that has several other sites operating in the same field (gambling). According to the research I did after reading your article, I did not find a single indication that it was launched by Russia (the authorities) or that it had a relationship with the parent company.And even if your logic is sound without proofs, this means that webmoney is involved in money laundering as well, which I do not expect as a big conspiracy. Simply because the amount of money that may have been laundered may not be able to buy a single warplane and bear the costs of the soldiers on the ground.",

Ban webmoney in all the other countries so they can't able to convert the purchased Rubles into anything!Now let's talk about the reality, the money we are talking is huge for a common man but as someone above said the total value is under 1 million then its not really an amount to consider for a country like Russia to destruct their economic structure.",

      "body": "Banning Webmoney will only serve to hurt everybody. But it will improve relations between Iran and Russia. Russia and Iran have been friends for a long time. But sanctions are improving their ties.Russia and Iran are cementing an alliance amid global sanctionsQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-31-russia-iran-cementing-alliance-amid-global-sanctions.html#Two of America’s biggest rivals – Iran and Russia – are cementing stronger ties as their isolation from the international world stage is driving them to conduct more trade and military and scientific cooperation.The deliberate isolation of Russia with sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine has only accelerated efforts to bring Russia and Iran together. Both countries have often talked of establishing closer ties in the past, with few concrete results. (Related: Epic fail: Joe Biden’s sanctions have actually benefited the Russian economy.)But now that extreme Russian sanctions have cut off many of the Russian economy’s former ties with the West, it has turned to Iran to help both countries mitigate the impact of sanctions by mutually finding new markets for their products.Since the start of the year, bilateral trade between Russia and Iran has gone up by 10 percent. Some of the new deals being negotiated by Iranian and Russian traders include Iran selling clothing to Russian retailers to replace the disappearing Western brands and Iranian factories providing Russian car makers with automotive spare parts.Perhaps more importantly, in July, Iran surpassed Egypt and Turkey to become Russia’s largest wheat buyer, receiving nearly 400,000 tons of wheat that month, more than double what the other two countries receive.“Iran can only buy wheat from a limited number of sources,” said Masha Belikova, a London-based grains analyst. “When the war started, Russia was targeted by sanctions and faced payments issues. Iran was one of the few countries ready to accept” the political risk of continuing to trade with Russia.Russia, Iran also agree on closer military cooperationPerhaps more alarming to the United States is the increased military cooperation between Russia and Iran.Back in June, American intelligence alleged that Iran hosted a Russian delegation to showcase the country’s attack drones. Intelligence further claims that Iran is training Russian soldiers to use Iranian military technology in Ukraine....",

Good luck with that.The problem that you see only good things in decentralization in crypto and some people see only bad. We should see all and have working mechanisms to avoid bad side in all possible way. If there will be a choice between stop the war and death of all innocent people or to continue run \"decentralized crypto\", i will support the first one. I don't have anything bad with fair government is accounting crypto, if this stop russian orcs from using it. People's lives more important than ambitions of some angry nerds",

      "body": "\"Money laundering\" is simply a term that somebody tries to use to take away your freedom to make and use any kind of money you want.If Russia had some kind of agreements with the US and other countries of the world to use the USD, those agreements were destroyed by the US and the other countries when they did the sanctions against Russia.Of course, we are seeing that the sanctions failed, and actually became things of great benefit for Russia. But since Russia is not allowed to use the USD, and since the contracts for using it are broken, there is no money laundering involved in whatever ways they use whatever money.What? Do you expect Russia to simply roll over and die? Are you asking their people to all commit suicide? They are free... to themselves. And they are using their freedom to build a prosperous world for themselves. If other countries want to destroy themselves by attempting to take away Russian freedom, that's up to them.",
