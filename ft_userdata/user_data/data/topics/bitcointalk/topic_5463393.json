  "content": "1. A crypto gambling fork will emergeIn the crypto world, a fork happens when some users of a specific blockchain, some community members, disagree with other members of the community. What happens is those who disagree fork a crypto, creating a second currency.This happened to Ethereum in 2016 when the crypto went through a hard fork, which means certain nodes (computers) on the network disagreed with Vatalik Buterin’s plans to turn Ethereum into a proof of stake instead of proof of work protocol.A fork in the crypto gambling industry will occur in 2024 where players have to decide if they wish continue to play with a decentralized organization like Nitrobetting or a centralized organization like most online sports betting companies.Although a sportsbook may accept bitcoin, it doesn’t mean it is decentralized. For example, American based U.S. sportsbooks require you to give them your social security number, which goes against Satoshi’s entire concept of Bitcoin as being decentralized and anonymous when he created the blockchain in February 2009.Players will have to make a choice. Do they wish to be a part of the truly decentralized gambling world? Or do they wish to remain part of a centralized gambling world that accepts crypto currency as a means of payment?2. Individual sovereignty will become a buzzword among crypto gamblersFor many gamblers, the predicted crypto gambling hard fork will result in running to online sportsbooks and casinos like NitroBetting, which require an email address to open an account and which are truly decentralized.Another way to describe this is to use the words individual sovereignty. Crypto natives, true crypto believers, have a deep rooted sense of personal freedom and personal responsibility – – they believe they are the caretakers of their world.Sports bettors, casino players, gamblers of all persuasion, share the same belief of personal freedom, especially when it comes to their finances. The words individual sovereignty will become a buzzword for those players who choose truly decentralized gambling.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/4c75063",

This is actually strange to me and just as the post above mine stated it’s common in the crypto space to encounter forks but for gambling industry sounds odd to me. If you don’t mind Op, have there been a fork in the gambling industry? Or is this the first one to have ever been predicted? If it has happened before can you please share material/links for us to know more about it.Edit:I just did a quick search and I was unable to find anything related to it.",

It'll be good if a crypto gambling fork means we'll see more non-KYC sportsbooks because most of the top sportsbooks are currently in between, where they don't require KYC but can still force their players to submit it if needed. Tbh, I think we're going the other way around with more gambling sites encouraging their players to get verified.",

But I don't think this is a fork. Well, you must have used it as a metaphor, but the main point with a fork is that it is generally a copy of the original version, which I guess a truly decentralized gambling platform is not, in relation to centralized gambling platforms.",

      "body": "Every gambler has the right to determine what they want in gambling. And whether they will still choose a fiat-based casino or switch to a crypto-based casino, it's their choice and they should already know the risks for each choice. But the main risk is that they can still experience defeat regardless of the casino they use, so they must understand that playing gambling is just for fun.The trend of gambling will probably increase in 2024 because many crypto-based projects will be launched including crypto-based projects for gambling. And while it may seem like the gambling industry hasn't developed much at the moment, it has in recent years. So every year, developments will occur in the gambling industry. And KYC will be the concern of every gambler who will choose a casino and they need to pay attention and look for a trusted casino so that problems don't occur later.",

The crypto gambling industry will stay pretty much the same in the upcoming years. Most casinos and sportsbooks will remain centralized and the vast majority of the gamblers wouldn't mind using a centralized platform.If your platform Nitrobetting really is so revolutionary(just because you claim that it's decentralized), then why it still isn't the most popular gambling platform in the world right now?Don't get me wrong. I also want more decentralized gambling. I'm sick of all those horror stories of gamblers getting scammed and not getting their money out of the casinos. Unfortunately, things simply won't change that fast in the gambling industry.",

A lot of this potential improvements for cryptogambling industry would be also dependent with adoption of cryptocurrencies or this industry in general.In fact, the branching of the use of crypto for gambling has occurred since a few years ago, even if crypto is said as a legal means of payment, it is far ahead of the development of crypto gambling, considering that for payments only there are only one or two countries that have permitted this.Now times have changed, technological developments are growing rapidly and from there cryptocurrency assets are also expanding wings to spread widely in many forms of major developments.But this actually has a positive impact on the development of crypto because more and more people will know and adopt crypto for some of their interests, especially for gambling or betting.For the next trend, it might be difficult to predict because crypto is an asset that has a value from lowest to highest but has no real form, so maybe the development of the next trend is that more and more countries will legalize crypto as a legal means of payment and can use crypto to gamble in casinos. land based or traditional casino.We are all definitely waiting for this kind of successful development and with the support of everyone who leverages crypto I am sure the development will be faster and easier.",

The concern is whether the casino will support the branching of the coin or stick with the coins in the casino.What makes gamblers decide to play in a decentralized or centralized casino is the gambler himself, and it has nothing to do with gambling. Gamblers may choose a decentralized casino like the existing popular casinos because they don't need to do KYC even though KYC has now started to be implemented for casino members. But it's this KYC issue that differentiates between decentralized and centralized casinos.Crypto gamblers are anonymous gamblers who only need an email and password to register at a casino.
