Because I found out that both the \"dot(.)com\" and \"dot(.)net\" were using the same license.",

I hope that in the future you can buy copper membership to promote your site.I see your site provides a lot of options and features which are pretty good.But for the promotion board here it is still bad and it is better to change it to give users more interest.",

This is the first time to encounter my country being restricted on an online casino since we have an open law for online casino. I wonder what’s license you are using or what country you are based for my country get denied.I’m sure other countries will be restricted too since my country is not available, BTW I’m from SEA so I’m confused on this restriction.Buy a copper member to remove the restrictions of your account for posting images.",

I just visited your site using my mobile browser and haven't seen much on itI only see payments for cryptos like bitcoin and no options for other cryptos like litecoin, dogecoin , ethereum and others but would love to add other cryptos to make it easier for users to test play your site and make deposits, btw I think you should answer @Cantsay's question because of the importance of confirming the main domain as there are 2 active domains .net and .com of your site, at least we know which one is real and fake to prevent confusion as well as fraud.",

They offer Betfair games through various sites like Whitehorse, Orbit Exchange, Fair Exchange and others. As long as I was winning little money, there was no major withdrawal problem, but I won several thousand euros in the last few months and my account was suspended. Their claim is that it is Betfair's decision (odds manipulation). Obviously, this is a pack of lies because my bets were 100% fair and all my problems with the Brokerstorm started when I tried to withdraw part of my money.Below I am presenting my correspondence with Brokerstorm:What is certain is that I am very anti-gambling/betting sites that are just starting out here, of course we don't want to get stuck after using the Brokerstorm site.Why are there so many complaints of loss outside about Brokerstorm, are you here with the same mission and vision.",

      "body": "I confess that I am not a person with a broad understanding of how Betting Broker works in practice in relation to the TOS of casinos, especially currently with the KYC issue, so I hope you understand me if I say something wrong, correct me if I do is wrong: Betting Broker creates accounts in several casinos, right? then people create an account at Betting Broker then people deposit money on the Betting Broker website to place bets on games with the best odds and without bet limits and Betting Broker takes that money and bets on the casino with the best odds, and that's how it works does it work right?as i said i am not someone with knowledge of how exactly Betting Broker is even searching on google and my theory at least from what i could conclude from google and what i just mentioned, but my question is if Betting Broker is not against the TOS of casinos? because in practice the Betting Broker creates an account in a casino but who will be using the account are many other people, shouldn't that be wrong and against the TOS of all casinos?And what about the KYC issue? does the Betting Broker do KYC at the casino? I imagine that the Betting Broker keeps the account bonus because as the Betting Broker creates the account, the benefits of the VIP account are all with the Betting Broker. so how can this be of benefit to people who use Betting Broker instead of creating an account in person at the casino? I imagine they say things like anonymity and no limitations, but is that really worth it?",
