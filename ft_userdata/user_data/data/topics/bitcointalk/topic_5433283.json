  "content": "The 2023 Australian Open is 1 week away.Since Wimbledon, Novak has entered four ATP tournaments and won three. The won he lost he made the final and arguably should have beaten Rune.I have been watching him closely and he seems to be playing more aggressively and his forehand looks better.This is his favourite Grand Slam by far and playing Novak at Rod Laver arena is almost as hard as playing Rafa at Rolland Garros.I truly believe this will be one of the most dominant title runs by Novak especially after he was deported by the Australian government last year. He wants revenge.Fun fact, I placed a six figure (fiat) bet on Novak in 2021 when he won the title and plan on betting the same amount with BTC after he completes the Adelaide tournament in a few days.What do you guys think?",

That was quite different, in a year in which Djokovic won almost everything there was to win. And there is also a new young generation ready to take over from the experienced players. Out of the top 15 there are certainly a few players who can beat Djokovic. Alcaraz is the number 1 in the world and has gained a lot of experience in recent years. On gravel he would be the favorite together with Nadal, but on this surface it is a different story. But Alcaraz was good at the US open in the summer, in itself that surface is not very different from the surface at the Australian open. the top is close to each other. That was very different in the 90s and 2000s.",

I remember 2 years ago when he won he ws serving ridiculous and hit the most aces during the tournament. Zverev normally gives him trouble but I don't think he is 100% after breaking his leg.",

It was surely oversight on his part, but it would have been a different outcome if proper communication was done before he decides to take a flight towards the land down under.

Alcaraz is a beast on his own accord but yeah, he has been quite inactive after his injury in Paris. For sure he has recovered by now but that inactivity will surely take a hit on your reflexes and the way you perform.",

I'm the biggest Novak fan but was disappointed with his conduct last year. He looked amazing against Shapavalov yesterday. Was moving well and his forehand looked powerful.",

Medvedev has been in average form, Rafa isn't healthy, Sasha may not play and Carlos hasn't been active. I can't see anyone else pushing him let alone beating him at his favourite Grand Slam.",
