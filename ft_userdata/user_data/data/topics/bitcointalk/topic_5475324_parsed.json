  "content": "Or used lightning network  anywhere else? I see Kraken exchange gives you the option to use LN to move bitcoin to and from Kraken exchange.I used Kraken for years to buy bitcoin but so far have never used the LN option for any transactions. Is there any reason why I might want to?Questions:1. Since a special lightning wallet is required to receive bitcoin via the lightning network, does that  mean you can never use the LN to move bitcoin directly into a hardware wallet such as Coldcard or Trezor? If so why hasn't any hardware wallets implemented LN? Technical limitations?Is there any reason why anyone would choose LN over the main bitcoin network? I know LN fees are much cheaper but if you can't use it to move your bitcoin to and from a standard hardware wallet then what is the point?2. How secure are lighting wallets? Are they considered hot wallets?3. Can LN be used to actually buy and sell bitcoin or is it only a means for moving BTC between wallets?4. Are there any bridges available (lightning chain to BTC chain and vice versa)?5. What are current practical use cases of lightning network (not just theoretical)? For example, are people currently using LN for international remittances on any significant scale? Do any retailers use LN to accept payment for goods and services?6. Is lighting network still in very early stages of adoption? LN is a great idea but so far adoption and real world usefulness seems very limited.",

Since a special lightning wallet is required to receive bitcoin via the lightning network, does that  mean you can never use the LN to move bitcoin directlyinto a hardware wallet such as Coldcard or Trezor? If so why hasn't any hardware wallets implemented LN? Technical limitations?Because hardware wallets are offline wallets. Lightning network has to do with online.

I know LN fees are much cheaper but if you can't use it to move your bitcointo and from a standard hardware wallet then what is the point?Some people use it to hold little amount of money. It is available on some payment options.For noncustodial means of using lightning network, people can open and close channel and use it to mix coins.Quote from: headingnorth on November 24, 2023, 11:59:53 AM2. How secure are lighting wallets? Are they considered hot wallets?They are hot wallets.Quote from: headingnorth on November 24, 2023, 11:59:53 AM3. Can LN be used to actually buy and sell bitcoin or is it only a means for moving BTC between wallets?Why not, if the buyer and seller agree to use it.Quote from: headingnorth on November 24, 2023, 11:59:53 AM4. Are there any bridges available (lightning chain to BTC chain and vice versa)?If you use wallet like Electrum, you will move coins from on-chain to open a lightning channel. Use it for payment and also use it to receive payment. You can move your coins back on-chain. Both opening and closing channel will require on-chain transaction fee which is the transaction fee paid to miners.Quote from: headingnorth on November 24, 2023, 11:59:53 AM5. What are current practical use cases of lightning network (not just theoretical)? For example, are people currently using LN for international remittanceson any significant scale? Do any retailers use LN to accept payment for goods and services?As lightning network adoption continue to increase little by little, it is getting accepted as payment option. Also if you know how to use it to pay and the receiver knows how to use it to receive, you can use it for remittance.Quote from: headingnorth on November 24, 2023, 11:59:53 AM6. Is lighting network still in very early stages of adoption? LN is a great idea but so far adoption and real world usefulness seems very limited.The adoption is slow, but still increasing. Let us expect more to come. But the reason for the slow adoption is because it is difficult to set up lightning network on wallets that you will open and close channel. But easy to use lightning wallets are existing now in a way the you will not have a node or open a channel. More exchanges are supporting it now also including Binance, OKX and some other exchanges.",

If so why hasn't any hardware wallets implemented LN? Technical limitations?needing their special wallet is because the 'channels' THEY use, uses locked BTC that are very old. meaning THEIR partners wont be YOU. you have to be several hops away where you create a channel with someone else on a path to krakenyou would need to use a separate thing where you set up a channel with someone, but that involves you locking your own coin you already have out of the system to lock up to tempt someone to channel with you. you then need to get kraken to find a path to YOUR channel partner for your channel partner to then pay you kraken value. and then you need to get your channel with your channel partner to mutually close your channels so you can unlock your bitcoin and claim the value from kraken(via your channel partner)then you can put that coin into a hardware walletbut if you are trying to move bitcoin to a hardware wallet, the bitcoin tx fee's to lock, then to open a channel and close a channel is 4x* compared to just giving kraken a btc address directly to your btc hardware wallet.. so LN is not a practical way to get btc to a hardware walletLN is only cheaper if you keep funds in LN and just ping pong balance with other user in LN rather then using onchain payments to pay people over timeto just receive value to lock in BTC hardware wallet as a single event. LN is not cheaper*i say 4x because 1. moving your own hardware wallet funds into LN wallet =1 tx just to then be managed by your LN software. before you even opened channel2. finding a channel partner in LN wallet to then open channel with someone = 2nd tx2. closing channel with someone = 3rd tx to put funds back into your LN wallet outside of the channel 4. moving your own hardware wallet funds into LN wallet = 4th tx",
