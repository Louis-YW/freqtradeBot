We want to create an VPN-like application, in which you can Configure a full Node in one click, and access it by API. All of your BTC wallet traffic will then go to Nodey RPCs of your choose. All or most of the Nodes we will offer will be secured with TOR Network.https://i.postimg.cc/rwN8hzPy/img.pngI would love you to give me some opinions.
