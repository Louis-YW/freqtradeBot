So there is no consequences, the only thing is that since it is in a public ledger, anyone can track the movement, dates when it was move, where it move, fees associated with it.",

Miners could mine bitcoins easily in the past, low difficulty, less competitors and block rewards were high too.Initially, block reward is 50 BTC each block that halved to 25 BTC, 12.5 BTC and 6.25 BTC after the third halving in 2020. With 50 BTC for one block, you can have 5,000 BTC from mining only 100 Bitcoin blocks.Controlled supplyMiners did not mine bitcoin with ASICs in the past, they started with CPU, laptop, GPU, FPGA and ASIC.

As it keeps rising, a small amount today would look like a lot in the future. For example the 50BTC block reward was once worth barely $0.5. Many individuals have bought or mined bitcoin those days.There is no \"consequence\" of having money! Why would there be? There can only be consequence if the owner advertises it and puts themselves at risk of theft or other types of attacks/harm.",

      "body": "Clearly, the wallet that contained the $600 million worth of Bitcoin wasn't the scammer's wallet. It's one of Binance's wallets. And from this information, we can tell that the scammer is not really a wise scammer because he/she is using not only a centralized exchange but one which also requires KYC from all its users. Having said this, your brother should report this to Binance, along with all the evidences. This dumb scammer will not only lose his/her money, his/her identity would also be known. Anyway, I'm not sure if there is an individual who owns 36,754.6BTC, but it is possible. Why will anybody possess such a huge amount? Well, it's probably the same reason that all of us want to have as much Bitcoin as possible, although I think such individual should be spreading his/her coins in different addresses. As to the consequences, I guess it's good because he/she doesn't have to be working anymore knowing that he/she's got $600 million already. He/she also won't have to stack more coins anymore because he/she's already got so many already. But he/she could also be targeted by scammers and robbers for owning so much.",

There are many possible reasons why someone might possess such a large amount of Bitcoin, including:They may have purchased the Bitcoin when it was less valuable and held onto it as it appreciated in value.They may have earned the Bitcoin through mining or other means.They may have received the Bitcoin as payment for goods or services.There are no inherent consequences to owning a large amount of Bitcoin. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin, like any other asset, is subject to market fluctuations and may lose value. Additionally, some countries have stricter regulations on the ownership and use of Bitcoin, and individuals may be required to report their holdings or pay taxes on their Bitcoin-related income.",

If he assisted in trade, doesn't that imply he was a member of the team in some capacity, which suggests he was aware of what he was doing? I don't think that for $2,000, Binance will help. These are huge sums for you, but not for the exchange. When contacting crypto, a person must understand all the risks, whether he trades incorrectly or stores his seed phrases incorrectly.As for your questions, I don’t know the reasons that could prohibit a person from having large amounts of bitcoin; this is probably how he ensures his business, and indeed, only the owner can know why he needs such large amounts. Similarly, I do not see any consequences; if a person does not violate any laws, why should he be afraid of someone? Of course, he is not obliged to talk about how much and why he needs bitcoins. This is his right to privacy.",

Let's take for example the OP who is a Member rank with the potential to become a Full member, and asks such a banal question about whales, as if it is impossible for someone today to have 1000 or 10 000 BTC or even much more. The Winklevoss twins reportedly have over 100 000 BTC, and MicroStrategy has over 130 000 - and I'm sure there are those who own even larger amounts that are not publicly exposed. Regardless of one's opinion about it, I think that such things should be private as much as possible, at least when it comes to private individuals who can become an easy target for hackers, as well as ordinary criminals.",

That incident took place 12 years ago, and Bitcoin is now 14 years old. As of then, 1 bitcoin was not even worth $100. From records, Bitcoin reached $1 for the first time in February 2011, and in 2012, people saw the price at $12, less or more. So I assume such an offer could have only been made then and not now.You can say yes, but believe me, nobody will offer you 2000 bitcoins now just to change your name to Bitcoin.I guess it is not a private individual that has such a large holding but rather a company that deals in bitcoin like the forex companies, a CEX, or a casino (as also mentioned by Dave1).",
