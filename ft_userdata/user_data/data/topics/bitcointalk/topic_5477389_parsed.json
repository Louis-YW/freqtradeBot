Are you profitable or not, and why?Well as which one I am better is surely being able to find the right bet as for managing the bankroll I have problems,as soon as I hit a winning bet I tend to go right after another and if I can't find a good one I go to slot machines which is the worse money drainer in gambling.I would be in some profit if I were patient enough but no I am not so far.",

      "body": "Honest answer. I am not in profit right now in both sports betting and casino games. But I do think I have more losses in casinos than it is with sports betting.You can see me mostly in the NBA betting thread and most of the time I am 1/3, 2/4, or worse 1/4 in my bet results. It's not easy to make a perfect bet anymore either I lack the spreads or I got greedy and took the highest handicap that is available. NBA suddenly got predictable because of the changes in the rosters and rookies had been stepping up their games making other known weak teams become stronger that is why the spreads are harder to reach.Then, I have player props as my side bet which I usually don't share. Not that I don't want to but because it's too long that it might fill my whole reply with it.  Despite that, I still think I am better off with sports betting. Casino games are so hungry that they swallow my wallet immediately, winning moments are too rare and because of that I actually seldom play casino games now. I don't want to lose all my balance there because I am saving it for sports where my chances are higher, in my own computation. It's a long battle in sports betting but it's more fun and the risk is lower when you do your homework.",

Are you profitable or not, and why?Its' very hard to answer mate, I think both should be present if you are a gambler. I mean, you see some good bets along the way, and you have to carefully choose which one to bet because of your small bankroll. So as per experience, you need to really pick one in order to be profitable.So for me it always depends on the situation, but if you are a wise gambling, I think selecting the right bet will be your first priority as it will increased your bankroll overtime. It could be a single bet with medium to high odds or parlay bet.",

I generally am a little picky on my bets, taking time to consider how much I'm going to bet and with what odds, on what game, etc., while also being a little reserved to not exceed a certain budget. I try not to keep a large amount of money on my account; something like $50 to $100 seems okay, while it's usually on the lower side ($50-$60). I always withdraw any earnings and stick to leaving some funds on my account.That way, even if I get irritated and emotional after losing a few bets, because it'll happen eventually and we're humans, it's not always easy to control your feelings, especially if you're not having a good day, it's inconvenient for me to bet more money. I wouldn't go through the trouble of depositing more funds; I'd have let off steam by then and wouldn't need to play anymore at that point.",

Everyone of us here probably are challenge with the bankroll management since most of us does not considering sports betting seriously, I mean we don't do it on a regular basis, we just gamble to have fun, that's it. As a gambler who like to try to be investing in sports, I watched a lot of youtube videos to help me understand everything, including the how to analyze, manage the bankroll and stay discipline,... but... there's always this big \"but\" beacuse the execution is the most challenging part and I usually fail.",

Are you profitable or not, and why?Managing my bankroll I would say, but it's better to know these two, it cost nothing to get used to these two, unless you don't like any sports which makes any data analysis useless for someone like you, so far I have some share of losses and some share of wins, I spent most times on other casino games than sports, unless it's my favourite sport game in action. It's harder to always select the right bet, it's like saying you will always win, so I think that's almost impossible, even if you choose the right bet you don't know what the end result of the game will be, so what makes it the right bet anyway? Managing your bankroll is the best solution for every gambling activities, if done right you will be split from the stupid desires in gambling and you will avoid unnecessary risks that can cost you your life goals, there is never going to be anything that beats managing your bankroll, you will be in total control and avoid ruining your own life.",

      "body": "I'd say managing my bankroll is what I'm currently good at, as it's completely under my control. Unlike predicting games, that always changes to negative results before the game is over. Judging from the recent results of big teams losing their games. Many players lose their predictions and don't understand why a team like Arsenal won't be able to score a single goal. I'd play clubs like Arsenal to score, not to win, but the game results don't fit into any of those categories. Imagine millions of people who would stake Arsenal to score. They'll all lose their money. So, since the money management depends on the gambler, it's better to bet a small amount on such games than wagering too much hoping to win big. However, the regret comes when the team ends up winning the game. The gambler will feel greedy, and think he would have won bigger rewards if he wagered more money. Sometimes the risk is worth it, and another way around it's safe to manage our funds. Instead of losing out on a game that'll consume a huge portion of our savings.",

Are you profitable or not, and why?If I'm one of the two, I would say I'm on the managing your bankroll side, because every bet and gambling I do is all recorded for me to keep track of my earnings. For example, when I have allocated capital for my gambling games and betting games, all of the transactions I do are recorded, and the either win or lose amount is recorded. I do this thing for me to keep track of what's happening to my capital, whether it's earning or not. From that, I could manage my capital and either stop or play games that have a higher chance of winning, but if at some point the whole capital burns, then only that allocated money will be the one who's going to lose. It's like I'm setting up a wall to limit my spending so I can manage my bankroll efficiently. because I'm confident enough to say that I'm a responsible gambler who has discipline and good management of my money.",

There can be a match between a strong and a weak team, I may go for draw if I know that the strong team can lose. It would be surprising that the match might ended draw, although the chance is small, but with big odd. The fact that some people will go for the stronger club to win but yet losing money makes selecting matches and games to be of less relevance at times, but to manage your bank roll by spending just little on gambling is far more better.",

Which are you better at: selecting the right bet or managing your bankroll?Personally, I will clearly prioritize the point of money management because no matter how good the bet you choose, it doesn't necessarily guarantee victory. But if you can manage your finances well, you can be said to be winner because we are unlikely to experience big losses or lose a lot of money.We may be able to get the right and good bets and even win the bets, but if we don't have money management then the winnings will also be in vain because they will definitely end up gambling again without having anything left.After all money management will be more difficult than getting the right bets and all professional gamblers will definitely be able to understand things like this.QuoteAnd, how has it been going so far? Are you profitable or not, and why?Of course, having good money management can also provide good development because I don't experience bigger losses and I don't feel disappointed, let alone having to suffer defeat because the amount of money has already been set to be received if it is lost.Meanwhile, will definitely get the benefits because when win, can decide to take some of the withdrawal so that can enjoy that amount.If gambler has the right approach, they can make good decisions for themselves and they know how to organize everything they do in gambling so they can get the positive side.",

Selecting the right bet is too easy for me as it will only requires history or records of performances to analyse and that may give me an idea which one to place a bet. Managing our own bankroll is complicated most specially if we are having no limits and discipline. Sometimes emotions will dictate what to do that could lead to mismanagement or mishandling of funds.

Are you profitable or not, and why?I am definitely better at the latter, managing my bankroll is more easy for me than picking the right bet to place my money on. When I compare myself to my friends, I know that I am not the best person to place profitable bets. A few of my friends are quite successful in football betting because they follow the league into the smalles detail. I am more of a big picture kind of guy and only really follow my home team, which makes it a bid hard to give accurate predictions and place my bets accordingly. However, remaining in full control of my money is for me the key to remain profitable. Learning how to control your bankroll is what saved me from not going broke over the years of my gambling history. I think it came from the strong focus on poker in my early days on gambling, because you need to have a close eye on your bankroll all the time and adapt quickly. You can only move up the stakes when making money, and as soon as you lose money you need also lower the stakes again. There will be losing streaks and we need to have the capital to survive it.",
