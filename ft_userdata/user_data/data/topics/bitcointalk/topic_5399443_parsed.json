Everywhere i find it shows formulas which i am not interested in, I am interested in how I can implement it in my trading decisions.Volatility is the fluctuation of such price action on the market. Meaning it could go down and up on a short time period. Its really happened on crypto and stocks. The more volatile is that means a huge risk but also high reward to some traders. This is liked by some leverage traders since they are earning through it. Sometimes even greater than 4% within hour of trading volume. Either its on going up position or going down.",

Like for example if btc volatility is 4% does that means it goes up and down 4%?As I understand it; volatility represents the standard deviation (SD) from the price in the timeframe you're studying, it basically tells you how much an asset's price changed over a period of time, a percentage of 4% represents less change than one of 29% in the same period.For example; if you're looking at a 24 hour period, and at different times (n) in the day, the price of Bitcoin was significantly different from the average of all price points, that represents higher deviation, than one which ic much closer.Quote from: coinmanhere on May 20, 2022, 04:06:12 AMEverywhere i find it shows formulas which i am not interested in, I am interested in how I can implement it in my trading decisions.There are lots of formulas available for calculating volatility, depending on what asset you are looking at.To implement this in trading decisions, you would have to understand more about SD, dispersion, variance and how they are related.",

Everywhere i find it shows formulas which i am not interested in, I am interested in how I can implement it in my trading decisions.Simple answer to solve your problem about this volatility computation is to use an indicator on the chart that determines the volatility of a certain coin using a certain time span. Use Average True Range(ATR) indicator in your chart to determine the range of the movement of the coin that you are watching. It average all the movement that happened on the coin with a set time span. This is what I'm using to find the best coin to trade for a day and also for my stop loss setup. Here's the tutorial of ATR: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp",

First, it doesn't need to go in both directions and the way it is calculated will most likely not end with a 4% result.",

OkImagine having kerosene and methane gas in a closed cylinder, open the two at the same time, you will find out that the container carrying methane gas will quickly evaporate, the same analogy happens to cryptocurrency price volatility, it is very fast that's why it is always recommended to used stop loss on your trades as it may be difficult to exit a trade when the market is having a downtrend.Use last week scenario of the Luna fiasco and the overall crypto market how they fell, it happens very fast that you can easily lose 50% of your position, that's why it is advisable to take caution if you are new to cryptocurrency, however, the reverse is very dope in the sense that bitcoin will help you beat other investment you ever had.

Everywhere i find it shows formulas which i am not interested in, I am interested in how I can implement it in my trading decisions.Volatility is the amount of \"error\" trading prices have around their mean movement (\"Drift\"). The higher the volatility, the higher the movement, those variation from the straight line are wide. Analytically, you can compute the volatility by computing the standard deviation of daily (log) returns and multiplying this number by sqrt(time)= sqrt(260) to obtain an annualised volatility. Volatility of 40% means that there is a 68% probability the price after one year will have moved LESS than 40%  in either direction. This explains how volatility can be used to trade: the higher the volatility, the higher the movement, the higher the trading opportunities. Trading low volatility assets (STIRs, EURUSD) require very high leverage. Trading high volatility assets (BTC, TSLA) require less capital to have decent returns. Volatility also plays a very important role in the diversification of a portfolio.See: Extracting stable positive return from high-volatile asset.HF recipe made simple",

      "body": "Volatility is derived from the word Volatile. A substance is said to be Volatile if it is able to change very rapidly within a priod of time. The rapidness is in most cases unpredictable which could lead to gain or loss. But in crypto, volatility is often emphasised for the lost aspect of it.It is therefore correct to define volatility in cryptocurrency as the rate at which the prices of cryptocurrencies changes.Volatility is good and bad.It is good because it creates the movement that day traders need to make profits in the market. It is bad because if it moves against you, you will run into losses.Sorry if I am too elementary in my explanation  it is because your question looks elementary too.

A couple of hours later the price moves down to $29,000. 5 hours later, the price bounces to $32,000. 10 hours later, the price went back to $29,000. And then it finally closed at $35,000. That's basically what volatility is. It refers to the sharp movements in prices within a relatively short period of time. The level of volatility also fluctuates. There are times when Bitcoin is less volatile, for example. Unpredictability is also a big factor. You cannot really predict when the market will experience so much price turbulence and when it somehow experiences stability.",

Volatility is usually used in the context of purchasing and selling options. Implied Volatility is one of the factors that contribute to the premium, or price, of an option. If you believe that volatility in a market will rise, you may communicate that belief by purchasing a long option contract based on that market. If the underlying market's volatility rises (all else being equal), the option's value rises as well. This is a highly simplified depiction, because options' prices are also influenced by other factors such as the underlying's price, time to expiry, and so on. They are also leveraged investments, which means you could lose more than you put in.",
