  "content": "QuoteThe EU has listed at least nine points in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act that could be in breach of international trade rules.South Korean officials have also raised similar concerns to Europe.A taskforce between European and American officials, which had its first meeting on this subject last week, will meet every week to discuss how to address Europe’s concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act.EU member states are standing resolutely firm against President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act amid fears it will harm their domestic companies and economies.The sweeping U.S. legislation, which was approved by U.S. lawmakers in August and includes a record $369 billion in spending on climate and energy policies, was discussed by the 27 European Union finance ministers on Tuesday. This came after the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said there are “serious concerns” about the design of the financial incentives in the package.“Each minister agreed that this is a subject of concern at the European level and that we need to see what is the best response,” an EU official, who followed the ministers’ discussions but preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the issue, told CNBC.The same official added that “there is a political consensus (among the 27 ministers) that this plan threatens the European industry.”The EU has listed at least nine points in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act that could be in breach of international trade rules. One of the biggest sticking points for the Europeans is the tax credits granted for electric cars made in North America. This could bring challenges to European carmakers that are focusing on EVs, such as Volkswagen.“That’s what we’re eventually seeking: that the EU should be, as a close ally of the U.S., in a position which is more similar to that of Mexico and Canada,” Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s trade chief, said at a news conference Tuesday.South Korean officials have also raised similar concerns to Europe, given the set of measures in the U.S. could also restrict Hyundai and others from doing business in America.A second EU official, who also followed the ministers’ discussions but preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the issue, said the conversations were “not very deep” — highlighting unity among the ministers on a broader level.The same official said that France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, told his counterparts that he was not asking for a strong negative decision against the EU’s American friends, but rather asking for a “wake-up call” for his European counterparts who need to protect the interests of European businesses.Earlier on Monday, Le Maire told CNBC, “We need to be very clear, very united, and very strong from the very beginning explaining [to] our U.S. partners [that] what’s at stake behind this Inflation Reduction Act is the possibility to preserve the level playing field between the United States and Europe.”“The level playing field is at the core of the trade relationship between the two continents and we don’t want to see any kind of decision that could harm this level playing field,” he said.French officials have for a long time advocated for strategic independence — the idea that the EU needs to be more independent from China and the U.S., for instance, by supporting its own industry. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that the EU should also look at a “Buy European Act” to protect European carmakers.“We need a Buy European Act like the Americans, we need to reserve [our subsidies] for our European manufacturers,” Macron said in an interview with broadcaster France 2, adding, “You have China that is protecting its industry, the U.S. that is protecting its industry and Europe that is an open house.”A taskforce between European and American officials, which had its first meeting on this subject last week, will now meet every week to discuss how to address Europe’s concerns over the Inflation Reduction Act.The idea is “to continue promoting deeper understanding of the law’s meaningful progress on lowering costs for families, our shared climate goals, and opportunities and concerns for EU producers,” the White House said in a statement.Despite the regular contact, U.S. officials are dealing with the midterm elections and the Inflation Reduction Act has already been legislated, meaning that any changes would have to come during the implementation phase.Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, told CNBC that “it is obvious that the EU has legitimate concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act and direct and indirect discrimination in it.”“Many of IRA policies that take a ‘America first’ attitude will hurt competition and EU firms, and especially so in sectors where the EU is competitive, not least green industries and cleantech. The EU may go to the WTO [World Trade Organization] to sort these issues out but it is far more interested to get them addressed bilaterally,” he added.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/europe-shows-a-united-front-against-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html....I began reading this article expecting europe to have legitimate concerns over the inflation reduction act. But it turns out they're only upset america is throwing money at american automakers, while european automakers receive none. European nations say that they should be treated as if they were located in canada or mexico. Rather than on the other side of the world. They claim america is discriminating against europe and will request the WTO - world trade organization to compel america to throw money in their direction. Emmanuel Macron went so far as to say that europe should create their own \"Buy European Act\" to stimulate european economies.If europe has legitimate concerns to air over the inflation reduction act, I hope someone explains them. This article definitely does nothing to elaborate on or support the stance. It sounds as if europe is desperate for money. Which is never a good sign.",

      "body": "Claiming that Europe doesn't have stances to protect its own industry is quite wrong too. I'm.not sure there's any vital industry Europe as a whole couldn't produce something workable for (Italy has a plane making company, 2D planes are probably easier to make).The size of companies and the revenues of ones such as fiat, VW and Toyota are huge but they don't seem to have much in terms of expansion and capital gains compared with the same types of companies in the US. (Toyota recently blew money away on flying cars). What I think has happened here is that this sort of legislation might have been introduced to curve the chance European cars become cheaper if the EU keeps being unstable, or drops further if Russia managed to advance into the EU. This wouldn't explain why Japan has concerns though as the Yen normally behaves in a disproportional way in relation to the Eurozone.",

      "body": "What can these countries do, or are there binding agreements between the European Union and America? So that if those countries are affected, the congressional laws are repealed or reconsidered?I do not expect that any decision will be made unless there is a first and last interest of the United States and therefore companies will push lawmakers not to amend these laws unless we wait until after 2024, or the start of mutual sanctions.",
