When I try to do the big offer tasks I can never seem to complete it and I get so many pop ups and site keeps redirecting. Also when I tried to withdraw I couldn’t as I needed 1500 coins first.Is this site legit or just a waste of time and a scam?Can anyone recommend a better website for earning free crypto that doesn’t have a catch to it and doesn’t have any withdrawing restrictions etc? Ps: I’m new to crypto and would like to own my very first crypto….",

Faucets are micro earning platforms from where you can earn decent amount of money if you have great following. the more the followers are the more will be the earning your could make by making more referrals. At start i also stuck in many faucet website back in 2018. at that time i was not even know that there is this Bitcointalk forum exists. so i must say you are lucky you came to right place. These websites are not scams well at least 40% are not scam. idk which faucet you have joined but there is a long list of faucets on Bitcointalk forum.  Micro Earnings Its a section on Bitcointalk forum where legit platform with reviews are listed. i must tell you i am not promoting them i am just helping you to get a better idea of the forum. You should also see the Meta and help and beginner section too for better options to grow over less time period. For your better guide, i must say spending time on these faucet is no doubt profitable but if you are stepping into crypto then you should also know how things works in crypto. Well i assure you working of crypto is not very difficult to understand. You can learn the basics by watching some videos on YT or by reading article wrote here. Running blind will take you no where, while if you run with the light of knowledge you could reach to your aim more easily and quickly. Knowledge of crypto and blockchain will help you to understand the importance and impact that it could make on modern life's sectors like finance etc.",

However, the issue with using a faucet is that you need to constantly claim a very small amount of satoshis repeatedly for months before you can withdraw. And, sometimes the amount you've accumulated couldn't even cover the transaction fees, which can result in wasting your time and effort.[1] https://freebitco.in/signup/?op=s#",

Faucets are a waste of time, as mk4 has said but the best one if you are willing to keep trying is freebitco.in, as Maus0728 has told you. Most likely scenario you will be wasting your time but if you are lucky you can land a $200 reward just playing free spins which is like winning the lottery but you get the tickets for free.",

In the case of freebitco.in the free faucet is a way to attract people to their casino, where in the end they make a lot more money from people who gamble than they potentially lose from the few people who use the faucet to get a few satoshis and don't gamble.Giving things away for free or at a discount, although it may seem paradoxical at first glance, often serves to increase turnover.",

Most legitimate faucets(that are mostly dead already) aren't as evil as you think. They give you free satoshis in exchange for you viewing ads on their platform.",

Today's free bitcoin earning methods don't work anymore, if you want to invest in bitcoin instead of wasting time on faucets or airdrops. I recommend you find an outside job, earn extra income and then invest in bitcoin. It's the fastest way to get bitcoins, getting free bitcoins is just a waste.",

For me, to get free cryoto, I do participate promotional airdrops on exchanges like MEXC Global, Kucoin and at times Binance. And I also do airdrops via Telegram channels ones in a while.",

I advise you to try freebitco.in only if you want to play with the faucet because on that site, you only need to press the button once an hour and it's completely free and doesn't have many requirements. You can also invest your money into FUN tokens and earn more WoF. I don't think it's difficult to withdraw because on the site, you only need to collect 0.00030000 BTC with a transaction fee of 0.00000488 BTC for automatic and slow ones.",

Buying bitcoin is not restricted to only people who have a lot of money, and there is not a fixed amount that you must buy. You can buy in any amount that you can afford and then from there discipline yourself to adopting a strategy to buy more. Plenty people are accumulating the amount of bitcoins that they have by engaging in the DCA method where you dedicate yourself to buying an amount regularly. That strategy will work better for you a newbie than depending on any website to give you free bitcoins.",

Looking for free crypto online is almost the same as searching for free money. Remember, legitimate websites that offer cryptocurrency rewards typically require some form of effort or investment, such as completing surveys, watching ads, or referring new users. There is usually no such thing as completely free cryptocurrency with no strings attached. Regarding bitcoin faucets, that's a thing of the past, and it is difficult to find a legit one that pays a significant amount. It's more probable that investing your time in other activities would be more profitable in the long run.",
