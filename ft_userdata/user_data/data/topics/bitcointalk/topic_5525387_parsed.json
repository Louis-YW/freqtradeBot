From the start, Bitcoin’s purpose was decentralization on all transactions, but that’s not what we see now. Most exchanges are centralized, while decentralized ones aren’t as popular. This shows that governments still hold the power to protect their interests.I’d rather be content with Bitcoin’s limited adoption as a payment system. Governments are already working on their own digital currencies, like  CBDCs, because they always want to maintain control over the financial system.",

A country having reserves in Bitcoin will always be in danger of losing value for its reserves if the price falls, which we know happens.So, even if Bitcoin becomes globally accepted as a payment method, fiat currencies and current financial institutions will still be around. It will just be your choice for when you want to use them and when you don't. If you, as an individual, don't need them at all, you can abandon their services and use cryptocurrencies for all your financial activities if you know it's possible.And, even for that to happen, we will need to wait for years and decades, because it won't be easy for all governments to let that happen, and without all countries accepting and allowing it, it won't be a global thing.",

A country where bitcoin is used as a mainstream payment method will only happen when the government will make bitcoin as a legal tender then it would be possible but if isn't then it won't be possible. Government will always find a way to be able to earn profit without making bitcoin as a legal tender so it's not likely that it will happen in the future.",

It's been so, and it will always be so; it will even get higher in time to come, and sometimes it will reduce too. We have experienced it in the past. Banks control over our funds is our decision to make; we can either use them or avoid using them. The choice is entirely ours, which people are already making.Bitcoin can’t completely take over the banking sector; they both need each other in some areas. Some people will still want to remain traditional, and you can’t force them to embrace what they don’t believe in.",

However, for us to achieve a world where Bitcoin will be the only means of transaction it's certain that everybody will be a Bitcoin holder which may likely not be possible.",

Traditional banking won't go away anytime soon. The blockchain tech is here but this is just an additional means for now not the main financial attraction in the world of finance. So we can't discard the fact that banking system will still be a part in major financial transactions.Quote from: EFS on January 05, 2025, 09:59:30 PMBitcoin is already mainstream, many people have an idea of what it is.

This doesn't mean that the whole banking sector will disappear and crypto currencies will be the only option.Replacing the traditional banking system is indeed not yet the mission of having bitcoin in the market. We are just giving alternative option to people and it is not compulsory to utilize this payment method. But if you happen to see the advantage of using btc or other alts in your financial transactions, then, you are lucky to learn about this market. Because not all people can appreciate this technology at the moment because of so many reasons.",

Add to that the freedom to control our own money. But there are risks involved that Bitcoin currently cannot address especially those we are accustomed to in traditional systems. Imagine if banks disappeared how would security and fraud prevention work in a decentralized setup? And if government control were reduced how would regulations and anti-money laundering efforts be managed? This is why the world isn't quite ready for such a fundamental shift yet.",

Slowly people get used to it, for which we can't say that the people have left the traditional system and moved to the bitcoin usage. In most parts of the world, digital growth has happened in recent years, and the same has popularized bitcoin. Banks are the major functional units of the government. Banks getting out of usage and bitcoin taking the role won't happen. This is kind of a government functioning as a puppet. No government wishes to have such a role. Bitcoin might go mainstream, but the main purpose for which it has been innovated has got transformed towards a form of investment. If the specific purpose is fulfilled, it might make a big change in the entire system.",

And we have discussed this so many times already that we say that we should take advantage of both worlds. Having some kind of money in a bank is good and then we have our investment in Bitcoin in a wallet that we have total control of.And then for the unbank, and for sure there are millions around the world, Bitcoin can be their leverage if they can get a banking account. As for Bitcoin being known in the world, it's going to be a slow process but we are getting there. The good thing is that anyone can used Bitcoin as payment scheme across the world as you describe and to be used like a remittance, that will be the best case scenario for BTC.",

These things are biggest barriers for Bitcoin to replace banking system completely.It won't happen in my opinion because governments will exist, and they will govern societies through many things exclusively banking system. Another big challenging factor, is the people in societies who belong to two main sides: want to use Bitcoin, and don't want to use Bitcoin. You can not change all people or force them to use Bitcoin.",

So the use of our currency and bitcoin will work hand in hand in paying for transactions in any country because there are some transactions that you can't possibly pay with bitcoin because of how small the money is, and then you can use some other currency to pay for the transaction. For instance, when you want to pay for a transaction of very small amounts, you will easily use some traditional method of transactions like in Nigeria,Ghana,Benin republic,cameron and Qatar to pay for that transaction because you know if you use bitcoin, it will cost you more because of the transaction fee.In addition we can force any individual to use bitcoin but when changes arise from investors and holders they will accept the bitcoin massively.",

Thinking of making it mainstream that will replace the local currency is something that everybody knows will not happen regardless of its adoption; furthermore, many people have been used to the local currency, so if they tell those people to go back to using bitcoin, it will cause another problem for them. Seriously, many of these people don’t even go to school in some local areas, and obviously these people cannot make transactions with bitcoin.
