Of course, in the crypto space we can come across many different forms of asset optimization to increase profits and it always needs to be studied, I think if our experience is not yet successful we want, it is simply that the experience is not enough and needs to continue to be more patient.",

(high Risk)2-  Keep the bitcoins you have while you wait for the bull season. (Medium risk, because it can get lost or stolen if you do not keep properly)3- Keep buying bitcoins to add to what you have. I do not think there is any method that is does not have some risk associated with it, Knowing the risk will help.",

      "body": "You both mentioned that increasing your Bitcoin is riskier than holding it. First, holding your Bitcoin in a custodial wallet is more risky than anyone could imagine. This is because:1: You don't have full control over your Bitcoin again the moment you deposit it into a custodial wallet.2: Your account can be frozen for some unknown reasons, which might result in you losing access to the account forever.3: Hacking: If the custodial system ever becomes a victim of a hack, your funds won't be spared, and I don't see any form of T&C that allows a centralized system to pay back its customers deposits if it is hacked.4. You will need to seek permission before you can use your Bitcoin when ever you want to; you can't just use it when and how ever you want.Gambling, like _act_ mentioned, is even worse because you might become an addict and gamble all your funds, with no way of getting them back. So the safest way is to hold and wait until the bull run, when you can be sure of some profit.",

Is there any proven low risk method. No method is risk free or proven to be low risk but traditionally long term holding is a safe method to grow the value of coins as per their fiat price changes if you are selling at higher price than what you buy at.Previously many casinos had the option to invest in their bankroll, but these options are limited now and hence I dont recommend much of them anymore.Remember that low risk also means low reward. It ends up being a 5% Fixed deposit like in a bank, though such options are not much in circulation. In yeild farming and staking and all, again the risk is enough to clean up your staked money if the company crashes or rugpulls.Then you have masternodes, which require a huge investment, check them out if you can.Many options indeed, but buying more coins at low price and stocking them up is a option that is always available to you.",

Holding is using profitable whenever you hold on for a very long time with this the price of the coin might have grown or better still you would have saved your coins from devaluation due to inflation which affects the fiat currency. Aside this, the other way again to earn or grow your coins in profit will be through trading. Aside that you need to have extensive knowledge about it, it is more riskier than holding and all most similar to APY since you need to trust your coins with centralized platforms.",

Try out  whirlwindmoney  the APY is better than just holding in your wallet since you are looking for means to multiply your Bitcoin. Their reward campaign is still open and they have a good reputations here on the forum as of when last I checked their are some Escrow done in other to build trust while running the Anonymity mining campaign. And their campaign is also being managed by one of the most respected manager Sir Hhampuz. So they are to be trusted you can give it a try.",

Because you will have to depend on centralized exchanges for your coin, that does not make it to be similar to staking which I think is what you referred to annual profit yield. They are both different. Trading too is very risky and I will not advice anyone to do it unless he is using the money he can afford to lose to trade. Trading can be as risky as gambling for some people.  In return, loss may be the result.",

The lowest risk is with you buying more bitcoins than you have money, maybe from your monthly salary.If you have trading analysis skills maybe you can use it for trading but I think it is high risk. If you don't have any expertise in this area, it's better to forget about itThe easiest and least risky way is for you to hold your bitcoins until the price goes up. You will benefit from rising bitcoin prices. How much profit you get depends on how many bitcoins you hold",

Is there any proven low risk method.The simplest answer is, start trading with your BTC and Perform DCA. To understand how can you do that let's take an example: let suppose you have 0.5 BTC and the current market price of 1 BTC is around $30.3k. And suddenly like 2 days ago price of BTC reached $31.8k or maybe $31.9k that was due to XRP news.So if you would compare the profit you would made by selling those at $31,800+  and after booking the profit you could use the same profit to buy another amount of BTC when it will come down to $30k. Now the question is, how would you know that BTC will come down ever again or will go up. That's where the risk factor comes. But if you had good knowledge of crypto industry and you keep an eye on all the news means fundamental analysis and technical analysis then you would be 90% sure that price will come down to $30k for sure.",

Is there any proven low risk method.Yes there is, just by buying more BTC's! Agree with you. But I add a little that buying Bitcoin regularly can grow the Bitcoin you have over time. And don't think too much about the volatility of Bitcoin prices. Keep buying according to the schedule that you arranged.Another way is to stake your BTC on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, etc. It can also grow your Bitcoins but it has a certain amount of time before you can take profits and the Bitcoins. In addition, you can borrow your Bitcoins on the exchange because there is a feature on the exchange.But whatever you want to do, according to people's advice, do it only for the Bitcoin you can afford. It is never recommended to use all the Bitcoins you have because of the possible bad possibilities.Trading can also be a way to grow your Bitcoin but trading requires skill for you to make a profit.",

If there were any such method, everyone would use it instead of trying to hold it tight in their wallets.
