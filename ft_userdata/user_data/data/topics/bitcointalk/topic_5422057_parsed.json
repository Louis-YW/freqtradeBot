  "content": "This is all over Twitter now. Different media already released this too.The Bahamas Government takes over all FTX assets for \"safekeeping\", so one of the top Ethereum holders that is labeled before as an FTX Hacker when there was around more than $300m total of assets flew out from FTX wallets.So for me, is this good news or bad news if it's true that the Bahamas government already got these funds from FTX?Is this even legal action by the Bahamas Government?This is a very roller coaster event right now on cryptocurrency.",

Because why didn’t he just send the funds to the governments wallets instead of moving all the assets to different Defi networks and dumping it all for dai.There is also the issue with slippage. Since he was selling massive amounts with poor liquidity he got bad fills and lost tons of money this way. A very bad action on the governments part.But at least these funds are safe.",

It can be said that the news related to SBF and FTX is really a lot and confusing, we still can't confirm what is the most accurate reason for all these series of events. FTX is very difficult to return investors' money, so even if we find out the truth, we will never demand justice for investors. My concern now is that like Dokwon, SBF and his girlfriend, all 3 should be properly punished for causing serious business consequences.",

The appointment of the JPLs and recognition of the Chapter 15 Case are thus in serious question. It Case 22-11068-JTD Doc 22 Filed 11/17/22 Page 5 of 11 {1368.002-W0069002.} appears that the automatic stay has been flaunted, by a government actor no less. This is no time to be arguing over venue So beyond all the buzzwords to gain likes, the story is pretty simple.The government didn't trust FTX will keep the assets under control and decided to force them to move all the funds into a custodian under their control, not under FTX's control.Seriously, edit the title!",

The media is trying to make it seem like he’s not just some bitch thief who got caught stealing and is doing what any bitch does, give up everything to try and save himself. Let’s be honest… He didn’t hack anything. He had access to the funds and the Bahamian government said you can go to prison or you can give us all the money in your exchange, so he gave up all the money so he could go home instead of a cell. He’s not some brilliant hacker. He’s a con artist that took bleeding heart liberals for a ride.",

Only a fool would believe in such coincidences.I completely agree with your opinion. Not only the FTX incident but most of the allegations of hacking, stealing assets of exchanges or projects, up to 99% of owners, and developers are the culprits and they make up those fake stories. Everything is planned in advance and they just have to wait for the perfect official announcement date and they will get the sympathy of investors, a lot of people are still believing that SBF is the victim in this story.
