He doesn't pose a threat to Bitcoin in any way, the only \"threat\" is that he's going to influence the people who believe in him - but he already did that, didn't he?A so-called war between Gold & Bitcoin cannot even be started, because they're two completely different things except the fact that they're both considered commodities and Bitcoin is considered the \"Digital Gold\". Besides these two similarities, they're like A and B.It's funny though how he owned Bitcoin people donated him and even accepts BTC on his website. Like I hate PayPal so much.... if you want to buy something from me, I only accept PayPal",

Maybe we have different perspective on how we should treat both of this investment platform, some may see that gold is more valuable that is because they are more exposed in it, rather than bitcoin that is in fact, for us is achieving greater heights, because for us, the reason why bitcoin will increase too much than what it is now is the scarcity and the increasing adoption or demand we have over time.",

Maybe, we'll see it soon and he will say that his bitcoins were hijacked by an exchange because he has sent it there.",

The later statement when he said it was him forgetting the password came way later, when mass media called it a Bitcoin attack.How come when your followers are telling you that it's not Bitcoin's fault you say \"the wallet forgot my password, it wasn't me\" but when mass media claims it was an attack against Bitcoin you suddenly admit that you were wrong?The dude FUDs Bitcoin like once every few tweets. He's never praised how well and good Bitcoin was when his wallet was working flawlessly, but once he forgets his password Bitcoin is shit..",

I don’t know why people are fond of looking for ways to discourage others from making use of cryptocurrency, while the mistake is from them. They really need to learn to accept their mistake and stop blaming it on cryptocurrency and saying that it’s a scam.I can remember that when I started making use of Bitcoin I made the mistake of not copying down my wallet ID and when I uninstalled and reinstalled the wallet due to a certain problem I had on my device, I wasn’t able to login and that’s when I realized that I didn’t have my wallet ID and I understood that it was my mistake, there is no one to blame.",

Like most people get their extraordinary wealth: he \"earned\" it from his parents. Schiff Sr. was a really interesting guy -- far so more than his son. For one, he died in prison protesting the federal income tax. He stopped paying taxes in 1974 and encouraged his followers to do so, who of course ended up owing the IRS a combined $56 million. Irwin himself was on the hook for somewhere between $2 and $8 million, depending on what time span you go by. I first heard of Peter Schiff in 2008 when he was credited for more or less calling the recession. I followed him for about two years, but then I realized he was just another talking head cult of personality that depended on sensationalism. He's been wrong about pretty much everything (his financial forecasts, sans his gold obsession at times) for the last ten years.",
