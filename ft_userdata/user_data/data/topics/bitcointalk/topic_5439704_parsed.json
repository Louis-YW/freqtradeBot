There is very little upside to social media to begin with. Yes, it's unethical to restrict people's choice in what they can or can't do...but it's not hard to find and resolve the issue. It's a good problem solving task for them at best. Maybe they'll learn a thing or two. I wouldn't do it personally. I wouldn't say it's the worst idea though. The only impractical part of it is that I am sure mobile data will quickly substitute for re-access",

There are some social media platforms that can enlighten thier users and make them get profitable information or knowledge. But the rate of social media addiction among mostly youths is becoming alarming. If your family members are below 16, it is important to monitor the way they access social media. If possible they should have restricted access to the internet.The only way to reduce the rate of social media addiction among teenager that are above 16 is through education and awareness about the consequences of spending so much time on social media. This is because they can always look for ways to access these platforms even if you block these platforms in the router. They can be introduced to some other activities that can be beneficial such as learning a musical instruments or a new language.",

It really consumes a lot of time and they're thinking that attention in the social media is the most important thing. They're building the thought that social attention through these media is what's going to make them satisfied but no. It's just a way to have social validation from the rest of the world that's also part of that social media. If the strategy won't work, I agree to the suggestion to force of blocking all of those websites just to control them temporarily. But I am sure that someday they'll realize that their lives shouldn't just rotate through social media and they have to remove those toxins from being addicted on it. Detoxifying it through being inactive is what they'll have as a resort.",

I guess they're not too engaged with other things because if you have engagement you may likely not have to much time for social media.But in other scenario, if you're doing on social media is fetching family source of income, why not organized family internet culture to boost the efforts of what they're doing.

What? You don't like sarcasm? Lol.The Aleutian Islands are a chain of Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia. Adak Island, in the group, has a US military base on it. See - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands.I like the Bitcointalk forum setup. You could start your own (and so could I) by downloading it from Simple Machines Forum, which is linked at the bottom of every Bitcointalk page. Bitcointalk uses a older version, but I like it better than some of the newer versions because it is simpler/easier to look at.",
