  "content": "It's very important to run bitcoin node to increase the security of transactions, to help the decentralisation of bitcoin and make it even more secure. There are so many benefits for bitcoin network to run bitcoin node that it would require from me to write a big article. To sum up, it strengthens the robustness of the network and that's one of the most important part but I often see that people don't run bitcoin node because they don't want to let it take some space in their computers and also don't want to spend days to download bitcoin blockchain. They prefer to use lightweight wallet like Electrum. To my mind, it's okay to use Electrum on your smartphone but at the same time I think that by relying on other nodes, we aren't doing good for bitcoin. Wouldn't it be a good idea if satoshi also implemented reward system in running a bitcoin node? For example, every 24 hours, each node runner would receive its share from 1 bitcoin or something like that. No one would be able to make money from it but I think a lot of people would run bitcoin node even for some small rewards and that would benefit bitcoin. What do you think about that?",

If you can not run your own node, you can still be using Tor to connect to SPV wallets like Electrum. You can also have more than one wallet and use different location for each.",

Then we will be spending around 365 bitcoin a year aside the block reward giving to miners from the number of total supply we have, then the mining will take a shorter time to reach than we have now. This will actually make a significant change in the network and should we reduce that amount from the block rewards that will cause the amount to be small and that is where the real problem is if there are few miners due to the reward not been a huge incentive to them. Let me ask how will you give out the reward, is it that when you have the node no need to come alive everyday or it will be given to who stay alive all day? And when does this reward stops? When the total number of bitcoin are mined? If so then we could back to se the reduce number of runners again",

      "body": "The disadvantages of providing financial incentive to run a full node are more than their advantages. That is because it is very difficult to verify if a node you are connecting to is an actual full node or not. It can be faked rather easily and any kind of verification process would just keep increasing the cost of running a full node. Even if we found a way to make sure it is an actual full node, we still can't verify if node A and node B are different entities because one node operator could spin up multiple sockets through IP masks that would look different from the perspective of someone connecting to them.Not to mention that Bitcoin is not proof of stake or space, etc. it is proof of work which means the only incentive is to the miners that are actually and verifiably spending computing power to perform \"work\".P.S. There are about 20k listening nodes but there are more than that running full nodes (about 50k in total)https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html",
