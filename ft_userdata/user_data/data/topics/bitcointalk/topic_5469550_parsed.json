  "content": "Former European central bank President once said bitcoin is not real, he also said he is against bitcoin, so many people saying there own opinion towards bitcoin. But have you ever thought why?, from my own point of viewBitcoin and cryptocurrency are banned in most countries, China, Russia and many more. Because the government is afraid of bitcoin knowing that bitcoin is a decentralize currency, the government cannot control and monitor your funds.As bitcoin continues to grow most people continue to adopt bitcoin as there currency, the increase population of bitcoin has become global, business owners, traders, now use bitcoin so the government is scared of loosing there value of money. The more people use bitcoin in saving there money the more the government loose control of there currency.they see bitcoin and other cryptocurrency as not trustworthy, as the value changes.    Conclusion:Countries ban bitcoin for different reasons, some, the government (president) didn't even know anything about crypto but the financial advisers gave the wrong information or they advise the government wrongly on cryptocurrency.If the financial advisers gave the right information on cryptocurrency many countries would have adopted bitcoin in their countries. Some of them were trying to prevent their citizens from internet fraudstars and scammers probably because of the previous experienced in the country.",

Rather than discussing again on the similar topic it is good to discuss in the opposite way, what benefits bitcoin can bring to a country when adopted as legal tender as we don't have countries other than El Salvador.",

All they have to do is, allow those who want to transact in bitcoin to do so peaceful, as they also allow those who choose fiat to also do so peaceful, they can not force every one of us to go the fiat way with them when we have a better alternative like Bitcoin around.",

Because they always think that they have nothing to gain from it, but the truth is that they can gain a lot from Bitcoin.That's why the other countries that previously banned Bitcoin also withdrew it, right, like El Salvador, Russia and others. Why? because they realized in the end that it would be a great contribution to their country and even to their constituents and also establishment businesses to be honest.",

If Bitcoin is legalized as a means of payment, many export and import sectors will use Bitcoin and the country's currency will decrease in value because its performance decreases. A currency gets stronger if it continues to be used/circulated to revive the economy. If this does not happen then the currency will not move and demand for the currency will also decrease resulting in excess supply while there is no demand.Please correct me if I'm wrong.",

Because the government is afraid of bitcoin You are right but to some extent only, because those who have accepted btc or not banned it yet, they also can not control the BTC because BTC is also decentralized for them. All they are doing is getting benefit from the new technology and earning money. For example. BTC is banned in our country why?. QuotePakistan's Minister of State for Finance and Revenue has reportedly said crypto cannot be legalized in the nation due to conditions set by the global money laundering watchdog for staying off of its list of countries under increased monitoring.sourceWhile this issue is also faced by those countries who have accepted or not banned BTC yet. Instead of banning BTC they try to find ways that could avoid or stop the bad use of decentralization factor of btc-->Money launderingTo be honest, this is the shitiest accuse I have heard. Well what we can do. Nothing. Governments can find out who is using btc and can tax them and earn money from the crypto (btc) users. So we should not say that every btc users can not be observed by governments. The thing is those who have banned btc, they don't want to spend time in another sector of investigating such cases involved in btc so at the simplest scenario they banned it. [/list]",

They have no choice for real, if you can't beat you join them, this is what will happen in the end, if not why is ETF now a thing? Exactly, Bitcoin is the solution to the problem of many countries, they lack wisdom that's why they are still banning it, the few smart ones are going after Bitcoin as their rescuer now, so I am not surprised.  So there you have it, the ban is happening because the government lacks the wisdom and only focuses on power, they are looking at the disadvantage and that's decentralization, they fail to look at the advantage side of Bitcoin, but it's only a matter of time.",

Governments or Countries does not hate Bitcoin, in fact they are very open with it, but it gets problematic to fully adopt this cryptocurrency because it gives so much financial freedom to its user that defeats the purpose of the government. Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general does not have a governing body, its government is its people so it get less interest from the government and they don't want it to just throw them away and be taken over.

That's a single human hatred the governments are not controlled by a single person but a group of people with same mindset. The governments main motive is to have complete control over the citizens and something like Bitcoin won't allow them to control the citizens in way they wanted to. That's why the governments are trying to add competitor to Bitcoin in the form of CBDCs. The CBDCs are digital like Bitcoin but they are 100% centralized and governments can control those. No-one can control Bitcoin because it's decentralized and is supported by a huge community of miners and nodes. The public controls Bitcoin the governments doesn't, not even the creator of Bitcoin has control over it. If the governments can't control Bitcoin then in similar way they can't control the ones who use Bitcoin, but surely they can't hide their negative intentions and that's why they are banning Bitcoin.I'm not against governments but that a reality which we will have to accept. The Bitcoin is really a huge threat to governments and they try to do everything to suppress its growth. The launching of CBDCs is the first step that they took against Bitcoin and surely in future they will make more plans to stop the growth of Bitcoin. But, I highly believe that they will not be successful because Bitcoin is supported by the humans of the whole world not from a single particular region.",
