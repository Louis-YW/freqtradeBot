      "body": "I am not sure if I understand your post correctly but it sounds like you are saying that slots have a pattern where they have days where they are generous in giving out wins and there are days where they don't give any wins.I've heard and read this kind of belief or \"observation\" before(no offence), Basically, a lot of gamblers who play slots believe that slots are pre-set to give out winning on certain days, time, bets, losses, etc.. I am not invalidating what you observed but there is a high chance that all of it is just a coincidence.",

      "body": "If the service you're using is honest and Provably Fair, it's just math and randomness at play.I've seen some nice articles about it, but basically we're the ones who give meaning to the numbers and what you're talking about happensFor example, you've said that you've been playing for many years, and sometimes there's this string of losses and then a string of successes, or vice versaIt's completely normal for mathematicsAn easy example, talking about odd and even. Imagine that you've played 10x even and come up with 10x odd, you think there's something wrong, but there's not, the next play have 50%, the next move has a 50% chance of coming out odd and 50% even.Another example, when I started betting on dice, I did the marthingale method, and as it was on cryptos with a lot of decimals, I had a lot of spins, I thought it was impossible for example for the pair to come out more than 10 times in a row, and it did, I lost the whole bankroll heheheSo it's just our interpretation and perception, but each player has their own way of interpreting these sequences of hits and lossesAfter all, this helps to make betting more exciting and fun",

Then I tried to play slots several times and luck was not on my side, I have never had a big win in this type of gambling. And I only got a small win and the result of that win ran out again in the next round. Until in the end I stopped playing this gambling game because I felt unlucky in playing this type of gambling.What is different from card games, even though I am not lucky in gambling, in card gambling I can improve my knowledge and skills to create opportunities to win.",

There are 2 points I want to convey. First, agree because based on gambling schemes, many people including myself have experienced this, but this applies to 1 casino and not to other casinos. Second, I don't agree because I played at one of the crypto casinos from the first deposit I made up to 5-7x the deposit and never got a win.So in my opinion, whether it is regulated or not, you just need to control the bets in slot games, for example trying to move from game A to another game according to different RTP levels.I have also made a thread about gambling patterns, maybe this is suitable for you with the title Gambling Distortion Patterns",

You are lucky to have experience this pattern repeatedly over and over again. Some gamblers hardly win but rather they loss almost all the time that they game.What I know is that there is always a lucky time when a gambler will keep winning and when that time passes,the gambler will experience the opposite. It might be some hours or some days that you will be lucky. No one can predict or know when that lucky period is or will come that is why it is advisable to only gamble what you can afford to loss,and set aside a gamble budget.",

But winning type of days are not common among the 365 days that makes up the year. Also there are days that you will gamble and win in the morning and afternoon. You may be be winning in the night but all of a sudden the gambling will change and you may lose later in the night.",

Op, weâre dealing with gambling here and as long as youâre dealing with slots youâll surely lose and thereâs no strategy to achieve massive wins. If perhaps you were able to go a whole week with high amount of wins and the next few weeks could be losses or if youâre still lucky you ought be able to balance both or just win more than you lose I donât believe time and duration has any effect on your win to lose ratio.",
