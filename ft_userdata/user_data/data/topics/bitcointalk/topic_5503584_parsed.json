      "body": "Why brain wallet in particular? Are you onto some sort of research?I don't think it's possible. Maybe if you tried to use one of the browser based bots where you can record tasks, and then play it in a loop to carry out the task repeatedly. There was one that I used to use, but I don't quite remember the name right now. It was some sort of browser extension.Have you explored https://iancoleman.io/bip39?",

      "body": "Assuming you're not trying to crack any wallets, you can implement it by applying SHA256 to each line, ensuring that it is within a range of valid private key, and then using it to obtain the public key and subsequently the address. This method should be fast enough, unless you're trying to crack something.Again, if you're thinking of cracking insecure Bitcoin addresses, then I can't help you here. This would be slower than brainflayer and what not but should be sufficiently fast for most use cases. If you're thinking of creating and using these, then you shouldn't because it is not secure.",

A private key for a brain wallet should be created automatically from each line from the .txtWhen you create your wallet, do it in a normal, standard and simple way because it is more helpful and workable for your wallet recovery later. Don't try to complicate steps in wallet creation procedure and mess up your steps for wallet recovery in future.How to back up a seed phrase?Seed splitting is a bad ideatxt files are not secure formats to store your wallet seed phrases.",

For each additional brain wallet, hash the previous phrase and generate a new phrase. Do that as many times as you wish.",
