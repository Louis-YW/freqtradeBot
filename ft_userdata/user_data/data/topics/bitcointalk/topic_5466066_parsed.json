And much as I know that Bitcoin might end the year around $30,000 (give or take), it will be more appropriate to use the right bound range. That is why I would define mine thus;Bitcoin would be within the range of $15,000 and $37,000 by the last second of Dec. 2023. All strong analyses used for now are pointing towards the same possibility. As you can see, the range is wide enough because no one perfectly knows what the market will do eventually, and if one defines it on the lower level only, what if it ends up?However, these levels ($25,000-24,700, $31,450-$29,400 and $35,000-$37,000) should help further as Bitcoin finds its way amidst the battles between Bulls and Bears till the year ends.",

I can't select any of them for now. From the beginning of this year we have been on this prediction at Speculation Board and other places yet non of the prediction has been accurately predicted. For the rising and falling of the price. I will take the rising option of it, the prise will slidely rised up to the previous price of all time high in this year. And before this price will start this increase it will enter November and why I am taking November to be the rising Month because even last year, it was from the month of November that the price started rising up.

Right from the early months of this year, we have always stayed positive in our speculation about the price of Bitcoin towards the end of the year, and here we are almost at the end of the year and the price is still bearish which gives the impression that the price might remain bearish till the end of the year, although i believe that Bitcoin might be able to reach either $30k or $35k before the year finally ends but that's by chance.",

Bitcoin will move in whatever direction it wants to go so we can only hope that by the end of the year it should make a favorable movement but in my opinion I don’t think there would be any special movement but I don’t think it would go too high or too low by the end of the year.",

To me, it is extremely difficulty predicting what the price of Bitcoin will be before the end of this year considering how long price have been stuck between $26k and $29k region. In one of my comment in a similar post, I explained why I feel we will see some sharp moves downward before the expected bullrun billed to commence next year. Weather this will happen and when it will happen is what is not clear to me. Besides, we are already entering the last quarter of the year and soon the news of the halving will dominate the media... as you know, such positive news would have already started some positive response. The best suggestion me fit give anybody now na to arrange yourself and buy some Bitcoin before this year ends.
