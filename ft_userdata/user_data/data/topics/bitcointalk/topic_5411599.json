You shouldn't be relying on others when it comes to verifying the source or if you do, make sure it's someone that doesn't have any motives, and you trust. Short answer is, it's trusted by thousands of others, but there's nothing stopping this from becoming malicious at any point, especially if you have auto updates enabled for extensions (browser specific).",

And look, I'm not that \"paranoid\" about these issues.But yes it is possible to limit the add-on only to Bitcointalk.In chrome, follow the instructions here:QuoteManage your extensionsOn your computer, open Chrome.At the top right, click More More and then More tools and then Extensions.Make your changes:Turn on/off: Turn the extension on or off.Allow incognito: On the extension, click Details. Turn on Allow in incognito.Fix corruptions: Find a corrupted extension and click Repair. Confirm by clicking Repair extension.Allow site access: On the extension, click Details. Next to “Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit,” change the extension’s site access to On click, On specific sites, or On all sites.https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en",

The script host (Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey) needs broad enough permissions to cover any conceivable user script.",

However, it's worth mentioning that the open source alternatives aren't as popular, and therefore haven't had as much development put into them, and therefore they're either lacking the UX/UI or they're missing some functionality that other closed sourced alternatives have. Generally, most addons/extensions are terribly invasive with the permissions they require, even more so for a script manager that needs to cover a whole lot of angles for the maximum amount of compatibility with userscripts.",
