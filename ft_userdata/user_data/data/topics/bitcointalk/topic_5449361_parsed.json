Legacy addresses started with 1, native segwit with bc1, these are address type and can send/receive bitcoin from one another and vice versa.Would recommend using segwit because with segwit, you will help the miner to allow some more txs into a block.",

Or did the user modify the name manually?To the user, it appears that your address appears in the name of the wallet. Therefore, for privacy purposes, try to transfer your coins quickly.",
