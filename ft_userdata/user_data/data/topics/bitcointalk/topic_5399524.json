      "body": "@FatFork: honestly i am not interested what you think. sure, every shitcoin got already agreements for 9 exchanges after 7 weeks and for sure also every shitcoin will have a offshore company register after 2,5 month.. not need to talk with you.to the mod thing, simply that they stop this when providing that legit, not more.@Gulf_Official: its simply like that, that most projects going under cause they plan just \"short\" time, for 5 years or something. simply unexpirienced owners what know nothing about crypto.The altcoin market was getting really worse over the last years and thats why we planned our two projects.till 2028 a maximum of 47% will be in circulation.Nobody knows now what is in future, so in 10,20 or even 30,40 years. Bitcoin is on his way just since 2009, 13 years now just.I have worked at/for several projects since 2016 already, know some people from a few blockchain summits, know how to make good deals with exchanges, list mcap sites and everything around the etablishment process.the other 53% of all tokens are simply future savings what additionally allow us to go later also in app deplovement for example or also list a new exchange in 50 years... Nobody can say now what comes in future and i simply think: that are my projects, and after the etablishing i will live and work from and on it all my life. I got the founds to start, so i will do. Also in general:From mid these month i am heading from germany to belize regarding the offshore company registration. Here in germany is no way regarding the tax law and as normally digital nomad i will head to there, live and work also from there. They simply provide 0 tax for international companies which making no business inside the country.Will publish all to that when its at the time.Also, the next: I talked with digifinex and bitmart! More i dont say, but with bitmart i will soon publish something. They will allow and confirm that we publish the listing agreement before we get listed there! (for all the fudders here) Then i guess this topic should be without fud! The whitepaper is changed long time and it was the official bep20 token desription what you find everywhere around the internet. For me it have to be in the whitepaper of a bep20 project.+ here, a new topic regarding exchanges where we are now already: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404579.msg60474080#msg60474080+ here a small linklist what we got after 7/8 weeks:Website: https://www.polybtc.net/Website Exchanges: https://www.polybtc.net/exchangeSmart Contract: https://bscscan.com/token/0x434f30874b8Bf94cab10771E60F96F2De539317bTelegram: https://t.me/polybtcTwitter: https://twitter.com/NewCrypto2023Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/polybtcfacebookReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/PolyBTChttps://www.reddit.com/r/PBTC/Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404579https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399524https://github.com/PolyBTChttps://blockspot.io/coin/polybtc/https://coinpaprika.com/coin/pbtc-polybtc/https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/PolyBTC-_PBTChttps://desk.lsr.finance/asset/pbtc-poly-btc/https://coinsgem.com/token/0x434f30874b8Bf94cab10771E60F96F2De539317bhttps://thebittimes.com/token-PBTC-BSC-0x434f30874b8Bf94cab10771E60F96F2De539317b.htmlhttps://www.coinscope.co/coin/pbtchttps://watcher.guru/coin/polybtchttps://www.coinscout.cc/listing/polybtc/https://coinxhigh.com/todays-best-cryptocurrencies/polybtchttps://coinhunters.cc/tokens/PolyBTChttps://coinmooner.com/coin/20804https://coinalpha.app/new-born/0x434f30874b8bf94cab10771e60f96f2de539317bhttps://coinhunt.cc/coin/bc2a8273-07c8-4c28-8126-29faa5fcdba0https://goshfinder.com/coin/polybtchttps://www.freshcoins.io/coins/polybtchttps://cointoplist.net/coin/polybtchttps://coindiscovery.app/coin/polybtc/overviewhttps://tokenlist.cc/token/202897https://gemfinder.cc/gem/9354https://top100token.com/address/0x434f30874b8Bf94cab10771E60F96F2De539317bBankCEX ExchangeUSDT: https://bankcex.com/exchange-base.html?symbol=PBTC_USDTUSDT Advanced: https://bankcex.com/exchange-advanced.html?symbol=PBTC_USDTETH: https://bankcex.com/exchange-base.html?symbol=PBTC_ETHETH Advanced: https://bankcex.com/exchange-advanced.html?symbol=PBTC_ETHMintMe Exchangehttps://www.mintme.com/token/PolyBTChttps://www.mintme.com/token/PolyBTC/trade",
