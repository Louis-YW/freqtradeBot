Definitely, it makes sense, it’s a state in the US, and Trump already mentioned using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve for the country. Plus, we all know Trump won Pennsylvania, so their move to draft a bill like this was probably influenced by his statement about Bitcoin. I think it’s only a matter of time before this happens, and other states will follow suit. After all, they always follow the leader, and for them, that’s Trump.Quote from: Davidvictorson on November 17, 2024, 08:48:59 AMRecently my country's inflation rose to around 33% and I imagine if we had some Bitcoin reserve it would have acted as an hedge but the forces that be are working full time to ensure that it doesn't happen and the inflation keeps rising.Hopefully, your leaders will come to see that Bitcoin is the answer. They probably just need a strong model to follow. If the USA sets the example, there’s a good chance other countries will start considering Bitcoin as a national reserve too. So let's wait and see.",

No doubt, the future looks bright for investors. The US accumulating 1 million Bitcoin as a reserve is already big news, but it doesn’t stop there. With the US influencing other countries, we can all guess what’s coming next. That’s why I think betting on Trump’s administration, though he hasn’t taken office yet, might be a smart move.

You can used it whenever you like, store of value, sound money, assets as a investment, hedge against economic turmoil. But making it as legal currency might be far stretch in my opinion.
