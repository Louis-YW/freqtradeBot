  "content": "Recently I observed that symmetric, formerly known as Ratimov fell out of love with some of the forum activities. I do not know why because he didn't make any thread to why.I also know he had two threads which helped newbies and other ranks close to the next rank with upto 25 to 50 merits.Re: Helping Potential Legendary, Hero, Senior and Full Members (May 2023 Update)[Merit] Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rankAlthough I haven't benefited from any of the threads because it wasn't difficult for me to get my first 100 merits. Going to senior member, my movement is as slow as a snail and that reminds me that I will be needing a help at some points and likewise other low rank members.I know people are missing the kind gesture already but they might be afraid to speak up not to get into troubles.The reason for this thread is plead with any merit source to re-start a similar thread. I have seen some merit sources who say they don't exhaust their merit allocation. Such a thread could help ease their merit distribution stress and also serve as a reference point where other merit sources could look into to spray some merits.",

Some of this things are not easy as you see and are tiring or could even affect the merit source outside forum schedule. So I will say they should do there thing Also there is another thread by Fivestar4everMVP on  merit countdown that members can drop their application because other merits sources also go there to help",

Such a thread could help ease their merit distribution stress and also serve as a reference point where other merit sources could look into to spray some merits.I have never considered this a desirable way of distributing merits, although I understand that some members simply remain out of reach of most merit sources because they reduce their activities mainly to boards that are full of spam and megathreads. Maybe all those who so eagerly want merits should change their strategy a little, and not look for their \"success\" in an easy way.",

You are quite right about this and I'm sure there are users who wish the same thing the op has said but for me, it's best to not depend on these merit sources for your next rank up because it may make you not put inore effort to hustle for yours and you'd easily get affected if such an action gets stopped.It can be quite telling to do such things and still maintain your online presence and while we really can't place or give a reason for Ratimov going AWOL, I feel the guy needs a break to process.",

Not only will you get merit from merit sources - while other users who have sMerit will also pay attention to your posts, so again don't rely on such things. Several other merit thread are still active - in fact you can still use them to get some merit if you have quality posts.Of course creating such a thread isn't against the rules - but forcing merit source to do might not be a good idea. I see a lot of merit sources really ddon't like being forced to spend the sMerit they have - but of course it would be good if you found a powerful way to get your posts noticed by merit sources, especially because of their quality.",

Instead of asking a new merit source, I'd ask a de-merit feature.Its not that merit shared is increasing, its more about having fever active members each year (especially new ones) which then gives impression that amount of merit shared has been constantly increasing. Before theymos did the last merit readjustment 2 and a half years ago (and basically doubled monthly merit allocation) there were 50%+ more active members and 50%+  fewer merit sent (those numbers are probably even bigger) on the monthly basis, which then made it much harder to rank up. Situation now is diametrically opposite which makes it much easier for shitposters to rank up, especially since its usually not their first account so they are experienced when it comes to merit farming. At the same time, some parts of the forum are still undermerited and I hope that theymos will sort that out as well in the future, along with maybe decreasing merit allocation for some boards.",

This is indeed a great service but time consuming and I doubt that all merit source is willing to spare their free time just browse those users that near to rank up and review all of their post history.",
