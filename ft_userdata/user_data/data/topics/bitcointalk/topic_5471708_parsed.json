If there would be a significant drop in bitcoin price, I am expecting it next year, but spot bitcoin ETF may not let that happen. I share the same sentiment; it seems too hasty for the SEC to approve Bitcoin either this year or by January 2024. Over the past few hours, it appears that the pumping momentum has ceased, and the current price is struggling to surpass the previous swing. I have a hunch that BTC will establish a price range to define support and resistance levels. It's possible that Bitcoin will be in search of a new breakthrough while we keep a close eye on its direction.",

What's your opinion, fellow traders?\"My opinion is that it's anyone's guess for the short to mid term, but I believe that the long term will include higher prices than we see right now. The short term provides two possibilities, one being a major event involving whales/institutions that capitulates on the current high prices. The other being that the excitement for the progress of the ETF is the catalyst that starts the bull run early. I think the latter is what everyone would least expect, and many are probably still in disbelief, so it could be the more likely outcome when it comes to benefiting whales the most and keeping market participants from benefiting from the run. Whichever way it goes, the fun is only beginning! Buckle up!",

This is just a price hike due to the traders keeping more demand to buy the coin. The traders know that the bull season is near, so definitely they are trying to buy the coins now in current price which is more cheaper than the actual worth of Bitcoins. As they are increasing the demand to accumulate the coins and we know that Bitcoins are limited in number, hence to fulfil the demand, this is a sudden price hike.",

And what makes next year unique is that we are expecting two significant events which are the Bitcoin halving and spots Bitcoin ETF. The SEC's decision on the approval is unpredictable so it might not be proper to depend on their approval to make predictions. However, I expect the price of Bitcoin to get to its highest past price or even greater than that. I will suggest that you trade with caution because the market is highly unpredictable.",

Federal agencies are like dinosaurs when it comes to making decisions, so don't be surprised when they move very slowly with the approval process. Also, the SEC is not in a rush to approve any Bitcoin ETF, so all this price rising and hype surrounding ETFs is premature, and it will potentially cause a bunch of mini-hikes and mini-dips for the next year (or at least several months).",

Usually, Bitcoin starts its upward movement before the Halving date approaches, and with the Halving, more investors enter the market.However, I think this halving will be different from others and I would say that fundamental analysis is more important than technical analysis for Bitcoin. The Etf approval, the market maker decisions made by the US institutions about Bitcoin, especially the FED's decisions, the recent wars in the Middle East and the Black Sea region show that the price of Bitcoin may rocket earlier than expected.",

What's your opinion, fellow traders?\"I think Bitcoin price movement is nothing you should be confused about; all you need is to have a target price for which you wish to sell your asset, then sit back and hold it until your desired price is reached. If you are also in the process of still accumulating your coins, then you should apply the DCA strategy, depending on whether the price will still bounce back.IMO, the sudden jump in price is not a surprise; perhaps the price has sat so low for more than one month too, and even if the price drops before properly going up again for the bull market, it's still not a bad thing. If you are buying, apply the DCA strategy, and if you are selling, wait more until the market is very bullish; maybe it surpasses the last ATH.",

The Bitcoin price increase today comes as hype around a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) resulted in an increase in spot and CME BTC volumes and this bullish momentum continues to push prices across the crypto market higher. according to Cointelegraph https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today",

The halving is expected to take place in March or April 2024 and if history repeats itself, we will have a bull season when the halving occurs, but it will not happen immediately but will it takes a few more months.

It is possible for the approval to take place by January or not because we don't need to trust SEC as they can still be reluctant to approve it. If it is not approved then bitcoin price wouldn't keep pumping but it will dump. I still believe that we might experience a dump even before next year January because this is how bitcoin price moves. I believe that you should continue accumulating more bitcoin is you can through DCA so that you will have stashed up your portfolio very well when the bull run arrives. Every price dump or pump is an opportunity to buy more since we believe that bitcoin price will hit 100k and above during the next bull run.",
