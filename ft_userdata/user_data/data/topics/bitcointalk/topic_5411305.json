  "content": "ONYX is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network powered by the open source blockchain protocol [YesPower]. With ONYX, users can pay anyone in the world at the fastest speed in 5 seconds, at the lowest cost compared to other digital assets.The ONYX project emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin given early concerns about Bitcoin's delay in confirming block transactions and rounding errors in halving block rewards. By making minor technical changes to Bitcoin's original source code, ONYX achieves faster transaction speeds, even lower processing fees, and provides the most accurate halving and block total than any other digital asset (including Bitcoin). ONYX was also launched based on the idea proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. We wish you all the best and enjoy this currency.[BlockTime: 5sec | Supply: 1.000.000.000 | Halving: ~10years]Premine 1%: It was carried out on the future exchange listings. A detailed version of the use of PREMINE will be sent to you soon. Please note that it will not be used for profit by our teams! We have a real future for the ONYX project.🌐 WEBSITE: https://onyx.run/🌐 BLOCK EXPLORER: https://explorer.onyx.run/[⛏ EU POOL: https://pool-eu.onyx.run[⛏ US POOL: https://pool-us.onyx.run[⛏ AS POOL: https://pool-as.onyx.run⚠️ SOURCE CODE: https://github.com/ONYXcore/onyx👛 Win64 WALLET: https://github.com/ONYXcore/onyx/releases/download/v1.0.2/onyx-win.zip👛 Linux Wallet: https://github.com/ONYXcore/onyx/releases/download/v1.0.2/onyx-linux.zip-    🖥 miner: https://github.com/bubasik/cpuminer-opt-yespower-    🖥 mining command: -a yespower -o stratum+tcp://pool-(us/eu/as).onyx.run:(port) -u YOURwallet-> DISCORD: https://onyx.run/discord-> TELEGRAM: https://onyx.run/telegram",
