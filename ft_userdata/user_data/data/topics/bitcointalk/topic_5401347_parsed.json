Sometimes the price of bitcoin goes up in their favor and they won't withdraw because they don't need the money yet. Such people only take their bitcoin when they need to solve a real life problem and, they may not consider the price at the time it was taken because they saved the money knowing that they would have spent the money long ago if they didn't invest the funds into bitcoin. Most of the time I don't feel anything when the price of bitcoin down trends because I'm the later.",

You not only feel stuck with your money but at the same time you feel that guilt of keeping money in such a risky investment, people seeing the first bear run even feel that the whole market is a foolish scam made to loot our money. But you are right a bear market is nothing but a launchpad for the upcoming bull run only if the market would go bearish accumulation would become which could then pump the market.",

Bitcoins are the digital asset that will become valuable as the time passes.So we should look the bearish market in a positive attitude and buy as many Bitcoins as we can.",

I don't feel anything whenever the market is down, and the same when the market is up. No hate for me when there is a bear market because most of the profits of the investors are coming from after the bear market because you can buy coins or stocks for a lower price.  Quote from: Marvell1 on June 04, 2022, 02:01:23 PMEvery time a bearmarket happens, I always have valuable lessons that the bull market doesn't have. So always be grateful when the market goes down, it gives us many lessons, lessons about emotions, lessons about capital management, trust and patience.Bear market = opportunity for intelligent investors.When the people are panicking, intelligent investors are silently accumulating coins and thinking of holding it for mid to long term. After the bear market, they will just wait for another bull market and *BOOM. Easy profit for them.Quote from: Marvell1 on June 04, 2022, 02:01:23 PMThe bear market is not the end but the beginning of a new and better start, the bear market is a measure of our confidence in the market. Worthy rewards will only come to those who truly believe in the market.What goes up goes down in every market whether it is stock or crypto or other market. Sometimes, we need to shake off the market and let those newbie and investors who are panicking easily to leave. Those who will survive will be the ones who will see another day. Those who accumulate during the bear market are the ones who will got the most profit when the next bull market comes.",

Trading itself already made me hate it whether it was a bull or bear market since most of my early days were me selling on bear seasons and buying on bull seasons.

Well that was when I was still trading daily, now that I just DCA, I still tend to look at the positive thing since I put in money when I wanted it to be not minding the season, takes a lot off my plate.",

I think this is a simple logic for everyone. A bear market is an advantage for us who see the bull market. Because the market could move up anytime. Those who have enough patience could be gainers and make handsome profits from the bear. But most of the time we fall into the trap, once we buy the market go more down. Always we can't catch the bottom, to be honest. So whatever we may accumulate that would be better for us during bear.",
