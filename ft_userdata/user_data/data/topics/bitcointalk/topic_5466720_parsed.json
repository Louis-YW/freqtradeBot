While this is good news for the victims and will restore some level of confidence in the entire Bitcoin community,  there are concerns regarding the impact of such move on the price of Bitcoin. The exchange lost 850,000 BTC to the hack in 2014. The concerns is that this proposed refund might lead to a huge dump in the price of Bitcoin. If Mt. Gox actually refund their victims, how do you think this might impact on the price and future of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Nobody knows what will happen. It depends on if more people buy or sell. But most likely that as some people receive their bitcoin, they will want to sell. If many people sell their bitcoin, this may cause decrease in the price of bitcoin because that amount of bitcoin is huge.I do not know what traders will do, if some of them also sell, this may cause more decrease of bitcoin price.Or some people know that bitcoin price is cheap for now and they may want to hold. I do not know what will exactly happen, but I think the price of bitcoin will fall a little.But do not panic, the price of bitcoin will increase and get to ATH",

      "body": "Not until this day did I know Mt. Gox still had over 130k+ BTC all over their trustees addresses, which is enough fund to pay back a few of the lost BTC during the hack.When you talk about the implication that this might have on the crypto market, well, considering the fact that all the repayment is not scheduled to be made all at once and not all payments are to be done through BTC, I still believe there will be less to worry about, especially as they also want to pay their victims through fiat and other forms of crypto payment, which will reduce the amount of bitcoin that will be redistributed to users. The only place that I believe there could have been some negative price impact is if they were planning on selling off all their holdings to make payment back to their victims using fiat. Then we could have started thinking about how much the price of bitcoin would dump, as it's obvious that it would dump. But right now, considering the halving that is coming, many people who will receive this payment might not be in a hurry to sell back, as they might want to wait for the next bull run in order to benefit from it.",

If they were all going to sell then we might see a bit of a dump, but I don't think it'd be anything permanent. In addition, the exchange is going to only partially pay the loss, not to mention part of it is going to be through other coins (BCH and Japanese Yen as well according to the article). I don't think with all of those, we're going to see anything permanently done to the market, it may sway it down for a bit but I reckon a lot of others would consider it a buying opportunity if said victims were to just drop all of their coins in the market.",

If massive sell off might happen after the refund then provably it can create an impact to the price of bitcoin knowing that many might get afraid to see what possible scenario might happen and other holders might dump first before it happen so we hope that we cannot see the worse and the refund will happen this year so that possibly by next year if bad thing will happen we can recover since halving hype might start and accumulation phase maybe can save this.",

Gox will start compensation distribution to their victims, soon or next month. Again, now we have another news, next month they will distribute bitcoins to victims.You know, such recooked news is to fud the market, to create fear that when Mt. Gox distribution happens, the Bitcoin market will have big selling pressure from Mt. Gox's victims.",

But I want to ask you, do you think the plummeting price of bitcoin is a good thing or a bad thing? Furthermore, many people always want to buy bitcoin at a cheaper price than the current price, so do you think if Mt.gox really released those bitcoins, would it be good or bad? What I find confusing is that people always say they will buy more bitcoin if it drops more, but there are many threads worrying about FTX or Mt.Gox causing bitcoin to drop more. To me, both of those events are more beneficial to us than harmful to us.But I have doubts about Mt.Gox, this is not the first time there are rumors that they return assets to victims. Their promise could be made into a movie because it has been going on for many years, and so far, no victim has been compensated.",

If its hacked then it could be confiscated by the government instead and the only reason why they will try decieving people that it will be claimed is for them to ask KYC from those OGs. Too paranoid you might say but then fact is that its claimed to be hacked and MtGox are gone. Coins that are hacked are lost coins.",

Even I am a little anxious if the BTC return is properly done. I don't know how big it is, but I'm afraid that the amount of BTC returned to users could make the problem worse. I've heard 2 times this BTC return news. But there has been no real realization. Although maybe Mtgox Users are waiting for this replacement.",
