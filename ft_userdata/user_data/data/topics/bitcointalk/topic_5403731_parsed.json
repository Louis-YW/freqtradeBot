Given that all major media outlets are owned by only a few large global corporations, it is not difficult to conclude who is most bothered by Bitcoin.",

We must see a worse market and long period of unprofitable for miners to see capitulation.When they can not cover their electricity mining cost, bank calls if they borrow to buy ASIC and some physical things to set up and mine Bitcoin, they will have to capitulate. Capitulation will appear before a new market. Market can not complete a bearish phase if most of people and miners are still healthy, feel positive and hopefully about the market.",

Miners can only sell what they mine, and according to the current reward, a total of about 27 000 BTC (900 per day) can be mined in 1 month. Even if everyone miraculously joined forces and sold everything they mined, they would only harm themselves (at least in the short term) because they would bring down the price even more. I wouldn't say that they are so stupid as to do it that way, and that they certainly use OTC, and maybe virgin mined BTC has a premium price, so they profit that way too.Quote from: DapanasFruit on June 23, 2022, 01:22:42 PMWe are expecting more bad news on crypto because as the global economy is tethering towards great bad changes, the crypto industry is acting like its mirror instead of offering a good alternative - a big failure in my opinion.I understand the disappointment, but on the one hand, we can't talk about adaptation, and on the other hand, I guess we should keep Bitcoin under the glass bell away from all the negative influences?
