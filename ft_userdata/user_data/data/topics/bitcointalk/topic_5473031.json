Because this exchange has a lot p2p users. Remember that if you intend to buy and hold bitcoins, then after buying bitcoins, withdraw them to a non-custodial wallet or hardware wallet.",

If you don't mind going through KYC, I would go with Binance P2P. There are no escrow/trading fees, it has both BTC and USDT and most importantly, there are plenty of offers and individuals you can deal with.",

In short, I will say by doing KYC you will expose your identity to the government indirectly, but if you don't do it then I don't think centralized exchanges can be used to track your cryptocurrency activities. Coming back to your query, if choose to do KYC then Binance is a better option to buy BTC or USDT using Western Union or Ecash. If you are newbie then try to watch some tutorial from the YT it would help you more and try to watch new videos not some years old videos.",

There are many scams happens at these platforms, but if properly used then they can really help to get the maximum profit from it. You will make tons of profit or save a lot if you buy from a seller directly. So it’s always best to buy the coins through trusted P2P deals.",
