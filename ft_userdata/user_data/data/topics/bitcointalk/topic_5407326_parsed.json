By storing your backup offline, you reduce the risk. If you store if online, you increase the risk and do you think your security is good enough for backup file. I doubt that it is not good enough.You told that you left your paper backup on computer table. That is very bad practice.

Try placing it inside a book or better yet write it inside a book and place that in your bookshelf.

I am speechless because it is unnecessary. If my brother loves his mom, he should do something to stop it but he does not. I think it is unacceptable and I am in conflict with him about that.

If you have stored your HW safely, then treat your backup in the same way - because imagine a situation in which your HW breaks down, and then you discover that your mother threw the backup in the trash - unlike that character who is looking for his HDD in some junkyard, you wouldn't have any chance of finding an ordinary piece of paper.Quote from: xSkylarx on July 23, 2022, 07:59:49 AMThis is what I've been scared about when people say to write your recovery phrases on a piece of paper instead of storing it online.I would like to know how others keep these secret phrases if the people in your house are not really knowledgeable in crypto. Would it be safe if I store it online but the file is encrypted and password protected?The problem is not that you use paper for backup, but in how you will store that paper. Physical storage, whether it's paper, plastic or metal, has its drawbacks, but you're sure that you won't be hacked by a hacker because you saved your backup as plain text on your computer, or you save it in the cloud or e-mail. However, everyone who has a physical backup should know that one backup is not enough, as well as that 5 backups in the same location do not make sense if that location is threatened by fire, flood, or earthquake.You don't need to complicate things as some do, so after x years some don't know why the backup doesn't work, whether the words are mixed up or maybe there is additional protection in the form of a passphrase.

Of course, your mom wouldn't steal your crypto using that seed-phrase, but as you saw for yourself, she could easily let others do it out of ignorance. Someone could find your recovery phrases among the garbage (away from home), albeit with a small probability. In your case, you should take care of a safer way to store it. I would recommend that you immediately exclude the online storage option and prefer the local method.
