Just like Justin Sun gave BTC to Warren Buffet. But this is likely just a Birthday gift to Peter. Sadly these guys just knew what they want and they are heavily invested in Gold.Peter though has a son who have been into Bitcoin for a long time. At least his son isn't as hard headed like his father, his son knew the future could be different.",

I really don't know what their motive for donating is, really. So, you have a negative opinion on Bitcoin but use it as a means for collecting birthday gifts? For me it's like anyone can use Bitcoin as a platform to gain popularity and when all else fails you can still go back to it and the community will accept you with open arms.",

He is refer to as gold advocate because of how he speaks highly about gold but he never stops talking about Bitcoin too, that means he loves it tooHe has opened more than one polls on X to let people vote between the price of Bitcoin and gold which will dump to a certain price and which will surpass a certain price. He has always criticized crypto not just Bitcoin but still yet he has a hidden likeness for Bitcoin which he admitted in his speech last year when he said that \" if he had known how big Bitcoin would become, he might have \"loaded up on it\" If he don't like Bitcoin for once, he wouldn't have publicly admitted to such. He is just ceasing this opportunity to receive some free Bitcoin for himself from his fan. They call him gold advocate, if he loves gold more than Bitcoin, why did he not request for gold instead?    lol",

Even if you are drowning in bitcoins, why the hell would you send it to a clown who constantly trashes it? He says he will never sell? Yeah, right. Thats just what he wants you to think while he is probably smirking about all the free money he is raking in from gullible idiots. We will see if his \"never sell\" promise lasts longer than his next anti-Bitcoin rant.",

For sure we understand where he is coming from, but he is arrogant and probably Bitcoiners are sending him a donation and then we will see how it goes till this bull run.",

On the other hand, I feel that this person is trying to take back his words about Bitcoin with his own method, although we don't know what he really means by all that, but I hope it is true that he intends to fix it. Actually, we often encounter incidents like this before, and I even remember there was a media that tried to sneer at Bitcoin and in the end they stopped sneering at Bitcoin, or eventually they get involved.

But I wouldn't eliminate the fact that he might be doing all donations himself from his unknown addresses. I can post a donation address and donate lots of satoshis through different Bitcoin addresses and manipulate the fact that people follow my tweets and send me lots of donations.",
