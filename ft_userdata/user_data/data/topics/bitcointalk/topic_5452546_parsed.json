  "content": "My people, if you dun run transaction in the last one week, you go dun see say miners dun turn POS operative in regards to the kind transaction fee dem dey charge. To get transaction confirm in the fastest time dey cost reach like $200 last week as I dey see screenshots everywhere (like the screenshot above wey person been send me) even me self check am and confirm am. People wey been get all their money for BTC the thing worry dem well well. How far, you do transaction last week and if yes how much you pay for fee. Also which wallet wey you use run the transaction so maybe others fit download incase this kind thing repeat him self for future. Edit: I notice those wey dey use trustwallet dey get this over high fee issue as dem no get control over setting their fees Another matta wey I wan bring here na, from this experience of high fees na say, wetin be your stand on getting some stablecoin for hand as e fit help in situations like this. People wey been get stablecoin just dey do their things as normal like nothing happen and dey wait for the fee to come down (e dun reduce small now) before dem begin the use the network again. How you see the idea to they hold stablecoin as you dey hold your BTC.",

It is good to consolidate inputs if mempool is not congested.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on May 12, 2023, 10:47:34 PMAlso which wallet wey you use run the transaction so maybe others fit download incase this kind thing repeat him self for future.Desktop Electrum has fee customization.

Wetin dey happen sha dey encourage hodling by fire by force.Bitcoin transaction fee is based on transaction virtual size or weight, not the amount of coins that you want to send.Bitcoin transaction has never been a problem for me as the transaction size is not more than 500 bytes, using 16 to 20 sat/vbyte and ViaBTC free accelerator to accelerate it. The last time I did it, it was around $0.6 in fee when many people are using over $20 as fee to get faster confirmation.Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 13, 2023, 02:46:52 PMBut e dey possible say we fit experience this kind congestion for stablecoin like say USDT if plenty people start to dey use am?No. Altcoins are more scalable.

Many people no get patience and dem no get time to dey find accelerators. We no dey use the bitcoin blockchain, e get people wey dey depend on am very well and any moment wasted fit affect their reputation. Take Hhampuz as example, he's known as a fast paying signature manager and to keep his reputation intact, una see the kind money wey him dey pour for transaction fees just to make sure there's no delay in transaction while other managers dey delay their participants payment and you no go blame them, dey no get reputation to protect.
