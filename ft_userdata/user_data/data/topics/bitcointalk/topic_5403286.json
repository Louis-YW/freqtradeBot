Also scarcity increases the value. An exclusive photograph that no one else has can have a great value. A common photo has less value.

Some people don't value bitcoin at all, claiming that spending energy on its mining is a waste of resources, whereas others may value bitcoin because it allows them to make unstoppable transactions, which can be settled in seconds without the participation of any trusted intermediaries. A fixed total supply is one of the main features that make bitcoin valuable to some people simply because these people understand that no other assets in the world have similar peculiarities.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on June 20, 2022, 03:24:55 AM bitcoin doesn't get used anywhere for any purpose. it's just imaginary.If it is imaginary, then you can use your imagination to make yourself rich by imagining thousands of imaginary bitcoins.

If you really look at Bank notes, you find that it is made from cotton paper and linen (The same material used in the manufacturing of say aprons, bags, towels, napkins, bed linens, tablecloths) ...... and the only value linked to it, is the signature of the government official that promise to honor the value that are printed on that.  How many people still believe that governments have the best interest in mind for their fellow citizens? How many corrupt governments are looting and stealing tax payers money? I will rather support a currency that do not use politicians to manipulate it's value to suite their hidden political agendas.     (Bitcoin's value is based on supply and demand from people globally... not government officials)",

Coins used to be backed by gold, but gold also has quite a bit of faith in the belief that it is valuable, although it can be argued that with gold you can make durable objects but to analyze this would be to enter into a long debate that would divert us from the main issue.In this case the Bitcoin is worth because many people give it value, and if you wonder why they give it value it is because of its intrinsic properties, but as I said before in value attribution there is always a part of shared belief that it is valuable. Note that in ancient Rome, salt was considered much more valuable than it is today:Did you know the word 'salary' has nothing to do with money, and everything to do with salt?In ancient Rome, it was salt and not money that was used for commerce or trading. The soldiers who worked for the Roman empire got a handful of salt in return as their payment each day.What was the salt backed by? On the belief that it was valuable. You could argue that it was used to salt food, as in the case of gold, which is used to make objects, but that property seems ridiculous today to give it the value it was given in ancient times.",

A production cost must be factored in while calculating the value of bitcoin, otherwise it doesn't makes sense!

Everything goes hand in hand here!...Where do you get that from? For years BTC was mined at a loss by people who found it interesting. Even now there are people mining with older inefficient miners who loose money every day even at $50k or $60k per BTC. As people stop mining difficulty drops so the remaining miners make more. If the price drops even more, more people may drop out and the remaining people will get more BTCThat's the way the system works. That's the way it's supposed to work.As an altcoin example it looks like that as of the next difficulty change (tomorrow) LTC will have a 25% drop in difficulty since the beginning of June when it's price plummeted.Would take a bit longer due to the 14 day adjustment of BTC but if miners dropped out the same will happen. But looking at the BTC difficulty, miners are not dropping out.-Dave",
