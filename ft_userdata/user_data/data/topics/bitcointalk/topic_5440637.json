I have marked these user's trust feedback pages with distrust feedback.Miscellaneous: Text is DT2 through the good grace of campaign manager @CryptopreneurBrainboss i.e. https://loyce.club/trust/2023-02-18_Sat_05.07h/807536.html and was probably ripping off @Hhampuz who is Campaign Manager for the Freebitco.in signature campaign with their attempt at participation in that campaign.QuoteTrust list for: Text (Trust: neutral) (65 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2023-02-18_Sat_05.07h)Back to indexText Trusts these users' judgement:1. yahoo62278 (Trust:  +34 / =2 / -0) (2950 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)2.

Maybe the one that created this account.I didn't buy this account from him, this was given to me when I asked for help from him when I got an issue registering an account on this forum, he is the one that introduces me to Bitcoin and this forum.My comment for Part 2:Hmm, as far as I know, having an alt account here on this forum is not forbidden, it is not also suggested nor recommended but I can see that some of the members have their own alt account/s. My mistake here is I didn't confirm on this forum that this user Text has an alt account OnlineMoney, which I successfully registered on my end.With regard to the Torcoin socmed campaign, there's a rule of 1 account per each social media. It didn't say whether an alt account is allowed or not. So I presume having different accounts and a different socmed account is allowed. I admit I just came here in my early days just to earn by posting... But of course, it changed as the years pass by, when I got more understanding of the work around here especially when I got tagged as a spammer, I learned a lot from it. And I already stop using my second account joining campaigns.Yeah, I might abuse some of the bounty campaigns before, maybe I just did that cause of a lack of knowledge, I am not fully aware of how to work on this forum. But yeah, I am not reasoning this just to have pity on me.It's still up to you guys how to judge me, but I am telling my story now.I might be an abuser of bounty socmed campaign participants for having an alt account with a different socmed account too,  but I didn't scam here directly and I can't do that.",

However, I later discovered that the account had been linked to others as the previous owner was an account seller.As a newbie account, the previous owner gave it to me, and I changed the email address and password to make it my own. On April 9, 2016, the day the account was turned over to me, I began browsing the forum and made my first post.I would like to apologize for my past behavior as a campaign abuser. It was a foolish mistake to join campaigns with red flags. At that time, I did not have enough knowledge about it, and all I knew was to post more to earn more.As a precautionary measure, I created an alt account named OnlineMoney in case something happened to the Text account. However, I made a mistake by using it to claim other tweets. I thought it would go unnoticed, but I realized it was wrong. Apart from that, I do not have any other alt accounts on this forum.I recall that the Text account was locked out because it had been reported for spamming, and Lauda red-tagged the account when I fell into the trap of a bumping service offer. However, before she left the forum, I asked her if she could remove the tag that had been hanging on my account for a year (I am not sure of the exact duration), and I promised that I had learned my lesson and would not repeat it.I have learned a lot from my mistakes and am committed to avoiding such errors in the future to maintain a good reputation.I would like to clarify that I am not using the OnlineMoney alt account and have kept it inactive.If I ever need to create a new account, I will publicly announce it in the first place.",

But after the year 2017, when this account received a negative rating, I never repeated the same errors or committed another mistake.Are you perfect? Haven't you made any mistakes in your life?Not 1 single person is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. The issue is you've made multiple mistakes and now want a pass because its been 6 years according to you, but only 1 year according to Timelord. For now I will not be tagging you. I will be ~you as should everyone else on the forum so that you never make it into DT. If Timelord2067 shows proof you've been scamming in the last year I will tag you.@Timelord2067 the proof you posted above doesn't show where they exactly cheated.

I need him to provide evidence that I've been scamming for less than a year. Once he provides the evidence, we can take a look at each accusation one by one.",
