  "content": "Good morning. Some days ago I was taking a look at my twitter feedback and I found something some of you could find interesting or at leat worthy of some discussion.It seems there are slot machines of a popular japanese animation called \"Madoka Magica\", basically girls with magic powers, these slots machines seem to include a tactile screen for the player to interact with the characters in order to gamble.In these Tweets you can see how two of the characters seem to ask the player to \"touch\" their fingertips as part of the slot machine functionality. (For some reason, if the player chooses to hold on it more than necessary the character reacts to it)https://twitter.com/_jpjordon_/status/1514676095999696902https://twitter.com/Gitaka27/status/1515198419115343877What do you think about these japanese slot machines?Do you like them?Would you gamble on them?",

In general the slots are the same, I mean the game is basically luck, of course I like slot games especially at certain times like the ones I've played Voodoo Magic, Xmas Magic.It seems that the slot you say is more dominant like the Sailor Moon cartoon slot game, Naruto, however, I have never tried to play the Madoka Magica slot, maybe if it promises why not.So, what's interesting about the Madoka Magica slot compared to the Magic slot in general, what luck is there and what gambling site you play on that slot.",

This is really attractive for young japanese gamblers to try and play because they like this.",

We all know how things work on Japan and it is not surprising that this kind of machine exist on their casinos. Possibly, there are more things that has been changed on that casino such as the overall design of the place which has a theme of anime characters.",

A slot machine using a touch screen to play, the animation of the voice character is quite tempting, honestly I'm interested yeah I like it a little. But I doubt if I must to bet with it, the location is also far and for me personally it's better to bet on an online slot casino than having to fly spend my money for travel, because in my opinion slot games are the same as slot other, only difference is the sound and graphic.",

It's only instead of pulling the arm or pushing a button (as you do on classic machines), in this one you have to tap with your finger on the touchscreen to spin the reels. Those cartoon images and animation are there just to make the game funnier and more interactive and I don't believe they affect in anyway the outcome of the game.",

Though on the gambling aspect of this particular slot machine, I don't think it will attract hardcore gamblers. Only men with taste on these girls would see the gambling aspect as somewhat a bonus for what they're doing. With the kind of interaction this slot machine is provided, I'm pretty sure it will be a hit to those men who are looking for a company rather than thrill in gambling.",

Maybe, this is quiet inconvenient to some since we are used to play in slot machine by just pressing the buttons, but still this might be one of a good technology that casino in Japan has to offer to the gamblers.",

Looks cool actually, will give it a shot if I had chance to try this slot machine. Btw, animation of slot and feature scripts are different on slot machines but what matters is house edge in overall turnover. Hope house edge percentage is not over 3%. The house edge is indeed a concern in a slot machine regardless of its technology since the concept is still the same its just that, you have to put your finger in the screen so you can start playing. Well this is cool as long as its safe and Japanese animation never gets old, it is still a good one. Is this located in a Japanese casino or in other country? Just curious if this is also available in some casinos outside Japan.",

Referring to online slots, maybe what I will just find is how good and attractive their free spin is,  or what are the other surprises include in that slots. If I found it impressive, I'm expecting there's a buy-in feature on that slot to make my session intense and much more entertaining. That applies to other slot themes as well.Referring to physical slots like the one you have shared here, regardless of the theme, I might try them because it's an actual experience.",
