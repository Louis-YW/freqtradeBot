  "content": "Interest Free Loan Service¬†I'll launch the service 1 week after the ban on mixers is in. Loan applications will be considered from Jan 7th 2024.The service's open to users who want interest free loan between $10-$125 for up to 21 days max.¬†Who can apply¬†_\\Any user who's got crypto collateral to the value they're applying for.Any user who's in paid campaigns. If you've got neutral feedback your application's going to be considered. If you've got outstanding loans or negative feedback please don't ask because your application won't be accepted.¬†Is it really interest free?¬†_\\Yes it's interest free. I'm lending for up to 21 days max. All I'm asking is you repay the full amount on the agreed date. You'll arrange permission from your sig campaign manager to pay the loan direct to me if you didn't repay on 14 days. If your sig campaign manager's my safeguard I'll lend the money.If you want to include a tip with your repayment it'll be accepted with thanks.¬†How much can be applied?¬†_\\The amount's capped at your week sig campaign pay up to $125.For example if you've applied for $21 or more but your sig campaign pay's $20 week you can't because the max you should apply for is $20.If you apply for $51 or more but your sig campaign pay's $50 week you can't because the max you should apply for is $50.If your sig campaign pay's $35 week you can apply for $10-$35.If your sig campaign pay's $72.50 week you can apply for $10-$72.50.If your sig campaign pay's $200 week you can apply for $10-$125.¬†When does it get repaid?¬†_\\Unless we've agreed differently all loans must be repaid by 21 days. If the loan's repaid sooner it'll be appreciated because funds will be available to other applicants.When you repay the loan you aren't obliged to include a tip but you'll have to return the loaned amount including tx fees I've incurred to send it to you.For example if you've borrowed $50 USDT but it's cost $1.15 to send it you must return $51.15 USDT. If you've borrowed 0.0013BTC but it's cost 0.000065BTC to send you must return 0.001365BTC.USDT's been paused so only apply for BTC loans. Ask questions. I'll give more info on how you're to apply & explain any rules changes if required.",

I'm delighted you like how I'm trying to change the way lending's operated here. Your positive advice helped thanks supporting me. By sending support messages you've given me confidence I'll make the service underway after the mixers ban. I'd expect a practicability some users who'll be removed from mixers campaigns could default so I've marked 1 week before assessing loan applications.",

If I'm losing money because of defaulters I'll stop the service. Forum lenders have given helpful money services over time so they're established. I'm trying a modern lend style which's in opposition to big interest on loans.I hope I'll make interest free loans a commonly used route which's replicated by more users so they'll becomes lenders. If it happens there'll be increased pools of interest free lenders to choose from.Quote from: AHOYBRAUSE on December 15, 2023, 12:03:21 PMGood luck with your service, I hope people won't take advantage of it!It's a smart move to cap it at the borrowers weekly signature payment, this secures they should have 3x the loan amount after 21 days and a repayment should be no problem.

I don't want to spend my flow from UniJoin's sig campaign so I'm stacking sats. While I'm saving BTC I don't mind helping other ppl. If I'm successful it's going to encourage me so I'll continue the service after increase the max loan amount. There's two eventualities I recognised if the service's got chances to flourish. It's a smart move capping loans at sig campaigners pay & I'd have to start the service after mixers promos get banned.",
