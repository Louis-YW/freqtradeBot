I sold that ADA on February 2021. Is it possible to backtrace where I bought my ADA before depositing into bittrex and to which price?I have some info on my bittrex deposit history: the TxId and the address and the exact amount. Which site do I need to put that information in to get more details?",

Try to paste that wallet address on cardanoscan.io and go from there. If you can't trace back the source further then you'll have no choice but to use the earliest known date. You can go to coingecko and search for ADA's price history using their \"historical data\".",

Which site do I need to put that information in to get more details?If you purchase on 2018 then probably you are holding an ERC20 version of ADA and you can use etherscan.io to track the root of the transaction. Most of the time, you will see the name of exchange that you use on purchasing it if you purchased it on CEX since CEX wallet address is tagged by there name while DEX usually has a smart contract transaction note for swapping you purchase it on DEX.It's important to determine what blockchain is your ADA to determine the suitable explorer to browse.",

Yes, your order history. For deposits you can check your wallet address on when you've deposited it but to know exactly on which price you bought it, it should have to be on your order history as well. I think there might have been some discrepancies if your asking on which price you bought those ADA token before depositing to your Bittrex account since that wouldn't be available on your order history but you can have an estimate if you know the timestamp before depositing it. You can check tradingview (or other price chart tools) or use Google to check on what was the price on the said date.You can use this historical price data for ADA: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADA-USD/history?period1=1528588800&period2=1681430400&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true",
