It should be noted, however, that the movement is not supported by volume, and there is strong resistance ahead at the levels 28.5k-29k, which may constitute the frame of the H&S formation.So we have to be careful, but the situation is certainly better than in recent weeks.",

We have to think that there is a world outside the analysis, and a negative news can pull the price down.news that appears out of the blue and changes the fate of the market, called a \"black swan\", is an unpredictable phenomenon that no one ever includes in statistics because it is unpredictable. The probability you are talking about, which you see in the analyses, relies on statistics (e.g. A falling wedge is a technical analysis pattern with a predictive accuracy of 74%. The pattern can break out up or down but is primarily considered bullish, rising 68% of the time.) In other words, when someone gives the probability, it is not because he predicts that an unpredictable phenomenon may occur with a 30% probability XD",

We have to think that there is a world outside the analysis, and a negative news can pull the price down.Each analysis has its own probability and it cannot be determined only from a technical analysis. There is no 100% probability, that every analysis will definitely have some errors or discrepancies with the current price reality. There will be other factors that affect the probability of an increase in bitcoin prices such as Fundamental Analysis, government regulations and several other influences. You may rely on long-term investment, it is the best and there is no need to read the chart in detail.All you need is to enter at the right time and then hold with a certain price target and certainly have money reserves to buy back. But be aware that every investment or trade has its own risks. Seeing how the Bitcoin market conditions in Q4 are currently, it is quite optimistic that significant price movements will occur soon.October will be a reversal month that could be the beginning of Bitcoin reaching ATH again next year.",

For me this early month of October coming to early November, we might see price still trading lower. And then late November coming to December would be an upmove. For me we're still in a bearish trend. unless there's good economic news that would drive BTC's price higher to $32K with a fast bullish candle, only then I can tell that my initial analysis would be wrong and more likely to be on the upside.That's how my analysis works. Embracing uncertainty. If this..then this... We're only adapting with the current market condition.",

So let's keep our fingers crossed to see what becomes the outcome of the current market realities and how best we tend to handle all of that stuff as regards to bitcoin market and its speculations,  and how best we can fake position either it is it buying or selling position and we apply the DCA techniques.",

Based on what am observing from the chat, show that bearish season is about to disappear from the market for bullish season to roll in for those that invested in a low price to begin to get ready to supply when the price increase higher again. Since we have experienced $30,000 in this year 2023, I believe something good will definitely happen before the end of December that will make investors to accept that next year will be a massive bullish for both long term investors and short term investors.",

In the last 13 years, 9 times Bitcoin has gone up during the month of October. Bitcoin must surpass the $30,000 price resistance, so that we might see something different towards to it. I mean Bitcoin has been moving sideways for quite some time already. Many are just waiting for some catalysts that might've push the price either up or down. Well, we're only a few months away from the Bitcoin halving to happen (estimated to happen in April next year). The bad thing though is that, in the last 2 years, the price of Bitcoin during the month of November, and December is down. I will not be surprised if it will happen again this year, but nevertheless, I expect a bullish movement towards the price of Bitcoin at least this month.",

There is a slight, almost imperceptible upward movement on the charts, but it is too weak to be called a trend or even a correction, the 30k resistance level has been a formidable opponent and most likely this is going to remain the case for a long time, and while this could be exasperating for traders, this is great news for long term holders as they can buy bitcoin for a relatively stable price on the upcoming months and prepare themselves for the upcoming halving.",

So maybe its slowly starting to happen that's the reason why we see some upper trend movements towards bitcoin. Although it price reverse a little bit but I'm confident that we can see more of it and maybe it can break to $30k on next month. Month of November and December maybe an exciting month since this might be a deciding factor by majority to see if they can see some good price to set on next year since if good actions happen in this month maybe this is one of the reason why a bull run will be triggered to happen on first or second quarter next year.",
