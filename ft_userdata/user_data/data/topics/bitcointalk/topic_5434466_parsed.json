  "content": "2022 was certainly a bloody year for bitcoin investors and many drama played out in the crypto space but all that said we have manage to cross the year successfully to 2023.  2023 is going to be another year of major speculation on the rate on when we are going to experience another bull run and eventually reaching another ATH.  As 2022 was seen as a disastrous year for some bitcoin holders, it was also seen as an golden opportunity for new comers like me who missed out in buying when bitcoin was very low before it experienced a major rise in the year 2020. We have bought bitcoin now thats it price is very low and we are expecting to hodl it till when another bull run season comes hopefully we can see it reach another all-time-high. So am curious to know if everyone is still holding or have chicken out and sold theirs. Note ::get your coins off any exhange platforms if you are still on the hodl game",

So for me this is still the first step. and is still in the middle accumulation stage. I might only be interested in selling when the current ATH is exceeded. Because the money I use for bitcoin investment is really cold money. so I'm not too interested in a 1-20% increase. But I'm quite happy to see how the current market volume continues to increase rapidly. this indicates the market is on a positive path.",

But certainly it was a great year for me, first for the opportunity to join this forum and then to gain more knowledge about bitcoin. The best of it is the fact that we had the opportunity to buy bitcoin below the $20k cushion. Who will have thought we get it this low. I am holding some although it doesn’t seem much to me but I have the holding in two categories. One batch will be sold when the current ATH is surpassed and the other batch will be next halving after that 2024 if at all there isn’t any surprises or emergency beyond the my emergency funds",

What I saw in the crypto market few hours ago show that bull season will soon kick off for those that hold for a long time to think of how to visit the market to release their coins to achieve what they want and  wait for another opportunity to come before they can buy and hold again. Since the price has demonstrated some signs in this month of January, that is making majority traders to believed that this new year will be better than last year 2022.",

But despite all the troubles, bitcoin was able to withstand and once again show that something is yes costs. It also gave new opportunities to build up btc in their wallets, which many took advantage of.I think there is no clear answer and there will be people who still hold btc, and those who sold at different stages. Some are better, some not so much. Even those who sold at a loss can now buy bitcoin to make up losses later or even make some profit.Now there is certainly no point in selling, because this is the time to buy and accumulate. Perhaps this is the last chance before the start of a bullish trend.",

A longer accumulation phase is necessary and a great sign for an upcoming bull run and not a quick recovery from the recent big dump. This year is the best time to enter on Bitcoin slowly because typically another low always appeared on this time when everyone is fear of losing due to the recent big dip event. I’m still holding most of my old investment in Bitcoin but I already flip the rest of my altcoins since last year and add to my Bitcoin balance. Putting all my eggs on Bitcoin is my strategy this year for a better accumulation with less risk of losing money.",

Note ::get your coins off any exhange platforms if you are still on the hodl gameIf you aren't holding now i don't know the appropriate time to hodl again when the bitcoin price is already dip, the best advice nowbis to invest, hodl and keep your asset decentralized and private by avoiding any means to third party access with your bitcoin investment and the access to the keys.",

Hoping to get back on track within this year.Yea I think a lot of people will at some stage have to liquidate some Bitcoin to coverunforseen expenses. I had to do the same in 2022, a small percentage had to be liquidatedbut I'm predominantly HODLing.For anyone who is in Bitcoin for a number of years, we realise that 2022 was just a year in a cycle. Buying in just at the time of the ATH means a bear market will be experienced.Not everyone realises that it's the time of HODLing, not selling out of panic or FUD.",

There's no way I can't now.Year 2022 is  history now but it will be remembered as a very difficult year for crypto, as collapse of FTX and Luna  triggered massive sell-off across the board & many investors suffered  huge losses & some of them lost their life time savings. Additionally, the interest rate continued rising throughout the year due to high rate of inflation,  which had  also negative impact on all financial markets including crypto. Hopefully, 2023 will be an improvement year over 2022, which is also evident from beginning of market recovery. Bitcoin is now trading above 18k which is a good news for crypto Investors & traders. Market analysts also expect a less harsh monetary policy in 2023 which is another positive factor.",

Still this was an opportunity for newbies to invest and for people to accumulate more bitcoin for themselves. This shows that in every bad situation there are benefactors,this also made so many investors to understand the way how to keep their investment safe by themselves in a noncustodial wallet,i.e not your keys not your coin.I am still hodling and I don't have any plans of selling yet until 2025 when I know that the I am ready to carry out my project,but I will not be selling all as I will keep bitcoin as my valuable asset,which I can give to my son when he is grown up as a man.",

But on my end, my assets are not as big with others that is why I am taking extra caution of my actions. I am waiting for a clear trend line before I make a move whether to sell or hold. It is quite managing the risks involved. The market price is subject for time to time changes because of volatility. But right now, it seems that the price would play around 15, to 17, unless something big will happen for this year.  But at the present, new projects are quite being noisy so it could be an alternative if you're not used to big names in this industry.",
