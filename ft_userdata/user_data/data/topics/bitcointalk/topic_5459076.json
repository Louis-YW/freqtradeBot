Does this mean the bitcoin and vault feature in their wallet is centralized and they can steal the balance still? Is it not that safe as I thought vs trustwallet? Being open source but having the ability to use my private key is still risky. Pls clarify.",

The announcement only affects its custodial lightning nodes, although you can still use other or own self-custody nodes to proceed a lightning transaction. This also mean that their main wallet and other features are not affected by that changes.",

And also, don't be confused of custodial and non-custodial wallets. Most or all custodial wallets are centralized it means they have full control of its user's funds, non-custodial wallet is the opposite. In lightning, when you say custodial, it means that the service say bluewallet, have the control of the node server used in lightning. When you say non-custodial, these are the nodes that its either from the community or the one you self-hosted. But in this case, since bluewallet stops their custodial lightning node, the only thing you can use their wallet's lightning feature is to use other lightning node or your self-hosted node, and it's non-custodial or what they called self-custody Lightning wallets.",

After I use translator to translate what he posted, this is what I got:QuoteYes, my brother, Yahya, I had previously created a topic on this subject. The lightning network is still supported, but it has become non-custodial, unlike what it was before [1]Â I think Wallet of Satoshi is a good alternative (for those who don't want to go into technical details)That is also the same thing we posted here. That the lightning network on Bluewallet is no more custodial but now noncustodial.",
