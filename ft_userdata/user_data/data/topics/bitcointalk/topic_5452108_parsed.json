BC.GAME's representative on this forum has been offline for about a month, so you won't get a proper reply here until he comes online. You should continue to contact them with their support team and find a solution.Because the forum representative is offline, his explanation of this complaint will not be available in this community.",

      "body": "Have you consider the likelyhood of the system need some time to reverse the transaction? I am not familiar with Indian banking system, and since several articles I searched gave me mixed answer, I resort to our latest brand new and still shiny source of information, ChatGPT. To summarize my conversation with... it, the likelyhood of transaction got successfull and credited to a wrong account is about 1%, but it does need several days to reverse the said transaction, suppose it is not credited to a wrong account.Below is the snippet of the conversation:QuoteIt is difficult to estimate the exact percentage of transactions that are wrongly credited due to incorrect IFSC codes, as there are no official statistics on this matter. However, based on anecdotal evidence and reports, it seems that such errors occur in a very small percentage of transactions, possibly less than 1% of all transactions involving IFSC codes.The time taken to reverse a transaction that has been credited to a wrong account due to an incorrect IFSC code can vary depending on a number of factors, including the banks involved, the accuracy of the details provided, and the promptness of the account holder in reporting the error to their bank.[I asked the time needed to process the reversal]In general, the process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to be completed. The account holder who received the funds in error will need to initiate the process of returning the funds to the sender's account, which may involve visiting their bank and providing proof of identity and the erroneous transaction. Once the bank confirms the error and the details of the correct account, they will initiate the reversal process.[...]",

Please answer ~Have you attempted to contact the casino through official channels, and if so, how long has it been since you last contacted their customer support? Keep in mind that customer support may not always be able to provide an immediate response to every issue, particularly if it requires time to investigate and identify the root cause of the problem.Before making any accusations of scamming, it would be prudent to wait until you receive a response from the casino's customer support.",

Maximum 1-2 days (if transaction is pending due to bank side issue) but in that case bc.game should not Mark my transaction as Success/approve. It's been 5 days and u have not received anything. I contacted bank they said \"contact the sender he got the refund\" becouse they still never received any transaction of 9028 Inr \"110 usd\" I made other fiat withdraw aswell \"once it mark success it just arrives right away\" within in sec. Case is not about banking side.Case is about bc.game bank clearly said they never received money of that transaction. So probably bc.game team received the refund (and of course they do manual withdraws ) that's the main problem. So i need help from them so they can check the actual issue and refund the balance to my bc account. As probably they got refund if till now i never got anything.5 days passed since I'm contacting the team.
