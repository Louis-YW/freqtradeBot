  "content": "I have strange relationships with doge coins.I like investing in altcoins and I believe that there are a lot of good projects that bitcoin maxis are ignoring. And you definitely can't say that altcoins are useless.But if you think about meme coins, they are mostly useless and pump only because of the hype. So it's a dangerous asset to invest in, that's why I don't like meme coins. But two years ago I decided that I want to try buying some doge hoping that it will fly up and I was wrong and lost some money. From that time, I decided for myself that these coins are not worth investing in. And after two years I still think that it's better to invest in coins that have some kind of utility/project.But I still see that there is a huge community of people who still buy doge and wait for it to go \"to the moon\" despite it still being a coin that only Elon can pump.So why do you think people still want to risk their money buying meme coins instead of buying bitcoin or some good altcoin? I think that even if doge will start pumping, it won't go x10 because its market cap is too high.Do you still buy doge or other meme coins?",

      "body": "That's because they still think that altcoins or meme coins can repeat their success by getting pumps from people like Elon Musk. In addition, because the price of the meme coin is still very small, they are willing to sacrifice some money to invest in meme coins, even though they don't know whether the meme coin can repeat its success in the next altcoin season or does it take longer to start increase. I have been buying Dogecoin and Shiba for a while now and am just waiting on the timing. And if those two coins don't increase any time soon, those two meme coins will just complement the coins I have in my wallet.",

But the main problem here is for the newbie investors who thought Doge Coins will be successful like ETH or BTC just because it is promoted by Elon Musk and they continue to buy them even though there is no guarantee that the price will rise in the future. People nowadays need to refrain from listening to any influencers concerning their investments if they don't want to jeopardize their capital because those guys don't tell people whenever they want to sell their holdings.",

From your story, I believe you are speculating and trading not investing.If you speculate a market wrongly and enter it at bad times, you will have to suffer a very big loss. If you bought Dogecoin two years ago, I guess you did it when Dogecoin rose to about $0.7 that is terrible and surely it's not good time to buy it.What did you think to load up Dogecoin after its rose a lot like that? Especially with your experience in altcoins, that speculation is so bad.Good news for you is Dogecoin is a Proof of Work altcoin and it won't be divided too much like GameFi, Metaverse tokens.",

We can't stop them nor discourage these people because I was certain that they are already aware of the situation and see Dogecoin losing its value, yet they still hold and invest. But for me, I don't consider it buying even though I saw the huge community supports for this project. Not because it was a meme coin but it is because I have no courage and never see the potential of this project in the long run.",

But usually, Elon will make tweets when the market is going up, which will increase meme coins or other coins. And for now, we can only guess hopefully Elon will tweet again for this meme coin. I don't really have high hopes to see the meme coin go up as high as it used to but if it does, I'll try to sell it at the highest price possible.",

Good thing I did not buy one though.You could be right that it won't go 10x, let alone Shiba being $1 as well. It is just not something of a realistic ATH as of the moment to be eyeing at.",

And because of this incident, the Doge reached 0.1$ each almost.    And this is also the reason why there are still many people buying doge in the market, maybe the doge believers believe that what Elon did will be repeated entry or the bull run will happen, which in my opinion is vague. Also, if I were to buy meme coins, I would prefer Babydoge and others that are under SHIB's utility tokens.",

Someone can be serious and not serious with use cases and utilities.But, only wants gains and wherever it can be, they'll also be there. I understand that there are investors that are only for that because that's what investing is and for us to make some profit.They chose the quite risky way but we're choosing the slow yet stable way of investing in the market through having reliable cryptos mainly bitcoin.",

Or more likely they have an use case that's not really needed and they act like they are building something important when it might as well be done with database or just using other similar coins. I would argue that meme coins have more use cases then 90% of the real world usage coins. They are not promising anything special so they aren't trying to bluff you thinking more of them then they are.That being said, i won't be buying dogecoin. I see even shiba having more changes to moon. It has as much room to grow as we bring in new people in, and there are going to be new youngsters every year investing into memes.
