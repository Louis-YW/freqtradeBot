You could very well use Bitminter's image without having any connection with their team.Apart from a Linkedin post from 5 months ago, we can't find anything about you online.Can you give us the block numbers that your pool has found? This could help you to build trust in the community.Quote from: promojo on October 21, 2023, 07:51:42 PMDiscrete Mining for Uninterrupted Operations from threat actors?Please, tell us more about this, I am curious. \"Discrete mining\" ?Also, I spent some time to read your terms and conditions. Can you tell us more about your KYC policy?QuoteLegal ComplianceThe Pool may have an Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer (‚ÄúAML/KYC‚Äù) programto detect and prevent money laundering. You shall submit any documents or informationrequested by XBTO Digital for compliance purposes. We will manage your personallyidentifiable information in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

Wemay allow legal authorities to access your account and informationSource : https://pool.xbtodigital.io/static/XBTO-Digital-Pool-Terms.pdfHow can you possibly think that my hashrate could be linked to some money laundering activity? A flagged BTC withdrawal address? A large volume of hashrate rented via Nicehash that could be used to receive clean BTC from your pool?And if you suspect this, what documents are you going to ask for? You've been \"serving the mining community since 2011\", except for miners located in Syria, Iran, Russia, Burundi, Afghanistan, China, Cuba, Belarus, Venezuela etc. QuoteThe Pool is not available in any location sanctioned by the U.S. government or prohibited by applicable lawI'm not naive, I fully understand that you are located in the USA, and that you must therefore respect US law.¬† But... QuoteWe may report suspected unlawful activity to legal authorities. Wemay allow legal authorities to access your account and informationThis just confirms what mikey said a few days ago:Quote from: mikeywith on October 19, 2023, 12:10:52 AM--snip--Probably the time to make a community-owned PPS pool will come soon, I always thought it would be to fight decentralization but it seems to be now needed to protect privacy, an anonymous PPS pool would be an interesting idea, something like the old p2pool with a smart contract of users funds that acts as a pool fund to distribute rewards to miners where the people who provide liquidity get paid some %.",

The solution is rather simple, steer clear from any mining pool that is based in the U.S if you don't want to be KYCed. it's crazy that in a country that is known to be the land of the free, you have all the rules and regulations that would strip you of your rights to privacy under the illusion of fighting \"money laundry and terrorism funding\".I wonder how long it will take for the U.S. to force every U.S. miner to use a U.S.-based mining pool.?",

      "body": "Bitminter had been mining for 9 years. When it shut down there was a lot of experience and in-house developed software that seemed a waste to throw away. Now that is part of XBTO Digital instead.Mining has changed a lot. From individual mining to mining pools. From CPUs to GPUS, to FPGAs, to ASICs. From individuals mining at home to companies running big mining operations. From any individual being able to start a mining pool, to pools run by companies. Companies that have their own big mining operations, or is otherwise connected to one. Otherwise the pool won't reach critical mass.Bitminter could not survive how the mining world changed in recent years. So now we bring the best of Bitminter to a bigger and more viable operation.",

The European Union has no business in Bitcoin mining, whatever operation they might have would be considerably small and not worth mentioning, so who is fool enough to set up a mining pool in EU anyway? what would they gain? tax are higher than the majority of the world, no local clients of interest, exactly nothing.I understand why would someone start a mining pool in the U.S, because regardless of the regulation, the U.S is the largest mining hub, so being a U.S \"made\" mining pool would certainly have some advantages at least to the larger corps mining BTC, but in EU, I don't see why.QuoteEuropean users of Nicehash (based in Slovenia) could soon or later have a bad surprise when logging in...What are the news?

Yes, I don't think any new pools will be set up in the EU in the future.¬† But if I'm not mistaken, it seems to me that there are still a few small pools that depend of EU regulation (Nicehash, Mining Dutch, EMCD, but it may have changed since then, I will double check and edit my post if I find something new). I agree with you, the EU is only symbolic (and still, not even 1% of the total hashrate lol...) but personally it's more the big picture that bothers me: USA + EU impose or will impose KYC on users of pools under their regulation... Quote from: mikeywith on October 25, 2023, 12:12:19 AMWhat are the news? Not only Nicehash. We'll soon have mandatory automatic declaration of CEX accounts in the EU, and incomes from mining too (no idea how it is supposed to be done concretely). There's talk of more advanced CEX/tax agencies cooperation, and also this KYC thing to come. Fortunately, we have a few countries with extremely advantageous tax systemes in Europe (Germany, Bulgaria, Croatia, Portugal, Malta), but the screws are being tightened more and more each year. There are two big laws in the pipeline on cryptos, and everyone is pretty pessimistic about their consequences for users.Quote from: mikeywith on October 25, 2023, 12:12:19 AMOh, that would be pretty light, I hope it stops there, for all I know, they could use the terrorism, Iran, Russia, and Hamas card, which would be pretty devastating to BTC in general, a few weeks ago Binance froze a dozen Palestinians' accounts, the excuse was that they were \"related to Hamas\", we know who is behind that, there is only one country which has the means of forcing Binance to do that, ya politics sucks, let's hope these governments don't weaponize crypto further for personal gains. Exactly, and we have good reason not to be overly optimistic.",
