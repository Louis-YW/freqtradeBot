You should post it in the Altcoin section of the forum, you will have more feedbacks about it, and probably more interest from forum users.Quote from: https://www.powerbombpay.com/pbpteamYears ago, I, Andrew Holness, founder, creator, CEO, (so far the team is only me, as the project grows, the team will grow) had created 2 Cryptocurrencies, they had no use case, they were meme coins with a charity aspect. They were successful, they're still around but as most meme coins do besides a couple successful ones, they die down. Could you please name both of the meme coins you created which were successful ? Not saying you are lying, but I am always very skeptical when charity is mentioned, even more when the said charity is linked to meme coins.The project is a token on the BSC. BSC is known to host a mass of more or less bad tokens, and an infinity of scams. I'm not saying it's a scam, but it's a big red flag for me. More proofs about your background could be great if you want to be trusted by the community IMO.",

      "body": "Hey, sorry just seeing this now. I created King Coin ($KINGC) & Toyz Token ($TOYZ) - Toyz has videos of my toy donations to community centers that helped under priviledged families and all the initiatives we started. They weren't really meme coins, there was just no real utility to them so I classified them as memes instead of alts.Also this post was posted in the Altcoin section.BSC has lower tax than ETH that is why I build on it. Every network has a mass of more or less bad tokens and an infinity of scams, because I build on the BSC you automatically start throwing the scam word around?I have 5% of the contract and only purchasing more and using for giveaways and contests. Ownership of the contract is renounced. LP is locked for a year and will extend. Please before even mentioning scam with a project, do your due diligence first. If you need more info, powerbombpay.com, there's a chat function there where you can reach me direct.Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on May 20, 2023, 09:26:26 PMI don't like to be the guy who breaks the mood, but there are a few things that seem not 100% clear about all of this.First, if I am not wrong, the project has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
