      "body": "Yeah what you actually said is true because nowadays people or industrial companies are no longer looking for people that has only one profession however they go for someone that could be very versatile in times of being good on different areas so that in case a department needs more manpower the person could easily navigate very well without challenge, although I'm not disputing that fact that having one profession cannot be employed but my point is having different skills will be an added advantage to be easily accepted by any company or sector. OP just like you said most schools are know longer accepting teachers who only specialized on a particular subject because they need someone that can teach several subjects in case the need arises so that they could easily improvise.",

And this na the reason why you need to be smart at whatever you are doing and in whatever environment you find yourself so that whoever needs your service will see you as a serious advantage to his firm or company and wouldn't want to loose you for any reason.We as humans needs to be versatile and have a creative mindset. But the fact still remain that no matter how smart we are, we can no cheat nature. What you can do is what you can do, what you can't do, you can't do it. Jus like the compearism of mathematics and physics you explain. I think you choose maths over physics because you find it easier Dan physics. And you can't change that fact.You can only Excel in what you are good at. Despite we talk about being versatile, I think we also need to consider things that will not be useful to us. Some people's end up not achieving their goals, due to multiple works without focus. I think focusing on one particular thing makes you stand out and you will be respected for that. Not some sort of  \"jack of all trade master of none\" and most of this is caused by lack of employment in the country. Sometimes we always think we know everything. Sometimes we the achitecture of our problems because we Lack focus. We think knowledge is by force and can achieve it by all means. Most collapse building and damage property is cause as a result of \" I can do it\" which dey don't know how to. Paraventure it might just be what dey see for the first time, and they jumped into conclusion and even go to the extent of doing it derby destroying some one's property due to ignorance.What you said is true but all am saying is that, when trying to be creative or versatile let us not jump into everything because we need money otherwise you'll get into trouble.",

No be by one work person gats survive with ooo. There gats be main hustle and side hustle too. This forum also Dey bring opportunities for most of us here too way be say we day use am as one of our hustle too. Person no gats day idle because oyibo talk say “an idle man is a devil workshop”    The best thing to do is to gain as much skills as possible and implement them gradually. You can't have knowledge in just one area alone and be blank in others, yes there'd be a main field of study but it'll be much better to back it up with background fields. Situations fit dey wey go need some kain skills and e no go make sense if the space jus dey blank, make we try find relevance everywhere we go. Develop yourself and build up in diverse areas, time go come where all these areas go dey of essence, normals the more the labour, the more the income generated, the only loss go be the extra stress wey dey attached to the hustle.",

There even some works that requires versatility so if you ain't skilled in the other aspect you may not be hired.",
