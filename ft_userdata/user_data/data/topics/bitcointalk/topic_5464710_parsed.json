I do not know if these laws have been changed or updated, but countries that are looking to adopt Bitcoin do so in order to legalize and impose more taxes, not because they like decentralization or try to make their people less poor. The G-20 summit will have less future impact in light of the conflict between the G-7 and the BRICS, which will represent the traditional battle between East and West countries.it is difficult to find an extensive regulation of that group.",

      "body": "This is a very contradictory statement when compared to ground realities as India is one of the nation with exorbitant amount of tax even for a single trade and if you compare the crypto trade volume from India between 2021 and 2023 you will see a huge drop of around 90% they just killed Indian crypto market without officially killing it by levying hefty tax and most of the exchanges like CoinDCX, Kuber Coinswitch are having massive layoff and at exchanges are trying to move out of India as they are literally making zero profits since users don't want to trade by paying tax amount which is much higher than profit margin it's like paying government on every trade even if you don't make profit.",

India is a crypto-unfriendly nation, and for quite a long time their citizens who used crypto were uncertain of their fate because the country was proposing a ban on crypto. In 2018, they first of all banned banks from handling crypto transactions, that ban was lifted two years later, but little did Indians know that it was because the government wanted to \"extort\" money from Indians who use crypto.The tax rate on crypto gains in India is now as high as 30%, that is extremely high and discouraging for Indians who use cryptocurrencies, if the government of India wants to promote crypto (which i am sure they don't care about), they should start by reviewing their crypto tax laws, which is basically stealing from people at this point.",

It's a very populated country, a lot of young people are trading crypto, but high taxes keep a lot of people locked in. 30% is a very high too much, if they relax the regulations a little more, India can maximize their current potential with the development of trade. I think there are quite a lot of Indian citizens adopting this technology, just as they have gone this far in computing, Blockchain has the same potential and they can realize it.",

Government is playing very smartly in terms of using crypto in IndiaÂ  they are neither opposing nor supporting openly. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, had imposed banking restrictions on cryptocurrency-related transactions also there were legislative proposals in India, such as the \"Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill,. Until and unless law is Implemented nothing cannot be considered.",

If they partner with other countries, they can regulate it. Because there are a lot of airdrop hunters doing airdrops from multiple wallets(500 wallets). They did not pay any taxes. So the best thing is to get the KYC details from the exchanges and allocate the taxes. It will be good for the country as well.",

Most country acts swiftly to ban crypto because they only want to protect their people from frauds and scammers taking advantage of ignorant investors but once they see some good news from other countries, they act this way and want to go the other way like the others did.",

So banning is clearly out of the question here, but we've got to wait and see what root India takes. They said they draft regulations that are suitable for Indian conditions. In India, there are 35 to 50 million crypto users. So we hope that the bull run will bring in a lot of prosperity for Indian exchanges, plus sensible regulation and taxation by the government, and that this industry will provide employment to millions of employees. It has huge potential world-wide, so everyone hopes all the countries in the G20 Summit will take India's initiative as a great start to making that potential an accessible reality for future generations.",
