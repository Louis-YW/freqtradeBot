      "body": "Yeah, I've been loading up gradually on certain tokens I wanted to buy last year but couldn't because of price. Now is the right time, that's if anyone isn't scared. Bull excites investors and makes discussions noisy while bear scares them and keeps everyone in hushed tone. Only a few keep to what Warren Buffett says about buying when others are scared. That's the situation now. Instead of people to buy or DCA their investments, they're scared.",

I have accumulated a few top coins though it is down from the buy price. But still, I am holding and moved to Ledger for long holding. What about you? Have you filled your bags? Or just watching and waiting for more dips? Yes, it's a best time to fill in our wallets with good coins like bitcoin, ETH, BNB, ADA etc. Also, I am not waiting for more dips. Ups and downs are just a part of the crypto market and the opportunity may get lost if we wait for more dips inside the market. So it's always better to buy in small quantities over a period of time and hold them for long term. probably such holdings will eventually become my retirement fund when I look to consolidate. But only buy few top coins and don't look for any random coins because I believe we don't need 99.99% of the coins that are available in the market today. So diversify, but with a precaution and avoid unnecessary risks.",

Actually I wanted to buy more but my funds were already been bought many alts and waiting to get back again my funds. When the market began to become more stable and recovers. I do hope this bear period wouldnt last long cause it really give you a bit scared and mixed emotions. But I do believe it will recover only it will take some time.",

Or just watching and waiting for more dips? I've been doing Dollar Cost Average ever since, even though the market is it at it's peak.I've been constantly buying Bitcoin on a monthly basis. Waiting for the perfect timing to enter the market isn't working for me and for others here, that's why I stick to my plan which is to just buy Bitcoin on a monthly basis. As of now, I feel no panic, and I'm continuously accumulating Bitcoin for long term. I just hope that many investors filled their bags with not only Bitcoin but other top market cap altcoins as well .",

All bitcoin forks have made 20X - 100X, this one, because of its very small cap and much better technology should do better.I have Bitgesell (BGL) from winning a lottery campaign held on this forum, I think this Bitgesell is a crypto that will be difficult to develop. The reason is, there is no crypto with a Store of Value that develops other than Bitcoin itself. Bitgesell does not have utilities like other mainstream coins, such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Coin and others. I'm also not afraid if the price of this coin suddenly goes up a lot, because at least I have some Bitgesell (BGL) that I hold.",

And in the current situation, I see no prospects for a new rise in prices. Hamsters should fix their losses and become disillusioned with the crypto market. You can start shopping a little, but I plan to think about it when the price of Bitcoin approaches $20,000 and Ethereum to $1,300.",

Due to the so many uncertainties in the crypto market and i think if this will become a very big decision if someone think to go all in at the current price, the price of bitcoin can be dumped even deeper than before. Im still taking some price level as a way to get into the market. I know that if i shall decrease the risk by investing in the crypto right now. Waiting for a bullish signal to come soon.",

You should buy if you have extra funds, you know how cryptomarket works, after this dump the price will start to recover and if you don't want to regret anything, better to start buying small amount now because that is the best thing that you can do on a bear market.",
