  "content": "This news is already circulating and reliable sources are telling that the undisputed lightweight champion Devin Haney already agreed to move up in weight to challenge super-lightweight champion Regis Prograis this coming October 28 in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is another big fight coming up and the young Devin Haney finally gets his wish to move up since there were issues already in the past that he is killing himself to make the lightweight weight. He will be tested against the 2-time champion and heavy-handed Regis Prograis.There is a lot of drama in Haney's situation though as most fans and even the stats are saying Vassily Lomachenko beats him and deserves an immediate rematch. There's also the WBC's mandatory for him to face 2 division champion, Shakur Stevenson. And lastly, Top Rank's offer for Haney to face the biggest name at the junior welterweight, the lineal and WBO champion Teofimo Lopez. More updates soon if Haney will be stripped of his belts at 135 as he wanted to keep them while testing the waters at super lightweight.",

      "body": "With this news, it would mean Shakur and Loma have a decent chance of happening. Haney moving up seems to be the right decision; his body structure is capable of battling in the higher weight class, and I really think his chance of winning is high.After witnessing one of the biggest fights today, we will soon witness Haney trying to challenge Prograis and steal the belt. This is a good move for him, so people will stop talking about the rematch against Loma due to the controversial decision.The present champion, Regis Prograis, has an impressive record as well. Although he is not an undefeated boxer, his KO rate is high—24 out of 29 fights, which is equivalent to an 82.7% KO rate. I hope he will be as quick as Haney so he will be able to hit him and use that high KO rate to his advantage. Regis Prograis record.",

This would be a big challenge for Devin considering his fight against Loma who goes up to 135, practically a smaller fighter but almost defeated Devin. It was a robbery and the majority agreed with this claim. But I think Devin made a good decision to move up since he is at risk in both weight classes. It's Either Shakur or Prograis so he chose Prograis.",

Moreover, we should not forget the fact too where Lomachenko revealed some of his weaknesses on their recent fight and some are even going to argue that Loma won that fight.",

This fight reminds me of Shakur Stevenson and Oscar Valdez, a counterpuncher versus a power puncher but those heavy hands could damage nothing if it hits nothing.

But I think Regis is underrated, so I will give him some chance to pull a upset against Haney. Although Haney is in his prime, and so is Regis, and he has a tough lost against Taylor years ago.But I think Regis will give a interesting and very competitive fight for Haney here. I think this could go on the judges score card and could be a very close decision, could be a split decision for Haney, but I wouldn't be surprised if Prograis do enough to pull an upset.",

Maybe he is also quick, but not as smart as Mayweather. Eventually, he will face a boxer who could exploit his weaknesses, resulting in his first loss. Regis Prograis could be that opponent if he manages to land hits on Haney or if Haney decides to go toe to toe. That might be the only time we see Haney in trouble.Regis Prograis is a champion who isn't as popular as Haney, so most likely Haney will secure another win here. However, as a fan, it would be nice to see an entertaining fight because that's the only way we, as fans, will be fulfilled.",

In this case, it was Haney who is going up in rank and to be honest, I think Haney's body is more of a 140 lbs - even welterweight of 147 lbs.However, we know how defensive Haney is, and if Prograis try to be the aggressor, I think it will be like Haney against Kambosos. Wherein Haney will have the upper hand as he will do the counter all night long. The only chance that Prograis is to hit Haney flush to win by ko as Haney doesn't have a good chin to begin with.",

Matchroom and DAZN though are keen on getting Haney back into their side while I highly doubt PBC will allow someone to beat their champion who's been loyal to them for many years.Money-wise and legacy-wise though, Top Rank's offer for Haney to face the lineal champion Teofimo Lopez (The Ring & WBO) is the best choice. Either Haney is mad at Bob Arum or he just wants to get rid of the biggest names of 135 and 140 like Lomachenko, Shakur, Teofimo, etc. who are all under Top Rank.Somehow, I want Regis Prograis to land his heavy hands-on Haney and score an upset. This is better for boxing rather than young Haney who already ducked a Loma rematch, a mandatory from Shakur and Top Rank's best offer for him to face the lineal 140 champion Teofimo Lopez.",

There is a big difference between a good puncher and a hard/strong puncher. The expertise of a fighter lies not in putting 100% power behind his punches because that is going to throw him off balance and also might potentially screw up his defensive position.I don’t have any problem with a fighter being aggressive or defensive. We have seen aggressive fighter like Mike Tyson being one of the best at that time and we have also seen Floyd Mayweather who is definitely quite defensive to be one of the best in this era as well.I think the fighters also have to remember that the Challenger must do well to claim the win. If there is a chance of the fight being almost even equal, the Challenger is not going to get the win. Because in most cases, the Challenger does not get the benefit of the doubt.",

I don't think that in the first place Haney is interested to make the fans entertained because if he will do that, that might be his first loss in his professional career because he is not that kind of boxer that can entertain the audience by doing something out of his character. He is only there to win and nothing else, after that, fame and money will follow because that is the most important factors in this day of age. Boxers will try to destroy him because of his position now but that is not an easy job to do.",

Do you guys want to see Devin Haney lose or do you just believe that Regis lands his powerful punches? I am bored with Haney's fighting style and he is supposed to lose against Loma. Now he is avoiding a Loma rematch, avoided his mandatory on Shakur, and avoided the real lineal champ at 140, Teofimo Lopez.Regis had a bad night in his last fight and if he performs the same way again, Haney will have an easy time outboxing him. Still, I believe Regis knows he needs to perform better this time. I won't be surprised if he hits Haney with his signature awkward but powerful punches, this is the only way to beat Haney. If he cannot hurt Haney then he will lose his belt.Hahaha. I remember that you call Haney an email champion, don't know the reason why but seems you don't like him or his fighting style.Of the three (Prograis, Loma and Shakur), it is Prograis for me is the weakest and beatable, maybe that's the reason why they took this fight. This could be a clinching feast for Haney to avoid those awkward punches that Prograis may threw. If Regis could not knockout Haney, he will lose in points as Haney may outpoints him through his jabs. Jab, jab and clinch, Haney's game plan lol.I've read an article that Shakur and Loma are mandated by the WBC to fight for the championship belt so this means that Haney is being strip of this version of this belt.",

Do you guys want to see Devin Haney lose or do you just believe that Regis lands his powerful punches? I guess fans wanted to see Haney fight, he had established himself as sort of Floyd Mayweather now. He is love but at the same time, many fans wanted him to lose and getting knockout, and as you have said, his fighting style is bored and that fans view that Loma won against him.Quote from: inthelongrun on August 07, 2023, 04:47:18 AMRegis had a bad night in his last fight and if he performs the same way again, Haney will have an easy time outboxing him.

So if by chance one bombs land on Haney's chin, then maybe he will have a good chance to beat and let Haney taste the canvass for good. And Haney is technical, if he fought a awkward style like Regis has, it won't be that effective.",
