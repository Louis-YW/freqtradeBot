  "content": "The guy claims to be a Scam Purifier when he is a scammer himself.Created multi Telegram accounts claiming to be different person and joined our Stake translators team as translator & reviewer (when he knew it was forbidden for the same person to take both positions).As he joined the team due to another translators team manager recommendation we would never imagine the things he was doing in our back.. till a few weeks ago when I started to pay attention to some details. The first thing I noticed is that \"both of them\" used to message me with weekly reports with 1 to 2 mins difference. All ok with that if you take in consideration that \"both\" live in the same country, right? Then I noticed that the week one would forget to send the report, the other would not send it too.. and a few more things that I wont even waste my time to detail here (and to prevent him from knowing the things he should improve before scamming someone else).A few days ago while talking to our advanced Support team they confirmed that both his Stake accounts (the one he used as translator and the one he used as reviewer) were using the same address to withdraw the payment.. and, one more time, he tried to pretend that \"they\" were not the same person. He, then, started with excuses saying that one was helping the other with withdraw issues caused by a block in his exchange (which, lets be honest, sounds at least a bit odd as there are plenty of exchanges he could use himself)As translator he may even be ok but definitely not someone to be trusted.As Stake Translators Team Manager I would never recommend his services to anyone.Bitcointalk Acccounts: Black_Gloves & Crypto KoreaTelegram Accounts related: icoblog, Blackglove2, armyoftr and only God knows how many moreI have to say that I was reluctant about creating this topic & even about leaving him negative trust on forum as I like to believe that people can learn from their mistakes but after he messaged me yesterday morning with a 3rd account (armyoftr) to check if we (Stake Translators Team) were not in need of any translator for the team, I noticed that it could be him.. scrolled back our old chats but somehow his Bitcointalk username disappeared from the chat history.. for his bad luck I remember talking to efialtis, back to Sep/2021, about the Native Translations guy that messaged me offering his \"translators team\" to provide us some kind of service and guess what? His \"Crypto Korea\" Bitcointalk account was still thereNote: Telegram account \"Native Translatios\" (@armyoftr) claims not to be \"Crypto Korea\" but stopped replying when I asked for him then to send me his Bitcointalk accountThis was when I asked for the translators team members to send their Bitcointalk account, a few days ago.. and his response (so you can see that the profile link is exactly the same as mentioned in the chat with efialtis, back to 2021)",

It is good dear Caroll that you created this topic for project owners & Bounty managers to refrain from hiring him. Whoever cheats and uses illegal ways to make money does not deserve our sympathy and deserves negative trust.Quote from: rat03gopoh on March 14, 2023, 10:05:45 AMAnd guess who until now recommended this fake translator. This was an old list of translators that Mr. Irfan published in 2020, as you can see there are many in the list who are left and inactive, fortunately, an update will be made soon by the OP, and he will remove Crypto Korea from the list as soon as possible because he does not deserve this recommendation because of his cheating.",

I think one translator is enough for one language.Well, beside being translators team manager, I've been Portuguese translator for almost a decade and the most important thing I learned from this is that 2 pairs of eyes can see things that only one may not be able to. I can assure that my Portuguese translations were always in the top of the languages we offer at Stake, I never had a single report about mistranslation, typo or so but once I could get a reviewer I knew I could trust, he started to see a lot of improvements that I was not able to see myself.. and thats not because I am a bad translator, I have been Portuguese teacher for a couple years, the fact is that when we are used to do the same thing every single day it may happen for us not to be able to see in a first moment that a single word change could make the entire sentence looks much better... and thats why we always use a reviewer, not only to fix possible issues but to help to improve our translations.Quote from: yhiaali3 on March 18, 2023, 09:33:30 AMAnother question, is it permissible for the same person to translate two languages, for example, Korean + Spanish? Or is only one language allowed?It depends much.. some translators team will accept you to do the translations in any language you are able to speak but as for our team, you are only able to provide translations for your mother language",
