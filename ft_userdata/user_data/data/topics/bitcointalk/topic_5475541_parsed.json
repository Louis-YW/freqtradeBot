Well bitcoin might go there but the valuation is too high maybe a $100k would be a perfect prediction to that and 10k for eth and as is for bnb. Most projects could be a game changer and other alts in the list might go as well provided that these three first will do the prediction figure and any tokens will follow suit.",

The issue with sol is that its ATH was heavily manipulated by FTX so right now its real price is reflecting in the market. Also there will be a massive token unlock schedule in the next year i think which is owned by FTX. So it is also possible that FTX will sell off those tokens to compensate their customers which will put massive selling pressure on them. Dot is having the same scenario that it also has massive token unlock schedule and DOT also lose its hype from the market as well.",

Doge and XRP are difficult to reach the target while it's easier for BNB, Solana and Matic. The target for BTC, ETH and ADA would depend on how the market moves. We are already at the start of the bull run it's the first few steps that are modest. Every bull had made a much larger all time high for all these coins and the price targets for most are just about twice or thrice of the last bull. Bitcoin was about 70K, the double would be 140K, Solana was $250.So, they are attainable but they should be your last targets as it's better to sell on slabs not to miss a shorter bull.",

BNB is the same way. Hopefully the CZ problem will be resolved quickly so that there will be no more sentiment of investor fear that Binance will collapse, hopefully this never happens, and BNB will touch a new ath again.",

But if they're not, my recommendation is ETH and BNB or XRP because these are the most controversial altcoins right due to their beep with the SEC and so far they are staying positive throughout their battle and investors are temporarily avoiding them nowadays and with that, it creates a chance for us to buy them at their lowest price right now.",

In the order of profitability and reliability, i think that the crypto coins that you mentioned, starting from bitcoin, at the top, ETH and BNB, are more likely to reach the price Target projected by the OP. There is no limiting bitcoin, to cross $1000 mark, because of the high trust level that investors have about it's coming bull run, a lot of investments are going to pour in, to pump up the price. Then for top altcoins ETH and BNB, bitcoin bull run, will also impact their demands, that will see them increase significantly. Hopefully CZ resignation as binance CEO, will not affect BNB bull run, and increase in it's value, because if it does, then it'll be a shame to have a top altcoins, go under.",

Investors that supported them are out and some of them might be invested in something else so it will be a long shot for XRP to reach your number. Then there's BNB, a big issue happened recently about CZ so this could somehow ruin the reputation of Binance coin when it comes to investments. However, I still believe it will move up because the usage is still high but not to that extent in 2025. Bitcoin most probably has a higher chance of reaching the amount that you said because of the Spot ETF that is being applied and maybe near the approval of the SEC. Ethereum will do the same and it will boost the value of it. Just watching its market now can tell that it will just keep on moving up even without ETF just yet. Dogecoin, I am negative on that too. Investors are more wiser now in my opinion after the chaos with FTX. They will want something that has a project that will back up their coin. The other coins, I have no idea how their market will move.",

The market prices of crypto are not consistently increasing which could make it or not, or whether how long would it take to be achieved. So what's your move as an investor? Simply hold still if you are capable to so. If you don't have yours then at least find a good entry point then do the same thing which is to sell once you're okay already.
