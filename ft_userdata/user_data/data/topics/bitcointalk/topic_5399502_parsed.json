  "content": "I'm actually part of the developers community, an independent developer for that matter. My works have been copied by several companies(not sure if they will agree) , and have actually benefitted the cryptocurrency space but I have received nothing in return even though I have never asked for anything in return. I just do this for free especially due to my beliefs.Now I have made claims that sound outrageous but no one so far has been able to prove them wrong, for example on how certain kind of posts can influence the price of Bitcoin... well anyone who has been observing will notice this is true with my posts. Â Not just this, your business will most likely succeed beyond your expectations if it is a good business and you follow my advice for the business. I personally will have the business in my thoughts and prayers to see that it succeed. All you need to do is to believe. You may ask, if what I claim are true, why do I not own a business and make money from it, well making money is not part of my role, most of my current jobs are done for free, I don't demand for reward and that is basically how priests are suppose to operate. How you can sponsor me in a risk free manner:  if my claims about Bitcoin price are true, you can donate to my Bitcoin address which will be provided once I find a sponsor... Afterall when price increase according to my forecasts/predictions(which are precised) you also benefit. Or you can also rent my signature space to advertise your good/moral company. Deal?",

It's clear to me, everyone wants to earn money first of all, and whether their work will get further development or not, they care about it second of all. The project is very difficult to understand, you can't solve it alone, so you need a team capable of implementing it. Try to delve into the essence of the idea, not many have succeeded, maybe your work will help to move the dead stone in solving this issue with God and your help.",

You proved to be unable to do anything, or at least anything good because since your \"intervention\" the price dumped from 32k to 26k two days later.

      "body": "@ Stompix, Just noticing your post since I created this thread and I'm still surprised how you hastily posted as a high ranking member without thoroughly going through my thread or what you quoted as proof I'm unable to do anything or that my predictions are wrong. I am really surprised this post got merited My friend, I did nothing after the comment (the first bolded comment below) as we did not agree on moving the price up. Read the thread again or ask the person who quoted it first to tell you how it went. Here is the thread you got that from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396744.msg60092809#msg60092809In regards to the last bolded comment, the price did actually move that Thursday and it was the biggest price movements of that week Quote from: stompix on June 02, 2022, 02:53:36 PMQuote from: Ucy on May 20, 2022, 12:23:17 PMNow I have made claims that sound outrageous but no one so far has been able to prove them wrong, for example on how certain kind of posts can influence the price of Bitcoin... well anyone who has been observing will notice this is true with my posts.

      "body": "What about those claims that you will move the price to at least $25k and even up to $40k? You didn't do anything for 2 weeks, and then you brag that it's your credit that the price reached almost $25k a month after your announcement?Quote from: Ucy on July 01, 2022, 05:11:46 PMSomething I have decided to do Have decided to move it up to $25 000 to 40,000 in 1 to 2 weeks time. I'm doing this without expecting reward from the work of moving it up. The current price of Bitcoin is about $19,500 is archived: https://archive.fo/0aVIp Â Date: Friday July 1st 2022I will move the resistance to $40,000... And I may stop supporting the price at $25 000 to 40,000 level if people still do not appreciate. Quote from: Ucy on August 02, 2022, 10:19:35 AMWe ended the week on Saturday 30th July 2022 and achieved a high of about $24,600 on that day, that is approximately $25,000.... Price varies on different exchanges/platforms.... But the least price I have seen so far is about 24,500 on coinmarketcap.Â  Â Well, that was achieved despite the massive fud within the period of 14th to 30th July 2022.The next plan is to move it up further, depending on how much time I have. If I leave it at this price, it will most likely collapse back to below $19500. You need stronger hand to support and move the price upAs I already wrote, you are only speculating and hoping to guess in which direction the price will go, and then you take the credit. When the price does not go in your favor, you blame the people who do not support you. You dance on a very fine line until someone seriously flags and tags you for what you do...",
