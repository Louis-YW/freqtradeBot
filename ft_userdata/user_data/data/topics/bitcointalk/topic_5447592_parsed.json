Trying to convince someone over something that the person did not want isn't right most especially when it's all about Bitcoin, don't force anyone to it, just explain to them what the technology is all about and then let them be, there is no point in convincing them that Bitcoin is the right choice, because if any mistake of investment is being made in the near future, you who convince them will be the one to be hold responsible.",

If you try forcing them and they are not giving you listening ears,just leave them alone so that they don't blame you tomorrow if anything happens to their investment, or if the price dump below what they bought, you might become an enemy. Moreover bitcoin knowledge is what one will show interest on before he/she will take it serious,if not you are wasting your time. It is better you do something else with your time instead of trying to make people feel uncomfortable with trying to teach them about bitcoin. A sceptical person will never learn what he doesn't believe in. A open minded person will love to learn something new.",

Additionally, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, which means that it is not subject to the control of any government or financial institution. This makes it a safe-haven asset in times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a scarce asset, with a limited supply of 21 million coins, which makes it an attractive option for those looking for a store of value or long-term investment.",

It's much easier to convince those who don't yet have a hard opinion on Bitcoin, and then when Bitcoin achieved big enough adoption, many skeptics will flip on their own. But some will remain skeptical no matter what, that's just the reality of life, some people are very stubborn. There are people who don't use Internet and smartphones even today.",

Because these kinds of people are usually wasting time because they have an attitude of not easily believing.  Because when dealing with a skeptical person, it's important to listen to their concerns and address them with accurate information.  Be patient and understanding, and avoid being overly pushy or aggressive in trying to convince them.  Respect their decision and not pressure them into investing in something they're not comfortable with.",

So it's better not to at this point, it's all over the headlines though, by now majority could have heard about it in news and social media and other means. It's really up to this individuals to invest or try it out, if not then we can't do anything about it. Yes, we wanted to help everyone to get over with the current economic issues that a individual may have been experiencing. But you can't help everyone here and maybe they have their own opinion already on BTC and that they have close their minds on it. So no amount of convincing will change their close mindset.",

It doesn't have the abusive rulers who got all the powers in their hands as far as money is concerned. Bitcoin is ruled by codes that are etched in stone, that can't easily be tweaked in whichever direction the greedy fiat gods think of. The same decentralized feature means it doesn't have a CEO or a president to kill, a headquarters to raid or burn, central server to seize, and so on and so forth, which government agencies are fond of doing to anything in their way. But if a skeptical person isn't convinced of this, try telling him/her the real situation of fiat and banks and governments and how ludicrous the monetary system actually is. If he/she is still skeptical, it might help mentioning to him/her that the likes of Elon Musk, Ray Dalio, Tim Draper, Jack Dorsey, Robert Kiyosaki, Tim Cook, and many others also own Bitcoin. If he/she isn't convinced of Bitcoin, perhaps these influential personalities, one of which he/she might idolize, have found something.",

Or do you need a couple dozen more answers. Not just with Bitcoin, in money matters let people be wrong for themselves. Giving advice or trying to convince someone usually results in if it goes right they won't even thank you and if it goes wrong they will throw it in your face.Better if you lock the thread.",
