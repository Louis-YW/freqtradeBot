Although it will certainly involve transaction fees, it is better and we can feel safe keeping an eye on our assets in our private wallets. Trezor and Ledger are an option for users but some users prefer other wallets which may cost nothing to buy.

With DApp you don't have to pass through the hassles of KYC which centralized exchanges demand. It is a good idea so that we can reduce the transaction fees for sending those assets to the exchange even though when we use the DApp, we will also get fees that may be higher than the exchange but that can reduce any worries. DApp is a solution for those who don't want to verify overly complicated exchanges and we can also store all assets there while waiting for the price to increase again.",

I am sure that an American would not care about that or even save that much during high school by working on McDonalds, but that is not how rest of the world feels.",
