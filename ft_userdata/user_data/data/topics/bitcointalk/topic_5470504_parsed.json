(I don't found any discussion related to that number)Well you are almost right but we can't be sure how theymos is treating it... what I mean is, when you select \"Always stay logged in\" a session cookie is generated with 1 year expiry date and on every request your session cookie gets refreshed for one year again.  So logically speaking it stays \"Always logged in\" until you keep visiting bitcointalk at least once a year. But for sure if you don't login for one year then your session cookie will expire and \"your always login option\" will not work and you have to login again.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on October 16, 2023, 08:22:17 AMWhere is 3153600?

Don't mind, but if you check the first person (mitmivan) he registered on this forum at July 24, 2018, 11:47:15 AM. And if you convert those days, he have logged in for, in years, then it becomes around 63.56 years. But it has been registered for only 5 years. I don't know if the stats you have mentioned are wrong (but they are of course, not made by you instead by forum). Well, I am trying to think, how or in what manner, that member have spent his time of 5 years that would be tracked as 63 years by the forum. I didn't find a way.

Most of the members even haven't spend 6 years on the forum and I believe that it would be really difficult task for someone to use their same computer with same settings for 6 years. I'm a person who renews his operating system every 6 months or less and I login once again and check that \"Always stay logged\" option again.I'm quite sure that most of the users does that because that's needed for the security of the system. There may be very few users who have been logged in a system for more than 6 years in fact I think there might be no such users. That option allow us to stay logged in for many days and that's enough for most of us. I have not been logged out for many days and when I get logged out it's simple to login again.",

It would seem like a big oversight at first glance, but there are a bunch of similar mistakes in other contexts over the internet (i.e. this cisco documentation references the number of seconds in a year being both 3153600 and 31536000). Sounds silly, but yet (*).(*) It wouldn’t account for the term always_logged_in being limited to a year, but perhaps it does seem like a forever value from a login perspective.",
