As obviously we can't always follow you on like betting in a black jack or any card games.And as @robelneo said, majority of gamblers whether offline or online just like to let everyone knows of their big wins.But on the other hand, they might have lost more than they win in their gambling activities.",

You've understood and stopped at the right point, if not in the upcoming bets you might've lost. We don't know what would be the outcome in the next bets, which means you're not in a situation to give assurance on win. So, it is good that you won and that doesn't mean you an expert to be followed.Maybe you can make some series wins and post it with the statistics of your entire gambling activities. This could let people know your wins and losses which is a must to decide whether to follow your bets or not.",

I have seen many gamblers complaining about there bet especially on blackjack but you are so confident and I hope we are going to see more of your impressive results soon. This is why gambling is all about consistency because we may not know when we are going to hit a jackpot that is going to give us a big winning.",

At least he posted a disclaimer that he is not an expert so that he's followers will not expect huge to him while betting nor even following what he do on stake. @OP this is great win a fast one imagine in 1 minute you made that but anyways that's not gonna happen always since even you are good playing blackjack winning will not only come but at least you enjoy the game and that add up the entertainment factor you can brought to your follower on your youtube channel.",

I never had luck on Blackjack, honestly.I must say that you are free to gamble and publish on youtube and any other social media any content you want. But it is obvious, no one can always win on any online casino.If you only are going to share your wins then a disclaimer should be added on your channel, so some users won't believe you are a dishonest person.Or you could also add a small section in your channel dedicated to your losses taking a format of short video-blogs. At least, that is something I would do, for the sake of being honest to my viewers.Good luck!",

I mean casinos were able to figure out that using multiple decks would counter card counting, I hardly doubt they wouldn't implement it online where it's also really easy to implement. Anw grats to op, wouldn't really say that this is a rare case, there are probably a lot of instances out there that are pretty much the same as op. I reckon anyone can win $500 in a minute if they really wanted to, especially in cases of videos, they just have to record a good run and not the entirety of it. I'd say I'd follow a person more if they posted both wins and losses, like what @robelneo said. Now that dictates how much of a good (and lucky) gambler you really are.",

You won only 250$ since the other half is your bet. Also there’s nothing new here because many streamers is playing on Stake and betting max bet on the table.Watching 250$ spread on 7 seats is not amusing. You should improve too your video quality if you want to get more views because your cp to laptop video has a very poor video quality. You should use screen record app on your laptop instead of manually filming it using your phone.",

Usually, the ambition to achieve more than that is the only option for aggressive gamblers who don't know when to leave the casino. Btw, you are not beating the house at all with just $500, believe me the casino house has got more profit than you thought.",

One thing is for sure, beating the house will be a large task so you will need a lot of luck for that to happen.
