Rather than setting the political escenario for peace, both sides have decided to escalate this situation, resulting in the unnecessary lost of life and even kidnappings by the Hamas forces conquering parts of Israel.I expect Israel taking control of the situation eventually and retaliate on Gaza strip even harsher. It is an never ending cycle.",

If Israel comes out of them, then the solution will be there. There is no need to take sides Leave the rights as much, or it won't end and shouldn't end.What can I say about the common people? Israel attacks and kills the common people whenever it wants It would have been different if Hamas had attacked Israel by force. In fact, Hamas defended itself.The last thing is that the common people should sit down and discuss among themselves, but if Israel does not give them back their space or freedom or rights, there is no point in negotiating, forcing something It cannot be kept at a price, it turns out to be a snake tomorrow, this is proof that torture of civilians should be stopped.",

However, when Hamas massacred Israelis yesterday, you can't just be shouting peace! It doesn't work. World leaders should condemn Hamas, and drag them to court. But that won't happen so Israel will counterattack Hamas with way more gun power.Peace will come if Hamas/Palestine realizes that they already lost the war a long time ago. Time to move on without poking Bees' nest. Now is like a slap battle between a kid, and a huge muscular man. I won't be surprised if there is no Gaza after this war. It's sad, but it's the reality.",

This is a fight that started several decades ago and yet kept on after sometime. The peace talks in the UN security council just held recently has failed and both parties don't seem to have reached an agreement to stop. I see more escalation of the fight and some countries to join, at the moment Iran has been figured to be supporting Palestine even though they have not come open to show their support. Russia is already in the side of Palestine while US have been longtime friends with Israel, so this war is sort of bringing different blocs of interest in it, hope this won't begin the third world war.",

So let's allow them to dig it out with one another in this war so that the next time, the other country would learn on how not to attack first and seek for lasting peace. It is not today that people around the globe have been seeking for peace to happen between the people for Israel and Palestine. They choose not to be at peace with one another.

But just because we do not see a peaceful solution to this conflict, does not mean we are supposed to give up on peace for both sides. It is obvious that there are some factions in Israel which seek to occupy and possibly annex Gaza for themselves, but Hamas is doing nothing to help Palestine to reach a peaceful outcome to get their territory recognized, have access to food, medicine and water. There are violations of the international laws being committed by both sides and yet, some people seem not to even care for the civilians who are just collateral damage for the leaders of Hamas and the Israel government.",

It's quite shocking to see Israel didn't bother to ask for the return of the kidnapped people but they just dropped huge bombs on Palestine. Sure their missiles also killed the non-Hamas men. Normally, a negotiator will first respond but they went ahead launching missiles. It sends a message that this is an eye for an eye which makes the whole world blind.  But this war didnot start last Saturday morning when Hamas attacked, this war started a long time ago with a conflict. Just like the conflict between Iran and Saudi that started a thousand years ago but just recently made a peace deal.",

Russia vs Ukraine goes way back in history, the Russians claim it's their land due to \"history\", it's up to you if you don't want to compare the two conflicts but they are the same, you have two sovereign states (Ukraine and Palestine) and two invaders (Russia and Israel) the main difference is that Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 while Israel Invaded Palestine in 1948 and they keep expanding the invasion day by day with the support of your tax money. So how is it okay for Ukraine to defend itself but it's not for Palestine? you need a truck full of hypocrisy to swallow that contradiction.QuoteBoth sides have done terrible things and war that we have now was inevitable. The Ukrainians are also doing terrible things to the Russians, so by your standards -- they shouldn't do that, they should just sit back and wait for the Russians to take their land.QuoteAnd in all these years whole Gaza was built on hate towards Israel.There is no such thing as build on hate, you need reasons to hate, seeing someone invade your country, take your land, kill your people, will automatically make you hate them, this is how life works, good luck convincing the Ukriain future generation who are yet to be born not to hate Russia.QuoteOn the other hand, people in Gaza selected Hamas terrorist to be their legitimate representatives.What is your definition of \"terrorists\" is it the killing of children? Israel has killed far more children, is it the number of buildings destroyed? Israel destroyed an order of magnitude more buildings than Hamas, so how can you call Hamas terrorists and not the Israeli army? you are comparing an invader to someone who is protecting their country, if you can't be fair and call things as they are you should at least not be a hypocrite, the least you could do is call both of them terrorists.",
