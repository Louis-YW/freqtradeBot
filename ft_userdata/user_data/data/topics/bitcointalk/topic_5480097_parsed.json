You can easily find new projects if you intend to invest in altcoins. There are always emerging projects in the altcoin space that most people invest in with the projection of making a quick profit. Don't be deceived by the name of some projects such as Bitcoin Cash and others, Bitcoin has no alternative project. Ensure you do your research before venturing into any new projects because many scam projects are springing up every day. Or you can decide to buy or invest in only Bitcoin.",

Listen to what Ordinals developers like Udi and Casey Rodarmor have said. They said that they wanted to make \"Bitcoin fun again\". THAT shows they don't care about bringing the network forward, they merely want to build something like memecoins.QuoteBitcoin does not have trends like other networks which are focused on profits and finding new ways to attract investors.

Or you can decide to buy or invest in only Bitcoin.   That's true, talking about emerging trends or projects, that is common with altcoins, Bitcoin is strictly focused on building more on what has already been laid foundation on, their could be some newly introduced development under Bitcoin improvement proposals and you can get full details of them here on the technical boards or at GitHub, but when referring to projects, ordinals is not regarded as such to me because it's not under Bitcoin protocols but the network included it due to available block space and it's something entirely different from Bitcoin itself, altcoins have much of these developments and newly introduced projects, you can often visit the altcoins section to get more details.",
