For example that the wagering requirements have not been reached and that is why it does not allow you to withdraw, although the normal thing would be that the withdrawal option is there, and that when withdrawing you get the message that you cannot withdraw because the wagering requirements have not been reached. But being 1xBit, or 1xCrap, as I like to call them, I am not surprised. In the forum we have done what we could, as Eternad says, what makes me feel bad is that constantly new people fall into the trap.",

They hate winners on their casino. Their main goal is for you to send money so that you lose but once you win, that's when they start stating that you violated certain terms and conditions, and they ban you even when you did not violate anything. What is funny is that in most cases they won't even clearly state the terms you violated and how you violated them.",

It allows them and other online gaming/betting websites to simply invoke their ToS whenever they like in order to scam any user they want. In most cases they do not even feel obliged to show evidence of wrongdoing and it would not matter to them what evidence was sent by victims because it would be dismissed as the intention was/is to scam.1xbit does have longevity but eventually it will fade away in to obscurity.

It's sad by the way. That's right. Even theymos made the mistake of selling them some advertising space on Bitcointalk a while back, but changed his mind after the community informed him about the reputation 1xBit has here. That means they have plenty of money to throw away to get greater exposure and visibility. They even had their ads up on Blockchair and maybe some other blockchain explorers. I don't see them right now, but they were there. @Bradtl Lua You should at least contact their support and ask them why you aren't allowed to withdraw to see what excuse they come up with.I don't know how the site works, but is it possible that you have to enable or add a coin for withdrawals somewhere in your settings or profile. I have come across some sites that work like that.",

When it's a Crypto gambling site then 100% they are taking the opportunity to keep everything behind open place. However if a casino wants then they can make their users betting history and other reports public, not showing the full username but hiding out the some characters. It sounds very transparent but if a casino have bad intention in mind they still can change the data to create a fake reputation.But it does not make sense that when a casino is in profit then why will they think of not paying their users. An unsatisfied customer can spread the bad experience to 10, from 10 it become 100. Eventually casino is losing their clients. Considering the reputation 1xbit has now, I have no idea why even they consider the forum for their advertising place? I do not think they are not in profit or they would not be able to spend millions in so many advertising platforms.",
