You need to start slow, if you want to trade then just spot trade for at least a year, and then once you have confirmed you have what it is necessary to become a good trader you could consider this question again, but even then I would think it would be too soon.",

Because the only one I know of that has future trading is Binance. I'm just not aware of other exchanges that have future trading. Now, if you are just a beginner in the cryptocurrency industry and are just getting into crypto trading, it is better to start with spot trading rather than future trading. Don't rush yourself with such activities in future trading because you might just get confused at the beginning. Especially if you don't have enough knowledge about it or don't have an idea, it will really come out that what you are doing is too risky.But if you know yourself that you have enough ideas and knowledge, you can try that even if you are new to this forum.",

Many had lost thier capital even before they make a few future trades without knowledge. Its liquidated without them knowing how it happen because they are new to trading.  Its recommended to stay on spot market and gradually learn why the market goes up and down and then learn a few indicators that you could use. And  then only try futures when you are confident enough and have lots of money that you wouldn't mind losing.",

If you don't know how to leverage in the first place, then how can you put yourself in a speculative position in the first place? It will mean disaster for you in very short time. And others have said that you also needed the skills (risk mitigation etc.) that you can only acquire through years and years of experience in crypto trading.",

With margin trading your leverage is much less and spot trading is basically 1:1.So all in all you can lose all your money in all 3 different methods but the futures one you can just lose it faster if you use more leverage. So if you don’t know what you are doing you shouldn’t use any of the trading methods and just trade demo for now.",

I have been trading derivatives many months ago and I will advice you to do these if you want to start:use the amount of money that is far below an amount you can afford to lose to trainalways you the amount you can afford to lose to trade after learning do not trade shit coins. Like me, I only open BTC/USDT long or short position use low leverage, 3x or lower leverage is betterlearn how to use indicator do not be greedyMany traders always set stop loss and take profit which often help them. Future trading is highly risky. Learn indicators like Bollinger Bands and RSI. I remember a time I always lose, it was because of the coin I was using that contributed more to the loss, a shit coin can turn a good trader to a poor trader.",

At least you should read and comment if anything is confusing or you don't think it's clear.It's natural when the exchange warns that futures trades are risky especially for new traders who have very little knowledge of futures trades, don't try if you are still very knowledgeable it's better to try spot trades while continuing to learn a lot in trading.",

If you are just learning how to trade, I suggest to trade long for now and it can help you become more profitable especially if you are still don’t know where to trade and how to trade properly. Trading is not easy at all, it may take a lot of time before you understand it but don’t give up because trading is very rewarding as well.",

And of course you have to do a candlestick analysis as well as the basis for the decision of each of your entries (not random entries that rely on luck). Then evaluate your trading results.If you think with that result you are ready with futures, then do it with small cap first and the lowest leverage.",

I was one of the hardheaded beginners before thinking that I can do future trading successfully for the first time but I ended up losing a lot. It's only for experienced traders. You can still do it but you need time to study and do research about it. As a newbie, it's normal to feel curious about the opportunities that crypto could offer but you should also have the eagerness to learn and take easy steps for you to do things the right way.",
