  "content": "Is Bitcoin a scam It's  so funny  that at this stage and century , some people still believe that Bitcoin  is a scam after it has proven itself  over and over  which has led to it's massive adoption.If anyone still thinks Bitcoin  is a scam and depending only on fiat currencies then he or she is a slave to fiat system and believe  it or not Fiat is brain rot.There are so many things these peoples  must understand  to know why they are really  a slave to the fiat system. Decentralized  nature This is the major difference between  fiat and the bitcoin,  there's  no influence or control from authority  like government , no manipulation in transactions  or values everything done in bitcoin is transparency  as full  nodes could be run by anyone,anywhere anytime without hidderance  and this a way for showing every transaction on blockchain making double-spend bitcoins impossible. In fiat everyone is subjected to the power of governmentand its agencies,  the supply ,circulation are always influenced by their Monetary  policies. SupplyBitcoin  has a specific fixed supply of 21M coin which will ensure protection against  every  from of devaluation , beside there's  a smaller  unit that can be used in btc(sats) incase of any form of scarcity and scarcity brings  about increase in price , bitcoin price is also determined by the demand and supply in the market.On the other hand, fiat currencies can be printed at will by the government  and the supply will still be determined  by that single entity  which is still the government. You know what the biggest  scam is : Bitcoin  was and will never be a scam **CoinL",

Bitcoin has already proven what's in it; those who want to call it a it a Bitcoin scam don't really know how a decentralised currency works. Bitcoin wasn't created to make us rich; it was a p2p decentralised cryptocurrency to make a solution for a borderless payment system without a third party. How would Bitcoin be scammed when it wasn't controlled by anyone? Due to a lack of proper knowledge, a few people think Bitcoin is a is a scam. We aren't concerned about it.",

Please let's not find anyone who's not a fans or an adoptor of the bitcoin to be adamant to good life. Let's just say they're missing a lot of good services and potentials which bitcoin has to offer. If we get so grieving with people who're in doubt of bitcoin, there'd also be ways they'd be grieved eiths sis for not believing what they also insights about other varieties in life.Remember bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency which is non-custodian and not under control of any of the governments and the their authorities, so at the course, let's also be aware that there are not only bitcoin illiterates in the world but also illiterates to rh the digital schemes which means bitcoin is a digital currency for those in the digital world. Obviously not everyone are possible to meet up with the knowledge demands and lot of the masses feels bitcoin might not really be a scam scheme but they're in worries that whom would be questioned and hold responsible if any unwarrant transactions such as being scammed or lost of funds, who would they report to ? And who'll stand on the their behalf in getting to rh root of it?These are how curious they're about in doubt of this bitcoin and its digital technology system.",

Not necessarily a slave of the fiat system, probably because these people got swindled by a company pretending to be a Bitcoin company.  We had a lot of experiences like these in the history of cryptocurrency scams.In short, due to the short-sightedness of people and being too lazy to know the actual fact, many are misled to believe that Bitcoin is a scam especially those who idolize known people who are against Bitcoin like Warren Buffett.",

For a long period of time now we've got people who feel that by accepting Bitcoin as a scam project or a waste of financial space will just make it fizzle out or something, thereby proving their beliefs are those who find it difficult to live with the fact that in some ways it's better than the traditional fiat. There have been influential people as well who have spoken vehemently about it, trying to dissuade the public from contracting the virus which is Bitcoin so they can have a bit of control over them like a puppeteer does his puppets and are furious that Bitcoin is showing them the light, so definitely you'd hear thrash talk.If Bitcoin were a scam, I doubt that something as historic as the Bitcoin halving will always occur every four years cause it takes something that has depth to be able to achieve something as remarkable as that. Let the haters hate. Bitcoin will keep growing and surpassing beliefs till they have no option than to accept it.",

There is nothing that you can't find answers to using the internet, if people still judge something they don't understand in 2024, where internet is everywhere, then they are stupid people, i don't ever want to spend my precious time on such people, what are they using their internet for then? TIKTOK? Only fans? You can't save stupid people that don't want to be saved.In this present day of Bitcoin, if anyone still thinks that Bitcoin is a scam then nothing can change the mind of such people, its been out for way too many years already and I won't want to waste my time with such people, we are not in the 80s, everyone has a smartphone or computer this days where they can find answers about bitcoin, and if anyone still belief that its a scam, its because they don't want Bitcoin to succeed and they are mad that it's already succeeding or they are just complete ignorant beings.If this scam nonsense is coming from those tech-experienced people or popular millionaires, you shouldn't bother yourself, they are using their power to influence or manipulate some people who have trust in them, to probably try to attack the price of Bitcoin, mind you, these popular figures are also Bitcoin investors in disguises, you will be shocked what they are doing in the back.",
