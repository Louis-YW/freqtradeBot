      "body": "I know this guy too. I was amaze of his journey in trading, $359k is too much profit when your capital is only $500. I thought that it would be easy for him to trade like the win rate is 90%. But what I have observed, he also experienced many losses. But how he can manage to get that $359k? It's because he really trust of his plan and with the help of risk management. I believe that if he is not good at risk management, he will lose all his funds. So no matter what's your plan is, always include the risk management. There's no magic in trading, just trust the process.",
