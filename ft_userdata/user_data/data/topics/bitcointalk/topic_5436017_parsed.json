  "content": "HCFH is a token based on the Polygon blockchain that can mine on GPUs via a smart contract with unique tailormade PoW Plus consensus.Humans Care Foundation: House is a project of the Humans Care Foundation. Mission HCFH’s mission is to give a helping hand to the victims of humanitarian and natural disasters around the world. We believe that using innovative solutions made by HCF and drawing the attention of the global community we can create a sustainable future for everyone.Tokenomics At the stage of token generation, tokens are distributed to the main HCFH wallets. The total supply is 21,000,000 HCFH and it is divided to:«PoW Plus General Wallet» - 5,000,000 HCFH«Staking General Wallet» - 12,000,000 HCFH«Project Tokens» - 4,000,000 HCFHPoW Plus stage On the 26th of January 2023, the source code of the network became available to miners. The remuneration is set so that 5,000,000 HCFH tokens are stretched to be mined within 12 years. Block time 120 minReward per block 93 HCFHDaily reward 1 116 HCFHApproximate time of mining 4 480 daysStaking stage The Staking Share contains 12,000,000HCFH of the total supply. The emission of it is stretched for 12 years, 1,000,000 of HCFH is distributed annually so 83,333 HCFH is distributed on a monthly basis.This monthly emission is used for:Reward users who have made a donation. This loyalty program is called “Lifetime Staking”;Reward users who have staked their tokens on HCF platform. Users can stake tokens using our fixed staking program.To replenish the “HCFH Security Wallet”. To be more specific - 25% of monthlyemission goes to this wallet.Project tokens 4,000,000 HCFH are distributed to 3 wallets. Wallet addresses and information about them are posted on the official resources. These wallets are:Charity Share - 3,000,000 HCFH (75% of project tokens)The main and only purpose of this share is to be burnt after the donation is made. Operational reports on donation distribution will be published on the official resources of the project. In addition, the official resources of the platform will informationally cover the events held as part of the charitable programs.Developers share – 800,000 HCFH (20% of project tokens)This is the share that is created for developers. It may be used for rewarding them as well as spent on HCF platform maintenance and functionality development as well as scaling the HCF ecosystem. This is up to developers, this is why it’s called “Developers Share”.Activity share 200,000 HCFH (5% of project tokens)These tokens are aimed at increasing the community and the number of active users,attracting additional funding to the project and developing marketing.Donation mechanism The HCFH project connects donors and the Charity Initiatives together. A user who has made a donation becomes a Donor of the HCFH project, gets his share from monthly emission and gets his right to vote for funding a particular Charity Initiative.The amount of money for each donation is split into three portions. 70% of it is divided between all the Charity Initiatives in equal proportions. Before these funds are sent to Charity Funds - they are accumulated in the HCFH Charity Savings Wallet. All the payouts are made once every two weeks.25% of it is also held in the HCFH Savings Wallet and is a subject to vote. Users choose the Charity Initiative they emphasize most. After the voting is over - this amount is sent to the winner of voting.5% goes to “HCFH Reserve Wallet”. The name speaks for itself. When there is no time to hesitate for a specific Charity Initiative - we sponsor it. Having distributed the funds, the corresponding HCFH tokens amount is burned then. All the HCFH donors are invited to the “Lifetime Staking Loyalty Plan”.Voting system The mechanism of all donated funds' distribution as well as the tool to govern the HCF evolution is one of the key features of the platform.The main idea of donation distribution lies in each charity initiative getting part of it. Thus 70 % of accumulated funds are equally spread within them. 5% goes to the \"HCFH Emergency Wallet\" while the remaining 25% is becoming a subject to vote.All HCFH donors and token holders can vote which charity initiative on the platform should receive additional funding with 25% of all the accumulated donations as well as influence the integral decisions of the project development such as technical and fundamental updates, the implementation of joint programs with global NGOs and all sorts of issues wherea collective decision should be made.1 HCFH token gives the user 1 vote. The voting timespan is 2 weeks. As soon as it is over - the funding goes to the winner.The voting process is open and everyone can see the intermediate results in order to make their choice much smoother. Token Burning System DonationWhen the donation is made, the corresponding amount of HCFH tokens is burnt. This is made in order to reduce the amount of circulating tokens so that every single one of them has more value.
