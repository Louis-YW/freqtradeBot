Have savings and investment?There are ready-made rich people, and there are self-made rich people. The first class is privileged, while the second class might be lucky and earn it through hard work. Despite not having a level-playing ground, we should still not relax but do all within our power and environment to improve our financial condition.Quote from: MaterialMouse69 on March 11, 2023, 03:45:23 PMWhile the poor doesn't have any of those?Poverty is not good and it's a disadvantage that many have to deal with. Yet, some poor people still make it, but it will be so disastrous if poverty has infested the person's brain to the extent that they will not be able to try to make it at all.Quote from: MaterialMouse69 on March 11, 2023, 03:45:23 PMThe point is I started in low before having some savings and investment.

We should strive with hard work and pray, who knows, luck might shine on us one day and we will become rich.No one has a total excuse not to be rich!",

Can you guys share your ideas with this topic.Once you get into proper investing you start to understand the real meaning of this, and by proper investing I mean buying shares of companies actually creating tangible products or offering useful services. When you're rich, you have way more money available than you spend month to month or year to year, which means you but shares - those shares return company profits and often get reinvested to buy even more shares. This creates a massive compounding effect over time, allowing the rich to get ever richer - provided they don't spend too much.",

The rich ones continue their investment and businesses to sustain their lives while poor individuals are used to the life they are having and becoming not open to changes or betterment. But this is not to generalize. Some poir individuals are just lacking the resources to move up to their expectations. They have the drive but not the capability to start that business or to enrich a particular idea. Bottomline is how an individual seeks for something in line with his/her desires.",

Making investment without you being focused and determinant would still make one poor, set your goals and target walk and works towards them then you will became successful in Life. Note better, from the day everyone or anyone was born they didn't came with trillion dollars or even being birth with a silver spoon nor Golden spoon they were born empty and pure nakedness but their parents groom and nurture them the way they should grow possibly they were thought the secret of money on time.

Have savings and investment?You need money to make money, and the rich have access to money to make more, so they keep getting richer. The poor do not have access to money that is sufficient to find more money, so making money becomes more difficult. Money gives privileges and access to better opportunities. If you have money enough, you will be well connected with people who can offer you better opportunities since they know you are in the same financial class as them. But it does not also mean that a poor person cannot make money and become rich, he will just need to work harder and be prepared to take opportunities when they come.",

I can't deny that it really happened, because those who are rich have privileges unlike poor people. But can the rich really be like that? I don't think so, because I have heard of many rich people falling into poverty and also not a few poor people getting rich (in this case we must have different views about what rich is like). But there are advantages that many people don't realize, poor people might be ready when they get rich, and they are better prepared when they have to go bankrupt because they have experienced that. But when the rich fall into poverty, not all rich people are ready for that because they are used to living in luxury.",

But I guess that is just the way the system is set up. It is like the rich are playing a game with cheat codes, while the poor are trying to beat the game on the hardest difficulty level.",

      "body": "Quotethe rich get richer and the poor get poorerThis article[1] explains clearly why this quotation happened.  Simply said, \"The Rich operates in Abundance mode, while the Poor operates in scarcity mode. \" which is explained as:QuoteAbundance – You give more because you are already in a better position, which in return attracts more returns. And the Rich habit effect is passed on. Scarcity - You won’t give unless you are enough, but there won’t be more if you are not giving. Hence the cycle this goes on from generation to generation. We can see this in terms of how the rich setup businesses and how poor people are contented being employed. The condition also affects the belief and behavior of individual where rich people are more open hand to investment that can yield them multiple returns because they have extra money to spend while poor people even though saw an opportunity but due to lack of financial capability prioritized food to bring on their table.  Thus in terms of generating profit, rich people tends to generates several times while poor people failed to.As a result, the wealth of rich people keeps on piling up, while the wealth of poor people always get exhausted.[1] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-rich-stay-poor-stays-marcus-how#:~:text=In%20a%20simple%20explanation%3A,habit%20effect%20is%20passed%20on.",

I agreed with you about how level rich and poor as contradiction with poor don't have many option how they can build their business and if taking bank loan and get failure actually have to close their business. But there are not mistake when some one born with richest parent and many people still happy although as poor, if can't build business they can get work from the rich person, both of them connected each other and we are poor never sad about our condition because still get work from rich person.",
