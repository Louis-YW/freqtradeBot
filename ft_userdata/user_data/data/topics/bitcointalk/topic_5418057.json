It's also very different from country to country. And Bitcoin market recently reacted negatively to inflation, rather than being a hedge against it, probably because Bitcoin is more of an asset for \"good\" times rather than \"bad\" times.",

It has to be constantly rising to compensate the losses imposed on us by fiat.Unfortunatelly, that is not what we are seeing right now, but I hope as soon as the market enters a new phase bitcoin is going to compensate all the devaluations faced during the last years in the traditional fiat economy with wide advantage for holders.",

Inflation affects the buy power of dollars which makes the commodity higher in USD amount since the supply of USD is continuously increasing. BiTcoin is not directly affected by inflation since it’s value is based on speculation and no one can set the price to controls it. It’s absurd to incorporate the effect of inflation to Bitcoin because it has a separate to the global economy due to its deflationary feature. Maybe you right about the bottom but it will jot adjust base on inflation but rather on people speculation on how they view Bitcoin value.",

For example, the result of inflation is an increase in the price of goods, people's income is reduced and purchasing power will also decrease if we look at it based on the Customer Price Index (CPI). That's the general picture of Inflation.Regarding what you mean, inflation has nothing to do with the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is different from fiat currency whose value can change due to inflation. While Bitcoin will not change in value even though the world is experiencing high inflation.Maybe you will find a sentence or statement that says 1 BTC = 1 BTC.May be useful.",

The matter of inflation still relies on the purchasing power that we've got and if you ever convert the bitcoin that you have and that's how you think of matter with how much you've got after selling bitcoin at the current rate. But it isn't a big matter at all to consider since we're all just speculating and trying to look at the perspective in relation to inflation and bitcoin's current price.",

If those who are very young in Bitcoin, are vulnerable to FUD. But if those who are familiar with Bitcoin with a minimum duration of more than 3 years, I think they can distinguish and understand how to hedge.",

And Bitcoin market recently reacted negatively to inflation, rather than being a hedge against it, probably because Bitcoin is more of an asset for \"good\" times rather than \"bad\" times.Bitcoin went down during inflation times because people often view it as an investment than a currency. You can see why Bitcoin has been moving in correlation with the stock market lately. When tech stocks go down, the same happens to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being traded on the market today. The FED's monetary policy (rising interest rates) has made matters worse, as Bitcoin struggles to get past $20k per coin.I hope the day comes when Bitcoin becomes independent from real world events, so it could prove its real value proposition as sound money for the unbanked. That means using Bitcoin without ever needing to know its price in Fiat terms. 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin, right? Who knows what the future holds for Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional Fiat currencies? Just my opinion",
