Did anyone here use them because I can't remember I ever heard about them before.Quote from: https://blockchain.news/news/alphapo-hot-wallets-drained-of-over-23m-in-btc-eth-and-tronAlphapo, a payment processor for various gambling services, reported a breach of their hot wallets today, July 23, 2023. The breach resulted in a loss of over $23 million in Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), and Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrencies. The exact amount of BTC stolen remains unclear.The stolen funds on Ethereum were swapped for ETH and then bridged to Avalanche and Bitcoin. The addresses involved in the breach include:    0x040a96659fd7118259ebcd547771f6ecb9580d17    0x6d2e8a20b8afa88d92406d315b67822c01e53c38    TKSitnfTLVMRbJsF1i2UH5hNUeHLDrXDiY    TDoNAZHa7WxarUAFbQUhiijTGtd7EpbzRh    TJF7mdFxDuHB4tb9hoyR4SCpKxk7gr23ym1",

But the amount hacked is huge and this really arose many questions and doubts about their security. I checked the link you provided and hypedrop is a NFT marketplace which was using the Alphapo payment processing service. And they have added on their website that they are facing some withdrawals issues now.I checked on similar web that this website Hypedrop have more than millions of customers. Then you might some members using it here. I didn't find the link to the alphapo website or service providing ads etc. Like they might have anything to contact with them.",

Or both of them?By the way, does anyone know which crypto payment processors do casinos like Stake.com and sportsbet.io use? Definitely, BTCPayserver can't be an option for them because they constantly get deposit/withdraws, i.e. have a huge cashflow (or call it a cryptoflow) and have to manage some of their funds in USD/Euro. Or do such a big companies have their own child company for payment processing?",

But then I have this strong conviction that hacks happen from inwards. I mean a member of the team leaks information that will lead to hacking. I might be totally wrong, but my instinct is strong on this one.If a company processes $23M either daily or weekly, this means they have enough funds to hire experts or procure any security architecture. So why the hack?",
