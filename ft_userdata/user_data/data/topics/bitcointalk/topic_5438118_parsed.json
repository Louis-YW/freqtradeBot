Why would anyone hear from a newbie? OP doesn't even know how to put a link on the post. OP stop posting these please, any newbie can find these threads from the forum and read the guidelines, instead you put some of your time into reading these threads.",

They are mostly short posts of 1 sentence, and in several posts he is looking for an opportunity for a job in the field of digital marketing, social networks etc.It is quite legitimate to offer different services and products on this forum and there is a specific section for that on this forum.However, it is quite different if a new member is trying to share tips with other members on how to progress on this forum by sharing links from other forum posts that are very easy to find.It would be much better if he shared with us some of his personal experiences, and not what is generally known and very easy to find on this forum.If he wants to earn merits with posts like this so he can personally advance on this forum and build his reputation, he's taken the wrong path.",

I believe if the OP is really new to the forum according to his profile, then he should be seeking for help from other members of the forum and not advising people in the forum. If you are trying to get merit, then try to make meaningful contributions to forum and you will definitely receive merit, also You don't really have to create thread before you will receive merit, just make meaningful contributions to other members posts.",

You can learn more about the below topics.I think the issue here isn't knowing about bitcointalk but, knowing about bitcoin, about cryptocurrencies. That's where the issue is and that's what the forum is mainly about. An avenue to teach and impact on crypto enthusiast.The most I can say is of value in your thread is the rules as, the rules makes it possible for you to be here, to contribute not only your ideas but, to ask intelligent questions that can prompt concerns on aspects that weren't been given any attention.That's some primary reason to owning g an account on the forum, the rest are just secondary. At most, you could be on the forum simply as a guest but, that's not me anyways.",
