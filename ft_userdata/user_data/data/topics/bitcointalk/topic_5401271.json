  "content": "White Paper of FinanceDAOFDAO Never Stop V1.0https://finance-dao.github.ioCustomer Support: financedao@outlook.comI. Design PrinciplesFDAO is a DeFi & DAO token anonymously launched by blockchain geeks. DEV reserves only 1% token and locked LP for 12 months, open-source and audit contract.FDAO aims to establish a Decentralized Financial (DeFi) protocol to provide fair wealth opportunities for all people who mint or hold FDAO tokens.In order to ensure the uniqueness of FDAO, some codes are not open source for the time being, and all of them will be open source at the appropriate time.II. DeFi Perpetual Motion1. Using the BNB reserve mechanism, the spot price promotes the rise of the tier minting price, and the tier minting BNB is used to repurchase and destroy the spot. Break the impossible triangle and realize the DeFi perpetual motion machine.2. The purchase token tax is 8%, and the purchase rebate on pancakeswap is up to 8 generations, with 1% for each generation. The design will actively encourage spot purchase, help project publicity and exposure.3. 8% token sale tax, the more tokens sold, the more BNB is accumulated in the super prize pool. The super prize will incentivize tier minting, escorting the project, and protecting the ending round of participants.III. TokennomicName: FinanceDAOSymbol: FDAOTotal supply: 21 millionToken allocation: 96% tier mint, 3% liquidity, 1% devPancakeSwap tax: 8% for pancakeswap buying, 8% for pancakeswap selling (adjusted in due course, lower or higher or tax-free)IV. Invitation BonusFind and copy your invitation link on the website, send the invitation link to your friend, and complete the smart contract binding to get the following two invitation rebate bonus.1. When friends buy FDAO on pancakeswap, the purchase tax of 8% is used to issue 8 generations of purchase rebates, 1% per generation, and the bonus will be sent directly to the wallet (bonus FDAO).2. 10% direct bonus will be provided when friends participate in tier minting of FDAO, and the bonus will be sent directly to the wallet (bonus BNB).V. Tier MintThe total number of mining pools is 20.16 million, with 360 rounds of minting. Each round of minting goes up by about 2%, and tier minting price increases by about 10,000 times. There is a 10% direct bonus, a 3% automatic buyback, and an 87% contract buyback.Participation methods.1. Minimum payment of 0.25 BNB - Maximum payment of 10 BNB.2. The tokens are released equally within 300 days.VI. Buy And Burn1. Automatic buyback and burn3% BNB from tier minting is allocated to this part. When a user participates in tier minting, there will be an automatic buyback and burning of the FDAO tokens to help stabilize the market price of FDAO on pancakeswap.2. Contract buyback and burn87% of BNB from tier minting is allocated to this part, which will reserve BNB in the contract and use BNB to buy back and burn FDAO tokens from time to time in a variable BNB amount. This will be a catalyst to push up the price of FDAO tokens on pancakeswap.VII. Super Prize PoolThere will be a 72hours countdown, and each time a person joins and participate in the tier minting, the countdown will reset. At the end of the countdown, there will be a reward for everyone who participated in the ending round of tier minting. The weight of the reward will depend on the BNB input ratio of the ending (last) round. In the \"CLAIM\" navigation menu on the website, you can find the \"Super Prize\" section and determine the number of BNB you have contributed to the last round of minting and the weight percentage. The total number of BNB in the Super Prize Pool X your last round weight percentage = your projected super prize.VIII. Mint End Logic1. When the hard top-of-tier minting is reached, the super prize will be permanently stopped, and all BNB of the super prize pool will be transferred to the contract buyback pool. At the same time, the 8% transaction tax on tokens bought and sold on pancakeswap will be cancelled, and only a DEV tax of less than 2% will be charged at that time.2. If the minting hardtop is not reached, then minting will be stopped after the Super Prize is awarded, and all unminted tokens will be transferred to the blackhole and burned. Additionally, the super prize will be permanently stopped, and the 8% transaction tax for tokens bought and sold on pancakeswap will be canceled. Only a DEV tax of less than 2% will be charged at that time.IX. Eco Application1. The purpose of hierarchical coinage (tier mint) is to disperse FDAO, but it is not the end but the beginning. Dev will keep pace with the times, protect the price of FDAO to the greatest extent, and build FDAO as a DAO autonomous community around Finance.2. DEV plans to have an uninterrupted launching of eco-apps, and the range includes DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, SocialFi, and DEX. In the many upcoming DApps, there is a 90% probability of continuing using the current invitation link and team relationship (But each DApp has a different reward mechanism), which will bring huge rewards for the inviters.3. DEV predicts that each DApp becomes a popular application for BSC networks. These DApps will bring the following roles to FDAO: promote the increasing number of pledges and destruction of FDAO, and the ultimate goal is deflation to less than 1 million tokens.X. AttachmentsThe Excel sheet will provide detailed data for 360 rounds of tier minting, including the number of BNB raised per round, the number of FDAO corresponding to each round, the BNB unit price, the U.S dollar unit price, and the cumulative growth.https://ln5.sync.com/dl/f932f4700/zehn6q4p-isakf7gx-sj46dapr-q8cgmmxpXI. Project Vision VideoThis video will give our community a better understanding of the mission of FDAO. DEV as geeks who love crypto, want to use FDAO to prove to the world the true power of blockchain and crypto. Missed out on Bitcoin, but now there's FinanceDAO. The time for change has finally arrived. In the FinanceDAO, the possibilities are endless. If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.https://ln5.sync.com/dl/f932f4700/zehn6q4p-isakf7gx-sj46dapr-q8cgmmxpXII. Smart Contract AuditSolidity.finance famous clients are yuga.com. Yuga Labs is the issuer of the famous NFT BAYC and the issuer of the famous token APE. DEV has submitted an audit request to solidity.finance, the authoritative auditor, and has now passed the preliminary audit. A final audit request will be submitted after the official launch(June 14, 2022 UTC) and the report that passed the audit will be updated whitepaper and pointed to the button below for easy viewing by users. No further notice will be given. https://ln5.sync.com/dl/f932f4700/zehn6q4p-isakf7gx-sj46dapr-q8cgmmxpXIII. Launch TimeIn order to prevent robots and protect the average investor, DEV is unable to provide accurate launch times. This initiative is intended to provide a relatively fair investment opportunity.DEV expects to complete liquidity deployment and other preparations within June 14, 2022 (UTC), and update the URL on official website when the preparations are complete, at which time users can purchase or minting FDAO tokens by clicking the buttons \"BUY NOW!\" or \"MINT NOW!\". However, the invitation link is continuously available and is not affected by the launch time. No further notice will be given.Launch Time: June 14, 2022 (UTC)Thanks for Reading.",
