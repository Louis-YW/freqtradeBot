I can understand that people will not just give away larger amounts of tBTC since if they would do it, they would quickly run out of them also. So I was thinking I could just point a miner at a testnet pool for a few hours/days to get the amount that I would need. After some research I found out this will be more difficult than I thought, since many pools seem to be offline. Also it is many times suggested to set up your own pool.

Also I want to have some tBTC for future projects for example open a LN channel and just did not expect that it would be so hard to obtain the needed amount.I dint know about that Ethereum Scam stuff, but I hope if this doesn't stop there will be just a second testnet or something like this to be able to stop these scammers to mess with people by hoarding all the coins.For the mean time I will try to just stick with the faucets, but all help regarding testnet mining will be appreciated, since maybe the difficulty will go eventually when the next shitcoin bubble will pop.",

Correct.OP desires testnet bitcoin. Also correct.It'd be reasonable to assume that testnet coins do have a market value, because there's demand and there's supply. However, this should not be the case in here. The moment the community starts treating tBTC as a product or money, it'll essentially nullify the demand, because their only purpose is to help on testing. They exist only to help us improve and understand the main network's benefits.Therefore, the owners are incentivized to give them for free.",
