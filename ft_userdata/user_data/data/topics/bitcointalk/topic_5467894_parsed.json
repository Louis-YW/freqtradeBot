Do you see any value in them or it is just a death spiral?Not familiar but if it won’t require you to invest then it would be worth trying. And if investing is needed always gauge the risk by just investing in the minimum if you’re just into testing it first. If you’re too hyped of it then you may invest bigger amount. Some are saying that projects of such concept are really profitable but to some it is not. Which gave me the idea that the ones who have engaged early are always the ones who are earning huge profit from Play/move to earn games/ applications. Better to try it for yourself or join communities specified for that application to gain first hand experiences for its users/investors.",

In fact, P2E gained some interest in its early days but unfortunately, the tide is over and most of these projects turn into a scam and make people become hopeless with the money spent on them. I'm not sure but this move to earn is somewhat another scam trick, I can't be fooled by such a trick as I was old enough for this. If we aim to earn a profit, none of these projects will provide to us.",

Do you see any value in them or it is just a death spiral?These coins are just trends based coins and now trend already over so I will called these projects a dead projects. Goto tradingview and check the chart of GMT and GST, you will fund your answer there. Stepn is father of the move to earn projects and when stepn has been dead then all other projects are also in same class.I bought sneaker at the time of projects full swing. That time GST price was more than 5$ . projects system was too good and everything was running well and suddenly some nad news come and then panic started and now gst price is only 0.2$. we should always invest in long term projects which doesn't work only with trend like ETH and other projects having high demand in every season.",

There is a project on Binance I remember that got hype due to the sneakers and walking to earn crypto but now has been quiet eversince.

Do you see any value in them or it is just a death spiral?How do these move to earn project gain revenue? Answer that first, then I will say if there's any value from these kind of crypto projects.Move to Earn is like Play to Earn where in order for a person earns, somebody must need to invest. Let's face the fact that in P2E games, developers are paying their users thru the money of different users. Same concept with M2E. In order for a user to earn tokens or whatever shitcoin it is, they need investments from other people. Unless they are earning from other things like having a merchandise, or whatever it is.Move to Earn doesn't have any value at all. I remember SweatCoin where it has been there for years already, and yet it hasn't gained any popularity or at least changed the hype around crypto. Overall, move to earn projects doesn't have any value, but I'm also thinking that there might be some out there who still believe in these M2E projects and because of that, they will be forced to exercise, and that would be healthy for them, so I guess these projects are like \"blessing in disguise\" for them because they will be healthier since they're already exercising.",

Do you see any value in them or it is just a death spiral?The value that I see on them is you're taking care of your health and you're obliged to move and walk. Just think of it as something forcing you to have exercise and the benefits of it to your health is more than what's the value of those tokens. That's the best consolation or worth that you can think of with these apps and projects. But if you think that they're not worth it, then just walk or run alone without being tied up with these apps but honestly, they're a good motivation for someone that's looking forward to become healthier. So if you've got goals to live with these apps and tokens, that's your decision but you can live without them as well but keeping up with what they're promoting and that is to move.",

If you’re not sure on those project or you are still analyzing it better to consider everything and choose the best investment for you instead of dealing with those shitcoins. Again, its too risky because some of those project are just came here to make money and not to do business.",

Generally, as we always witnessed in the altcoin world, remember that without hype, these types of projects won't last long even with how good the project concept is, in most cases.It's not wrong to take part in those projects as long as you know what you are dealing with.",

When it came out, I was kind of intrigued by how the money would work but I realized that it also has a ring to a scammy attempt. This is just another pyramid scheme where people would need to invest to give something to those who came in first and then it goes on until funds start to deplete and the miserable investors will be those who are at the bottom and cannot even get back their ROI. It's not far from the play to earn tricky games where I have invested a lot before. The only difference is, that I made sure I was one of the beta investors to make sure that I could get my ROI as early as I could. There's no assurance with this type of project in the long run. If you see profits as early as possible, take it, sell it, and then just leave something that would make it work by itself again. If it can make more then withdraw again. Don't fall in love with this because they are obviously pyramid schemes.",
