  "content": "Ethereum One (ETHOne)Welcome to Ether One BlockchainEther One is forked from Ethereum (POW) and it's based on Proof of Work Algorithm. This blockchain does not inherit the difficulty or data from old blockchain but it provides a fresh start. ETHOne is the native token and used as a gas for transactions. Wrapped Ether One is also created as an ERC 20 token on this blockchain. WETHOne will be used to swap with other ERC 20 tokens on this blockchain.Ether One Website : https://etherone.one/index.htmlEther ONEEther One blockchain is a fresh blockchain starting from block 0. It won't have any data from old blockchains and won't have same difficulty level. It will be much easier to mine. Other POW forks of Ethereum blockchains like ETHW and ETF are very difficult to mine and are not profitable for mining. Our goal is to support decentralization, fast and possibly cheaper transactions and lots of fun DApps.Token DetailsToken Name : Ether OneToken Symbol : ETHOneToken Algorithm : ETHASHToken Wrapped Version : Wrapped Ether One (WETHONE) - 0x5db6199605DA5155E65037D5B1bDCcB77a40FA38Token Supply : Unlimited - (Generated via Mining)Token Initial Coin Offering (ICO) : No ICO or Pre-SalesToken Tokens in Circulation : 244k (8 Oct, 2022)Social MediaEther One Discord (Chat) : https://discord.gg/vF2SDb6Yz9Ether One Telegram (Chat) : https://t.me/ether_one_blockchainEther One Twitter : https://twitter.com/EtherOneChainEther One Medium : Coming Soon ...Ether One Instagram : Coming Soon ...Source CodeEther One Github (Code) : https://github.com/etheronechainMining and NodesEther One Mining Pool : https://node2.etherone.one/#/Ether One Block Explorer : http://explorer1.etherone.one/?network=Ether%20OneThanks a lot for supporting this project from day 1.
