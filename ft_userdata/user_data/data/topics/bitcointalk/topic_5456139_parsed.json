You mean to say if my wallet account has been hacked¬† by someone, you can resolve and get it back to me?It seems difficult to do that, I haven't seen anyone stolen here in the crypto business who got the token back to them that was lost in their wallet.So it seems hard to believe, but even so, if you really have the ability to do that, I hope you can provide a sample that you have done with such a problem.",

I find them as founder of Timedom ‚Äì Ukrainian service of apartments rentals and currently CEO @ UA-Valley.com linkBoth timedom & UA-Valley.com services are dead.Can bloggers consider themselves experts in any field, when they have almost no personal experience?Quote from: digaran on June 14, 2023, 10:58:02 AMReturn of the jedi is more expected than the return of stolen crypto, I could save everyone 150 AED on how to keep your crypto safe, just use a cold wallet and you'd be Ok.This sounded like \"Return of the jedi\" to me too. ¬†I would say this is just an innovative way for a restaurant to sell some food.Quote from: Sofia372 on June 12, 2023, 02:04:32 PMThe talk starts at 6 p.m., on Thursday, June 15th at the restaurant üìç Gaia, DubaiNote: The minimum spend rule in the venue is 150 AED.",
