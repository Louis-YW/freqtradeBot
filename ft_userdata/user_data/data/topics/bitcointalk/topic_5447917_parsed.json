Most of these Filipino trading groups can be found on social media, mainly in Facebook.It is because that's the social media that most of us use and you can see a lot of these trading groups there. While being a fan of Anime, Onigiri Neko are japanese terms and meaning of it are  Onigiri = rice ball and Neko = Cat. Well, that's just some trivia and anyway, this is the trading group that you probably are looking for.https://facebook.com/groups/472203605109045Members there are still active and just by reading some few comments, is there any problem related to investments/trading you guys have?",
