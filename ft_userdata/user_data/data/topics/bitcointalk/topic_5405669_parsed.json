Even if the problem is not related to multi account, they will still ask for KYC for verification because this is the standard procedure for processing red flag to a user account.I will wait for sportsbet official reply here because OP win 3600$ out of 80$ is very rare and there is a chance that he abused a certain bonus to get it using VPN to create multiple account and use this thread to get support for his issue.I have 200 free spin gate of olympus when i wager 200 usdt. But i dont use VPN sirand I got a about $30  from 200 fs",

To say the least $3,600 is a small amount that Sportsbet wouldn't be able to payout if they've not suspected any foul play, I'm very sure this! but sometimes (less than 10% of most cases) the bookies too do get things especially when the main way of connecting accounts is via IP addresses, however Sportsbet have said it several times that they have other methods which they can't mention for security reasons which they use to connect these account.PS: I'm not supporting Sportsbet here, but you might need to provide valid proofs enough for users here to be convinced that you're not guilty of the accusation, You can send them a private message here, I'm very sure Steve would be willing to help you look into it https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=832366 but the response might be a bit slower since it's a weekend and being a festive period.",
