Now thinking about invest on btc at least there is no chance like 98% dump at least stable coin looking to more risky!!Well if you are for the long term then BTC is still the best way to go.And that's why it's hard to trust this stable coins, because we have seen what it can do the the market, including BTC. So everything is on the red because of what Luna did or suffered in the last couple of days. This scenario has been laid out though years ago against stable coin and now we have realized that it can easily be manipulated, depeg and then affect the market in general in a bad way.",

The LUNA ecosystem was always designed to fail like this given that in a depeg situation, the arbitrage mechanism essentially means that LUNA gets dumped on the market -> LUNA decreases in price -> further decreasing confidence that UST can stabilise.Absolutely insane situation, but hopefully a lesson learned.",

But staying in cryptocurrencies that have proven themselves and made a serious name in the market is the most important element for this market. Because I think people will never give up their btc admiration and investment. It is an important factor to stay in cryptocurrencies with big names like btc and eth in the long run.

This is very unfortunate to those who bought at the peak price and hold, I don’t know if LUNA can still be trusted by the investors or it will remain on this price level for now better to get out of LUNA and invest somewhere else. The manipulator for this coin is very powerful, I wonder what’s next for this project.",

I didn’t see this coming for LUNA, this is worst and imagine its time frame for the drop, just 72hrs and you already hit the bottom of the bottom, that’s alarming. The price may rise again but I think it will be more volatile, and it might not rise that much again, we’ll see. Just continue to monitor and if you are still holding, try to be more patient.",

It's the indicator and mover of the market so whenever bitcoin goes down, all of them follows but bitcoin will never go to zero or at least 98% of losses although it's truly volatile.",

Now thinking about invest on btc at least there is no chance like 98% dump at least stable coin looking to more risky!!I am really sorry for your loss, as without a doubt it does not matter who you are such a loss is catastrophic for anyone, however it is because of this that the more experimented members of the forum advise people to only hold bitcoin for the long term.If you want to trade altcoins and you are prepared to take the risk then that is fine, but you need to be willing to sell at the first sign that there is something wrong, after all there were signs that there was something wrong with LUNA since April, so people had more than a month to sell their coins and avoid being part of this disaster that has ruined the lives of many, as they were completely invested in the success of this coin and now they have lost everything.",

I don't know if Do Kwon could make his recovery plan a success and will be supported by his company investors to make luna stable , maybe he is just slowing the dumping process that's why he is constantly tweeting to luna holders. I don't know if that could even help them get up, some says that even he manage to get the funds, it won't be enough to the current immense sell off.",

Many lose their money on this, but then again you need to analyze now so you can know your next move.",

It's your fault investing in the algoritmic stable token that backed by volatile asset like bitcoin. It doesn't make sense to see that happens. You may ask yourself why were you doing it in the past. Bunch of people are loosing their life savings due to this dump. The bad scenario is when the price needs years to recover from the bottom again.",
