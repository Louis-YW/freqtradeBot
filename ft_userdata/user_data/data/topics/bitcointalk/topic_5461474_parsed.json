      "body": "In theory, that means making the supply less, and when the supply is low but the demand is high, the price of that token will be worth more. But for a token or coin to increase in price, there are many factors, it will not depend solely on the burning of coins. In my opinion, you should only consider this factor for large projects, projects that have use cases like ETH or BNB, it will be really helpful in helping push the coin price. But when it comes to memes and shitcoins, burning won't work because their value like Doge or Shiba depends on shark manipulation.",

They often advertise aggressively by creating hype all over social media and offering new features that may or may not be useful at all. Methods like that are only good for short term.",

Also, many project gona to scam like this system, so that's why you have to be careful and stay away from such project.",

How big the impact from the burn totally depends on its mechanism. I took two different examples1. BNB burn mechanismBNB burn used profit raised through operating its product to buy back the tokens from the market. This is also pushing the circulating supply to be even less than before. It was giving huge impact to the price caused by binance has active product that was regularly generating profit for the burning purpose2. Meme token burn mechanismMeme token used tax mechanism to burning its token but this is only fooling investors caused by the burn generated from giving tax for any transfers that interact with the meme token smartcontract. This burn mostly used by stupid dev who didn't evne understand about the product.

As you've said, it becomes a buzz word whenever there is an announcement from any token and project that they're going to burn supply. Some of those are lucky to have a strong community and any news that they release to their community are being bought by their investors. But as I have said, not all of them are the same and even with halving or burning, not all gets the attention.",

      "body": "In addition to burning, you also need the necessary demand. Burning coins by itself does not guarantee anything. It may just be one of the marketing ploys to lure investors. It is important to consider at what rate the coins are burned. If they are burned at a much slower rate than how inflation in the token itself grows, then the burn in such a cryptocurrency doesn't matter much. Something similar can be observed with the LUNC cryptocurrency.",

But the problem that many market theorists tell is that there is no real gain that flows because the token that are burnt are already with the team and were already not part of the flow so it doesn't really impacts the price.",

Maybe in 2017-2020 but not anymore. The way the mechanism works is that some tokens are taken out of circulation. When this happens, it is usually perceived as a positive event since decreasing supply is believed to mean that price go up:Supply goes down, price go up. (similar to bitcoin halving event where mining rewards get slashed in half).However, most of these projects don't have a fixed total supply. There's usually an inflation that doesn't get offset by the burn events.",

Starting from how much is going to be burned, who is burning them and in what rate? How do they acquire the burned tokens? Do they buy them from the market and continuing to do so or are devs burning their own stash that they wouldn't use anyway? (which wouldn't make anything but artificial meaningless difference to circulating supply.As a rule of thumb; burning technically always helps the price grow. In reality it often doesn't as there are just too much to burn in order it to have any effect.",

In the past, I've seen an ICO cut their total amount of coins by three zeros (000) the billions of coins became millions, and yet the value was just glued unto. There was a window of an increase in market value but it didn't even last a day. Simply because the coins that all the holders have was also cut by three zeros so you cannot even say they did a burning mechanism, just an adjustment. What Shiba Inu is doing may have the same effect as well. They have too many coins being held and on their stock plus they are a meme coin so the probability of the value going up is not that high. I'd stick with other coins with real projects behind them.",

And it is obvious they refused to do so as they wanted to use burning their coins as a market strategy to create attention for their coin, however as we know for any asset to become valuable its supply not only needs to be on the low side but its demand needs to be high, as well and while burning tokens can reduce the supply, it does absolutely nothing to increase the demand.",
