      "body": "Why would you even want to have empathy for a bad person? Bad people that commit crimes out there like a mass shooting, kidnapping, and rape, I seriously doubt that person or persons ever had parents that could teach them about kindness. The golden rule ‘treat others as you would like to be treated yourself’. Without having to learn the act of kindness as a child there is no empathy for doing such brutal things. I have only empathy for the survivors of the crimes of the sad event, rebuilding is very hard, and the event will forever be in memory for the rest of their life.",

      "body": "You not feeling bad about bad thing doesn't mean anything,is just your emotions that tell how you will feel when such things happen.I kine of believe that we feel bad to good people and don't feel any to bad people,the truth is that it's depends on what did the person do or what did he get involved in that made him die.Paul walker death I will say I didn't feel it at all but he was a good man too but I guys why I didn't feel it is just because we are not related in any way or even close at all.so you feeling or not is all on your mind.",

      "body": "Well, being selfless & considering others more could make you understand people more and possibly become more sympathic. But I think it's not something you train yourself to become. There need to liberation first then gift of Light.I remember when I understood who people really are and where they were ignorantly heading to . I felt extremely deep and overwhelming sympathy for them that I couldn't resist tears. It was so powerful experience that it made me become more caring. The feeling was like discovering that a large ship you thought was taking you and others to a nice beautiful place was instead sailing to a dark evil place full of cannibals, evil creatures, suffering etc. And you notice how everyone in the ship was very determined, working everyday, organizing seminars, coming in groups to discuss world issues, making laws, making discoveries, celebrating their achievements, receiving awards, marrying... and all to make sure that the ship continues to sail to the  \"nice beautiful place\" while they live comfortably in it. This feeling actually was transfered/revealed to me by my CREATOR without speaking about it, to let me know the condition of humanity.",
