Now, staying away from green candles makes sense in theory, but its not always easy to do.DCAing is great because you set it and forget it. It helps people cope with the crypto market's dramatic swings. While I like your sharp market assessments, I disagree that DCAing during market upswings necessarily raises risk. Truth is more nuanced and involves numerous aspects. Every investor must decide how much risk they can bear and act accordingly.",

Investors like you who just started last year are likely to go into the DCA than investors that begin since 2009, 2010, and so on. Because they have understudy the market volatility over time and overly familiar with the system. They tend to go with the Lump sum instead.Anothrr reason could be the nature of trade you do outside the Bitcoin network. Maybe you are a serial entrepreneur who's trying new trades almost frequently and you need to access investments on monthly or quarterly bases. You're likely to be more interesting in ghe DCA. It could be more simplified through the use of Active and Passive investors for instance.Everything lies on the choice and preferences of the investor whom must have made technical and financial investigations or survey on how the market flows. Or just simply by their level of tolerance to taking risks or even mere choice of decision.",

I think it's better to have some dollars awaiting your buying signal and buy the better dips. Value average is a good strategy as the investor will set his target growth rate and constantly adjust contributions to suit the target.

This strategy will be profitable if you can always predict the movement of the market accurately which is somehow impossible.

Value average can lead to procrastination and delay in investment. Keeping money aside for investment and waiting for the right time to invest can be risky. You might be tempted to use the money for other things. It will be better to be consistent than to keep procrastinating until you miss an opportunity to buy.

DCAing at such times are increasing your risks. The idea of DCA is to average your buy price since you will never know when will the price will dip that’s why user consistently purchases fixed amount of money on a certain date regularly. There’s a tendency that you keep wait and wait for a dip until it never happened since the price of Bitcoin is unpredictable. Yes your idea is really good assuming that the asset show same pattern per year but Bitcoin is different because it can pump quickly while you are still waiting for the huge dump. DCA method is use to avoid FOMO buy while you already have the capital or if you have a regular income on a certain date.Again, You are assuming a scenario that you are predicting a dip every month which is not the case.Example: You can have a much better average price if you purchase on  16k, 18k, and 20k instead when the price dip from 25k to 19K which you will purchase according to the plan on avoiding green candle.",

This not DCA,you are buying at the dip. This strategy is good because you buy bitcoin in a discount price and will have a significant amount but it is very risky because you might end up not accumulating the amount of bitcoin can you would have if you were using DCA method at a given period of time. This is because it is not easy to predict the market movement and when after waiting for sometimes the market didnt go as you expect,you might end up spending your funds before the dip. One the other hand DCA is the best method to accumulate more bitcoin into your bitcoin investment portfolio because it will lead to consistent increase in your bitcoin investment either when you are buying in the bear or bull market. It is just like someone working and assigned a certain amount,let's say 10% of his income monthly to his savings and he just allow the money to keep on piling up. We all have saving in a particular period of time or presently. This is the same with bitcoin when you believe in it,you use 10% of your weeklyor monthly income to DCA based on your cash inflow. Although this strategy is for those people that have steady cash inflow and not for those that dont have steady cash inflow,if not they might end up going back to sell from their investment as a sign to show that they are not prepared for the DCA method. Both methods are good strategy but for a newbie,it is advisable that they buy at the dip. I use both methods,Quote from: Outhue on September 09, 2023, 09:20:04 AMWhat is your own DCA strategy like?

If you're buying small chunks of bitcoin every week, then you will definitely buy when it's considered low (as it did in late 2022). You will likely alleviate the potential loss. There is no perfect strategy. Just think what is more suitable for your life. Is it buying $200 worth of bitcoin every week? Is it every month? Is it every once you get paid? You might think you can time the market, which in that case would be more preferable to have big capital and spend it for one purchase.",

A person chooses a fixed amount that one can afford to invest per month, and just commits to doing it, no matter how the price is moving. And of course, it's more profitable to buy at a low price than if it rises, but with DCA you win some and lose some, without needing to stress over market analysis, finding the right time to buy or sell, etc. Occasionally buying when the price is on the rise isn't a problem, IMO. The only time when I'd say DCA can be unwise is a few months of a rapid bull market that happen once every 2-3 years, but that's just generally not a great investing time.",

DCAing at such times are increasing your risks. It is foolish to do DCA for only 12 months with bitcoin. You have to look at it over 4 years. Or at least, now that we are 7 or 8 months away from halving, for a couple of years. But if I were you, I would look at it even more in the long term, which is what I do. Bitcoin is a unique asset, and it is going to become more and more in demand and scarce. It is worth considering keeping bitcoin forever, even to leave it as an inheritance, so you can accumulate amounts that are comfortable for you and take advantage of bull markets to partially sell and make profits, but always keeping bitcoin in the long term. Quote from: Outhue on September 09, 2023, 09:20:04 AMWhat is your own DCA strategy like?Forget about the ups and downs of the market and continue to accumulate as much as I can, with a long-term perspective. As I have explained in other threads there are different variations of DCA, the most typical being to buy the same amount over the same period of time. But you may have more money available to buy at certain times and then take the opportunity to buy more, especially when the market is bearish.",

Waiting for a big DIP is actually what DCA method addresses. If you wish to wait for a dip before investing I most at times think that you’re wasting the opportunity to buy. Once the market isn’t close to the ATH then I would say buy because without the certainty of what will come next it is better to cease that opportunity. What if one waits to for a dip before buying and that particular target price doesn’t come again, or probably the markets continues to green from that price you would have missed the opportunity waiting for a dip. QuoteMonthly investment is the best frequency to some people, they advice to never delay any investment, are you one of those people? Regarding of the price action of that month? Why most people actually go for monthly investment could actually be related to the fact that most people use their monthly salaries for the investment or the fact that at least the market will have change within that thirty days in month. DCA strategies should be done on how you feel it suits you properly or goes in line with your income but do not wait too long for a dip before making any investment most especially if you’re coming new to the market",
