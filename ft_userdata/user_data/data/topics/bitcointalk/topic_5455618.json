But make sure that you are updating the firmware and everything you are using with it, like Trezor Suite or Electrum.",

Of course there is a way for users to protect themselves by setting up passphrase, which should again be composed of random characters, and if I remember correctly, someone mentioned even 30+ characters for absolute security.I think you can be pretty safe if you buy BTC and store them in that HW, although there are always some better solutions.",

Anyway considering recent ledger mess up, even if it's a bit offtopic, would you be so kind to share what you consider being better solutions?",

With the passphrase, new keys and addresses are generated Quote from: hopenotlate on June 07, 2023, 01:59:38 PMAnyway considering recent ledger mess up, even if it's a bit offtopic, would you be so kind to share what you consider being better solutions?For bitcoin, wallets on airgapped devicen is better. If not spending the coin for a long time, you can use a paper wallet too. But wallet on airgapped devices, you can have a watch-only wallet too which is optional but can make broadcasting transaction easy.",

That's right, and that means that the seed in itself is worthless without a passphrase, and even though it may cause confusion for some, when it comes to Trezor, I would recommend everyone to familiarize themselves with that option and use it.Quote from: hopenotlate on June 07, 2023, 01:59:38 PMAnyway considering recent ledger mess up, even if it's a bit offtopic, would you be so kind to share what you consider being better solutions?The only storage that can be considered safe if done correctly is airgapped cold storage, and anyone with an old laptop/PC can do it. As for ready-made solutions, most agree that there is currently only one hardware wallet that makes sense to buy -> Foundation Devices 'Passport Batch 2' hardware wallet review",
