  "content": "I remember that day perfectly. I was quite unhappy with my health and financial instability. After multiple successful and unsuccessful surgeries, I found myself reliant on a wheelchair. Unfortunately, the limitations extended beyond just the inability to move my legs; there were significant financial costs associated with various aspects, from purchasing quality medical aids to dealing with the progression of the illness. These were the reasons for my frustration up until 2021.On that day, when it all began, I had no idea that a phone call with a friend shortly before midnight would change everything. Lee, I am immensely grateful for that! After a long discussion, a particular sentence stuck in my mind when he likened Bitcoin to a train waiting at the station for the last passengers to board and experience a remarkable journey. That was the first time I experienced FOMO firsthand.During my initial purchase, I was not familiar with the DCA method, and I made a mistake by investing more than I could afford due to the fear of missing out. However, I felt incredible when it went a few percent into profit. Subsequently, it dropped by more than 50%, only to surpass the previous all-time high shortly after, and then the market finally flushed it out. At that point, I felt less fantastic. Fortunately, I did not withdraw the money at a loss., held onto it, and continued to HODL and gradually accumulate, thanks to information from the internet and gaining familiarity with Bitcoin.A big thanks go to Bitcoin Channel (Czech), where he created a series of videos titled \"Introduction to Bitcoin,\" which I watched multiple times. The information was presented in a simple and understandable way, often with a touch of humor. I still occasionally revisit them, and the information that initially I did not understand now makes sense. I share this video series with others who I want to introduce to the world of Bitcoin, offering them valuable information to study and decide whether to dive in. I am incredibly grateful to my friend for pulling me into this.Studying the content in the Bitcoin Channel has added a lot to my life. I had no idea how little I understood traditional finances until I study them. I was taken aback by a video where I learned that the big-dollar is not backed by anything, that it really is just about trust in the state. I was amazed at how complex Bitcoin is from a technical standpoint, yet how simple it is to use. Comparisons to a microwave or the internet showed me that we don't have to understand what's happening behind the scenes technically – codes, hashes, nonce, blockchain, and the others. Just as the average population doesn't know how a microwave works, they just press a button and heat up their food. When you want to find information on the internet, you don't have to worry about how your device connects to the server and communicates in the background with the other side. You simply type what you're looking for, press enter, and there it is. You don't even realize the technical aspect of how money is leaving your payment card, and yet it is a widespread method of payment worldwide.Fortunately, I didn't lose faith in Bitcoin when the market hit its low in November 2022. I continued to accumulate in small portions, significantly improving my average purchase price from the previous entry during the peak of the bull market, thanks to the DCA method. I'm excited to see the reward for enduring the stress and holding on, even when things were tight. Now, with a pleasant profit, I know that I won't have to ask for help with the down payment on a new wheelchair or other expenses related to my health in the future. And I achieved this pleasant profit before reaching the ATH of 2021. What will happen with greater adoption? When the entry of large institutions fully manifests? When the next halving occurs? When FOMO grips new people entering Bitcoin? I don't know. But I firmly believe that this small appreciation will gradually increase, and I will fulfill my dream of financial independence, with an ongoing improvement in the quality of my life.In conclusion, with this contribution, I want to convey the following to people, especially those deciding to enter the world of Bitcoin: Educate yourself, stay informed, and don't panic. Only invest what you are willing to lose. I didn't come up with this advice; wiser, more experienced individuals did, and I listen to them. If you encounter any issues, reach out to people who understand it better and have valuable experience. I found support in the Bitcoin Community group on Facebook.If my story helps someone when they find themselves in the same situation as I was when buying at the peak of the bull run, I will consider myself successful, and it will have made sense to write it.I wish everyone, especially those who managed to read this far, robust health!Thank you, Satoshi!",

Certainly, I plan to hold onto Bitcoin for as long as possible, ideally until the point when it can be used directly for transactions, eliminating the need to convert to fiat currency. However, each year I incur significant financial expenses for medical supplies, so I can only choose a small portion each time to cover the remaining costs.

I've been in a wheelchair for many years. I ended up in a wheelchair after an unsuccessful scoliosis surgery when I was 13. Now I'm 30, so I've had enough time to learn to live with it. Yes, it is true that such friends are a great rarity in life. I met this particular friend in the hospital when he was recovering from a serious car accident. Even though both of us experienced unfortunate events that led us to the hospital, it also brought some positives. Since I am in a wheelchair, at least I have the opportunity to park close to the entrance at shopping centers. And my legs no longer hurt.    ... thanks to all",

I have gained some level of financial freedom since I started with bitcoin, which makes even more sense now as the local currency is declining and the dollar is rising. This newfound financial independence has made me more confident than before because of bitcoin technology.For sharing your incredible story, I am willing to donate a prosthetic for you, which will help you walk with your artificial foot for the rest of your life. I will also ensure you receive training on how to use it effectively. I'll also provide a one-year warranty for the product, so you can always have it serviced or replaced if something goes wrong within that time.Please send me a private message if you're interested in the prosthetic, and we can discuss how to arrange its delivery. We all consider ourselves part of one family here, especially when it comes to bitcoin. This forum has brought many of us together and continues to do so. Sharing inspiring stories like yours encourages more people, especially newbies, to commit to this platform and bitcoin technology at large. Therefore, we need to offer you every support we can to help you navigate this forum and continue to fulfill your purpose here.Quote from: serveria.com on February 18, 2024, 09:57:16 PMThanks, it's a truly inspiring story. It proves that Bitcoin is for everyone - it doesn't matter what ethnicity, social status, skin color etc you are. If you are patient enough and make clever investment decisions you will succeed even with modest investment. Thanks, Satoshi, thanks, Bitcoin!Oh yes, that's one aspect I'm proud of. Bitcoin, as a decentralized currency, knows no ethnicity, coloration, nation, or continent. This is one distinguishing aspect of Bitcoin. Another aspect is its decentralization, which means it cannot be controlled. Even if one tries to manipulate or hoard it, it won't affect others. There's no scarcity in Bitcoin technology, so even bad actors won't benefit disproportionately. It's difficult for governments to print too many loads of cash and end up moping the ones available, which can lead to inflation, as Bitcoin operates independently of such centralized control.",

If they were in your position, many would not have held their investments like this and grown their investments using the DCA method. But one thing you want to know here is when bitcoin halving will happen I want to tell you that bitcoin halving is still 58 days 1 hour 3 minutes away according to time it shows bitcoin halving on 20th of April. But rest assured the market bull run will start a few months after the bitcoin halving I hope you will be more profitable at that time when new ATH is created in the bitcoin market.",

However, I felt incredible when it went a few percent into profit. Subsequently, it dropped by more than 50%, only to surpass the previous all-time high shortly after, and then the market finally flushed it out. At that point, I felt less fantastic. Fortunately, I did not withdraw the money at a loss., held onto it, and continued to HODL and gradually accumulate, thanks to information from the internet and gaining familiarity with Bitcoin.You hold because you have faith in Bitcoin and that even proves that it helps a lot to save losses. If not always but most of the time we learn many things from committing mistakes in the past. FOMO is very influential and certainly affects our minds and is a common reason why people lose control of their emotions and make wrong decisions. But I see no sweet success, it comes with hardships and a difficult journey. But as long as we trust our investment and keep thinking positively despite losses and mistakes, it is not impossible to reach our goal. Indeed, it takes a longer time but it was worth it.",

If I understand correctly, you would like to help me with some type of prosthesis that would enable me to walk again?You probably think that I don't have legs. However, I do have them; I just can't move them. I am paralyzed from the chest down. I have severely spastic legs and cannot move them properly even with assistance. Both tendons and muscles are shortened. To make matters worse, in April of last year, I also suffered a very serious fracture in my left leg. Mobility is highly limited. I have a very strong scoliosis as well. In the coming months, I am planning to undergo surgery abroad because doctors in my country are hesitant and lack experience in such cases. The operation I had when I became paralyzed was already very complicated.I'm not sure if any prosthesis would help me, but perhaps I misunderstood your message.",

I would also like to warn you that in addition to good people on the forum, there may be scammers who can make great efforts to gain trust and draw out or somehow deceive people. Don’t be too gullible; the forum is not a social network where all personal photos are posted.I just looked at your profile and saw your Instagram.",
