Therefore, the distribution of bitcoin has to be tracked in some decentralized database that is running on every Bitcoin node.Think of the blockchain as a the all-seeing tracker of everybody's money - though it obviously doesn't know your name and identity - where the banking system failed to track money.It should be noted, that credit that you see in banks is also stored digitally, though obviously without blockchain technology. You have used \"credit\" if you have ever bought something with a credit card or debit card.",

As a new person to Bitcoin, what you actually need now a beginner guide to Bitcoin, of which I will start by explaining What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was invented by a man named \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" with the sole aim of eradicating middle men from the transaction process, which is independent on its own, not controlled by either central bank or government, and enables fast means of transaction across borders in seconds. But however, here is a detail explanation..If you love reading, check this out 👇https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/If you love watching videos, check this outhttps://youtu.be/MaLpcTOVkJEThese two source are the best guide for a beginner to understanding Bitcoin better",

LN does not have a network wide audit system or consensus to secure value. thus its not a network that should be thought of a secure trusted network for long term store of valueits the whole purpose of why blockchains are such a great invention because smart contracts were weak. all cypherpunks knew this. with recent issues with many sidechains and subchains that messed with their pegs. it should be best practice to make people aware not to trust other networks that say they are transacting bitcoin when infact they are not the bitcoin network and using tokens/units of a different name/measure. fine use the other networks as a short term niche use for a certain reason as long as you learn about the risks and accept the risks. but dont trust them as the long term store. same goes for using middlemen services where you send them bitcoins to their bitcoin network address and they give you some other database balance displayed on their website to play with. that website balance on their site are not real bitcoin. they are just a balance on a database that supposedly represents balance they owe youbitcoins security is the very reason bitcoin is great, be aware of the risks of services and other networks that pretend to offer you bitcoin off the network",

I also want to learn about how Bitcoin really work ? <…>Think of bitcoin as a decentralized distributed ledger that keeps records of all transactions that have ever been conducted. There are no \"coins\" in this ledger, only messages or \"entries\" that tell us who gave money to whom, when, and how much. The design of this distributed system is such that it is immutable (no one can tamper with the entries that have already been added), and it is resistant to double spending (no one can spend the same money twice or more times - once it is moved it is final), it is protected from censorship and fraudulent tampering because every single full node keeps a copy of the ledger and independently verifies every single incoming transaction. Bitcoin cannot exist outside of this ledger because if entries aren't protected or don't meet certain criteria of the system, they don't matter to the system and are ignored. Only those entries that have been added to the ledger via the process of mining can be said to have reliable properties (Proof-of-Work) that make them \"worthy\" to become part of history.",

So blockchain keeps the whole records of the transactions in the blocks mined and verified by the miners and each transaction have the fees that goes to the miner who has found the block.So you will learn a lot about these things once you start your journey.For your help there are some resources like others have mentioned and over it you must read  Mastering Bitcoin  that will give you enough knowledge about bitcoin working.Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 17, 2022, 02:45:48 PMWho is really Satoshi Nakamoto ?
