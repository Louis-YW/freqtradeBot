BUT binance didnt want to approve most bitcoin withdrawals. instead they pushed people into moving their binance bitcoin \"balance\" through their sidechain to other exchanges like coinbase to then withdrawthis is because coinbase held the real bitcoin in custodial reserves when creating the matched pegged bitcoin on the sidechain months/years prior.. so although people moved \"value\" from coinbase to binance months/years ago via the sidechain. where binance had the sidechain 'value' they did not have he reciprocal custodianised reserve bitcoin of that pegimagine if one day. coinbase just stopped supporting the side chain.. just decided one day it no longer recognises that network.. boompeople on binance are stuck with balance they can never claim back because coinbase is no longer listening to that network.",

But the OP asked about fake bitcoins that exchanges supposedly create with the same value as real Bitcoins. I assumed that he was not referring to wrapped bitcoin but to the fake volume of coins on exchanges internally. That's why I said it would be a risky business for an exchange because they don't have enough real bitcoin to cover that volume.",

Most people rely only on bitcoin for survival as it is. the 21 million is always in circulation. the day when bitcoin stopped moving or in circulation, there will a very big problem in the whole world.

They might use the name Bitcoin but something must be added to it to make it different from the original Bitcoin. If it is possible to create an exact like of the original Bitcoin, scammers might have done that become now but it is not possible and very difficult for them.Try to look on CMC and hover up on that search button and enter the keyword bitcoin and you would find lots of coins which does have a Bitcoin word on name of it which its never been a new thing.Lots are trying to make use of the word Bitcoin but using up other blockchains.Dont know on what they do have in mind and trying to believe that it could really get that attention on what Bitcoinhad able to attain? Thats why as a noob then it would be sensible that we should really make some indepth research about Bitcoin.You could eventually point out which one is the original oneby just looking on the numbers.",

To store bitcoins in cold wallets in order to prevent being hacked it's a security measure, but they must say to customers the exact amount of bitcoins they hold on their wallets, without inflating the numbers. Also, if an user has bitcoins deposited on the platform, they must keep funds in btc, unless there is an investment option available, so the customer has to agree in lending those funds to the platform for a determined period of time for interest.",
