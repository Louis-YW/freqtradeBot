OP I don't really understand the kind of message you are trying to convey, and secondly try not to generalize in times of this approach you are trying to make, I no that most ladies or rather women tends to leaves to other people standards when actually they cannot afford it were as giving people the mindset that women are disguising in nature which is partially true because in as much as we have bad one we also have the good ones so let's not try to generalize it.",

So I believe you have come across that statement, so why do you judge girls?If I am not mistaking, I will not use myself as an example, but I will use the statement \"THOSE\". Those girls are like a book, so you have to open that book, so you can know what's written inside, and I believe you just come across them and not get close to knowing about them before saying what you are saying.Sometimes, when we hear some stories about some people, we will feel pity for them and if we are in a better position, we might help. However, most girls have bad characters, but some still have good characters too.So don't judge because everyone have their own stories to tell.",

Her kind no plenty again for market.This should demonstrate to you that boys participate in this competition as well as girls, When they don't have any employment to perform, most of these boys used to borrowed clothes and cars to oppress other males on the street. Only a 50/50 chance exists with this issue. Not that I'm supporting girls that live expensive life because the issue with our girls is that they refuse to have their outfits cut to fit them properly. They fail to realise that living a fake life might lead them to base their decisions on what other people think of them, which is a huge red signal for their way of life. If we can condemn girls who do hook up, why shouldn't we condemn boys who plus up in the name of wanting to have a better life and change their family's history? Is it necessary to cause harm to someone in order to succeed? It's very bad and you can realise that with common sense even without refering to our religious books. I hold most parents responsible for this kind of problem since most parents are unable to raise and discipline their children, especially girls.Parents today want to raised in an English culture while neglecting our own traditional ways which has caused many issues for our girls today. How else are you going to sleep soundly in your home when your daughter is staying outside?Most of these things happen as a result of improper home training and sometimes peer group influence which have made our girls come to the conclusion that men are the ones that should provide everything for them and so they have become lazy that's why end up selling themselves for money. Both parties are wrong with their acts and their is really no reason to compete or try to measure up to standards above you.",

Telling you the truth it's really not easy for some girls as well as if some of them don't get involved in some immoral acts they may not be recognized and considering the fact that girls are weaker vessels, they don't have that energy to always carter for themselves at all times.If not that things doesn't work equally, not only girls but everyone desires to be okay in life and also succeed as others are succeeding. Everyone loves to look good despite the fact that our fingers ain't equal.",

Her kind no plenty again for market.Our economy is one of the reasons that changed the way most of our girls reason because due to the skyrocket of goods, money have no value anymore thereby making people not to be contented with what they have thereby increasing the quest to make money above all odds. I believe that if our economy was in good shape, immorality in most of our girls would have solidly be minimized. Due to economic hardship have made some of our girls to indulge in immoral stuffs just to meet up life obligation so believe that if our economy is stabilized to a unified condition it will deeply change most of the narrative that our girls have. And again our parents need to treat the girl child with caution and not provoke them to indulge in activities that will endanger their lives in the quest to meet up the standard of the society.",

Well everybody do what they think is good for them but,  that way that seemeth right unto human being might lead to destruction if they are not careful. They are not into hookup etc because they don't have skill,  most of them do have skill but they like coveting which leads them into doing rubbish.  However,  talking about woman that don't compare you with other guys doesn't mean she's 100% perfect in fact most of them are more dangerous than the ones that do fake life.",

These characteristics listed here is is also common to also our gender. there's is no need putting it only to the girls. Due to  anxiousness or overzealousness of making money, is leading The youth to commit crime on daily basis. And nobody is talking about that. Not to that am in support of the lazyness of the female gender, but just trying to justify equity. The female gender might be bad and lazy but the yohoo boys you made mention of, are they innocent? To be honest I think we the male are creating more problem in the society than the female gender. Yahoo boys have been using Young innocent ladies for rituals on daily basis but haven't heard of a lady using a man for money ritual.",
