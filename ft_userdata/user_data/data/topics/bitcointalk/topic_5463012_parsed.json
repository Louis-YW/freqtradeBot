      "body": "Also for the clueless who might fall into a trap like this, here it should be said that in this case they will ask you either for personal information or something to scam you. Lending money without requiring collateral to strangers makes it too easy for that stranger to disappear without returning the money, so they will require something which is where the trap will be to scam you. If it were a totally altruistic service they would simply donate the money and that's it. I remind everyone reading this that the OP has a red tag for running a scam site that supposedly doubled your bitcoins, on a website that is now defunct, as you might expect. Don't trust him one bit.",

I really don't like that approach because there are so many scammers doing such acts and it would be almost impossible to reveal the faces of all of those scammers sitting behind the computers that they are using for the scamming purposes. In my opinion the only thing we can do to help others be safe from such scammers is to promote awareness about such scams and the ways they use to scam new people. A single person won't be able to do anything in such case and there must be a team who would promote awareness regarding such scams on social media platforms. I know that it's easy to say something like that then doing it in actual life, but if some people want to help others to be safe from such malicious people then they only way is to take the step and continue promoting awareness regarding such scams.",

That's not the point, do you even know how doxing works? It doesn't matter if you know or don't know the people, if you have the skills and knack for investigating, you can identify these people depending on your expertise with ease. Also, you haven't watched Jim Browning reveal the faces and names of call center scammers in India. I agree with the raising awareness campaign but if we don't deal with the root of the problem, it will stay a problem nonetheless.Quote from: SamReomo on August 19, 2023, 08:35:19 PMQuote from: Latviand on August 17, 2023, 08:16:57 AM~A single person won't be able to do anything in such case and there must be a team who would promote awareness regarding such scams on social media platforms.
