Those are much more collectible than bitcoins and are worth only a fraction of what they used to go for after only a few years.",

Having the capped supply only helps the price rise by eliminating an inherent inflation that fiat (no capped supply) has, but it is not the reason.there is alot more to it than 'utility'imagine the most efficient method of acquiring bitcoin is (a)no one will want to sell below (a)imagine the most inefficient method of acquiring bitcoin is (z)no one will want to buy above (z)so look at the PoW cost of mining, which ranges(a-z) across the planet because of things like electric price differences ($0.04-$0.50 per kwh)where by right now at the 800exahash hashrate has a mining cost range of (a)$65k-(z)$375kthe market rate will speculate between (b)-(y) depending on demand and other things which people decide on, eg things like people enjoying bitcoins utility or scarcity or other featuresyou will find the pacific island nations have the highest mining cost so they are the ones fully willing to buy even to (y) because its cheaper than their(z) mining cost.. and thats the emphasis of my rant of \"more to it than 'utility'\"bitcoin will always have a value-premium range of a-z and the market price will swing/speculate between b-y... in a economic logic marketa-z itself will also change. and as long as more people want to mine it and the hashrate continues to rise long term the (a) increase will support a increase of the base value where no one wants to sell below(a) because the market rate will be above (a)the same goes for a economic logical market premiumin 2021 z was under $80k in 2025 z is under $400kmeaning the economic logic market can top out near that amount (unless someone manipulates the market outside of the logic of economics(fake orders))the only time bitcoin bubbled above its economic logic (z) was in 2011, but each cycle since, bitcoin has stayed in its periodic (b)-(y) showing the market is healthy and following economic logic...in short.. the reason gold is not sold for $2 is not due to \"utility\" its due to the mining cost of gold being not $2/ounce but instead over $1k/ounce which causes the market to speculate over $1k and wont be $2 unless something terrific happens like millions of tonnes of gold rich asteroid rained down on earth where everyone on planet can mine in their backyard with a spoon and a filter for $1 a ounce and everyone starts selling down to a $2 market",

It relies solely on the Law of Supply -- there is a direct relationship between price and supply, but it totally ignores other significant factors -- the Law of Demand, the fact that gold mining lowers the price of gold instead of supporting it, and the fact that most gold is not consumed.The Law of Demand basically states that there is a direct relationship between price and demand. Regardless, of how much it costs to mine gold, if there is less demand for it, then the price will drop. At the extreme, if there is no demand, then the price is $0, even if it costs $1k to mine it.Finally, gold mining does not support the price of gold. Instead, mining tends to cause the price to drop to cost of mining. As long as the price is higher than the cost to mine, more gold will be mined leading to more supply and lower prices. Mining does not prevent the price from going below the cost of mining.Even if the price of gold is less than the cost of mining and mining stops, there is still supply because most gold is not consumed and there are plenty of non-miners with gold to sell.Anyway, back to Bitcoin and \"utility\"...I agree that utility is not the only factor in the price because utility determines demand and the Law of Demand is not the only factor. The price is determined by the convergence of the Laws of Supply and Demand.However, it is correct to say that utility does support the price because more utility increases demand, while the cost of mining does not support the price because a higher cost does not lower supply.",

For bitcoin, it's not just a utility but also useful in different ways. It can be used in different ways like as payment method, investment and more. So, if many people wanted to use bitcoin then the demand will increase hence why the price increase. If you copy your statement then it's a plagiarized content.",

Collectible items are bought for only the purpose of displaying it and bragging rights for having it. Some of them may not be that valuable later on if the trend passes and no one really cares or remembers about your collectible item.This is why memecoins are often not valuable after a couple of years sometimes even months. It has no purpose at all. Compared to bitcoin where this is a currency you can use to transact with about anyone at any place through any platform securely and easily. Something that a lot of memecoins lack.",

It's not that easy. You mention Star Wars, I don't like Star Wars and I would never buy anything related to it, and if one day there will be no people left (or very few) who care about Star Wars than whatever collectible you have will have no value because no one would buy it. The same goes with Pokemon cards, stamps, etc, if there is no interest the price will go to zero because those are just objects that you buy and put on a shelf.

Well, despite the resistance some are showing I'm impressed that lots are gradually waking up to Btcoin but it's not enough yet since a large portion of the world is yet to embrace it. On the other hand, if Bitcoin could thrive even as there's still yet to be a massive adoption of it, critics should think about how it would be when a good portion of the world embraces it, we're getting to that point anyways all it would take is time and patience but then those who are privileged to witness this early stages of this digital Gold (Bitcoin), should be seriously accumulating it for the future. The sweetest thing about it is that the government has zero control over it and that's gives everyone the right and opportunity to shape their future and that of their children, i wonder why some people are still yet to embrace it, Bitcoin is the future and the earlier people start believing in it, the better their future.",
