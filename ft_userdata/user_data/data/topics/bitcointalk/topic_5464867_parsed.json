Take time to read than post as a beginner and you will understand the forum the better. If you take a look at my merit history, you will see how non Nigerians are the ones that are sening me most merits that I am receiving. Let us hope that theymos will answer us one day and give us another merit source, but still you will need to depend on yourself making quality posts.",

Merit is not really everything. Just like you said now reading and understand post and also understand the forum very well. not just posting anything. You must post quality article that will attract people . And also self dependent not relying on people. Another thing there is that most people always mind there business. No room to private chat anybody just O.Y.O (on your own)Â  many people were ban because nobody to guide them properly. Every body want to meet up. So the porpos of this topic is for many people who don't know who to talk to speak out there minds.",

Just rely on yourself and not others. Read more to learn more as others have said, I was like you with empty brain in the forum, nothing come from me about bitcoin but I read and learn from others. Even now I am begging people to teach me more on the areas I know that I am weak. So learning in di forum never end.

You must not have everything in life before you make someone smile... just that little push might be all someone need to overcome a major challenge or achieve a major milestone. From my experience, I have never seen one person that went down because he helped others; instead, there are countless number of persons actually succeeded because they helped others when they had the opportunity. Just like they say, life is a circle and the measure of love and support we give out, comes back to us in different ways and form. In our every changing world where the love of many is waxing cold, we should endeavor to keep in mind that \" we rise by lifting others\"",

The most difficult task as a beginner is reading. When I was introduced to this platform, I love the platform but to dedicate my time to read was a very big problem. If I read1..2..3 lines am tired. it's like someone was forcing me to do something I don't want. But I ask myself is this how you are going to succeed? People who has been here for long never get tired why must it be you? For one to succeed u must work smart to achieve what you want.There are many factor that determine ones success.1) work smart2) always have that mindset that you will make it and work on it.3) consistency4) chose your friend don't let friend chose you. Because a bad friend is a bad influence.5) always make good use of your time, time na money.6)Don't always think there is time.7) don't always ague about what you don't know.  try new things. Don't always use because the last thing you do did not favour you and say you will not try again.There are many to emphasise on but I choose these few.",

E no just happen by chance, e happen as a result of reading and learning. According to one of BrainBoss post wey him talk say reputation matter for di forum and na true, I no really need to go into details. You fit build a reputation here, if you wan learn skill or e get person wey you dey look up to as a role model, you fit reach out to di person and I believe di person go dey kind enough to guide you.

Another point I will like to emphasize on it in the area of over focusing on merits,Â  this doesn't make too much sense in the long run,Â  because we have some members here,Â  that instead of focusing on personal development and working to improve their work here,Â  they focus so much on the merit so at the end,Â  they accumulate tons of merits but lack the needed quality to sustain that level,Â  and in no distance time wether they be Hero,Â  Legendary or full member,Â  the still end up not being useful on anything around the forum even though they spend many years in the forum.
