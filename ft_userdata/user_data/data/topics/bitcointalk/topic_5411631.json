I am lazy to do more searches this night, but according to what I have read like some months ago, I think Glassnode report, more holders are not selling at $20000, this would likely be a strong support this time. But if wrong, any loss would be an unrealized loss if the bitcoin is not sold, holding for like 2 years would be a good strategy to make significant profit in my opinion.",

Maybe for now we can experience a not good looking market condition because many are in questionable and there's less people will believe that we will have a bull run on next following month.",

For now the price that fell down to $20k have once again bounced back reaching $20.2k which is a growth in short term. If the market is able to withstand the support level, we can expect slow progress from that point. For now this is good, but I find there is large chances for decline in market in the falling months.",

However, ain't surprising seeing the market that there will be a new ATH soon because this was already proven and tested that Bitcoin will always surpass the bear market trend, brace yourself and get ready for that moment, the anticipated moment that possibly will happen.",

I survived the 2018 bear market which was a lot worse than this one we are in right now. I remained with Bitcoin when the price fell from $20,000 all the way to $3,000. Now that the price is $20,000, I don't think I'd be bothered to stick with it some more. The possibility is open for Bitcoin to move to either direction.",

Next year might be different though, so we will see.As for the reasons, I'm seeing that the bulls will not let it go down again, will maintain the $20k barrier which we did after going below it in the last 2 days. We we have regain the important support so we are good to sustain it. Perhaps the Mt. Gox is still something that we have to look at, but it seems that it is already price it at the rehab could be in fiat and other cryptos if I'm not mistaken.",

In addition, the majority of investors realized that we are in a bear market and that they cannot expect significant profits in the short term, which together with the news of inflation, which is measured in double digits, dissuades the majority of retail investors from deciding to invest in Bitcoin.Moreover, many will be forced to sell part or all of the Bitcoin they have in order to pay bills that are getting bigger and bigger every month, and this will create even more pressure on the price. All things considered, the current price is more than good, although many are disappointed after they were convinced that the bulls had taken control and taken us to $25 000.",
