  "content": "I consider myself a gambling addict. However, unlike gambling addicts, I'm aware of my addiction and I know how to control it. What I love most is playing poker and also sports betting. The latter is the one that screws me the most. Even though, I can get some real good profits,sometimes I get wild and end up losing all of my money.To avoid, running after the loss, I have set up the responsible gambling in my account and it helps me a lot to control the bad beats against my will to recharge my account and ending up losing it all again. For me this has been working for quite some time and it was a way I found to prevent me from throwing money that I need away.Any of you guys uses the responsible gambling feature? If so, what do you think about it? Is it helpful or does it only gives you a sense of control",

I remember that i have found the feature on Betcoin a few years ago. I dunno if they still have it.As for the functionality of the feature itself, it is a feature for players that can easily lose their way after a few bad beats. It allows for players to set upmaximum deposits/monthand daily top expending, so I believe this is something that cryptocasinos should implement.",

      "body": "This feature is very useful to those who have chronic gambling addiction and can sometimes feel the extreme urge in going ham with their bet amounts. Luckily for me I treat gambling as if it's a part of my weekly routine and never had any extreme urge to bet beyond my set budget every week. Heck, there are even times that I forget that I need to gamble to pass time because I was busy doing something else. I have heard of casinos and gambling platforms having self-exclusion system, but not this responsible gambling feature. It would be nice if they can roll this out and give addicts a chance to enjoy the game and not destroy themselves in the process. Just imagine someone routinely gambling just to have their fill (like me) which are sometimes experiencing the sudden urge to recoup their losses. Disabling their deposits is a good way to combat the urge, and the player would certainly not complain—although he/she will, understandably be annoyed with it—because they know they activated this feature and enrolled their accounts to it. This is better than having to forcefully have the addict 'quit' the habit in an instant IMO, and might even help the gambler reconsider their choices by enforcing this downtime unto them.

I think it should be a mandatory feature to all crypto casinos, or to any other online casinos/physical casinos in the world in order to not get people addicted to gambling. They can keep their business and their profits without destroying someone else's lives.",

      "body": "I know about it and I don't think that I need it because I've never felt the drive to get back right away, or maybe never felt it to be strong enough to deposit again after a loss. I usually have very little money to gamble and I try to divide it so that I can kill some time playing. Say I play poker and I know I only have $100 on my account. I'll try to bet low and if I come close to running out of money, I'll prepare myself mentally for that loss and think about the things I'll do when it happens. For me it's never a way to get rich. I don't try to save up for something and I don't bet money I cannot afford to lose. Most of my bets, e.g. sports, are so low that it doesn't really matter if I win or lose. A win will boost my confidence, make me feel good throughout a day, but if I lose it's not a problem. No boost, on that day, but no feeling down either.",

Being end up disappointed and regrettable is part of being a gambler. It's also just fine to feel sad and not in good mood after a loss because \"no one\" is excused from being hit by emotional feelings.As far as my own approach is concerned, there's nothing really specific about what I do to control my bankroll. If I feel like gambling, I will just enter the scene because I do like to do it at that time. Likewise, there's also no specific time when I need to stop. It's all on me depending on my mood.We just have to follow our own way of how to be responsible gamblers and try to keep it that way.",

That function is of course built in to protect the gambler, but on the other hand, gambling sites prefer not to do this because they will lose customers that way. I thought that from a certain angle of a gambling commission there are also rules attached to this, but that differs enormously per jurisdiction.

If you lock the account, you're not allowed playing into the casino depends on the type Self Exclusion you choose.No multi-account, no playing to the casino!This is a different feature compared to what OP is stating. Self-exclusion just disallows you to get inside the platform for a certain amount of time, and at that time-frame you are not going to receive any promotions, updates, news, or whatever that comes from the casino tempting you to login and deposit. That 'responsible gambling' feature just limits your account in a way that you will not be able to deposit anything after a certain threshold in losses or deposits in the account is reached. You can still visit the casino, you can still check what games are there and what's happening around, but you will not be able to play since you will literally not be able to deposit for a certain period of time, or until that feature cools down/resets. It's a lot more flexible and a lot more appealing than self-exclusion wherein you will literally forbid yourself into logging in on the site. IMO self-exclusion is not the way to go; you should be able to let go of your bad habits slowly over time and not in one big dump as it may even trigger you to visit the casino once more and do even worse than before (relapse). With the feature OP is stating, it teaches you how to be a responsible gambler while still enjoying the games that you love.",

Is it helpful or does it only gives you a sense of controlPlease explain to me, what kind of responsible gambling features are you referring to in your thread, I'm a little unclear on it. but by the way, speaking of gambling. related to winning or losing, or to avoid losses or chase losses, what difference do you think. because for me, it makes no difference at all. basically, we love gambling. and behind this one hobby, of course it is very risky and we all realize that. moreover, if someone overdoes it, the impact can be bad. whether it's on mental health, material, addiction, and all things that affect human psychology.referring to what you said, that you consider yourself an addict, but on the other hand how can you become a responsible gambler as in the title of this thread. at least, you should explain it in a little more detail so that we understand better or can also help other members here who feel they are addicted to gambling. even so, if you are a responsible gambler. at least, you have a fairly high self-control.For me, gambling is a great pastime on the sidelines after a busy day at work. even so, the most important thing is not to overdo the activity. and the thing that needs to come first is, I have to manage my household finances first. as a husband, I will prioritize finances for my partner and allocate only a few percent of the monthly money for this one hobby. after all, the fact is that in every gambling session that we will not always lose isn't it. if it wins, it is luck. if I lose, I will come back another time at least there is a break to recover my financial health.apart from it all. IMO, at its core is understanding and not just being responsible. understanding is important, moreover we must know the essence of what we are gambling for. for me, for fun entertainment nothing more. and if I'm lucky, I consider it a bonus.",

The discipline you muster to abide by the limit is what is most notable. I for one don't like getting too engrossed with gambling on my phone, because the limits set might just be frustrating, mostly when it is fun I intend to have. It is in such cases I patronize the gambling place in my locale with a certain budget stipulated for that purpose. If I find myself seeking whom to get extra casa from to keep gambling, then i know i have exceeded my limit for the day and call it quits.The responsible gambling feature has promise, as it is a sure innovative approach towards regulating gambling activities and keeping the unresponsible gamblers without a control for their appetite, at bay.",

I guess now I understand what you actually meant by \"Responsible Gambling\" feature, because at first when I heard the name I was kind of confused. But moreover, in as much that a gambling addict gamble more than they could afford to lose, implementing this feature on a casino will do no better without the consent of the individual ready and willing to control how much he/she gamble with daily, weekly or monthly. Because for someone to be tagged \"Addictive gambler\", there is a high tendency such individual have like 3 to 5 casinos he/she gambles with, so of what benefit will it be having this feature on casino \"x\" while he/she still has an alternative of \"y\" and \"z\".So for me, having a responsible gambling first start with a mindset.",
