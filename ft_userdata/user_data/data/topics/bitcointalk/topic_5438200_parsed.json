Electrum never blocks access to your btc as you control the keys yourself. If electrum servers are down, you can easily just export your keys to another safe wallet and spend your coins by your own. You dont need a customer support for this. Its a shame that ppl still fall for such scams. Please educate yourself more before holding any bitcoins  Once again, sorry for your loss mate, the amount is huge (atleast for many ppl).",

Please educate yourself more before holding any bitcoins  Once again, sorry for your loss mate, the amount is huge (atleast for many ppl).This reminds me of a thread I came across a few days ago with the question, \"is it possible to buy bitcoins without basic knowledge\" and the OP's case was the obvious answer to that question. Buying bitcoin may not be too difficult, but holding it safe is another story. Newbies were too hasty in owning bitcoin without knowledge and fell into the trap and pay a heavy price. Condolences to the OP's loss, I think you already know what you need, please add your knowledge immediately.",

Why did you trust them if you never hold that much money in the first place?Also, most decentralized wallets don't have the kind of support as Coinbase/centralized platform does (resetting your password, etc). Hopefully, you can learn from this and avoid being scammed again by someone pretending to be official support in the future.

Newbies were too hasty in owning bitcoin without knowledge and fell into the trap and pay a heavy price. It applies to most things in my opinion, especially if it is tech-related. You should never use things you have no knowledge of (even the basic ones) in the first place.",

On the one hand, the one who deceived you is guilty, but you are equally guilty because you believed in such a foolish thing. This type of scam is one of the simplest, but it also seems to be very effective, whether it is selling watch-only wallets or paying some kind of fees to enable the withdrawal of funds.I hope you've learned your lesson, in the end it's just money that you obviously have - otherwise you wouldn't be able to allow yourself to throw it around so lightly.",

It should clear things up a bit, but I'm 100% sure you're being scammed. No exchange and no real wallet will demand money from you to allow withdrawal of deposited funds.",
