I left my [successful] career as a lawyer, I started coding and I went into academia and completed my PhD about blockchain.I’d like to share my concerns about the future of Bitcoin. About its value, not price. About its purpose and utility. As I was always a true believer of Bitcoin and its open competitive consensus.I projected bitcoin’s market dominance - and it indicates it is going to lose at least half of its market value within the next 3-5 years. And probably sooner or later  will give ground to Ethereum.Though the problem is more than that. It has been locked in a paradigm that does not work. It had to become a [global] peer-to-peer electronic cash. The title and abstract of Nakamoto’s paper clearly state these goals. But who even uses it as cash? I am looking at the number of transactions and I see pure speculation. When was the last time someone bought anything for bitcoin? (ok, maybe on this forum there are more chances to see these rare people, but ask anyone in your town). It is not money and will not become so in its true meaning.If you take a look at Top 10 on coinmarketcap you will see only Bitcoin and Dogecoin - two pure cryptocurrencies that are left in this list. Others are application platforms.I clearly realise that Bitcoin should change its strategy.Bitcoin still has one fundamental advantage - it is the most secure digital repository that humankind has ever created. This should be leveraged in its transformation into a web3/dapp platform. Unfortunately, this Turing-complete smart contract narrative completely misled people, and apps on Bitcoin-like systems and apps on them are perceived as flawed systems, which is not true. Throughout years of my academic research I came across a number of techniques of application development on bitcoin-like ledgers. I can say with 100% certainty there is no lack of technologies and techniques of developing well-designed and functional applications on Bitcoin, including token-applications. It is a matter of the community and its leaders - where they want to direct Bitcoin. Before anything dramatic happens, before irreversible processes begin, I’d put my efforts with other thinkers into Bitcoin’s greater future. If you wish to hear more thoughts about it you’re welcome to watch my video and join the discussion down below.https://youtu.be/b_mWdQSZgPU*********UPDATE:Since many folks perceived that I was talking about forking, changes in the core, or sidechaining, I should clarify that I was not. And I am not trying to raise money for anything. I am referring to various techniques of app development using anchoring (publishing data on blockchain). Probably the most known is OMNI Layer. I came across different techniques of app dev on blockchains (not only Bitcoin) and realized that there are methods and techniques that are worth looking at. So, to mind nothing really limits app development on Bitcoin (including creation of digital assets). Of course, there could better conditions for that. For example, block size or better scripts for publishing data (more data), etc. But look at it from another perspective - Bitcoin as a resource is limited, it should be limited and expensive - it is what it is, and it is what it makes Bitcoin the most secure repository - a digital stronghold. So, I'd work with it. And I’m pretty sure there will others who'd like to enjoy such an infrastructure for their dApps. Combining best practices of app development is the right answer. In a while I’ll elaborate on that in the Tech section of the forum.",

And coinmarketcap can't be used as a gauge, of course, Bitcoin will remain on top on the list, it's the prime mover and if ever there will be challenges for it at the top, it should happen in the first 10 years as there are crypto like ETH or even XRP that time that is like battling it out with BTC (remember the so called Flippening/Rippening)?",

And probably sooner or later  will give ground to Ethereum.There are so many things wrong with this statement First of all what you are looking at is not \"market dominance\" at all. It is \"market capitalization ratio\" where you divide bitcoin's market cap with sum of thousands of shitcoins' market cap.Secondly market cap and its ratio has nothing to do with value at all. It is a product of price * supply and since shitcoins have huge supplies and there are thousands of them, the ratio is small and shrinking as new shitcoins are created or old shitcoins like ethereum with unlimited supply create more supply.Finally a useless shitcoin that relies on being pumped such as ethereum is never going to be able to gain a value higher than bitcoin specially with unlimited supply and lack of real world applications. Just look at the charts from 2017 to 2023, this shitcoin has been dumping consistently ever since the ICO mania in 2017 where it reached about 0.15BTC and it is currently worth half of that since it's been dumping!QuoteIt had to become a [global] peer-to-peer electronic cash.Wrong.Bitcoin didn't \"have to\" do anything. Bitcoin is A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System just like it was on day one. It is always an \"option\" for people seeking financial sovereignty and is not supposed to replace anything or dominate the world as a money. QuoteBut who even uses it as cash?Lots and lots of people. Just look at the number of merchants accepting bitcoin as payment, look at the payment processors that help many merchants receive payments, etc.QuoteI am looking at the number of transactions and I see pure speculation.LOL bitcoin transactions don't have a \"purpose\" field attach to them for you to see their intention.QuoteWhen was the last time someone bought anything for bitcoin?Every second of every day.You want real world examples? Get out in the world and look around. For example there is a computer hardware shop near me that accepts bitcoin payments and last I asked them they said they receive a decent number of payments in bitcoin.QuoteIf you take a look at Top 10 on coinmarketcap you will see only Bitcoin and Dogecoin - two pure cryptocurrencies that are left in this list. Others are application platforms.If you look at that website's history you see that the market capitalization sorted list is always updated with the new hype trend. For example in early days the hype was innovation and new ideas so we saw coins like Namecoin, Litecoin, etc. on top. Then it was copycat coins that could pump a lot so we saw a wave of them be on top. The most recent hype is token scam so the token platforms are hot and on top until a new hype comes along.QuoteThis should be leveraged in its transformation into a web3/dapp platform. Nonsense.

Many years ago someone else tried corrupting bitcoin and making it irrelevant like other shitcoins by changing the protocol and introducing flaws into the system. He failed so he went on to creating his own shitcoin called ethereum that is known to be the ultimate scam, a platform for creating useless tokens that have only managed to attract scammers and gamblers and has been dying as the fever wears off.",

Cryptocurrency is not money - it is a unit of account in the decentralized infrastructure for dApps.Why not both then?Sure it's disrupting stuff, but it's rubbing off on people in he wrong way. Instead of using it as money they are using it as a sort of investment vehicle.I don't know if any non-stablecoin crypto that has had a relatively steady price similar to currencies.",

As I was always a true believer of Bitcoin and its open competitive consensus.We are actually tired of everyone coming with different approach and perception they feels about bitcoin in other to stop misleading others on what bitcoin represent, just as you've said on your statement here, of you truly believe in the consensus protocol and how the blockchain work together in achieving this.Quote from: Oleksiiko on February 21, 2023, 11:39:13 PMI projected bitcoin’s market dominance - and it indicates it is going to lose at least half of its market value within the next 3-5 years. And probably sooner or later  will give ground to Ethereum.How will you be making comparison between bitcoin and altcoins, they all have different protocols they follows even though they both fall under cryptocurrencies, bitcoin price can not be traded for other alts not to talk of it value, you know this when bitcoin rises they also follow and when it drops, they also fell drastically.",

Application narratives. Cryptocurrency is not money - it is a unit of account in the decentralized infrastructure for dApps.In other words, you want Bitcoin to become something that would suit you the most, and that would be some kind of endless creation of applications and tokens on which people like you would profit  - unless you left a lucrative job as a lawyer to become some new Satoshi or rather correct (according to you) his idea of Bitcoin as a currency?If you think that your idea makes sense and that you will save Bitcoin, you have the option, like many others, to make a fork and convince people to follow you. Quote from: Oleksiiko on February 22, 2023, 03:19:22 AMLook, I don't know how deep you understand the potential of blockchain based applications (generally speaking, including smart contracts specifically as a kind of blockchain based app). I spent four years 2016/20 conceptualizing a design of a blockchain based real estate registry. In 2021, I was invited to speak before the 'Fintech' Committee of the Australian Senate You Australians really have strange intentions when it comes to Bitcoin, I mean considering a so-called doctor from that same country claims to be Satoshi - are you perhaps in some kind of family or business relationship?",

It doesn't have to be globally accepted to be money. You can use an example of prison money where they use cigarettes and packs of instant noodles as money. Bitcoin is money because it can be used to buy numerous things online. You can find a long list of stores that accept it. Over the years I used bitcoin to buy a lot of things. Not as many as I bought with fiat money but I'm trying to save my bitcoin and spend fiat. Bitcoin isn't only for speculation. I'm a type of saver by nature and when there was no bitcoin I used to save foreign currencies in cash, jewelry, silver coins. Bitcoin is superior to all of these.",
