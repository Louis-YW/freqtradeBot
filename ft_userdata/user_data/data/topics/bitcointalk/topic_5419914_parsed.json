Most cryptos are best with short term investment. It is more like a hit and run project. Wait for a pump take the profit and walkout on the coin but when talking about Bitcoin investment then short-term investment doesn't work well because it takes a long time to make a bull run, another long time to make a correction and a longer time to consolidate. Overtrading is what makes many good strategy of less effect. Less trading and more reviews will boast any trading strategy because it gives so much time to look out for possible loopholes and mistakes but Overtrading keeps the focus on making profit not minding if the strategy is well applied.Mental Health is like a key to any good result. Stay safe because the market is always busy and profitable. I have a trading target every week and i make sure once i hit that target i close trading for that week even if it takes me two days to makes that very amount i end my trade then have enough time to examine myself, my strategy and possible improvements ahead of the next week",

Now that the price of cryptocurrency is still low in the market for investors to use the opportunity to buy and hold for a better future to come. it will be favourable to stop panicking in this bearish season than to continue holding your coins till the price hit higher. I don't think, it is advisable for investors to make use of Short term investments in this bearish season, because it will not help the Short term investors to grow higher like the way long term investors have hope of making a good incomes from their investments when the bullish season appear in the market.",

All three prompt emotional decision-making. Remember, the market doesn’t care about your feelings; charts are just visual representations of information. It’s up to you how you interpret it. This is an objective process where emotions have no place.  - Indeed, the market does not care about the emotions that an individual trader will feel in the crypto space, that is because the market has no emotions.That's why most people always remind me and it's been a long time here in this forum to always \"invest only the amount you can afford to lose\" or do your research before you invest\"Also, the actual practice of trading requires a thorough study first of how to understand what is on the graph or chart and to know its tools and how to use them properly and correctly.",

      "body": "This can be summarized more simply with an explanation per factor. It's hard to understand if there isn't.What I mean is this. For Panic = FOMO. That's already the thing that could happen. Whether it's a bear market or a bullish market, it's applicable. Panic selling or panic buying. And the fear of missing out is the general thing to see. It's the one that could mean avoidance in trading.Putting in Emotional Efforts = brings a whole lot of meaning. It's not going to be good just saying that because it means you will put emotions. And emotions are trouble when you are trading or in anything you do. Emotions are a problem. It would be best if you thought long-term about anything. That's the key to success.Overtrading = It's a problem if you are losing. It's okay if you are making a profit—other factors like your emotions about losses and other issues that issues could affect it.Mental health = It's the peace of mind that everyone wants to become more evident, more apparent thinking, and make okay decisions. It's a good guide. But having mental health as the last doesn't make sense because the list says the things you must avoid. Why avoid mental health? That doesn't make any sense.",

Sticking with the top coins is always advisable, Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and some other coins will not disappoint in the long, they never did. A bear market is testing our patience and will, but instead of overthinking it (that most likely will lead to some mistake) simply holding and focusing on how to get more coins is the best strategy in these times.",
