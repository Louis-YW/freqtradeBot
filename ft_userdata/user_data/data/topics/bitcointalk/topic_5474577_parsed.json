Do you think that this will ever make it to market, and cheap enough that the average person can afford it?Researchers discover breakthrough “switch” that causes cancer cells to self-destructhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-11-17-researchers-discover-breakthrough-switch-cancer-cells-self-destruct.htmlResearchers at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento, California have made a breakthrough discovery for the future of cancer treatments. The research team found a biological “switch” that causes cancer cells to self-destruct. This discovery will impact the lives of over 18 million Americans who are dealing with invasive cancer on a yearly basis. The findings were recently published in the journal Cell Death and Differentiation.The research team was able to identify and activate a crucial epitope that signals a swift death of the cancer cell. This biomedical discovery will open the door to improved cancer treatment protocols. Currently, the standard of care for cancer treatment involves surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. While initially successful, these modalities are often ineffective against therapy-resistant cancers that return more aggressively, ravaging their host.Researchers discover crucial epitope that can be activated to kill off resistant cancer cellsCancer cells have cell membranes that contain protein receptors known as CD95 receptors. Also known as Fas, these receptors are designed to destroy the cancer cell. Once they are activated, they will release a signal that causes the cell to self-destruct. The trick to killing the cancer cells off is found in a crucial epitope (or a segment of a larger protein) on the CD95 receptor. The UC Davis research team, led by senior author Jogender Tushir-Singh, said their discovery is the first to successfully target the kill “switch.”“We have found the most critical epitope for cytotoxic Fas signaling, as well as CAR T-cell bystander anti-tumor function,” Mr. Tushir-Singh said in a statement. ...",
