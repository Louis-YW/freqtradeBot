  "content": "Hi, I had a balance of 23 or 12 ltc in my trust wallet that I received as a payment from a customer. The customer used the bestexcgange site and sent it I think the exchange rate was different from what I expected was a russian customer. When I asked why this amount came, he threw a screenshot from that site. When the balance appeared in the wallet, I did not do any other checks, I delivered the service to the customer. I think I've never bought ltc in that trust wallet before. It was the first deposit. A few months later I needed the balance and when I wanted to withdraw it to my stock exchange account I could not withdraw due to dust utxo error. I then tried again from time to time but was never able to withdraw the balance. Today, when I investigated the error a little, I could not find a detailed solution, I sent a new 0.045 ltc from another wallet thinking that there was a transfer fee error with a little anger. the balance that can no longer be withdrawn has completely disappeared from the wallet :') Now it seems that only 0.045 ltc.Is there a way to recover it? Can you help?Address:Code:ltc1q8alw67ktyq86v7749y6y4em0es0uexs0l5pn26",

I wanted to point out that your problem is supposed to occur at any time for all those who use trading platforms as a main wallet and are not afraid of transferring assets between them without using a personal wallet whose mission is to receive and send assets privately. It is unfortunate that most users do not care to know the differences between wallets.Btw, trustwallet is not a private a wallet In case you think so.",

      "body": "I'm sorry to hear about the issue you're facing with your Trust Wallet balance. It's possible that the remaining balance may have been accidentally sent to another address, or there may be a technical issue with the Trust Wallet application itself.One thing you could try is to use a block explorer, such as blockchair.com, to track the movement of your LTC balance. You can enter your wallet address into the search bar and it will display all the transactions associated with that address. This may help you identify where your remaining balance went.If you're unable to locate your missing LTC balance, you may want to contact Trust Wallet's customer support team for assistance. They may be able to provide more information or help you recover your missing funds. It's important to keep in mind that cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, so there's no guarantee that you'll be able to recover your missing funds.In the future, it's important to always double-check transaction details before sending or receiving cryptocurrency to avoid any potential errors or loss of funds.",
