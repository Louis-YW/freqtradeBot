Happy Halving to You All.Nothing which we are experiencing today is never new to us old Bitcoin investors, as that's how the transaction fee has always skyrocketed and then later gone back to normal, which I'm sure this case is not going to be any different, as this is either likely to take time or okay sooner. Hence, I think this information should be directly channeled to newbies who may be experiencing this for their first time to not worry, as the fee will surely come down, because at the moment of writing this post, I was able to have a check on mempool.space, for recent transaction fee, and could noticed that the fee has drop abit as for \"Low Priority\" transaction it's fee is 91 sat/vB, e.t.c, as shown below",

I had thought after the ordinal’s madness which are still bothering the bitcoin network but to me will die down after the bull run and Altcoins investors are done taking their profits, we now find ourselves with another issue of Minting. Still I stand that after bull even this will no longer be a nuisance on the network, but before then the hype will even soon die down. For anyone looking to invest and the transaction fee is a barrier then I will say wait till they die down a bit and you can simply buy your bitcoin as there is no time too late to buy it. Do not panic to buy and leave on CEXs with the intention to move them later on after the transaction fee must have reduced. It is a huge risk because no one can tell you the safety of a CEX.",

Not only disheartening but frustrating to think the possibility of this kind of activities repeating to disrupt the Bitcoin transaction.  I believe that there is really a need for the developer to take action and prevent this kind of on-chain minting and protect the network from unnecessary congestion created by outside factors.Quote from: Zaguru12 on April 21, 2024, 10:43:01 PMFor anyone looking to invest and the transaction fee is a barrier then I will say wait till they die down a bit and you can simply buy your bitcoin as there is no time too late to buy it.

True that, I do not think that the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket soon that we need to FOMO and buy it today when the price of transaction fee is skyrocketing.  The increase in tx fee is not due to the coins trading/transfer volume but rather due to the minting of Rune that has nothing to do with Bitcoin market.  So yeah, it makes sense to wait a bit later when the tx fee goes back to normal again so that we won't get exposed to the possible risk of losing funds when we let our fund sleep on CEX for some time.",

Happy Halving to You All.I don't think there's a lot of people getting panic but rather they find it just a normal incident happen on bitcoin since its expected to have that huge fees if there's big changes happen on the market. Everyone understand than fees will  go lower and everything goes back to normal just like what happens to it for so many times. Bitcoin price still at good figures so there's really nothing to worry about since the current market condition would not affect the emotion of people but rather they would stay waiting to see the effect after the halving occur.For now fear is not to be seen but rather a lot of people speculating about more positive gains in future. There's still lots of good possibilities and I think majority is in focus with that then ignore those negative thoughts made by some people.",

The fees now are more reasonable, still high but if you need to send 3-4 figures they don’t seem that bad.After the halving it was crazy high like 1000 sats which were like $150 for a simple transaction. Even Ethereum during those crazy 2017 ICO days was never this bad. Hopefully we have seen the worse for these Rune transaction spams.",

I bet you don't want to make a transaction where the fee is higher than what you will send or receive, right? So it most likely affects many things that are relying on the transaction network, but it can't be helped because the halving event just finished and the runes are one of the causes of this high and congested market. Anyway,  you will still notice that there are people who are still doing transactions in the market and the fees are too high. I wonder what kind of person would do that; maybe they are too rich in order to afford that, or the transaction is needed to be done at all costs. Anyway, it's a waste that some of us can't do transactions right now, but let's just wait for some time. I'm sure the fees will go down to a single digit at some point.",
