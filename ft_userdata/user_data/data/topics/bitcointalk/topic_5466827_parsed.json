As we all know that Shakur has a high boxing IQ and in this kind of mistakes that his opponent makes, he will simply throw a counter either to the body or to the chin.And the thing with Edwin Delos Santos is that his chin has been broken already, although he did get up from the canvass and score a knockout win, but still though, if someone has crack your jaw already, it's just a matter of time before someone does it again.",

Yes and it's a easy route for Shakur to win another belt at 135 lbs. Not sure though if Haney will vacant it as he will have a fight at 140 lbs and then still go down and back to 135 lbs are a regular champion and then him and Shakur could meet.",

Stevenson might not make quick work of the challenger, but he's still going to come out on top in terms of scores and knock downs if it ever goes the distance. A bet on a knockout will be the most value here. ML is just straight up favoring Stevenson no matter where you will look once the odds are up.",

He will simply break down any of his opponents. And sometimes he will beat them to their own game, so that's how great Shakur is.But at least he has found a dance partner that is willing, and so this is a go now and most likely it will be like Stevenson on 1.2x as favorite, I reckon.",

The latter may have some advantage, of course, but I still think that this will be a good fight to see.",

But as you have said, if a KO is presented itself, then boxers will go for it. It might not mean a knockout through a huge punch in the face, but maybe a body punch will do as Stevenson is also known to be a big body puncher or least he makes it as a target to slow down his opponents and then maybe go for the kill later. And if De Los Santos weakness is going for a maximum range in his every punch, then for sure Stevenson is going to used that and time him with a good counter either to the face or body and so the possibility of a KO win.",

Well, one thing is for sure, both boxers wanted the vacant belt even if it's just an interim title for the meantime but that is still the same because if Haney will continue his journey at 140 then that means that whoever wins this bout, he will be a regular champion after Haney will be stripped.But I got to say though, Shakur really got an upper hand because his IQ is different and with experience, I know he can handle Santos. Shakur wouldn't be feared at 135 by Loma, Isaac and even Haney if he's not even that hard to fight but he is really hard to crack that is why those guys chose to avoid him rather than face an imminent embarrassment.",
