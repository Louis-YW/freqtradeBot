Yes their involvement is helpful because they will invest money where they think is better, giving money to good ideas.2. Bitcoin doesn't need them to survive.

Also the increase of liquidity of crypto all over the exchange is due to the VC that investing on exchange and other project liquidity. Without them most of the orderbook is very thin because retail traders usually don’t set limit orders on there trade.They are helpful and essential on crypto growth because we can freely buy and sell crypto anytime using huge amount compared before that we can’t trade high amount without giving huge price impact to the market. Exchange is worst before if you need to liquidate your asset immediately because market order will give you pretty low result than the estimated value when you do limit order due to lack of liquidity.Crypto will survive without them but the growth will be slow since there will be low resources to fund the project’s development.",

But I am not going to make any investor in Bitcoin feel bad. It’s their choice. I use Bitcoin and if I am lucky enough to get bitcoin and also find ways to increase my portfolio with it I would appreciate that. My main concern or reason in joining Bitcoin was my curiosity and how it can help out the financial system. Crypto-currency is risky and I can’t over emphasize that, entering Venture capital in crypto-currency without researching would not have a happy ending.",

Obviously, the additional funding is definitely helpful, but generally there's some sort of motive towards putting that money where they choose. Obviously, I'm not saying all are absolutely terrible, but the vast majority are probably more hurtful than they're helpful.

You may want to define an abbreviation you're using for the first and which isn't a popular terminology. It's a good way to start. Don't take this for granted. Assumption is not a good way to start or leave a thing. You took for granted that everyone knows what a VC is and I've read a couple of wavering comments on that. Now, in your conception, what is a VC? I believe a proper alignment of that will get you real responses to the question you asked.",

Do you think their involvement is helpful?It is both helpful and harmful.Helpful because VCs will expose cryptocurrency to more people. They already have their own networks and are able to expand their networks quickly with resources they have. More exposure, more cryptocurrency enthusiasts and more capital will pour into this market.Harmful because VCs can be scam groups too. With this side effect, they will make people feeling more negatively about this market.Quote2. Can crypto still survive without them? It will do. Before 2020 bull run, importance of VCs was smaller dramatically and we had this market since 2009 without VCs or with less VCs.Similarly for the cryptocurrency market without China, USA. it will still exist but short term effects should be very big. The market and its investors will be shocked and panic.",

Venture capital firms play a crucial role in providing funding for early-stage startups, allowing them to develop their technologies and bring their products to market. Without this funding, many cryptocurrency startups may struggle to get off the ground, limiting the growth and innovation in the industry.Without venture capital, it is possible that the pace of development in the cryptocurrency industry would be slower, as startups would have to find alternative sources of funding. This could include things like crowdfunding campaigns or relying on the support of a dedicated community of users. It is also possible that the industry would become more centralized, with a smaller number of larger companies dominating the market, rather than the diverse ecosystem of startups that currently exists.Overall, the absence of venture capital would likely have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry, potentially limiting its growth and innovation.",
