Asked this because you've mentioned that you \"started from scratch\".If you didn't intended to use -loadblock, I'd suggest you to just let the node sync normally by skipping that command line option.Also, try to set the default start-up block verification first and just change them to your preference later once it's stable.Specifically: checkblocks=\"24\" which is set a bit high from the default (6) and checklevel=\"0\" which skips all verification of checkblocks.If you can afford to discard the 20GB of already downloaded blocks and since -reindex didn't work, you can try to start with fresh datadir.(backup your current datadir before doing so)",
