      "body": "As the price has dropped, so has the price of mining equipment. So, it's a good time to buy miner now. But what you need to consider is buying new or used? What is your budget? As well as local electricity bills, the environment in which you place the miner, etc. Or do you have a miner model you want to know about? So that we can give more specific suggestions.",

That is because if you even make the slightest attempt to dump your coinbase fees and transaction fees, the market will notice and you will set it in full reverse again.",

One btc still remains One btc, and that is what you should be your overall motivation. If you plan to buy a miner, go ahead and do so, btc will not continue to decline even if the situation currently looks as though there is no end. I believe that if you have an interest in mining and you have settled and put under control the other factors necessary for successful mining, go ahead without consideration of the decline.",
