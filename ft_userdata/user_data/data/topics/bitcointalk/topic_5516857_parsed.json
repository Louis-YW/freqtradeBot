      "body": "Bitcoin has indeed exceeded my expectations. Not only its price has reached too far, but also its popularity globally amazes everyone. No one would thought in the first place that bitcoin will be this hyped and trending, but we all know the excellent potentials of bitcoin, so it's not surprising at all. There's still a lot of positive updates await for bitcoin, and we as bitcoiners, should always look forward for a brighter future waiting ahead of us.",

Despite having sold at a fairly cheap price, some mistakes have been corrected over time, which increasingly believes that investing in Bitcoin in the long term will provide extraordinary benefits. Just imagine we used to be from the lower class with mediocre finances but little by little were able to step up to improve our fate and that was thanks to Bitcoin which provided a bridge to achieve it.",

A short term holder can have his expectations in those period be met too, they could be aiming for a certain percentage pump and still get it or even more. As for me my expectations were to how it will handle the situation of manipulation and seriously overcoming it has been a thing that actually has exceeded my expectations, also the reduced volatility was something I envisioned and currently it is meeting it gradually",

      "body": "As far as the price is concerned, it has exceeded my expectation, a lot. When I first purchased Bitcoin, the price was much cheaper, less than a thousand, around $500. Never in my wild yet optimistic imagination that it would even hit $10,000. But then it even reached $20,000 just a little more than a year later. Today, it's above $71,000. But as far as my idealistic imagination of a decentralized online money is concerned, it hasn't met my expectations. When I first tried to understand Bitcoin, I was thinking of a revolutionary internet currency. But I was made to realize very early how this isn't that easy to happen because of transaction fees.",

The first time I see Bitcoin reach $20k, I just though that \"Wow, it is a big big big dream for me that what I did before can gives me a big profit\" so I feels excited to continue what I did. I am sure that Bitcoin investors never though as me. Those who bought below $1 really made a big profit. We really never expect that Bitcoin can be like today so I am sure Bitcoin investors will still continue what they do. Besides that, Bitcoin can be a legacy to their family.",

The average return is close to 2x from the amount I've invested, it's a good return, but it still not able to change my life.

Up until now despite many corrections and fud going around, I never doubted continuing holding my bitcoin. I saw progress, I saw results and I am confident that I will continue to see results in the future as well.As of now, I am very happy with my holdings of course if I could I’d buy more but right now my plan is to just keep holding",

When I first got into Bitcoin, I had doubts too..I couldn’t help but think it might just be another Ponzi scheme. Back then, I was new and only knew what I read from other people's comments, without really understanding how Bitcoin worked. But once I got to understand the system, that’s when I felt more confident about holding it.I have cashed out some of my holdings, though....not everything, just enough to enjoy the bull run a bit. And I’m probably gonna cash out a bit more soon; just waiting for Bitcoin to hit $100k, and then I’m good. The thing is, no one holds long-term without enjoying some profit. Even though I’ve cashed out a little, I know I’ll buy again once the bear market is back. For me, it’s all just part of the cycle - that’s my mindset on how it works. But in the big picture, I understand Bitcoin is going up.",

But once I got to understand the system, that’s when I felt more confident about holding it.Same here. To be fair, I didn’t think that it was a scam seeing how it has performed over the years. But I never just thought of it as a good investment option back then. I just thought that there’s no way I could earn a lot seeing how expensive bitcoin has gotten now. But then I learned to do DCA and I would say that bitcoin has indeed exceeded my expectations and I am excited for more. QuoteI have cashed out some of my holdings, though....not everything, just enough to enjoy the bull run a bit.

If you think you have earned enough, nothing wrong with trying to enjoy some earned money. Let’s make use of the bull run, yeah?",

And it really shows what is the future for Bitcoin, it's so resilient already even with the worst turmoil in human history in the last century or so. And most likely during the last 4 years, there are individuals who invest on it because of that, and now they could also be very happy that they might that jump as we have seen a new all time high and we could exceed that $100k that has been predicted since the start of the bull run.",
