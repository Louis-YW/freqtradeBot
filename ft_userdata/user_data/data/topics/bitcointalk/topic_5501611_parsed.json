  "content": "Bolivia, a country in South America, used to be extremely against Bitcoin. Since 2014 they have had regulations against its use, with further updates on that in 2020.But now it has all changed, and the Central Bank of Bolivia has recently removed all bans on Bitcoin transactions. Here's the X post from them:https://x.com/BancoCentralBO/status/1805997364362318143PDF link here: https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/files_noticias/CP_35%20NormativaActivosVirtuales4.pdfThis is the official statement from the central bank (in Spanish):Quote from: https://www.bcb.gob.bo/?q=content/el-bcb-en-coordinaci%C3%B3n-con-asfi-y-uif-actualiza-normativa-en-torno-los-activos-virtualesEl Banco Central de Bolivia (BCB), comunica a la opinión pública que mediante Resolución de Directorio N°082/2024, de 25 de junio de 2024 dejó sin efecto la Resolución de Directorio N°144/2020, de 15 de diciembre de 2020, habilitando, de esta manera, el uso de canales e Instrumentos Electrónicos de Pago (IEP) para operaciones de compra y venta de Activos Virtuales.They also clearly stated that this doesn't mean that Bitcoin is legal tender:Quote from: https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/files_noticias/CP_35%20NormativaActivosVirtuales4.pdfEl BCB enfatizó que la única moneda de curso legal en el país es el Boliviano conforme a la Ley N°901 de 28 de noviembre de 1986. En este sentido, un activo virtual no es una moneda de curso legal, no es efectivo y no existe obligación, por parte de la población, para recibirlos como medio de pago, por lo que los riesgos inherentes al uso y comercialización de los mismos serán asumidos por los usuarios de dichos activosSo, basically Bolivia is now at the same level of most of the developed world in terms of Bitcoin. It is legal to transact with it, but it is not seen as a legal tender.",

If you care about privacy, use Bitcoin full node and Tor to broadcast your transactions.What I care is \"Does exchanging bitcoin (buy & sell) in Bolivia is legal?\"If it is, it is nearly the same in many countries globally, not only developed nations.Quote from: Solosanz on July 01, 2024, 11:29:04 AMIt took ten years for them to consider Bitcoin isn't scam or could harm them.I think different.

Exactly. I don't see the initial rush-into-banning approach that a lot of these governments do to bitcoin technology. Many of the governments around the world only banned bitcoin out of sentiments or better still out of fear of transparency since they first got the idea of the decentralized technology as a platform where transactions are open for everyone to see while others out of total ignorance and resistance to new or emerging technologies. What have happened as a result is, they have watched more closely and interesting to see the benefits of Bitcoin and are now removing the bans against them.",

I believe what you said here and am also beginning to feel that most of the countries that are unbanning Bitcoin in their country are doing so based on what they want to achieve, political, and socio-economic recognition just like you have stated and after unbanning Bitcoin they often want to regulate it's operation. However, even if they unban Bitcoin as regards to what they stand to gain but it's a welcome development that countries are now understanding that Bitcoin is not a scam project and it's the way forward.",

This will change now, if I interpret the communication correctly the \"unban\" is the previous step for a permissive regulation of crypto services.The map on Bitcoin legality in Latin America is now getting greener slowly. The only two countries where still relatively harsh regulations are in place are Ecuador, where hodling is permitted but payment not, and Venezuela, where mining is banned. The restriction for banks and fintechs in Argentina has probably also been lifted, at least there are now fintechs offering cryptos and Paypal-style wallets.By the way, the supposed ban in Dominican Republic which can be seen in the Wikipedia article about Bitcoin legality is very likely not true. According to a recent Cointelegraph article there is even a \"progressive\" political attitude with respect to Bitcoin and crypto.",

Some Latin Nations have been facing some economic problems which include the high cost of goods caused by inflation. So it is common for them to seek means of fighting these economic issues and it seems friendly policies on Bitcoin are yielding some positive results. These nations need to attract investments and also reduce the influence of intermediaries in international payment systems and promoting Bitcoin seems to be a good option.",
