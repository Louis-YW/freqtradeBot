      "body": "it is theoretically possible to search for collisions starting from a specific private key and its associated RIPEMD-160 hash, doing so in practice is highly infeasible due to the enormous computational effort required. The security of hash functions like RIPEMD-160 relies on the assumption that such collisions are not practically achievable with current technology.",

It might seem like the odds of finding a collision are good because there are perhaps 2256-160, or 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336 private keys with that RIPEMD-160 hash. But, the probability of a number colliding is still extraordinarily small. On average, you still have to try 2160, or 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976, numbers before finding a collision.",

But i would recommend you to give up. Large Bitcoin Collider project already generate 45.28 billion keys[1], but most of the time they only find private key with balance as part of puzzle[2] (where it's key range is known). As for private key which isn't part of puzzle, people suspect it was generated with weak RNG.[1] https://lbc.cryptoguru.org/stats[2] https://lbc.cryptoguru.org/trophies",
