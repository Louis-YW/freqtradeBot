People who know math and use it well make money, people who believe in fairy tales get slaughtered. What you do in your daily life or have seen in your dream last night has no effect on the outcome of the game you are betting on. Any person with a little bit of common sense can tell you that.That kind of crap thoughts usually occur when we are kids. Most people thought (or maybe some of us still stink) that they are the headliners and everybody else are NPC's.Well, that simply isn't true.",

When you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you will make very different decisions than when you are sober. It is therefore likely that you will bet much higher amounts more easily than when you are sober. That does not always have to turn out negatively. If your bet wins, you will even gamble that way more often. Until you meet the man with the iron hammer and you get overconfident.",

If that's the result then that's the result even if the game is rigged like getting paid to lose if it's basketball or other games where the winners are expected to win the game. I do believe that your mood have an effect on yourself when deciding like which team you will place your bet since it is up to you to decide since you are the bettor and not the game or game results.",

But for some, they have such rituals on where to bet, and that's fine, we are all free to use the strategies that we think will help us in our bets.Just don't impose such practice to others as it may offend some people, but you can very well follow your own thoughts on this matter.",

I don't know why it happens to be honest.I have seen people who gamble while being in a bad economical situation and yet, they do not react negatively, so I assume it must be because other psychological factors I do not fully understand.
