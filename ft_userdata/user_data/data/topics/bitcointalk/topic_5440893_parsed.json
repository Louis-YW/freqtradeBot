I will consider about what to do. But not only removing negative trust will help you anything if you can not create a valuable post for the community. If you create valuable posts for the community you will receive merit. And if you receive merit, your rank will be up. But I think you are spamming.",

For start, stop sending PM's regarding trust feedback and selling others doxs. But why do you care? You said that you will find the money that you need elsewhere. Plus that forum's system is crap.
