Unless they unblind themselves, I think this invasion of privacy will only continue and progress.In my country, I know of a few people whining about their banks starting to introduce mandatory selection of reasons for depositing cash on your own account at several ATMs. That’s true, you insert your own banknotes in the ATM to deposit into your own account and before you’re allowed to do so, you’re asked for the source of funds or reason of deposit. How does that sound?The dystopia I’ve been trying to avoid and hope will never come is probably so much closer than it looks and sounds!",

Bitcoin transactions are not as fast compared to the cash at hand and this is due to strict rules around validation which is understandable because every country wants to put checks in place so as to regulate the inflow into its country. In years to come, Bitcoin will gain more popularity and importance.",

Because at that you don't have to stress yourself to the shop and pay the thing but you sit in your house pay the goods. I don't think there will be a time that everyone in the world will use digital currency exchange. Of goods and services.

      "body": "There is so much fraud around, that I don't want open banking, I want private banking. There was a perfectly good and efficient system in operation for several years. It involved my bank, Visa and the NS&I. Visa introduced an intermediate verification check, and this required me to obtain an authorisation code by inserting my debit card into a plastic nreader, and entering my pin. It wsas efficient, and I thought it was secure. Now it seems the UK government is insisting that a fourth privately owned organisation is introduced into the transfer. They asked for access to my account, and this had never been requested befoire. I'm going to write to my bank and askj for all details of the information they downloaded. In theory they could obtain details of all my credit card transactions for the last year, and other sensitive information. Although the organisation is UK based, the site is hosted in the US ( Iowa ), and the web site designer appears to be Spanish. The NS&I purport to be big on security. For example, they log you out if you use the bsack button, but then they introduce this massive security risk by insisting that I give my banking details to a new organisation with non-UK associations. I'm going to open a non-associated bank account to make these payments, and I'll transfer the money from my main account befiore submitting the payment request.There is some background to my concern. I believe that Bitcoin was created by the Central Banks as an experiment, and the 30 minute lag for payment confirmation, together with the total of 21 million coins createdwith the foundation block, were intended to ensure that Bitcoin was unsuitable to become a global currency for daily use. However it does mnake it a great store of wealth. The Central Banks must have learnt a lot from observing Bitcoin, and it has prepared them to introduce some CBDCs. Also, I believe that the European Union was created as an experiment designed to fail, and we can see that they are now implementing policies to cause this failure. We can also see that the WEF is moving to create a currency that will rfeplace the US Dollar and the Eurio, and to sit alongside the UK Pound. They are working to destroy the dollar to facilitate this change. The can't destroy the Pound, as over 60% of the Western world's wealth is contriolled by the City of London, and interest rates are quoted in relation to LIBOR. The wealth holdings are held in a structure known as the Veil of Tiers. These are pyramids of holding companies many of which are in UK tax havens. If Sterling were to be replaced, then most of the contracts in these holdings would have to be rewritten and renegotiated.",

      "body": "This does look like an unnecessary amount of steps, and of course it might mean that it's made for surveillance, but IMO there isn't enough evidence just based on this information to say that this is the reason. My first thought would be that it's just unnecessary bureaucracy. I've looked at NS&I google reviews, and people say it's just a very inconvenient service, although some do mention it's the newly introduced changes that make it so.Also, the issue seems to relate to the UK and this service specifically, not generally, although here I'd add some of my own experience as well. When I lived in the UK, I opened a Revolut account, using a UK phone number, and the account is in GBP. The experience has always been great, but over the last month or so, Revolut keeps popping up a question, asking for what purpose I use the money in this account or something like that, providing 4 generic reply options and not allowing to go further before choosing an option there. And it's not a one-time question, it just keeps reappearing all the time. So on that note, I agree cash and BTC are important and that perhaps the UK does have new requirements for banks to monitor and question what their people are doing. Thankfully, in my home country the banks are very chill and really don't seem to care unless you cross a certain financial threshold, which I never do because you need to be pretty wealthy and regularly make big payments to cross it.",

Looking into people's bank accounts when you don't need to is not trustworthy behaviour imho.I don't think that they will take any action against the company because they have added that intentionally and they already know that the company can access the details of the customers. I think they incorporated the measures to prevent fraud in the first place, but I'm surprised to see that why they asked about your personal details which doesn't make sense because the banks already have all the information of a user who has opened an account in their banks. I think they will not misuse the data and they will only use it for confirmation purposes. The company is their banking partner and they will now use it as a gateway for payments if I'm not wrong.Quote from: Jet Cash on June 21, 2023, 01:46:44 PMThere is some background to my concern.

However it does mnake it a great store of wealth. Ah, let's believe if that's a reality then in that case Satoshi was also the representative of the Central Banks and performed everything so wisely just to make people believe that he's a programmer who just created Bitcoin and gave it to public as a new class of currency. That's your assumption and I respect that, but if that's a truth then things could be different after the introduction of CBDC's and they may be a great competition for other crypto-currencies that aren't created by the banks.",

With it you'll most likely be guaranteed privacy on a possible privacy-friendly p2p decentralized Investment Network, even if your private info is collected. The decentralized Investment Network could have fellow participants who do businesses in UK on alternative UK or Global bond, which you can safely patrionize.   Otherwise a company could just allow transactions with Bitcoin on centralized platform that ends up demanding for your private information which could be viewed by anyone who controls the centralized platform.  If it becomes necessary to provide one's private information on a decentralized Bitcoin investment Network, it will most likely be handled in privacy friendly manner, probably by the system bot simply confirming that the information provided matches with your real ID without revealing it to anyone else.   I think sometimes it may be necessary to provide such private information, but what matters is whether it's accessed and handled safely.In regards to using cash, that depends on the kind of cash it's about (Physical fiat or physical Bitcoin?) . Don't forget who owns the fiat system. They could request for your private inform from the intermediary when you go to pay with cash by making it part of their licensing agreement. So using the fiat system to preserve privacy is not viable long-term. And it can't be decentralized unlike Bitcoin.",
