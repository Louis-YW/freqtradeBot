  "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance, a new player has emerged on the scene: PayPal USD ($PYUSD). It is a digital currency developed by PayPal, one of the world's leading online payment platforms. While PayPal has been facilitating online transactions for years, $PYUSD represents a significant leap forward in their efforts to streamline digital finance. Unlike traditional currencies like the US Dollar (USD), $PYUSD is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. This means that transactions involving $PYUSD are recorded on a secure and decentralized ledger, providing increased transparency and security. Currently, PYUSD is listed on several reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, including KuCoin, Bitget, BitMart, Gate_io, Huobi, etc.I'm so excited about this new gem. But I would like to hear the thoughts of you guys too.",

I saw it coming - I read the signs! Just thinking they'd strive for dominance over USDT.",

      "body": "Hmm, First of all, I think Op this topic doesn't belong to this section. I think it should be in the Economics section, on the point of PYUSD, as digital finance in the crypto industry the current capital PYUSD owns is like the Drop in Ocean so keep in mind that PYUSD cant stand a chance in front of the Stables coins as USDT, USDC or Even DAI. There is a total market cap of $44,361,852 USD for the PYUSD and $86,398,323,767 market cap of the USDT. See the difference in my views the PYUSD is nothing more than a shitcoin.Tarfoamtion of digital Finance is only possible with Bitcoin, Bitcoins cant fix the damages and there are a lot of vulnerabilities in them and Bitcoin is a pure gem for all the fixes. We don't give a shit about what Paypal says and the only sentiment is BTCitcoin.",

Op is talking about stables equivalent to dollars. Maybe with given time PYUSD could match up with other stables.",

Maybe you should read more about what decentralization in cryptocurrencies actually meansThe owners of $PYUSD (PayPal) can freeze and wipe out your account balance with a push of a button. I think you are pretty much clear with how PayPal have been operating in the past in regard to freezing people's accounts, asset seizures and censorship. You really call that decentralization?Quote from: The Future on September 26, 2023, 04:30:11 PMI'm so excited about this new gem. But I would like to hear the thoughts of you guys too.
