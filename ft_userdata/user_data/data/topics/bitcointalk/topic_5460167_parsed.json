  "content": "A recent thread motivated me to ask this query because according to that post, Quote from: Odusko on July 17, 2023, 08:10:15 PMLately, there has been some development here in the integration of AI in trading on some stock assets and cryptocurrencies, and to a large instead, AI has ground in acting and executing trades and recording profits, but it has not been for long so as we can't tell what the success rate will be, but for the fact that the reality on the ground has shown and proven their existence in trading stock, so as that which one will you prefer if AI is proven to be effective.Will you prefer to trade with AI or you prefer to do the trading yourself? OP asked which would you prefer self trade or AI trade. And i thought why would someone promoting or encouraging or the ones who prefer decentralized system. Will use AI Bots. Because AFAIK, in order to do AI trading. Don't we have to hand over our assets or i must say allow the Bots to use our assets as they want. So that they could make us some money.Why someone, do not even like the centralized platform (CEXs, ETFs, CBDC) etc. will hand over his or her assets to a centralized bot so that that bot could help them to make money. Does decentralized enthusiast do AI trading or not. Or i am the one taking the whole thing wrong. Because those AI, are managed by single entity or organization who would have all the data of you plus to register with one AI bot you also have to accept so many policies and have to provide so much documentation too. But their also exists other bots that require you to give less documentation and ask you to agree with less policies. Note* i am not talking about bots that automatically make your trade and end your trade. and all you have to do in those bots is set stop limits for profits and loss. I am talking about bots which suggests you to make trades at specific prices and also make those trades on your behalf.",

So what is centralized is centralized. But what I see more about those AI are lack of privacy for people that are using them as the developers steals information from users.",

Just because that Centralized platform of AI bot will made him profits. I think, answer to your query is in your post already. Which is very obvious that, a person will not prefer to choose centralized platform if he has already made up his mind about decentralization.But still, there could be many possibilities in which one might chose centralized platform like many people who don't like CEX but they use them. Same way, those people might be using the CEX AI trading bots too. But according to the post you quoted, many people suggested to not rely only on AI bots for trading purposes while you have to get benefits from the AI technology to increase the accuracy of your predictions. So, why would a person who care about anonymity so much will risk his assets too.",

Most people that dislike KYC will think otherwise if there is guarantee that after KYC, you can make profit. But what is the point after KYC, no profit is guaranteed.AFAIK, no AI bot trading platform will promise that you will definitely make profits even in the policy section they ask you to agree with them that even if the funds are lost then you will be responsible for it not us. Thus, this also included another factor to avoid AI trading bots. I think their exists some non KYC AI trading bots but they are risky too.

In order to get the full range of trading features that active traders have used so far and which also allow integrating AI technologies with an orientation to the ability to manage assets, you will most likely have to deal with a centralized platform. At this point, demands for decentralization are no longer relevant, not because of the AI but the trading platform used.After all, if you authorize an AI to manage the assets of a wallet you have uncensored access to, it remains decentralized. But I wonder if nowadays there really is an independent AI robot where it is able to manage everything with full authorization including choosing which trading platform is suitable and can automatically register there.",

AFAIK yes, you are completely on the wrong track Bot trading, Ai Bot trading Grid bot trading, or whatever you want to call has nothing to do with Centralization and decentralization.. A person who is already trading on CEX doesn't care about the bot script and how it is working in order to process trading all he means is regular buying and selling..For a person who is already on the DEX is not really trading all the time because you should know in AMM DEX for each communication with blockchain you have to pay gas fees, the amount suffers with the change in blockchain as its quite variable one very blockchain.. even layer to layer it varies.. So without being Futuristic first of all DEX trader can't afford the Bot as he will prefer the Self trader, for a moment let's imagine a rich trader like not as me and you can use really use a trusted script for that purpose all he needs is to know to integrate them, (Here I am talking about third party solution). Even some platforms offer their in-built solutions so that the smart contract is open source and the trader can verify weather the Bot is trust worthy or not..

Haha, Buddy what the difference,  what makes them differ from others just a price alert most probably you can find that feature on maximum scripts.. As far as I know. A bot will be a bot weathers its Ai base or not what can make the Ai bot differ from others is just that the AI bot will have some triggers, such as a volume trigger, Liquidity trigger, and Price trigger just that's it. Now Ai is not enough developed yet to make a fully descriptive and technical analysis for you taking into count the all fundamentals of that project. We are still far away from such Ai.__Regards Hamza... Ask anything I can make more clarification on the idea or queries as well just make sure to ask in a descriptive manner.",

There’s already a trading bot where you can use the default settings and it will trade on your own, this is ideal for a busy trader but still want to do some trade. Using a trading bot can’t make a guarantee profit anyway, and that’s why many still prefer to trade on their own since some bot platform are asking for a fees which is not that cheap. AI is growing but I still believe it can’t crack trading as this is controlled by the market supply and demand.",

If there is no script like that still I am true buddy it's not me who brought this idea I did an explanation on it only, it's your mindset where you want an AI to do everything which currently seems not possible and it will be at high risk because AI can't reach the maximum efficiency where it will select the trading pair and then make favorable trade, Do you really think there will no risk after 1 or 2 incidents of a major loss, if they happen would anybody like to use them. (Incidents like AI selecting a Third class Pair of shitcoin on the basis of an algorithm working on the pumps and dumps it will be a disaster for your portfolio).The AI Automated trading will introduce a large set of unseen consequences it will open a new world for market manipulators where they will try to suppress the AI algos to steal your funds in a legal way haha.Except for the Finding coin, all the features are on 99% Scripts you can find them on Github (Solution Scripts), Even some DEXs.Carbon DeFi",

The fame of A.I. has emerged after the success of ChatGPT[1], but in the end this product is for texts and trying to find the best result from billions of data. Predicting the price is a function that is as close to random as possible in the short term and can be predicted in the long term. So say that in 20 years the capacity of the Bitcoin market will be several trillion dollars, and then it will be less volatile and easier to predict. Also, within 30 years, we will have enough events to predict the impact of any future event.[1] https://chat.openai.com/",
