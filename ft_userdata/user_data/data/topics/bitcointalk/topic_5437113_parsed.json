No Water. I don explain as e take be for my area concerning water, together with light matter above, make this post no too long, i no go go further on this one again.Light no be issue for my Area, as we get steady light since and we no dey too stay off light like that as my area dey use the same gride cable with the I International Airport, so power supply na oboge 4 we area, and talk of water we still get enough light to pump water at will and even though the light no stable on the 24/7 basis but isha dey to use when available. But the issue of the new naira note na the one were affect everybody be that because for my area only few people have access to the new note and the few POS that have the new denomination are selling it because you will have to pay 1500+ fees on #10,000 withdrawal as the matter be everybody turn turn to transfer for transaction to go on. The few thing I will like us to prepare for in the coming days as election draw close is in the area of security, this currency swap will trigger a lot of issues beyond what we can imagine and a lot of damages may be done before Nigerians get used to this new systems. We should also be clear on some facts that we may face in the coming days which are. -scarcity of the naira note, make we no expect the new naira notes to be excess in circulation just like the old notes since thos new policy includes limites on individual cash withdrawal which is aim as moving out naira notes from circulation and adding cashless policy. So let us take upon ourselves to enlighten and educate the general public on the effective and secured ways to confirming e transaction to eliminate the activities of yahoo boiz who will want to take advantage of the current situation by sending fake alerts. God bless Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬",

New notes are not much in circulation and they want people to swap the old note encouraging digital cashless policy when the economy of the nation is not ripe yet for that stage.Â  1. No Fuel. This one is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. How can we be producing crude oil and claiming to be the largest refinery in Africa yet we are experiencing fuel scarcity, hike in fuel pump price.

Na 24/7 we dey patronize Atiku, fuel sef still scarce here no be small embarrassment fuel station dey give their customers here for person money again. Them lock us outside for almost 1 hour, even mount mopol for the entrance, na so aboki dey flog customers way won try enter to buy fuel. I just vex go house. 2. Money: The scarcity of new and old notes don too much. POS just dey take advantage of person, the painful part na say bank atm go dey 100 naira note with 5k limit, the one I go today na 3k be the limit. The thing don too much for my area so tay market women come block bank this morning say bankers nor go enter inside o na so manager call DPO, still the women stand attention dey protest. Na beg police come dey beg, them promise us to say tomorrow money go dey the bank for us to withdraw. This whole thing is beginning to turn into a big mess, the only challenge I am facing from this new policy na poor network because today alone I don make 3 transactions where the receiver no get the money and it has been debited from my account even as I show the man the receipt of the transaction him no free release the goods for me, na so I waka go my house jeje because I no fit fight, I tell the man when he sees the money make him call me. *on the issue of light, I must say we dey flex light well for this side, and since about 3 days now I no sure say the light did go off. *And fuel don dey now, I was able to fill my tank today and no cue at all a just drive in buy and go unlike last we where one needs to spend up to 4 hours on fuel cueing.",

No Light.For Almost One month now, we never see light we stable more than five minutes before they take am, and they no dey bring am pass two or three times in a day, the matter now don make water scarce for here, those wey get water and no generator no fit pump water, those wey get water and generator no see fuel buy, so that they go fit pump water, they ones wey manage pump water no gree sale, the ones wey dey manage sale don hike the price of 1 gallon(25 liter) from #10 wey we dey buy am before to #50 now, some dey even sale #70,#100 for 25 liter of water.2. No Water. I don explain as e take be for my area concerning water, together with light matter above, make this post no too long, i no go go further on this one again.3. No Money.CBN announce say deadline for old currency na 31st of January, and as e be right now for my area here, my people for here no dey gree collect the old note again ooh, and the worst part be say we no see the new note collect from bank, ATMs wey dey this ogbe na old currency all of them dey pay, and the banks no send, if you enter their domain do any how, police go knack you kpako for head, bundle you troway for outside, this na if they no arrest you.Doing business now is really difficult for our older forks wey no sabi wetin be \"i want to do transfer\", yahoo boys dey even use this opportunity to chop many people as most of them don start to dey send fake alert.People wey dey sell no won collect old note, those wey won buy no see new note to take pay for wetin dey won buy -- wetin man pikin go do like this???.4. No Fuel. If to say as light no dey, fuel dey, maybe people for not too complain, but as it is now, a liter of fuel here na #500 and black market dey sell #700, but even as e cost so, To see am buy na still a big wahala.No light, and no fuel, businesses dey suffer as they no see fuel to run their business, barbers, dry cleaners, tailors, bet9ja shops, saloon, gym houses, phone and computer repair shops -this na just to name a few, what about okada people, tricyclist them, public/commercial transporters.. Water a scarcity biting really hard in my area now due to no light and no fuel , things are getting out of hand over here..How things be for your area? let us know make we know which side we go dey relocate dey go abeg ...  This light issue pain me pass anything because na we they supplie Abroad with light in-fact Niger state na power state but we lack light very well for here we canâ€™t have light for 12hrs the mats tired me slf",
