      "body": "Just to alert OP. It's a common exchange scam, you find it all over socials, Discord, Telegram. People coming in and telling you about the huge difference in spread on either a fake/crap coin like you posted, or a fake exchange (you deposit your coins there expecting to sell it at huge profit margin but it's just a giant sinkhole).For the former, look up the chain. For the latter, look up the exchange and/or deposit exchange.",

According to CMC, the daily volume on Poloniex is a whopping $20.63, meaning anyone can manipulate the price anywhere they want at almost no cost at all.Anyhow, this belongs to Altcoin discussion.",
