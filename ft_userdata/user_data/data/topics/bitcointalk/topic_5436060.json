Come to think that most of us does have that missed the train kind of story that we shouldnt have sold like this and like that or simply had those words that we should have accumulating when it is still cheap.It cant really be avoided on having this kind of words but its true that we should really move on because if you wont really be doing so then you would just keep on coming back on thinking on thisways which would really be resulting into that frustration and stress.Its trueÂ  that now that we are fully aware about its potential then its never too late for us to get inconsidering that the market isÂ  still existing even up to this moment and into more future years to come.",

Many of us here have a life changing opportunity because of bitcoin and not just that, it has taught a lot of things not just about itself but also about the markets and economics that you'll get to learn when you're too curious about it. And these days, it's normal to see someone regrets that he should have listened to his friends or relatives when they've been shared and introduced to bitcoin because look at how far it has went. It's not just only about the price that it has got during 2021's bull run but the technology and acknowledgement that it's getting these days. Not just from the people but also from big financial institutions and the governments.Quote from: PhilixCrpt on January 19, 2023, 08:43:42 PMNo one can steal your bitcoin.Only if you know how to keep your bitcoins safe but if you can't, you might fall for phishing/malware tactics.",

That should probably be one of the major factors for everyone, and I believe was the main motivation for creating Bitcoin. The other one being; counterfeiting, i.e Bitcoin can't be faked, and every transaction is verified. As well as transactions can't be faked if they've been confirmed. It's nice to see someone who's relatively new not focus on the price aspect, and how it swings from there to here. You're at least focusing on the more important aspects which drive those swings.",

It's never too late. If you have some money lying around, invest in bitcoin and keep holding. If you don't, six years later, when you look at the price, you are going to make the same post and start regretting once again. Not a financial advice though. Do your own research. After six years, the price might skyrocket, might be the same or might go down much more than it is now.Quote from: PhilixCrpt on January 19, 2023, 08:43:42 PMBitcoin is a life changer.Not really...",

      "body": "A couple of notes, though. 1. Bitcoin is indeed censorship-resistant. There's no authority that can ban, restrict, or censor an address or a transaction in the network. So whether you're a communist, a terrorist, a criminal, a weirdo, an anarchist, or whatever, you're allowed to make Bitcoin transactions. However, this is all betrayed by centralized exchanges and other centralized platforms. These platforms blacklist, restrict, and censor addresses and people because they have tainted Bitcoin, used gambling sites, a resident of Russia, and so on. 2. Indeed, no one can steal your Bitcoin. But only if you keep it safe. By keeping it safe, I mean you store it offline where you alone have the control and possession of your private keys. Keeping the private keys is another thing. You cannot keep them online or in whatever device that you connect online. And, again, your Bitcoin could be stolen once you keep it in centralized exchanges. Not only could your coins be stolen, they could also be frozen for whatever reason.",

Digital money is not physical, so it's very hard to understand. After all, Bitcoin is based on code and is only existing in the digital world. Bitcoin is also based on trust and when Satoshi started it, he wasn't sure if it was going to be successful. He said something like that: \"In a few years we'll see either no transactions at all or a lot of transactions\". What implied, that Bitcoin needed to be supported by enough people. And Bitcoin had / has enough support to survive that critical early phase. A much bigger step than simply surviving from a technological perspective will be acceptance: After all, money is what people are willing to accept. And if Bitcoin, a digital good / asset (we could argue here about a better description), is accepted by many people it can become some sort of money as well.",
