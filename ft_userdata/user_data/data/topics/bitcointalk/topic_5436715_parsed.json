If this is a scam then it would be useful for awareness for newbies like me.No, that's not a legit wallet, most probably somebody has tried to scam you.The usual way to handle this is to report that message.As a rule of the thumb, always be wary of unsolicited private conversations. In most cases those are attempts for scam....and.... I don't know what else the forum could do about this.",

Please let me know. If this is a scam then it would be useful for awareness for newbies like me.Many errors has made this already a visible attempts for scam and i will like to highlight some of the things in this regards every user must be careful with not to fall into hands of scammers.1. The forum Administration will not send any PM to members to introduce such to tuem, they will rather prefer opening a thread and engage other members along.2. This is all about altcoins introduction on the altcoins discussion board and not bitcoin, while this is bitcointalk community.3. If you check the link address given from the link, it's not the original bitcointalk.org address which also is another reason this is purely scam.4. When you check the forum administration profile, you wouldn't see anything of such which means it's a scam, everything about the link was plagiarized with the intent to scam people.Warnings to newbies and other members of this noble community, we must be very careful especially when we receive PMs that could be a phishing one with the aim to attack us by giving some offers beyond the reasonable doubt to deceive us.",
