  "content": "Well lately you may all heared about the new AI chat called chatgpt which is in beta version and for free now and It's so easy to use and access. So i wanted to ask some questions about bitcoin to it and see the answer, one of my curios questions is how bitcoin price drop to 0$ and this is the AI answer : [It is theoretically possible for the price of bitcoin to drop to zero, but it is highly unlikely to happen. There are several reasons for this.First, bitcoin has a fixed supply, which means that there is a limited amount of bitcoins that can be mined. This scarcity gives bitcoin value and makes it unlikely that the price will drop to zero.Second, bitcoin has a decentralized network of users who are committed to the success of the currency. These users are motivated by a belief in the value of bitcoin and the underlying technology (blockchain) and are likely to continue using and holding bitcoin even if the price drops temporarily.Finally, bitcoin has a strong track record of price stability over its 12+ year history, despite experiencing some significant price fluctuations. While it is always possible for the price of bitcoin to go down, it is unlikely that it would drop to zero. ]Well i didn't get the scenarios of this thing to happen. So i had to ask about it again and i got this answer which was so detailed  [It is difficult to predict specific scenarios that could cause the price of bitcoin to drop to zero, as it would require a significant and unforeseen shift in market conditions or technology. However, there are a few hypothetical scenarios that could potentially lead to the collapse of the bitcoin market and a drop in the price of bitcoin to zero:Loss of trust: If the bitcoin network were to suffer a major security breach or if there were a widespread loss of trust in the integrity of the network, the price of bitcoin could potentially drop to zero.Government intervention: If governments around the world were to pass legislation that made it illegal to use or hold bitcoin, it could potentially lead to the collapse of the bitcoin market and a drop in the price to zero.Technological obsolescence: If a superior cryptocurrency or technology were to emerge and gain widespread adoption, it could potentially lead to the decline of bitcoin and a drop in its price to zero.It is important to note that these scenarios are highly speculative and it is difficult to predict how events might unfold. As with any investment, it is important to carefully consider the risks and conduct thorough research before investing in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.I liked these answers given by the AI and i don't think there's much left to add about this subject of price dropping to 0 and the chances of this to happen are very low and very close to impossible",

AI would still be AI and cant be something that would really be able to surpass human mind or brain when it comes to everything.Yes, it does have some advantage but it cant really be somethingthat would be far superior into its creator which is humans.There are lots of talkings and discussions about ChatGPt or into those AI about answering on something.They dont really have that real time experience and knowing about fundamentals which only human beings could able to comprehend and able to make suddenalteration of decisions.",

The price could technically drop to 0 USD and it wouldn't mean that bitcoin is worthless. It could still be worth thousands of GBP, Rubles and so on. If the US were to no longer allow the exchange to USD bitcoin would be worth 0 USD, because dollar is private. It doesn't belong to the people but to the government of the US and it decides its fate. If they go bankrupt - boom bitcoin goes to 0 USD, if the US gets blown up by nuclear missiles - bitcoin goes to 0 USD, if the dollar changes its name - bitcoin goes to 0 USD, if the USD trading stops - 0 USD, but it won't mean 0 USD is literal 0 (nothing). It's worth adding that if trading is allowed and USD continues to exist it will be impossible for bitcoin to be at 0. Even if the majority of people decide to sell it wouldn't be trading at 0. You'd have to convince 99% of bitcoin owners to dump it to really get into cents. I just don't see it happening unless the encryption gets cracked and people start intercepting transactions and stealing coins. A security breach or the end of the world could be the only situations where this happens.",

If no demand occurs in the market and everyone abandons bitcoin, that's when the price of bitcoin will free fall to its lowest price point.",

In fact, many members here as well as myself seem to have said the same thing about it.AI would be great for some jobs, but not for this thing.Of course i already read and i myself participated in answering the same knd of questions. It's just logical in many cases how bitcoin can crash and it's very rare to happen. I only did ask the AI in the door of curiosity and simply the AI gave logical answers too.
