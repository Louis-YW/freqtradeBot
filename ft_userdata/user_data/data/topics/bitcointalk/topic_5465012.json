  "content": "The internet was taken by surprise after the news the shiba inu, Cheems Balltze (12 years old), which inspired dogecoin cryptocurrency logo passed away after a battle against cancer. Not only inside the crypto community, the dog was pretty popular on several niches of the internet since the last decade and was probably known by people who didn't even have notice about Bitcoin or Dogecoin.Quote“He fell asleep on Friday morning during his last thoracentesis surgery. Originally, we wanted to arrange chemotherapy or other possible treatment for him after this operation, but it is too late now,” his owner said on Instagram.However, she asked fans not to be “sad” but to “remember the joy that Balltze brought to the world”.Shiba Inu made famous by viral ‘doge’ meme dies after cancer battle",

I didn't know there was a story to it and it feels satisfying to know that it's not just a random concept. I wish Cheems Balltze well and its owner as well. She can find solace in the fact that her dog inspired a lot of crazy trends and put smiles on the first of people.Cheems Balltze might be good but the doge/shiba inu memes and trends inspired by those memes will continue to live on.",

Am not sad that it died. But the way it died that makes me sad. Maybe one day all this news about cancer will end and the world will be free of that demonic disease.

I mean it shouldn't be impossible donations from both shiba inu and doge communities. t would be good press and uniting the community to stand for good things and cute doggos.But maybe they want to mourn in peace and don't want that cute dog to represent cryptos. I would totally understand that too.",

But honestly, I thought the Shiba Inu token faced some trouble just like the other dead tokens in the past but as I read the OP means the literal dog who is the owner of the logo. Anyway, if I were the owner of Doge and Shiba Inu, I would use this opportunity positively to promote my products because of this trend and it cannot be missed since they are given free promotions from the Dog and maybe this is his last mission.",

They're two different dogs, lol. Kabosu is still alive. OP was wrong, which is probably why I had them on ignore. Here's a good way to tell them apart (Doge is on the left and Cheems is on the right):Kabosu is actually a couple years older than Cheems. Only $DOGE is based on Kabosu, and $SHIB is based on $DOGE. There is no Cheems token AFAIK.",
