  "content": "Wasabi team has announced the default coordinator will implement blacklisting in coinjoin[1], and will refuse to let some coins from being mixed, which completely goes against the fungibility they argue they enhance[2] and to the privacy being preserved at all times as they represent[3].  Due to this update, I find it very hypocritical of them to believe they are the ultimate solution to Bitcoin's privacy issues, while partnering with people who go against the fundamentals of privacy and fungibility in the first place.  Wasabi is recommended in bitcoin.org[4], the place where every beginner learns the first steps to start their Bitcoin journey.  I think that, in such crucial place, presenting Wasabi as privacy-focused and completely transparent project is wrong and should be not be recommended.In this topic, I would like to gather petitions so we can send an email to Cobra (the bitcoin.org administrator) and explain our reasoning.

Could be 1000 reasons why we hear know about what they are doing but the bi7coin.org web people do not.But, there is no reason for them not to list the wallet. It's no more or less of a choice for someone to use it without getting all the details as it is for them to use any other particular wallet. If you're not using the coin joins you would never even know or care. As a wallet, it works. And it's probably secure. Anything beyond that it's really not their concern because they are telling you about what wallets are available not necessarily if the features the wallet is talking about are done well for the user. So long as they are not stealing your money like others wallets I have no issue with it staying there. With that being said, I would *never* ever use it.-Dave",

Wasabi team have been caught lying frequently, which makes them not trustworthy.  I can point you to some examples if you want.They advertise themselves as the best solution to Bitcoin privacy issues, and simultaneously partner with a mass surveillance company, which is hypocritical for obvious reasons.They have been caught doxxing their competitors (Samurai team).Their software has also been caught to reusing addresses, which is unforgivable for a project that aims to preserve privacy.Quote from: pooya87 on June 26, 2023, 05:43:59 AMBitcoin.org is also open source and the way to suggest changes is like any other open source software, it is by opening a new issue on their github page that can be found here:https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/Bitcoin.org/issues/new/chooseThank you.  I will create an issue and/or pull a request.

By recommending newbies' first wallet to be one which actively funds blockchain analysis to spy on their UTXOs, you set them down a path they may never be able to recover from.",

It’s true, they should still be out there for people who desire paying for inexistent privacy, but their constant lying and manipulation leads me to believe it’s better off without them than with them because a lot of users will be fooled otherwise.You ask them whether they’re really the solution to privacy and they give you links to read text an average Joe wouldn’t even comprehend. Then the average Joe looks at you, anonymous account arguing with them, looks at Wasabi providing false proof (and I’m calling it false because you ask them about apples and they tell you about trees). In the end, it’s not that likely the average Joe gives up on them because Wasabi continues to fight for their case although they know they’re in the wrong.Hence, I tend to believe they should either be delisted until they spread truth instead of manipulate and deceive, or they should be kept there with a big red flag for new users.",
