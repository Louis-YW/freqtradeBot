What are the rules? and all of that, as we have been seeing for the past couple of weeks now.As you can already see by yourself, the forum is a broad place, and everything information you need can be gotten from here, if not all at least helpful ones, and you already know how to use the search option of the forum, which I see as a very important thing for anyone to know in order to make their stay here very enjoyable and stress-free. You can use the search button and run a quick preview of the forum rules and regulations, in order for you not to break the law of the forum, although they are not hard to keep, as any learned person, as you appear to be, can easily know what's right and what's not without even being told.",

You will be able to learn over time that this platform was the first ever platform, or forum, that was created besides BTC. That is to say, the satoshi was registered on this forum when the BTC was created.I hope you will find many useful topics here because finding them is obviously not hard, but when you do not know what you should search for, it becomes hard, so my suggestion is to check for the topic you like the most, check for that topic's OP profile, and visit more topics created by them.Use the BPIP bitcoin talk tool to analyze who is most trusted, most respected, most liked, etc. here and try to learn from the topics they have created because most of the time the topics have a lot of information that we are seeking, and thus by reading that you will also get the idea too.",

If you know how to search effectively on the forum, like you have mentioned, then you will be able to learn even from old threads that have gone down the board. While on the forum, you just have to be very observant of the rules, and maybe you will not have any issues.",

Because by joining this forum, it means you have decided to seriously pursue the world of investing or trading in crypto/bitcoin. So from now on you don't hesitate anymore, if in the future you have a question or a problem related to the realm of crypto or bitcoin, you can immediately voice/discuss it in this btt forum. Because in this forum, any issues related to the crypto world are usually answered thoroughly by members who really know the questions. Then my advice, in the future, don't take it too seriously, if there are members in this forum who comment on/reply to your posts a little spicy or a little offensive. Because basically, this scathing criticism is not hate, but rather a lesson that you must understand. So basically, just take it easy, if for example there is a member in this forum who comments scathingly about your post. Because everyone must have a different character, in terms of delivery or opinion.And don't forget to read the rules listed on this forum, so you can understand more about this forum and so you don't break the rules.• Beginners - Read before posting",

If you're untrusted, the lender will require you a collateral unless he really trust you. And mostly for newbie ranks, you're barely trusted and that's why if you're legitimately trying to get a loan, don't expect that you'll get one without any valuable collateral to be offered.The distinction of being approved is still on the decision of the lender.",

Seems like even to this day, we're getting new users. Hope you have a wonderful time around the forum. Yeah, the marketplace here is quite also varied. It's not just everything circulating with trading BTC with another crypto coin. I know you mentioned that you don't need to lend for now, but careful in requesting for loan in Lending Board especially that you're still newbie. I believe that you need collateral there before you can loan. It's been so long since I visited that board to just read. But yeah, welcome to the forum again, OP!",
