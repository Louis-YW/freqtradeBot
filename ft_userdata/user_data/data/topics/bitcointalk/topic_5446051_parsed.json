Pretty a stupid move, he should have fled to some south Asian country instead.I agree that Europe is one of worst areas on the world if someone want to hide their identity and run away from Interpol. If someone want to hide, he should choose a remote area (but still has Internet as Do Kwon still used it) and little or no international cooperation, extradition like Asian countries.Quote from: retreat on March 23, 2023, 01:42:12 PMFinally another piece of trash from the crypto industry has been caught.

It's inspiring that the plan didn't work out, and he got arrested there. Scamming people (or grossly mismanaging their funds) who believed in a project and gave lots of money to it is certainly something that should be punished by law. My hope, as usual, is that as much money as possible will be returned to the victims. As for what else happens to this guy, I don't really care. I think the most important thing about financial crimes is to force the perpetrator to reimburse the victims.",

Pretty a stupid move, he should have fled to some south Asian country instead.I think OP is  likely correct because I did a search for it and cointelegraph  is up with the news as Do Kwon is being arrested. His arrest is long overdue as he has been on the run for months claiming he is open to any government call in answering any questions as to what really happened to Terra chain and investors funds.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/do-kwon-reportedly-arrested-in-montenegro/amp&ved=2ahUKEwj1sdvZn_L9AhVOi_0HHdX5DIYQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1qvAsSgC9nnUAZYtdTX7y-According to the reports, he was arrested at podgorica airport, Montenegro with \"falsified documents\" so I was wondering why he did use fake documents in traveling if that be the case. I thought he said he was not hiding from anybody and is willing to respond to any call from the government in answering any questions.",

However, I am not surprised that De Kown was caught in Montenegro, because his last known location was Serbia, where he hid for months. He obviously had badly forged documents and thought he would pass under the radar - and if he had been at all smart, he could have flown from Serbia to Russia without any problems and been out of reach of anyone.Quote from: kryptqnick on March 23, 2023, 02:26:10 PMWell, that is great news, right? Montenegro isn't a part of the EU and is a small, quiet country, which is why Do Kwon probably assumed it was a good place to lie low. That it is a small country is true, but that it is peaceful and politically stable is far from the truth. The country is actually torn between the local Montenegrins and the Serbs who, with the help of Serbia, are trying to maintain their political influence. Although I would put Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first place as a potential area where war can break out, Montenegro is in second place, considering that Russia also has an influence on everything that happens there.",

After clicking the link to the post, I saw one comment under the post and it made me curious. Like is the arrest really necessary? Is he the first person with a failed project? Why his own receiving special attention from the government and public? Or is there any crime against him other than Luna crash that I don't know? Someone should clear my doubt please.",

Even if the prosecutors managed to have access to his money, that would not be enough to cover the losses which were caused by the failure of his project, because this was not a conventional pull-rug.This was not about Do Kwon selling a token and then withdrawing the liquidity off Defi (like has happened before), both Luna and Terra were available in huge markets like Binance, which means that the value of the tokens escaped from the holders through short positions made by traders, which in the eyes of the exchange, can be considered to be clean money earned through speculation.It is more likely Do Kwon, after realizing he was done, took some millions of USD in BTC (from the Terraform labs Treasury) and went fugitive.At best, the prosecutors have proof of his expenses while in the run and can pressure him into handing over his private keys, in exchange of less years in prison.",

Fraud not only harms the individual who falls victim to the scam, it undermines trust in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and Holding individuals accountable for their actions is equally important for promoting ethical behavior and transparency within the cryptocurrency industry.This will not only protect individuals from scams and scams, but also encourage the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of payment and investment and for companies to act with integrity and transparency to build trust and drive industry growth.",
