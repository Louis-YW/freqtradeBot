Quotethe coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only. ...and you raise $40k already, not sure if people like your honesty or they really expect to make big x from this. Your coin at most requires website and some liquidity on exchanges, few k$ would be suffice, out of most would go for liquidity.",
