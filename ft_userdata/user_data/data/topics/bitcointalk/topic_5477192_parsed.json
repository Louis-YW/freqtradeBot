One should be wise and have self control, know when to cross the line and understand the gambling system very well before indulging in them. As you made mention, gamble with an amount you can bear to loss, not loan money or the one carry out your cost of living",

If someone wants to be certain that his rolls are fair and worries too much of things like this, then he can gamble on probably fair casino games. I think the more realistic issue with luring in players is how easy it is to win on no-stake rolls and fun token rolls. In non provably fair games this can be a real issue.",

The belief that they can earn a living through gambling motivates them to keep gambling until they lose control. You are also correct OP that until these people perceive gambling as entertainment and don't depend on it for survival, they might end up becoming addicted. Quote from: _act_ on December 09, 2023, 05:25:46 PMI noticed there has been some topics about how first time winning is dangerous. What I am saying is someone that has not gamble before, to gamble and win. That it is dangerous. Yes it may be dangerous because the person may have the exciting mind to gamble more  and lose. But that is not the whole true story.I also commented on the thread you are referring to, but what the author of that thread talked about was how a first win could entice first-time gamblers. However this might not be the main cause of gambling addiction because they will learn within a short period that it is not possible to win consistently. But I think what the author was trying to highlight is that newbies shouldn't be deceived by first wins because gambling is an unpredictable terrain.",

The first winning trap trick has been used for centuries by online and offline casinos.Human nature is generally greedy, curious and ambitious, where they first gamble and win, the desire to increase their balance for a second win is strong, not knowing that they have fallen into a trap and lost everything.My advice is to gamble without prioritizing emotions and greed, consider all gambling activities carefully, the first win is the beginning of suffering, so gamble without greed.",

      "body": "Conceiving the idea of only making a profit from gambling is a problem some people have. First of all, the primary reason for gambling should not be to only win; the gambler should also have it in their mind that they will win, lose, and catch some money. Gambling is sweeter like that, like knowing what you are actually in for. If you are only in for profit, you will not always be happy any time you lose, and the person might fall into the trap of their first win. This time around, it seems the majority of new gamblers are only gambling because they want to make a profit, and like the OP said, it would be only a few gamblers that probably won on their first bet on the first day they started gambling.",

They are trying to manipulate beginners into thinking that they provide more wins than other platform. And it is also true that first win can trigger a sensation or some rush to gamble more but it is not necessarily the major factor for people becoming addicted to gambling. Gambling is totally best on luck and if you win your first time then maybe you are lucky. And if you lose, luck is not on your side. If you enjoy gambling and you do it responsibly, do not overthink this too much. Everything that you won or lose is based on your luck. Except whatever you get as you can't change it.",

I don't think if you remove fun out of why people gamble, there would be anything else aside from the monetary gain. So it will be surprising to expect people to gamble without expecting a win or to wish that a gambler lose in his first time trying to gamble. I think the euphoria that comes with gambling is untimely and it can always spring up at anytime a gambler wins a game, not necessarily his First time. That's why someone can win a gamble today, lose and be sad tomorrow, then win again and be extremely happy as if they were never sad about it . It is because the joy and happiness that comes with winning a gamble is untimely and always side by side with the situation the gambler finds themselves. Overall, I think people gamble for the thrill that is in the risk of the game, the excitement that comes with winning a gamble, the monetary gain, entertainment, the socialisation, and sometimes to even escape depression. Some people gamble only when they are depressed and when they win , it brings that joy innate in them but the risk is that if they lose, they can become more depressed and hostile. The last reason I can think off is that, people gamble for the sake of solving their financial needs or crisis as oftentimes seen in students cases.",

In the other hand, gambling is deffirent from betting, the user has little to no control over the outcome over the result of the gambling session. Even though what you say makes relatively good sense, I still believe that the first win of a novice gambler can enhance their desire to continue to wager money further. If a novice gambler, on the other hand, had a lossing first experience in a casino, I believe it would be less likely for them to continue to gamble. I do not manage the statistics, though. So I could be completely wrong.",
