On this forum, there is no place for robots and bots, if you can't cope with this you don't belong here.",

      "body": "A.I, which has been the talk of many lately, is actually quite unique, but some people are still confused about how to use it, myself included. Well, for the advice you said it is very true because this forum is not intended to use any robots in making writing which tends to make someone lazy because of robots. I agree with what you said, that A.I should actually be placed in a more appropriate place and it is really needed so that every command is very useful, instead of replacing humans in all things such as writing on forums.",
