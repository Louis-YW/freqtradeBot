They can't bypass the typical listing requirements, but the service we provide is an expedited application and resubmission to get in front of a listing manager instead of  waiting in the queue like all the other tokens. When tokens apply they get sent to the back of the queue and then they're at the mercy of the normal wait time. If you are missing information or if it's denied you won't know until you've waited all that time and then you start the process again..The quickest we've listed with this connect is about 2 hours, average being 2-3 days, of course there are some outliers (depending on the performance of the token; usual \"dead\" tokens wait longer) CMC/CG FAST TRACKPrice: CMC $3,500 CG $2,500Both $5,000Its a jeet service it means we have %80 chance to do listing also have guarenteed CMC Listing it cost $15,000(less than 6 hours)(Middle Man accepted as long as fee covered) We can use https://t.me/saulpink or https://t.me/goodbye for MMIf you interested contact: https://t.me/Mooticohttps://t.me/MootieServices",
