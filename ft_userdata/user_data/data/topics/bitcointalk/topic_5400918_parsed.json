  "content": "HelloUpdate on RC coins 2022From our side we have the stickers ready. We are waiting on coins. Some delay due from the mint.-> Latest email from the mint received today.Coins were finished on Friday. Customs documents have been applied for and we are waiting for them to be approved – sorry, nothing we can do to speed up the process (just waiting on export documents). Then we will share a tracking with you and ship asap.Once we have the coins, we will update the forum and send tracking to all the pre-sale buyers. And also, create a post with remaining coins available for purchase.Thanks,Team RC",

      "body": "Looking forward to getting mine. I stack silver coins/bars and for a long time I hated enameled art bars as I thought they were ugly and was something of a silver coin “purist”. Once I bought my first enameled art bar and saw how beautiful enamel on silver is I was hooked. Now some of the rarest, most valuable pieces in my collection are enameled silver bars and rounds. Can’t wait to get these! We need more enameled bitcoin pieces moving forward! I even had an idea of making a silver bitcoin wallet, applying the private key and sticker, and the. Enameling over the entire coin sealing the key in. To access funds you’d have to basically destroy the coin making it much easier to HODL. Looking forward to getting these keep up the great work!",

      "body": "Update: Finally, all coins arrived in perfect condition.Front of the coin is exactly as awesome and beautiful as designed on paper. One of the most beautiful we have seen.Each coin is just something else. But mint has made a mistake in the reverse of the coin. (Pre-sale buyers can contact us and we will give details about the mistake.)Good thing is that mint recognises their mistake. We are working with the mint to figure out how to get this fixed. But for now they are saying that it would take them 4-6 weeks to resend fixed coins (they are arranging FedEx pick up to collect delivered coins).We are so sorry for this inconvenience. They will send us with more details on Monday. Our rough estimate puts coins to be delivered by August 1st week. So two months of delay from original May end week. We will try to make up for this delay. We are thinking of some ideas. Please bear with us.",
