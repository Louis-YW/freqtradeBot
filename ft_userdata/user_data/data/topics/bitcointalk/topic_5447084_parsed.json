It was also mentioned in this memorandum that the American government will be liquidating the rest of the coins they have taken from the case this year and divided into 4 batches.Why has the government not decided to sell them through an auction or over the counter similar to what they have done before?Page 22 of documentSource https://www.docdroid.net/cAA99Gw/123-pdf",

So most likely they will be selling into strength instead of just market selling it during low liquidity or bear market. Maybe they got someone at Coinbase that picks the most liquid time to sell those coins without affecting price too much.Really surprised why they didn't just auction them off like in the past. Someone would of paid OTC no problem. There was Justin Sun who offered but he wanted to underpay by 10% and most likely they wouldn't go for it.",

Yeah, just surprising that they are selling it as compare to their early strategy of just auctioning it and let the buyers decide for the price. Maybe they learn from it before wherein they sold at auction and it was for a cheap price.So they just think of offloading it by themselves, through whatever means, OTC or any other, not just in auctions. And the timing too is great as they did it when the price is going up, so win win for them and maybe moving forward the US government will sell the rest just like this method next year when we are in a big bull run.",

The price of Bitcoin was around $24k on the 14th of this month, so they could easily get $4k extra per Bitcoin if they had sold them now, but we all know that they are not into that kind of calculations, and besides, they have already made enough profit on them considering the date from when they confiscated the Bitcoins until when they sold them.And they still got 3 batches left, and I'm pretty sure that they will sell them at the right time. Even if they aren't holding them for profit, they will definitely sell them at a better price as they know it will be more money if they do so.",

They may only need to hold it on their own which I know they will because they already learned their lesson that keeping BTC on a centralized platform is not safe.USG are not different from us and other institutions who invest. They also invest to earn so they know what time is best to sell their coins but it won't cause a big dump since it's stated that they will do it in 4 batches.",
