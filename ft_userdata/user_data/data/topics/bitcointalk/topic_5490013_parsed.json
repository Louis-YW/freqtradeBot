Their intent is clearly in some ways to crush crypto which is terrifying. My understanding of this is that for example if you want to take 1K Euros according to the press release out of your Coinbase account and send it to someone, Coinbase will be required to collect store and verify information of the other party which is not their customer that is before the transfer is even allowed. So even people who are not Coinbase customers, Coinbase will now have to store all kinds of KYC documents on them before the transaction is even allowed. This is the stupidest thing and very ridiculous. Businesses based in the EU will just have to move out.",

What part of it being an open public ledger does not make that clear?Only people who truly have no idea of what a public blockchain ledger is think that it is anonymous.The only anonymous bit about it is that finding who owns any given wallet/address is very hard to do until it is either used to buy physical items or is converted to fiat. That said, every single Tx in & out is a fully traceable open record.Getting back on topic, several months ago the EU passed laws restricting fiat transactions. All the new EU regulations do is treat all crypto Tx's the same as fiat Tx's. In either case -- THEY SUCK!

But if not, this is just absurd law.I would be very ironic and funny if in the end these kinds of laws being applied in the European Union and in the United States, in the end convinced people to move most of their money to non-custodial wallets, instead using their exchanges to manage their money and carry out transactions. If so, what would the European Union and the USA do? Since we are talking about free software/open source, it would be very difficult for anyone to police people downloading wallets of their phones and computers. I still believe this could be about preparing the path for the incoming Digital Euro to be launched and becoming widespread with little resistance from Bitcoin and alternative currencies. Afterall, if they are all about replacing paper with electronic money, the restrictions on electronic money will be lighter than those applied to crypto. Also, it is easy to say that those who live in the EU and happen to be holders of Bitcoin are unfortunate, but living in Europa has other advantages which may or may not be related to Bitcoin and alternative currencies.",
