What is your take on this? Bitcoin is the best and most famous cryptocurrency, but it has all the same risks as other cryptocurrencies. That is, bitcoin can cost very little when manipulators start selling off their coins, so countries develop their own payment systems that they can control. I believe that bitcoin will be traded as a digital asset on exchanges, but it will not be a global currency.",

My take on this is that this has been discussed ad nauseam on the forum and my opinion on it has not changed. Bitcoin is more on its way to becoming a global store of value than a global currency, mainly because of Gresham's law and the problem of scalability in payments that neither the blockchain nor the second layer solutions existing today could sustain if it had to handle as many payments as are made in dollars today. Quote from: joniboini on June 29, 2023, 01:53:55 AMWhat exactly is a global currency? Basically something like the dollar today, which is not only used in the USA, but also in other countries that do not issue it, as well as for many international payments such as commodities.",

What is your take on this? This is not a determinant in determining what currency should be a global one. Even though Bitcoin is many a lot of people wealthy and rich, there would have to be a concemsus between countries of the world whether Bitcoin could fit in as a currency that could be use for global transactions. This is one of the problems the BRICS are facing because they do not have a currency that can stand replacing the USD when we talk about transactions. Even the Chinese yuan can not still stand to replace the USD unless something crucial is done about it. Bitcoin is very volatile so it does not fit in to be accepted as a global currency because it is going to result in big losessand could crumble the economy of any nation of the price falls drastically.",

To add to your point on the volatility of bitcoin, at the investment of El Salvador adopting bitcoin as a legal tender, they are still shoving on this volatility. Bitcoin has the tendency of bursting an economy 200% or far more in riches just like it does to an individual wallet during volatility and bull and after that retracement come which can equally bring you back to the starting point or further down. This is a bane on bitcoin, it is a tradable.",

To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries: we need interoperability,\" Georgieva told a conference attended by African central banks in Rabat, Morocco.\"For this reason at the IMF, we are working on the concept of a global CBDC platform,\" she said.Bitcoin can work when there are gateways to exchange for other currencies, CBDC can close those gates to all but a select few.",

What is your take on this? Bitcoin has the potential to be recognized as a legal tender in most of the countries of the world. It could be safely used for both local and international business transactions. But like you said nobody knows when. Bitcoin adoption will be gradual but progressive. Through bitcoin awareness and education, more people will keep ditching centralized platforms and move to areas they have control over. The government will keep fighting to slow its adoption because it will make them lose control of the people but they cannot stop the currency. Currently, we have one country that has declared bitcoin as a legal tender and some others are making friendly policies. Bitcoin adoption will keep growing until many nations sees its importance and follow El Salvador. Bitcoin will be good for developing nations because it will give a transaction alternative that is different from a controlled payment system like SWIFT.",

What is your take on this? Bitcoin has been used globally in all countries since it was first created in 2009, according to state or international law Bitcoin cannot be made a world/global currency, it violates the provisions and laws of state currency nationally and internationally.Bitcoin can only be traded, through services and internet access globally, does not mean that it has to be made into a global currency, the World Bank has special laws regarding money printing and has limits on money that must be printed in each country.Common reason Bitcoin cannot be made into a global currency is.1. Bitcoin has no ownership and is not real, I mean untouchable.2. Bitcoin cannot be printed, like banknotes or cents.That's a general reason, there are many other reasons why Bitcoin cannot be used as a global currency, another example of money in every country that must be printed, must be approved by several countries and approved by the world / internationally, of course if Bitcoin is made a global currency, it will be against state laws, especially those that are anti-Bitcoin supporters.hope you can understand, my brief explanation.",

The bill will have to move to the Senate before it will be sent to the Governor to be vetoed or passed into law. The government of some states in the US is taking a different path from the federal government. Most of these states have zero or no intention to embrace the CBDC of the US Central Bank. The committee that will be set up to research the viability of investing in Bitcoin should not consider using centralized exchanges to hold this investment. This was the case of some agencies in Canada that invested in FTX and they lost their investment when the exchange went down. The committee should be made up of members that are knowledgeable about the  Bitcoin space.",

This can be achieved by implementing strong policies and not to print more fiat or to save in bitcoin. The government will need money anytime for the running of the economy. If such fund is needed when the bitcoin is in the bear market, it will be disastrous. In the other hand, will government need to wait till bull run before they can start using funds?The volatility of bitcoin disqualifies it from being a reserve to the government fund.",
