People can deposit their fiat to centralized exchanges, buy Bitcoin and hold the coins on there because people don't want to pay on-chain fees.Moreover people tend to use Bitcoin as an investment, so the decline of on-chain activity isn't surprising.",

Cointelegraph is a propaganda service for promoting scam shitcoins. They are scammers.Activity on the Bitcoin network is at an all-time high, the mempool is full, all blocks are full, and there are 250,000 transactions pending.Check it yourselfhttps://mempool.space/Activity on the Bitcoin Lightning Network is also close to the all-time high from 2021. In the Lightning Network, 5,200 bitcoins worth over 300 million dollars are locked.https://mempool.space/lightningETH is highly centralized and very risky. You have to trust a group of people led by Vitalik Buterin not to rug pull you and leave you with nothing. ETH, besides being highly centralized and, in my opinion, a scam, has very high inflation, and you never know when the team in control will change the supply policy and print more ETH for themselves. Be very careful and don't put significant funds into ETH because you never know when they might rug pull.That's why I only trust Bitcoin and don't use altcoinsQuote from: mk4 on June 29, 2024, 08:07:03 AMQuote from: larry_vw_1955 on June 29, 2024, 05:39:00 AMthat's why bitcoin struggles once it gets to about $70,000 because no one is really using it for any real world use cases, they are just hodling. hoping to sell it for more than they bought it.\"Hodling\" is a real-world use case lol.

First, it annoys you that supposedly someone sent 50 BTC to CEX, now suddenly BTC is useless and you claim that an altcoin that is completely centralized, pre-mined and without max supply will become more useful (and more expensive, I guess) than BTC?Maybe take a little break and come back in a few months, it will be easier for you when the new bull run starts (or maybe not)",

It's more expensive in feat to send transactions on a daily basis, so people are now more than ever really thinking about the cost of fees and making transactions only when needed. This is why faucet's don't work any more, the fees alone would be too expensive. There are not as many dust transactions as the early days.",

Quote I hope that the OP will be reading this and will be convinced to have change of mind. Yes I'm reading all the replies. One thing I disagree with is how user mk4 claims that \"hodling\" is a real world use case. If that's all bitcoin is good for is storing it and hoping and praying that it goes up enough in value so you can sell it to make a profit then I don't really think that's a very unique use case. And not a very compelling one and if that's all its good for then it probably won't go very high in price.We needs better \"use cases\" than not doing anything with it other than buying it and then selling it. That's not a use case. A use case is something you do with it IN BETWEEN. QuoteAnd I do agree with mk4 that \"hodling\" is one of the use cases of bitcoin. An example, my country is facing an inflation. Most people monies in the banks are losing value as the currency drops. I withdraw my money from the bank and invests it in bitcoin and hold. My wealth is safe. This perfect use case scenario.  For you the IN BETWEEN thing is you are using it as an inflation hedge. That's a valid use case as long as the bitcoin price doesn't drop too far down and is at a bad price when you need to sell some of it. Even the USA has an inflation problem. But I don't consider bitcoin to be the answer to a hedge against inflation simply because it goes up and down in price and we don't know what price it will be in a year from now.  That's more like gambling to me. I'm not interested in gambling when it comes to my fiat. I would rather spend it.",
