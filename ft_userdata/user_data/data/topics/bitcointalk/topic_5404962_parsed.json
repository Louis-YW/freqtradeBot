Both ram sticks are working fine, alone.",

Both ram sticks are working fine, alone.If you're saying the reboots followed a rapid drop in temperature it's an environment problem.If you're saying the rig locked up and YOU rebooted it to recover it's a different story.Lockups can be caused by power issues, don't be too quick to assume it's bad RAM.",
