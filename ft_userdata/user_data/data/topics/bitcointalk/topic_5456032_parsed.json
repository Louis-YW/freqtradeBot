Gox and the operation of the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.According to court documents, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, both Russian nationals, are charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. Bilyuchenko is also charged with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.\"https://bits.media/v-ssha-obvinili-dvukh-grazhdan-rossii-v-krazhe-bolee-600000-bitkoinov-s-kriptobirzhi-mt-gox/\"Recall that Ivanov, who was arrested in Novosibirsk, claims that the Russian Alexander Vinnik, who is now in an American prison, was behind the creation of BTC-e. According to Ivanov (who worked as a BTC-e technical administrator), Vinnik was responsible for the financial component of the criminal crypto exchange.Alexander Vinnik was detained in July 2017 in Greece at the request of the US authorities. According to the US Department of Justice, Vinnik laundered billions of dollars for criminals through the BTC-e crypto exchange. After serving time in prisons in Greece and France, Vinnik was eventually extradited to the United States. On the charges, he can receive up to 50 years in prison. He does not admit his guilt. At the end of May, the media learned about the appeal of Vinnik's lawyers to exchange him for US citizens arrested in the Russian Federation. However, the exchange is unlikely, since the US Department of Justice is against his extradition to the Russian Federation.\"",

Do we know what his sentence would be if he were sent in Russia?I imagined that it would have been worse than in the United States, but it's true that 50 years is really violent. I wonder what he would risk, which kind of condemnation, if he pleaded guilty in the US?",

I tend to believe that the lawyers knew that DOJ will refuse that before even asking.",

There are many Russian hackers that are being used by the government to infiltrate systems in western countries, so they might even recruit him for that.",

Gox, dating back to 2011. Additional investigative reports unsealed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), reveal that Bilyuchenko and Verner moved the bitcoin from Mt. Gox to the exchange BTC-e at the time it was operational, after which it was further transitioned to two now-defunct bitcoin companies, Bitlnstant and Memory Dealers. Bitlnstant was a cryptocurrency exchange that was founded by Charlie Shrem, who in 2014, was sentenced to two years in prison for money laundering.\"Between April and November 2012, both Bilyuchenko and Verner received $2.5 million from Bitlnstant and Memory Dealers, to a bank account for a BTC-e affiliated shell company, Canton Business Corporation, which was registered in the Seychelles, a known tax haven and home to extensive financial crimes. Wire payments from Bitlnstant and Memory Dealers were labeled as “Internet Advertisement Agreements,” despite BTC-e never providing a single advertising service to either entity.There are some X posts about this, wondering aloud if that's why the DoJ is really interested in Roger Ver.https://x.com/KennethWRoyce1/status/1883730918155956719Maybe BitInstant and Memory Dealers didn't know they were buying hacked Mt. Gox Bitcoin, but if they paid a lot less than spot then they should have been suspicious.  I'll be stocking up on popcorn to watch this unfold!Any retrieved hacked Bitcoin should be added to the Mt. Gox restitution fund, but that's probably too much to expect.",

Gox computers to help fix the June 2011 hack, and just three months later the larger hack began.Was it ever definitely determined that the purloined wallet.dat file was taken from the outside?  Did Kim Nilsson figure that out?I read something on sophos about the Mt. Gox hack being mostly an \"inside job.\"",
