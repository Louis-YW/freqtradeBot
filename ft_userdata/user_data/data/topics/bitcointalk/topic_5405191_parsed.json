  "content": "WAISE got its name from the combination of the words Web 3.0 AI Semantic Network. The main purpose of WAISE Network is; By using the WAISE Community and GitHub developer community, by establishing science algorithms to understand artificial intelligence programming released by other developers, Web 3.0 software compatible with Blockchain and crypto money technology, and artificial intelligence supported module infrastructures.Community members play a large role in the development of the WAISE project. The shared open-source codes for WAISE serve as a guide for the development of the WAISE network. Thanks to artificial intelligence support, WAISE develops an algorithm on semantics as a result of each new artificial intelligence scan. Continuing its growth with the support of artificial intelligence, WAISE Network is a 91% community-owned project. Future advantages of artificial intelligence supported infrastructures and software modules that WAISE Network intends to launch.✅ Strong and Innovative FoundationsThanks to artificial intelligence and semantics, WAISE aims to offer improved, easily developed, reliable, easy-to-use infrastructures and modules for developers.✅ Fast and BUG-Free DAppsThanks to artificial intelligence support, BUG and critical errors that may occur in DApp programs created using WAISE Network infrastructures are prevented. Stacking problems caused by density provide solutions thanks to Web 3.0 support.✅ Chain Originated Transfer ProblemsIn case of chain-related transfer and GAS Fee problems, WAISE automatically balances GAS Fee fees and provides solutions to delayed transfers. (Important for developers for use on DApp systems with DEFi content.)✅ Module and Web 3.0 CompatibilityThe artificial intelligence and Web 3.0 supported resources offered by the WAISE Network can be used in harmony with Node JS, React JS, and Python (AI and some uses). (Please follow the WAISE for Developers community channel for details and support.)✅ Community SupportArtificial intelligence-supported resources created by WAISE Network and software infrastructures developed for Web 3.0 are constantly updated by the WAISE community and ensure peer-to-peer synchronization.BSC (BEP20)0xa4f4448d858264ee20f0b7eebdd3eb6fa1859463https://waise.network/https://waise.network/whitepaper/en.pdfhttps://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xa4f4448d858264ee20f0b7eebdd3eb6fa1859463",
