Signing is important to clarifies and settles dispute to be sure you are the owner of the wallet.It validates your ownership.",

It has nothing to do with the wallet security. I assume you saw it on this forum where people are signing message to verify their bitcointalk account?It's obvious that a bitcoin address private key will not be shared with anyone and signing a message with that particular address means you own the address. When you do something from an address that you own and when you do it from an account that means you are the owner of the account too. That's how we interpret it.",

By staking your BTC address, you can prove that you are the owner of the account and can regain access by signing a message that confirms you are the true owner of your bitcointalk account.The second topic is about PGP encryption, which is an encryption method used for privacy, security purposes and proving the authenticity of messages. PGP can also be used to prove that you are the original owner of messages by attaching a digital signature to them.Quote from: BTCGalaxyA12 on April 29, 2023, 11:04:56 AMThere is one more question I want to ask is how important it is to sign a Bitcoin address message because from several sources that I have read so far Bitcoin is safe from hacking.Neither of the topics you posted are directly related to the question you asked. Signing a Bitcoin address doesn't help you to prevent your Bitcoin from being hacked but the most extremely important aspect of Bitcoin security is protecting your seed phrase. It's essential to ensure that only you have access to your seed phrase and to take measures to keep it safe and secure from potential threats.",

It doesn't necessarily protect you from hackers.In this regard I must say that prevention is better than cure, so it is far better to sign your message and get it quoted. If you do the step successfully than your fears regarding the loss of your account will be less compare to the way they might be before doing that.However, in order to be safe from hackers you must have to learn  about the operating systems and software that you are currently using. Always try to get up-to-date security updates as well as software updates to avoid being victim of vulnerabilities of the out dated software.",

Anyone having access to a specific piece of software, knowledge, or desire to verify your ownership can do that by feeding to a verification algorithm your address in question, a message, and a signature created during the signing process. Message signing is arguably the only reliable way to prove that you own something without revealing any sensitive information because revealing one usually leads to the loss of ownership rights. So, it doesn't protect you from literal hacks but may help regain control of your funds in some cases, especially when you need to prove that you had those coins in the first place.",

      "body": "Just amazing to read how this technology works. After reading all the responses I had to see how the whole thing works and found an interesting article. Basically, we have \"asymmetric cryptography\", that helps in the process of securing and signing a message. Thanks to Ralph Merkle, Whitfield diffie, Martin hellman, these were the three great minds behind them who invented the process of asymmetric cryptography in the year 1976! It's really astounding to see how various researches in the past helped shape the bitcoin that we see today. QuoteAsymmetric cryptography is one of the most powerful techniques in computing and a fundamental part of the security of the Internet and blockchain-type networks. Its use has allowed high levels of security where it is necessary, guaranteeing privacy and even anonymity. What is asymmetric cryptography?As I understand from the article that I read we can use the signing process for:Verification of origin of fundsBe able to make payments to a specific address safelyAs a preliminary to the configuration of multi-sig or multi-signature pursesBe able to prove that you are the owner of an address.I am not sure if these are the only special wallets/tools that can sign the message OR any wallet can do but from the reading:Bitcoin CoreElectrum WalletTrezor WalletBitcoin Signature Tool - Seems to be referred toolGitHub library ?I am not so sure about the GitHub signing and how it happens but it seems we have an open source tool for signing?@OP, I believe this article would help you a lot in understanding more about the entire process and how to work with various tools. I have just shared the chunks of article. Even I am introducing myself to the singing so deeply for the first time, so here you go mate:How to sign a message with your bitcoin address?QuoteSecurity of this systemSurely you wonder if this system is really safe and cannot be broken in some way. If that is one of your concerns, you might like to know that you have nothing to worry about: this function is secure, in fact it is highly secure.This is possible thanks to the fact that Bitcoin uses the digital signature algorithm ECDSA to perform all these operations, and for the moment, said algorithm next to the curve secp256k1, is considered highly safe. In short, the security of both Bitcoin and this function is protected by very powerful cryptography that has not been broken at the moment. To give you an idea of ​​its security, you should know that this process is based on a superior security than almost anyone that you use in your day to day in some processes with online banking, messaging, telephony, ...On the other hand, and as you can see, it is a really simple process, in fact, if you know encryption and decryption systems for messages such as PGP (or GPG) you will realize that it works using the same basis of principles.The objective of all this is to provide you with a tool to send and verify information safely and without any kind of intermediary for it. As always, Bitcoin has been targeting decentralization from its inception and features like these only attest to that effort.",
