Also, you can invest in NFT projects, I think that they have a great potential in the early future. I am involved in one interesting project right now. Thee have a great community that helps a lot of people and takes part in various project events. I can give you advice about investment, so you can write me a message. I would be glad to help you.",

Anyways actually I've been using these platform and yes they're legit as long as you have skills and good looking profile that can get attention of some clients its all good and surely you can get a jon easily . So must try and don't spend your savings for another investment.",

You need to meet your basic needs.If you have a marketable skill, you could get a lot of opportunity in Upwork, just like what others mentioned in here. I cannot say the same in Fiverr since I went inactive there for a while. Though I would still advise you to find jobs there in your local area first, so you would still have a stream of income to buy your needs. Take any sorts of jobs whether it would be a fast-food work or something.",

Even when you are creating your own NFT and it doesn't mean if you can sell it instantly. This asset was illiquid, it's not a recommended way to do that. Think about an alternative way rather than it. We are facing very difficult situation these days started from so many things got dumped to the bottom and many more. Even doing trade is very risky with chance for the market to go even deeper",

It is not as easy as we think and never suggest to someone in this situation by seems promising double up the money.

First of all, I am so sorry to hear about your condition right now, hopefully, you can have a better job and life again.Actually, in your situation, it is too risky to put money in the NFT and also crypto investment or trade. Because we know that these two are risky and moreover currently the market seems to be very dropped easily. I agree more with @jossiel suggestion to seek that kind of platform.Or, if you are able to make some arts or other creative, you can check on the https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0Sometimes, there are some competitions or some services needed and probably you are suitable for the position or even can join the certain competitions",
