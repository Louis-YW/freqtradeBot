I did not find the forum link in the description, so you can add it in the description of the video in the future.The video is of short duration, but it contains an explanation of general concepts. Are you planning to launch more episodes? If that is true, then I suggest that you create an episode on the central platforms, because mostly here you will find that many people avoid them. There is a huge written content that you can convert into videos on YouTube.",
