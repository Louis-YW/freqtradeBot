  "content": "For the East, we have to wait for the result of the Game 7 between the Bucks and Celtics, either team will advance, I think they'll be a good match up with the heat. I like the position of the Heat as they have a good rest, and they also take the home-court advantage. But of course, as usual, let me hear your opinion, which team will win and who/what will be the key to the success of the winner?",

They are explosive on their past few matches against Celtics and can probably carry forward this momentum to a Bucks win. Heat vs Bucks would also be a more interesting matchup than a Heat vs Celtics one, if there'd be no injuries on either teams that is. Better to watch either teams on full power than with handicaps.",

Also, the Bucks bench does not have a great contribution to the team compared to what they did in game 5, so hopefully, they'll make the right adjustment in game 7 as it's not easy to win on the road.",

Game 6 is not really good for them because almost all of them struggles and its hard for Giannis to sustain the team if his teammates didn't provide quality numbers to help him out to win the game. Also game 7 is really tough for them knowing how crazy active the celtics fans and for sure the audience will add up the pressure to the game and this is huge advantage for Celtics to take over this to advance on next round.",

They are the defending champion and they should play like a champions, Iâ€™ll go for Bucks here and have a bet as well. Miami should be more ready this time and no time to take that rest, their next games will be a hard one.",

They have the complete package, but it will be a good matchup for the Celtics because they are almost equal, with stars and some defensive players. For sure this could be a low scoring series.",

The Bucks were third. QuoteI understand that last playoffs and current is different but I think Heat is overrated even they clinched the 1st spot in the Eastern Conference.It usually takes a hater to say that a team that clinched no. 1 spot and advancing to the Finals as overrated. A neutral fan would at least pay respect to those achievements. I can even call them as overachieving team.Quote from: Scripture on May 14, 2022, 11:26:32 PM.... the ECF are more intense for me compare to WCF.Â  It appears that way.

Butler is also getting better and better, this is the Butler we've seen going back and forth against Lebron in the bubble 2020.Right, and for those who are at lost as to why Duncan was used sparingly in this series, this is the main reason, and inserted Max Struss because he can play defense. Then they have Victor Oladipo who can explode anytime. And of course their franchise player in Jimmy Butler. Who really shows what a leader he is in their series against the 76ers. But as for the Bucks vs Celtics, just hard to predict this one.",
