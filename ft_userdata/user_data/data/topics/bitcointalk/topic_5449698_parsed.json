No serious bulls happening currently and if it continues in this little increase probably it will not get anywhere close to $60k. Bitcoin can get to $60k or even beyond this year, it may also get below thesame rate as well, if you consider where it all started in the beginning of this year, it has gone bearish to about $15k before rising back to about $30k, now that we only have about a year next to halving, we cannot consider the present situation as a conclusion but rather to take cognitive research and speculate more, maybe before the end of the year or after, there might be high volatility to pump the price high and after the halving, we may have a new all time high.",

      "body": "Earlier this year, bitcoin was below $15k and grew up through to this current price. So not forget that it touches $31o before the retracement back to the current price. Now my opinion is this, bitcoin is not dependent of national policies, it is not dependent on who starts accepting bitcoin now to drive market purchase power which influence the price of bitcoin in a good condition. You just should know that bitcoin is a volatile assets and can be able to pump and dump within seconds of trade. Currently, it's a bull market, there would be large buy order as investors are keying in so they could gather  and together with their own.",

Share your views.Maybe Yes or NoOne thing for sure which I think is that, we still have about 8 months for us to run out of this year and you can never predicts what next month or upper months will results to, just have to be positive about bitcoin growth, from my own personal point there is every possibility for the price to increase greatly since most of the investors and many users already knew halving is around the corner they may utilized this medium to hold lots of bitcoin that will surge price to see nearly $60k, that is to say we are talking about 51 percent market increase within the next 8 months to hit $60k.",

You will have to wait till the next halving and around it to see Bitcoin reclaims its 2021 all time high.

I will keep DCA into my favorite projects for now because it's too uncertain to know where Bitcoin value will be by the month of MAY, some people are saying that MAY is always a bearish month, if that's the case I will be able to get more coins through accumulation. It's all good if you are in this for the long term as there is nothing to be worried about. Do you want advice?

Just because we saw bitcoin grow from $15k to $30k in the first three months, too many people expect new ATH this year, and they forget to check history that we can only have new ATH later a year when halving. We still have a long way to go from the next bull run, so the expectation of $60k this year is a very difficult one to achieve. Optimism is a virtue when investing in bitcoin, but we need to be realistic to avoid disappointment.",

No serious bulls happening currently and if it continues in this little increase probably it will not get anywhere close to $60k. Share your views.In recent times there has been a strong relationship between Bitcoin and the stock market. Almost every economic indicator that affects stocks also influences the price of Bitcoin. Interest rates, economic policies, wars or conflicts, demand, the performance of the fiat especially the dollar, politics, and adoption by nations or big firms will always affect the price of Bitcoin. We saw how the conflict in Ukraine contributed greatly to the fall in price last year. But the recent mini-bull run was unexpected, therefore there is every possibility that Bitcoin can get to $60,000 this year if these factors are favorable to it. But if interest rates keep going high and we have issues like the fall of major exchanges like we had last year, the price might not get to your prediction.",

Share your views.It's very possible for it to get to $60k before the end of this year but that does not mean it will get there. I'm not really good when it comes to price speculating but I'm sure that if Bitcoin does not get to $60k or more before this year runs out it will definitely not fall below $45k, that's just my little speculation. But you can't tell what's going to happen tomorrow or few hours from now so it's possible for everything to change due to an even that might happen which will affect price movement.",

The bull is coming down  again. As it is now, it is $27k and this happened only in one day so just think of what will happen in the few days to come. The first quarter of the year was good and the first two weeks of the second quarter was also good bit now the market is about to change narrative. Now that the price is $27k, let see what will happen tomorrow if the price comes down below 26$ then we might enter another bear market which might happened like last year.",

Share your views.It's possible, and I have heard of analysis that suggests a sort of triple top is possible based on % gain from a relief rally that Bitcoin has seen before, but personally I think around $50K is more realistic for this year. This would be the equivalent sort of bear market relief rally similar to 2019 - or mini-bull market whatever you want to call it - and the current rejection from $30K doesn't really change this analysis only delays the timing. Either way, the fact that most people think $60K isn't possible this year only makes it more likely imo. Similar to reaching $12K in reality.",

Because of the price volatility, I do personally think that sixty thousand dollars is a way too high to give to the market that is just resurrecting from so many years of bear.While I was already contemplating about this, Bitcoin made thirty thousand dollars. This shows that it is not that difficult for it to make sixty thousand dollars this year. But to be fair, let us give Bitcoin the maximum of forty thousand dollars for this year.",

Granted, no one can predict the future, and surprises can come at any time, but based on history, it's impossible to expect such high prices while we're a long way from Bitcoin halving. We're only in a 1.5-year bear season, and if you still believe in a 4-year market cycle, you shouldn't aim too high. For me, if we could end the year with $40k, that would have been a success.",
