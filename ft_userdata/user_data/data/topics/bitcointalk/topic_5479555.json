Because we found many people gain and some loss, whereby is a risky game you either gain or lose, when you have enough to invest you go ahead to.  In this world of today we have many investors who invest much amount of money in bitcoin, all i think is we just go for the one we can afford to hold. Not by going for just a little.  Bigger amount comes with big win or big lose, and small amount comes with small amount or small lose, you are to decide which one you are to take in the risk.",

There are a lot of B.S influencer last bull market and I believe that those influencers really affected newbies by giving them into bad advices, exaggerated speculations and being unfindable when the bear entered the market. There are influencers who are posting good contents but I believe newbies should understand what those guys are telling you.What I learned this 2023 is to act early and fast. There are a lot of opportunities I missed this year, I don't want it to happen again next year.",

But when you hear this general view, you need to do your research to ascertain if the information is valid or invalid. The prediction that Bitcoin can get to $100k is possible, so you shouldn't dispute it.Quote👉 Stop relying on Telegram channels or Reddit groups for trade signals or investment advice.I have heard people say that some groups on telegram have been helpful to them as regards to trading. However, it is important not to totally rely on trade signals from social media platforms. There is always a need to do your research. Quote👉 This advice might seem a little controversial, but I think it's helpful. Stop over diversification, what I call over diversification is putting your money in every crypto project that comes your way.Some altcoins have shown consistency and improvement over the years. However, I prefer to invest only in Bitcoin because dealing with altcoins could be complicated. This is why I would prefer to diversify my investment to other sectors outside the crypto space.",

Good thing OP that you do able to realize and learnt up these things along the way on which i could say or everyone could say that this is precise.You wont really be able to take further step if you wont really be able to realize these things first because once you are stuck into those unrealistic mindset and thoughts then you are really that committing tons of mistakesspecially on to that point above on loving on joining up groups and believing that profitable methods does exist? If you wont really be that make yourself that realize then you would really be finding yourself having that issues on becoming that better. Keep learning as years passing by because this market could be having tons of variations on which it is really just that right that you would really be needing that adjustments so that in next time you would already be that wary on how things works and what are the things that you would be needing to do. Just keep learning until you would be finding yourself that knowledgeable and having those skills on which it causes for you to survive this unpredictable space.",

Let Bitcoin be the first and only coin that you should channel your investment to, because it's more assured than other altcoins that you may want to diversify to. Newbies are less experienced, have less knowledge, and have less ability to do research on any project, which means that they have a high chance of landing themselves in some shitcoins that will not generate any profit but instead cause them to lose their money.Because 1 bitcoin is $42k+, some newbies feel that it is very expensive and that they can't afford to buy it with the small capital they have. They may just invest in a random, cheap coin. These are the reasons why I don't advise newbies to diversify into any altcoin apart from Bitcoin. Someone who's more experienced can do so, knowing the risk involved.",

Research is very important knowing the right thing to do, and I won't agree for anyone to just keep accumulating no matter the condition it will be more convenient to accumulating when the price is down.",

It’s common knowledge in the finance world that diversification is good for business and like the saying goes “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. Many newbies have this mentality and they invest in different altcoins believing they are doing the smart thing.
