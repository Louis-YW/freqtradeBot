  "content": "Commentary is underated in sports and commentators are not giving enough recognition for the role they play in sports.I had this recent experience where I streamed live a recent premier league game and it had no audio, although it was expected to be an exciting game, I did not enjoy the game, not until the audio came up and i could now hear the commentary. Commentators add colour and enhance our viewing experience, they are well informed about the sport and the teams in contest, and give real time updates on a live game that can even make someone new to a sport pick interest. Without commentary and sports commentators, some sporting games will be entirely very unexciting and eventually boring to watch.Can you enjoy your sports viewing experience without commentary and  commentators?",

Sometimes their work necessitates investigation, and I'm amazed by how they know the identities and histories of the players. If your team is fortunate enough to be leading with goals, the way they make fun of their opponents is hilarious to listen to. One thing I like about commentators is that when a channel broadcasts a sporting event, any language person may be a commentator from that side without a language barrier. It's fun when everyone can hear what's going on in their own language.",

Probably only sports which I can watch without commentator is tennis.Problem for commenators that everyone have different preferences, so they can't be liked by everyone. Some people like when commenator talks just about game, others prefer when they talk about things outside the game - telling some stories about players, or talking some rumours. Worst thing when commenator haven't prepared for game that he ccomment or when he is biased.",

During the morning time I prefer watching matches with commentary on regional language. Even when the match is going so serious, some regional language colloquial terms gives some peace of mind than just pumping high.Commentary play a big role and gives the better watching experience. During the covid-19 lockdown we had zero audience matches, it was really bad to watch those matches.",
