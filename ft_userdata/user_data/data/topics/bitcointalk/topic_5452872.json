  "content": "So they have been doing this for the past 3 years and i'm looking on the BTC Mag website for the Miami conference this year and I am sad to not see any mention of BitPay on the vendor list this year. Which would lead me to believe that they are not going to have a collab with APMEX this year and passing out free 1 ounce silver rounds this year....Could this be true? If so, this is completely tragic and I am now very bummed as I was looking forward to continuing my BitPay/APMEX BTC Miami Rounds collection. Say it aint soo!!!",

      "body": "I can't remember if I knew that they were the company that partnered with Apmex to make these rounds or not, but I sure don't remember that these were a Miami conf release, is that definitely the case? And didn't you say there was a round for each year, so what was the other round? BitPay may be shit, I sure as hell wouldn't be surprised being that most exchanges are, but they are an early goer and as I'm sure you know Mopar they were the ones who sponsored the St Pete bowl, which I will always appreciate the work they put in on that and other early day endeavors/advertising for btc. Â Tread you find us any treasures at the conf?",
