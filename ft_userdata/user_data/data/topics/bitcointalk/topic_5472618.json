  "content": "Her guys. I'm looking to move out of Canada and into El Salvador to start a Bitcoin business. Or rather to greatly expand the one I have here in Canada.One problem I have is I am not able to find a fast and affordable source of Bitcoin inside El Salvador.I would need a supplier of Bitcoin in large quantities. Probably around 50k per week to start, and more as the business grows.Fast turn around is important. I need to turn fiat into BTC inside 2-3 days, or faster. The faster the better. I can't really be sending out 10 days long bank wires to US exchanges.And a low margin is also vital. Preferably below 1% margin above spot.Is anyone here inside El Salvador and able to tell me where I could get such a supplier?I hear I could get my Bitcoin from Strike as they are now located in El Salvador. But for the life of me, I have been unable to contact Strike on this matter.Any help from someone inside El Salvador would be greatly appreciated.Cheers, PepeLapiu",

But I can't really blame you, it's for business purposes after all, I just hope that this is a legitimate inquiry because if not then it's a waste of time for you and the person that's going to be talking to you about your proposal. Also, it's in your best interest if you post something about the business partnership proposal in the Service Discussion or Services Board, you might find the person you're looking for in those boards as that's where most of the people that are looking for jobs to do or people that need some work to be done stay and check new postings.",

I can't really be sending out 10 days long bank wires to US exchanges.Have you actually thought about your business plan twice?You need to turn fiat into BTC fast and your problem is that fiat is reaching Salvador to slowly, so you need to go there, but the problem is still there unless you pack your bags full of fiat and do a daily commute between San Salvador and Montreal your flow is still having problems!How does your physical presence help you there when you will still be dealing with banks?  Besides I seriously doubt you have to wait 10 days to get your money into Coinbase!Quote from: LoyceV on November 04, 2023, 01:58:24 PMWhy not use an exchange?

Why? Look what I wrote above.Quote from: PepeLapiu on November 02, 2023, 07:01:14 PM~snipYou are a risky person if you want to exchange money (and quite a lot of it) for bitcoin in the country from central america. Moreover, physically. Why don't you do this in your country of residence, or at least in a transit country where everything is more or less fine? You want to do everything quickly, for which you can pay painfully. In resolving any financial issues, haste is highly undesirable.Also, when moving from Canada to El Salvador, it is unlikely that you will be able to transfer such significant amounts without unnecessary problems from the authorities. If you're talking about cash.",

I mean what do you want to do in El Salvador with the development of bitcoin that you mean? If you intend to buy, there are many exchanges that you can use and for problems with quantities, even though they are limited, you can use several exchanges. I see the history of your post as more about trading, so why go to El Salvador if you can do it comfortably in the country where you live.Quote from: PepeLapiu on November 02, 2023, 07:01:14 PMIs anyone here inside El Salvador and able to tell me where I could get such a supplier?

You don't need a specific Bitcoin that is from inside El Salvador, you can just buy Bitcoin from around the world, easiest way is from Exchange, and since you don't have any trouble sharing all this in a forum you shouldn't mind doing KYC. And after that you could just put those BTC in your wallet and start your business. And after you get into El Salvador you still could buy Bitcoin from around the world, and use it there. There is no specific Bitcoin that can only be used in El-Savador, all Bitcoins is works in El Salvador.",
