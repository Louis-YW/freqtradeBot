Bitcoin is divisible down to 1/100.000.000th (satoshis), that's why you can do thousands of transactions with even a small amount of test BTC.You can also easily just 'experiment with Bitcoin' with regtest, as Dave mentioned above. I don't see why you need 'large amounts' of tBTC.",

You could just use 1 sat/vbyte as TX fee and send only send very small amount of Bitcoin on each output address. But if you insist you need lots of tBTC, you either have to1. Explain in detail why you need lots of tBTC. Most people wouldn't give such amount due to tBTC scarcity and potential you fell for scam.2. Use all faucet which already mentioned.3. Mine tBTC with your own device. While difficulty on testnet is too high for CPU/GPU, you can try your luck by mining block with difficulty 1 if there's no block mined in last 20 minutes.faucets dont work for me, theyre all blocked for some reason. which is why im asking hereI do not plan on sending this to anyone else, I am not buying/selling tBTC and want it purely to experiment with it.",

You seem pretty determined to suck those faucets dry. I'd just like you to know that their limits have a good reason, which is that they just have limited amounts of tBTC available. For general testing of Bitcoin or applications built on it, very small amounts easily suffice (as explained above), and by using unnecessarily large amounts you are taking away tBTC from everyone else. Unless absolutely needed (again; with a good reason, you can get tBTC easily from forum members), you should please avoid sucking faucets until there's nothing left for others.Quote from: dkbit98 on November 03, 2022, 06:02:03 PMQuote from: EndoBTC on November 03, 2022, 02:22:49 PMI do not plan on sending this to anyone else, I am not buying/selling tBTC and want it purely to experiment with it.And how do you want to experiment exactly?
