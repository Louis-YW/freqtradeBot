I ain't sure anyone will be eager to try that experiment with you when you haven't proved anything to us as a whole. We know how this ends. We've seen too many of such to think this will be any different. For anyone to contemplate believing you, you've to give out signals.

Mostly, that the strategy doesn't work at all, and he is just looking for people to collect fees from and sell them the lie.People with excellent strategies don't even bother talking about or selling them off because they can make a tone of money out of it in silence. And about shorting coins that are overbought, it's not a secret. Just go check out the funding rates of coins that have been pumping recently and are now in the overbought level.

And you mentioned that you have the best method for this; what is it then? Can you tell here in the forum?You also mentioned that you have a team in the matter you are talking about, so does that mean you have a group like the signals group when the members of your group should buy and sell? Besides that, it sounds like you are encouraging people in this forum to join your team. Is that right? It's like you're promoting yourself in this section by saying that you have a formula that can give profit to anyone who believes in you, if I'm not wrong in my assessment of you.",

You shared your formula, and what? It sounds like you are not helping others by sharing your formula for trafing; it looks like you are pursuing people to join you. It's not bad, but it just contradicts your intention for this post.Anyway, I also know that trick; in fact, it is common knowledge for every experienced trader, but if you discover it by yourself, then it's good because you've gained a way to professionally earn in crypto trading. There is nothing wrong with short trading; it just doesn't go smoothly sometimes, or you are not utilising the potential for big profits. But of course, it's up to the trader how he will trade to earn; as long as it helps you earn, then it's good.",

And at least to me it is as if you want to get people to follow you and charge them for any signals you may give them.",

A lot of us might have missed a promising strategy only because we judge it early or it doesn't work after our first few tries but if only we try to modify it with our personal strategy or combined it with other strategies that we obtain from other traders, that would have work well. With some of what I've said, it is still not a bad idea to join some groups only to obtain useful information and some strategies that we can use for our modifications later on. I don't think he will show his personal formula as that is like a secret recipe on why he is successful. People should only learn to experiment until they have also formulated their own recipe.",

Will the trend favor you for that?When you start to buy back with DOGE, you have a pretty good option, but you also have a bad option with memecoin. But yes monetizing DOGE is quite different and it's special to have Elon Musk as a loyal fan.When Bitcoin starts surging to reach a new ATH and altseason also arrives, then the time for Altcoins including DOGE will reach its peak. But specifically for DOGE, he will have special rights from Elon with some interesting tweets. So keep piling up to the bottom and you will get the benefits later, but don't forget Bitcoin is the main one.",
