After so much time on the forum, you still act like a beginner who doesn't know what thread spamming is...Well if he locked the other thread and refer us to this thread I would think that is good.Also all of us Og's should be happy we changed his mind.I often refer people in his original mind set to an old movie\"wild in the streets\"the main idea of the movie is planned obsolescence.the slogan they used was \"don't trust anyone over 30\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063808/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_in_the_Streetsmaybe we kept him out of that rabbit hole.",

Don't change a thing with BTalk  I am happy that you made this decision. I also read your last post but was unable to respond to it due to some reasons. But I have the same thoughts and opinions about this forum that you learned from that topic. This forum is full of unique content. People share valuable comments and make valuable posts too.Which are not very easy to read on a smartphone but can easily be read on a laptop or PC. I hope some day an app will be made for this forum so we can easily use it on our mobile devices. But until then, I think we have to use it on our smartphones. I only use it on my smartphone for some reasons. And I think now I am used to it.And you are right about pop-up posts like those on social media, which are algorithmic just to show you things that you like the most. But this platform is not a social media platform. In addition, it is a discussion forum, so things must be different here than they are on social media.",

After some thought I had to make amends to my not so well thought out post immediately but should have just stuck to the OP, I'm locking this thread and quoting it in an edit in the OP. Thanks",
