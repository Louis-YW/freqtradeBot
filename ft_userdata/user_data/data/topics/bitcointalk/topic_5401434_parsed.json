  "content": "About the projectExorde is a web3 protocol that links and collects all the information on the Internet and finds its source. In simple words, Exorde handles any publicly available URL link and, thanks to a decentralized management system, builds a graph with similar information all over the Internet. The idea of this project was actively pursued after the development of low-quality covid information, which needed to be filtered. The development team aims to reduce the amount of viral information on the web and make the internet a cleaner place. But you have to realise that even the original source can be false. The protocol tracks the spread of information on the Internet and shows you what it went through before you came across it.The Ambassador Programme at Exorde Exorde uses a system of rewarding cryptocurrency for spreading the project across the web. In other words, the project has launched its EXD Coin. There are several ways to start earning EXD tokens right now. Around $1.2 million has been invested in the project, so it's definitely worth it. All available information and earning methods are on https://discord.gg/djrefeMZBy far the most effective way to earn this currency is the Ambassador Program. Their number is limited and they are personally chosen by the administrators.Â  To maintain your role, you need to keep working even after your role has been given out. The main task of an Ambassador is to complete daily tasks and activities such as drawings, stats and tweets. There are also special bonuses for them, which are awarded at random. Believe me, such activities are very rewarding!Bouty program at Exorde It is not much different from the Ambassador program. The main difference is the unlimited number of participants and a limited number of tasks. In addition to the basic tasks, no one is restricted to do additional tasks. As with the Ambassador programme, tasks are only given out daily in the Discord. All information is entered into a table at the end of which a new Ambassador will be determined. The main condition is to earn 300 EXD. This may be called qualification for the main role, but remember that time is limited and places may run out soon. Hurry up!The project looks like a very original idea whose agenda is very useful for the community. I believe that projects like this are our future.
