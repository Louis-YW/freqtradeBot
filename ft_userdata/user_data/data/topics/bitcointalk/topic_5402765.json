Everything seemed quite small back then though.The forum itself probably costs as much to run as it receives in views/hits - of fewer people access the site it'll probably be a lot easier and cheaper to run. If the forum does disappear, there are a few user generated sites that store informstion for it and archive sites that used to parse the whole forum on a daily basis (I think it's done once a month now - on archive.org - but I've not checked recently).",

There is nothing impossible but bitcoin extinction is one among possibilities that may never occur.If this bitcoin cease to exist, probably all cryptocurrencies will no more be existing, then what remains? Nothing. Because of that, this forum may cease to continue to be existing. If still existing, there would be a lot of changes.",

Like before, when people said Bitcoin was dead but still the forum still exists not so active unlike when the Bitcoin is in demand(Bull market) there are many active new users joining here on the forum.If maybe never goes up and becomes no value just like you said maybe the forum will not continue to exist but still it depends on Theymos. If it happens I think there are still many believers who will request to continue this forum and support theymos by donating just to continue the existence of this forum for future plans/development.",

Though bitcoin may be the main discussion, there are still altcoins that are being actively discussed under this section. In addition, the price of BTC dropping is an excellent discussion which necessarily has to be discussed and talked about given this very bearish market.Investors and HODLers would definitely want to hear smart opinions of cryptocurrencies veterans and analyst in the market. Given by these facts, I really doubt that the forum's existence is a threat given the significant drop of BTC's price in the market.",

Forum existed and lively here even the bitcoin price is way too low than this current market. The only difference is the more people come here asking why price is going down then thats the beauty of forum since we can speculate and discuss whats possible happening in the bitcoin and crypto space. Even forum ads werent gonna be affected for sure as I believe the payment here is bitcoin.Im thinking OP is worried of it as possible closure or something right? But its not possible to be affected by this crash.",

In short, a bear bitcoin market is a perfect time to start learning the basics of technology, and the bitcointalk forum happens to be a suitable place to get answers to your questions. Of course, the \"quantity\" of posts may decrease during the bear market, but the quality of posts, which is a more important metric, is going to skyrocket because of the fact that people on the forum seeking knowledge will want to be educated and also educate less experienced users.",

From the financial angle, the forum allegedly holds something between 125 BTCs and 1250 BTCs (read through this thread to try to depict the most likely figure from all the posts within). Plus there is revenue made through add. That means that, unless BTC really really tanks, there should be an ample margin to subsist for quite some time with the operative costs.We could compare price variations against some of the charts on this thread, namely the second chart (Unique IPs from logged-out users) and third (Unique IPs from logged-in users), and although the data is goes up to the 9th of february 2022 (lacking the more recent months), you can see a seemingly stable historical underlying floor of forum participants no matter what. Sure campaigns may take a hit, and that may drive a bunch of people off the site, but there should still be enough people around (and history) to make it worth while running the forum.",
