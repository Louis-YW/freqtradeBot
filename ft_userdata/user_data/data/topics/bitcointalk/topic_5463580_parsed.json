If you do anything brain wallet related, at least make use of heavy encryption.Hello, that is why I recommend you to set enough length of nonce ( > 10000 ) to make it resistant to the brute force attack.I am also planning to adopt some powerful password-hashing functions like Argon2 https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2 but it will not be the default option since not many browsers or user environments support WASM and since Argon2 is not the standard yet. ( As we stated on the FAQ, we are currently only using the standard WebCrypto function to make any modern device compatible ).About the brute force, our key generation from the email and password is still stronger than the original brain wallet implementation from https://coinb.in/#wallet ( only doing 50 times of SHA256 digest vs 100 x ( nonce ) times of SHA256 digest + PBKDF2 key stretching) and still, we haven't heard a man using coinb.in wallet getting robbed due to the brute force attack so I think it is still secure as it is. ( Unless somebody brings up FPGA loaded with the custom script to brute force with every leaked email and passwords )",

Copy-pasting those entropy values to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ will give you the same mnemonic phrases.To prevent brute force I think the generation time of 1~5 seconds is a safe measure but I don't think people will brute force them if you are using longer and safer password values.See https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/.",

This website is only at the proof-of-concept stage for those who seek easy binding of the mnemonic against something easy to remember. My idea to publish the website here is to gather any ideas that could lead to improvement and get the audit done. If the function is mature enough, will port to other languages like C or Rust for a secure key generation framework. JS is preferred since it could demonstrate the whole process on Node.js and Web Browsers without sacrificing much time for building a UI.Still, this tool will provide you with convenient crypto storage as easy-to-remember mnemonic words that could be used across wallets like Metamask or Electrum if you don't intend to store millions worth of crypto.",

Not for testing my skills, but this website ( bip39.org ) will be a platform for various tools helping the management of BIP39 Mnemonic phrases.It is like building a safer, and more utilizable vault for your money, if your house is safe enough to store money in any place you would like it would be fine.But what I want to provide is a tool to help manage those who aren't and need some extra help.2. It is true, so I have placed a warning not to use details that could match with credentials that are used for other platforms.3. You might feel comfortable using Electrum for Bitcoin, but the mnemonics are also used for non-bitcoin wallets like Metamask and they are mostly browser-based ( js-based ) wallets.So, the security of the wallet generation itself will remain at the same level for other wallets.",
