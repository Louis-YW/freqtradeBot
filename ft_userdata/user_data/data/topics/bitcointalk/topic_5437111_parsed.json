Is it gone in your right-click menu?Check your setting if you've disabled \"Use Replace-By-Fee\". It's in \"Tools->Preferences->Transactions tab\".Note: changing the setting now will not enable the cancel option in existing unconfirmed transactions in your history, only the newly created txns.Also, if you're using the advanced transaction window, make sure that \"Replace by fee\" checkbox isn't unchecked.Another is, it won't appear for \"same-wallet\" transactions, means sending to any of your own wallet's address.",

Those warnings are telling you that although the signatures for the file are valid for the keys you have imported, you haven't signed the keys using your own key to tell your computer that you trust these keys are accurate and actually belong to the relevant users (ThomasV, Emzy, SomberNight).This step is not necessary and you can safely ignore these warnings and install Electrum from the file you have. Alternatively, if you wish to sign the keys, you can do so using the following command:Code:gpg --sign-key 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6Once you have signed them, repeat the verification process and those additional warnings will have disappeared.",
