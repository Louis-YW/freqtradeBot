I started selling off my Nvidia 1070/1080 series cards that I mined with for three years in late 2020 and decided not to purchase newer gen cards with the funds. Could have waited another six months and got more for said gpu's, but I'm not in the business of buying bottoms and selling tops. Sure the merge could have been delayed yet again, but I wasn't willing to bet on it. So no new card.I overpaid for some gpu in early 2018, but no worry. Most were purchased in 2017 at good price point. Now you sell them at loss or continue to hold onto them while manufacturer releases newer and newer cards, this decease value of your card even more.

Hello Metroid. Hehe  wise decision sir , i am currently trapped with about 20+ RTX30xx card  , but i believe the profit will recovery eventually since there are people selling cards which may lead the hash market come to a equilibrium.",

It's still just speculation. Let say some projects adopt ZK mining, 1. are they going to be as widely adopted as Ethereum was? (ETH's wide adoption is the reason it was so profitable)2. Will they grow astronomically in price and stay somewhere up there even in a bear market, like ETH did from the time of its inception?So there will be so many factors at play before we even think about that high profitability that ETH POW mining offered",

Hello Metroid. Hehe  Could also just wait for the next bull cycle. motherboards I bought in 2019 for $175 sold for $500 in 2021. GPUs will sell for ridiculous prices again too. Let's see.",

ZK mining sounds shortsighted. It's not FPGA or ASIC resistant. And just because navmine or w/e says they \"believe\" it will take time before FPGA and ASIC catch up we all know that isn't true. Based on experience, FPGA is very fast and ASIC can be just as fast if the juice is worth the squeeze.We already have a mining algorithm that is very good for GPUs and not very good for FPGA or ASIC: ProgPoW. And when combined with polyphasic engineering to swap between various ubiquitous general purpose processing (CPU, GPU, Mobile processors) there are already better solutions then ZK mining which is acknowledged as mineable by FPGA and ASIC.",

Hello Metroid. Hehe  It's 2018 all over again but mining won't be in this same hole forever, all altcoins are down 90% or more, those who don't stop mining now will still make a lot when market start showing bull strength, I will only stop mining if I can't afford electricity bill but for now I just let the Sun power do its thing.",
