  "content": "Quote“Demographic shifts” can mean many things. The composition of a body of people—median age, ethnic makeup, and more—all fall into the category.But in the context of the labor shortage that has gripped the world economy since the pandemic began, it has coincided with one of Elon Musk’s big worries: The world isn’t having enough babies.He has previously said the world’s declining birth rate is “one of the biggest risks to civilization,” which will “crumble” if the world doesn’t have more children. Now two major employment websites, Indeed and Glassdoor, are looking forward to 2023’s workforce (and well beyond that) to predict whether the “demographic shifts” of the last few years will continue. In short, yes—and it means the labor shortage is here to stay for a while.Using World Bank projections and analyzing employment trends across several countries, economists for both job sites found the number of people of working age (15 to 65) is set to decline in the coming years. That means hiring will be more difficult and workers will have more leverage over employers.The decline in people of working age will partly stem from an aging population, the number of deaths exceeding births, and reduced immigration. For example, the U.S. and U.K.'s population growth will be driven solely by net migration. And in the U.K., deaths are projected to exceed births by 2025.The U.S., U.K., France, and Canada are all projected to see their working-age population decline by more than 3% from 2026 to 2036.Meanwhile, during that same period, Germany is projected to see a decline of more than 7%—driven by its aging population and migration trends that haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels.Additionally, the report said Japan’s demographic prospects are “particularly stark,” with its population forecasted to fall from 128 million in 2010 to below 100 million by 2050—and the share of those ages 65 and older will soar.“Without sustained immigration, an increase in labor productivity, or a focus on attracting workers on the sidelines of the labor force, these countries simply won’t have enough workers to fill long-term demand for years to come,” Indeed and Glassdoor’s chief economist wrote in a foreword to the report.So despite warnings of a looming recession, and a potential decline in “employers’ hiring appetites,” finding candidates will be a challenge—giving way for workers to demand higher pay, stronger benefits, and flexible schedules.“In a moment like this, with so many headlines about layoffs, it perhaps feels a little bit weird to talk about long-term hiring challenges,” Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at Glassdoor, told Bloomberg. “But the reality is, it is precisely in moments like this when it's easy to lose the trees for the forest. It’s easy to conflate the near-term cyclical with long-term structural challenges in the labor market.”But a declining birth rate isn’t necessarily bad news despite the hiring challenges it may present. It’s often a sign of economic progress: Women have more opportunities to choose their own path in life, whether it’s prioritizing school, a career, or a life without children at all.While some demographers worry alongside Musk that this could create a workforce crisis down the line, it doesn’t have to come to that if society adjusts properly. This may vary from country to country depending on their economies, but it's at least the case in the U.S., as Christine Percheski, associate professor of sociology at Northwestern University, told Insider last year, the country would need to make structural adjustments like creating new policies that accommodate changes in population size.Besides—while U.S. birth rates hit a record low during the pandemic, a new study from the Economic Bureau of Research found that there was a COVID “baby bump” after all. Whether this will hold steady is unclear, but it shouldn’t matter for the workforce if we shift our mindsets to view a lack of labor as more of a new norm than a shortage and adjust accordingly.That might begin with paying attention to employees’ changing wants and needs. They care more about a company’s culture and its diversity and inclusivity initiatives, the report found. So to stay competitive in a challenging labor market, employers have to keep up with workers’ demands.“Beyond a competitive wage, offering employees top-notch benefits, positive, engaging company culture, and commitment to DEI initiatives will remain incredibly important to help win talent in a competitive and changing labor market,” the report said.https://news.yahoo.com/world-baby-shortfall-bad-labor-190124685.html....I seem to remember economic charts claiming average worker productivity has more than doubled from the 1950s to present day. If productivity continues to increase, the population and worker size needed to sustain construction, maintenance and development projects should shrink. On the opposite end of the spectrum, reports have claimed more than 50% of jobs are vulnerable to automation. People of today are caught somewhere in the middle of both trends. Not the most comfortable or stable place to be. And so perhaps begins the genesis of some of the future crisis we will face.The unsaid argument would appear to be one where predominantly european nations attempt to produce more children. To maintain a majority in the face of high immigration. Not knowing that many 3rd world countries have families that produce 10 to 20 children as an ideal standard. If residents of european descent nations could produce that many children, I think they could not afford to feed, school and clothe them. The strategy is flawed on a fundamental level. It is also possible that nations of european descent have lived without real competition or conflict for too long. It has made us soft and unappreciative of the high standards of living we enjoy. Perhaps being forced to compete and struggle for survival will bring the best ouf of us. And that will not necessarily be a bad thing.",

And that will not necessarily be a bad thing.No continent or nation is an island, because we all need each other to survive. Currently Asia and Africa has population advantage than Europe, while Europe are more prosperous and technologically advanced. Europe would continually need immigrate workers because it seem that most families are not willing to give birth to many children. But most families in Africa can somehow afford to give birth and rise many children even in the face of economic hardship. It has been like this for many centuries and it would take a long time to change this population imbalance. Europe don't need to compete with other countries regarding population because they might never win. Workable and productive immigration policies should be put in place to attract the right skills from other populated countries to Europe. Rich countries should invest on these developing and populated nations in areas like infrastructures, education and security. This would discourage illegal immigrations and also serve as a immigration pool where European nations can successful attract the needed manpower that might coverup for their population deficiency.",

      "body": "Normally the young workers subsidize the cost of of older retired workers but the ratio isn't proportional anymore with how high the life expectancy is and how low the birth rates are, so perhaps countries with lower birth rates could loosen up the immigration laws and import more labor for lower skilled jobs and allow immigrants to work up the economic ladder. There are millions of immigrants ready to immigrate to newer countries if given the opportunity -- cultural assimilation would be a barrier, but I figure it's a low cost to pay if your population isn't able to maintain itself.",

It has been like this for many centuries and it would take a long time to change this population imbalance.    They afford to give birth, but they don't afford to actually grow them and provide the resources for studying and changing their lives, they will live in poverty, sharing the few pennies their parents earn, then marry at your age to split the costs of living then having more kids because that's how they were bought up and so on and on.The same thing happened in Europe also, my grandparents combined had 21 brothers and sisters, and now only one of all my same-age relatives has 2 kids the rest, just like me have just one.The focus has shifted from having a large family to supporting each other to having a smaller one that can afford everything without sacrifices.Quote from: Hydrogen on November 23, 2022, 10:46:17 PMIn short, yes—and it means the labor shortage is here to stay for a while.Oh wait, does this invalidate the other 10 articles you linked about the sky-high unemployment that will follow this \"recession\", and other predictions?",

I've seen a lot of research that in the vast majority of cases, such investments pay off, so it's not only ethically but also economically desirable.Not to mention a couple of positive things the article mentioned, such as fewer births indicating more opportunities for women being available and workers now having more leverage over employers due to labor shortage.",

In my opinion, demographic problems are problems that can be solved, it is not fatal for humanity.To be honest, I haven't thought of that. Now, due to the modern age, condoms are pretty much the easiest and safest method to prevent STDs and unwanted pregnancies. A few decades ago, their usage wasn't as widespread compared to now, which potentially also contributes to the birth deficit the West is facing. You can easily guess that 3rd world countries aren't keen on using them judging by how many children they're having, living in poor conditions, and often working since a very young age. People in the past had larger families but different raising standards. Children now require a lot more attention and activities, and we're focusing on their education. The total population is constantly rising; it reached 8 billion a few days ago, but this increase is not coming from the West. In the next few years, we're going to face extreme immigration issues, something we're already facing.",

In the process of making shoes there is something called cutting. and the number of workers is thousands of people. and now almost everyone in charge of cutting at the factory has been dismissed. because the factory now uses machines/robots to process cutting materials for shoes. so that the presence of these machines or robots has caused thousands of people to lose their jobs in my area. and I think things like this don't just happen in my area but on other area too.so for me for now we (in my country) are more worried about the fewer job vacancies. while undergraduate graduates continue to grow every year. and causing the unemployment rate to continue to rise.on the other hand, MSMEs also continue to grow more rapidly because people who do not have a job prefer to make their own business. it looks good. but in fact the competition is getting tighter. so that the number of consumers is not balanced with the increasing number of traders. so that many of the MSME traders experienced bankruptcy.I think worrying about the current declining population rate for some countries is unnecessary. but I also know that in some countries there is a shortage of workers and it is only natural for some of these countries to be worried about the decline in the population level in their country. but the solution is always there and has even been done.namely countries such as Japan and Malaysia always bring in workers from other countries which do have excess workers such as from Indonesia.Another solution to the shortage of workers is the use of robots which are now growing rapidly.And it would be hilarious if one day the people who spoke about the concerns of the human population and workers. are those robot developers. which has replaced many human jobs.Sorry if my discussion is a little off topic.And what is noteworthy is that the Indonesian state has actually carried out a family planning program since 1957. That is, we were only advised to have 2 children per family. but population growth here is still out of control.(Bkkbn.go.id)",

It's been almost 8 years since the large migration from the middle east to Europe, and I am still not hearing about all the positive benefits which were promised to us. It's true that European countries are ageing and we need more young people over here. But what is more critical is that European countries try to get all their young people into universities. It became so common to have an Bachelor or Masters degree over here, that we are lacking a lot of young people doing the actual work. There are more than 1 million people missing from the workforce in specialised works like construction, nursing, electronics or other jobs where you don't need a long theoretical education but rather a practical education. And from what I have heard is that young people who are immigrating to Europe are also not keen to work in those areas. Many parents from abroad doing everything in their power to send their children to university over here. It also doesn't help that university education is for free and the government will give you money for your living expenses without any interest during your studies. This trend is going to get larger in my country, we will have more unemployed university graduates and not enough actual workers doing the necessary jobs. Hopefully with the double digit inflation we have now the income for the lower level jobs is going to rise exponentially to make it more attractive for younger people in school right now to switch career paths.",
