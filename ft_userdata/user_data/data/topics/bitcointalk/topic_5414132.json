Out of the 3 reports on the link I provided, two are obvious fake reports, create to shill what are very likely scam sites trying to get even more out of the poor sods souls that fell for the original scam. The third report may be legit and is often an encountered case, albeit it basely goes into details. These type of sites could be useful for some in some instances, although if one is conscious enough to look into them, he’ll likely be able to spot a scam from a mile away to begin with.",

It is really sad what happened to you, but I think you should be careful about Bitcoin transactions in advance, if it's not trustworthy or not reliable, then it is better not to do the transaction. I don't think the scammed money from you can got back or they can be identified because the only clue left by them is some virtual number.",

That was the first question came to my mind. In what mean (way) did he meet, and what business did they agree before he sent that huge amount of money. Is like the OP wanted to quick rich over night. The OP would have stated how or what transpired the transaction. What really made you to transfer the money? OP your story is not clear.

By the way franky1 has given you the full details so you can use that. And I don't think that fund can be reversed unless the person on his own willingly send it back to the OP.",

As you were told above, the chances are almost zero to be able to find a person with only btc-address and a number that most likely doesn't belong to him, which means that he is not connected in any way with the person you are looking for. This is a very difficult problem, which could be solved by additional information. That is, more details of the story when you were deceived.
