  "content": "A record book for Bitcoin history and the future of virtual money.My source is cyberspace. I'm not a trained writer or anything just trying to sum it all up quickly. People are bloody late and more will come so lets make it easy and kill the lies and confusion.  So, help improve the book for the community if you dare. If you're a writer or editor pull something through the GitHub and if it makes since I'll accept it. Let's make this the greatest Bitcoin book on the internet. FREE for all. For all who want to be informed about the origin of virtual money. A bit of a prediction book too. So, if you have some predictions tell it.Will give credit in the credit section of bookBy Coin Vader & the BitcoinTalk.org Forum Membershttps://github.com/coinvader/afterbitcoin",

It's a process and I'm willing to donate some crypto to whoever helps improve. I'd like to donate using something like Tomochain (TOMO) which went from .37 cents to over 1 dollar in 3 months or another cheap one that may go up some X's.  The book is on github.com so members can pull and improve it in any way they feel. I would like it to be used as a \"crypto bible\" to all. I have a church called Church of Cryptocurrency inside a metaverse world.

Any profit is not demanded it is donated like a church when people tithe. It is up to you I want to put this book in the public domain. So there is no property rights for anyone. Im willing to take a chance to educate people about the history of cryptocurrency. The information is the real reward that people can use to make profits. Bitcoin is open source so I just want to try follow that format with a book and see if people can understand. The book is free for all. I will try to not take anybody's intellectual property rights. That's why the book needs to be edited down and worked on to a final version. This may be a continues thing as it keeps being updated over the years. Cryptocurrency is still in the early stages of development. The whole idea is for people to get information and become financial free.",

From both sides, both as a reader and as an editor.OP, as a support to you, I offer you a domain and hosting as a donation for this idea, if you seriously want to commit to the whole thing.I would like to put a poll for a possible title change. Do you have any names? I know the title can turn people off because of religion and they might think conspiracy. But fact is Bitcoin saved some people's lives and they became financial free or in a better situation. The world is powered by currency. People get up everyday and work for money or hustle. To some people money is their God and they are nothing without it. It's not about conspiracy it's about facts and truth about cryptocurreny. Maybe we can use the Bible as an example what really happened maybe if there was a blockchain back then we could have caught fraud. This is why I attach the religious aspect of it because Christianity is the most popular religion. I'm not apart of any religion or cult. But I know there is deception right in your face when dealing with religion or money.The internet exposes both like a new born baby. It's obvious something went wrong and it's still wrong. So the conspiracy stuff gets destroyed. This is really happening open your eyes and see.  But sime people will remain the way they are so this is not for everybody first off. You should get the mass adoption thing out of head. Just like when Bitcoin came into being. People rejected it and still do. Bitcoin is genius but the fact is something went wrong along the way. This can help fix that if people can be aware of the past.anything can be a conspiracy. MCDONALD'S too much ketchup it's a conspiracy. Only joking but it could be pushed into society and tirned into something bad. After Bitcoin could mean a marking point like BC before christ and Bitcoin died. My first thought is what is going to happen post Bitcoin. The average person can not afford 1 BTC. What do they do now?  Where do they go? If you put 100 dollars in Bitcoin and it 10x that's only $1000 profit. They are no where close to being financially free. Even with a 1000 dollars it's not enough. I'm talking about the homeless person on the street the college student in debt. How are they going to get out through crypto. Bitcoin already went up. Too bad they missed it but it's not over.

You could also add some images, graphs, or tables to make it a bit more interesting to the readers.   All this is exclusively your work? No sources?No, there's no way this could possibly be all my work. If you truly want to get Bitcoin wrapped up in a book you would have had to be there from the beginning thoughts and after. There are sources all over you can copy google and find stuff. It should be audited but we don't have time to argue. Let's wrap it up. Some of its my thoughts but most is research. If you don't know about something especially a new industry you must research other people's work. I could rewrite things in my own words it's still saying the same thing he or she said. I'm trying to cut down the need of all these books on crypto and consolidate it into one. Just one book doesn't matter where the source comes from on the internet. As long as it's true and it has some evidence. I'm aware it's a ruff draft that's why I'm coming to the community for help. I'll shorten the paragraphs and all that and make it better. Before I even put it up I could have reworded things and tried to make it look like it was mainly me. Doesn't matter who I 'am it's about the TRUE INFORMATION. I'm glad Satoshi stayed anonymous. That was the best decision ever. So people don't know his personal mindset or self-interests. Of course, I want to make money some kind of way. The real question is how much? Will I get rich probably not, In my mind I'm already rich. But you need money to maintain a decent life free from bad debt and hard labor. Thats the goal all this fancy LAMBO and jewelry that's not real. When someone dies that stuff is nothing anymore. I don't know Satoshi's financial situation before Bitcoin but he knew that it wasn't supposed to be that way in this system. What did you leave behind to grow and the path to follow? Does anybody want to follow your path? Not you but the stuff you did. I'm not trying to take anything personal. I know we are here to make money. You have to make a certain amount of money to get free and there's no way around it. Satoshi Nakamoto made money from Bitcoin. Was he greedy? hell no. I know it's difficult to look at the writing because its ruff. Early Bitcoin code probably was difficult to look at even the symbol lol. Its a process it just started. This is long term 100-year log. I already know people are going to throw it in the trash like early bitcoin. People were giving it away for FREE!!! some still don't care it's ridiculous. Even if you hated it you could have cashed out and bought so much gold. I talk about this in the book. This book will be short but its packed with information.I read books so many words and i get nothing from it. People focus so much on showing of their academic literal ability they forget what's important. I don't think images can truly help a book what helps a book truly is substance. What makes a book are the words but I understand what you're saying. This is not going to be for that type of reader. Its time to think and fill your head with important things built with words. AI will weaken people even further smart phones can make people dumb or possibly stupid.",

I don't know exactly what you're looking for as a testimonial, because bitcoin mining is just a matter of calculations between the cost of infrastructure, equipment, energy, and the expected income depending on the difficulty and the price of BTC.Personally, I've been able to pay off my house and a few years of peace and quiet by mining at the right time, and I now manage a good hashrate, about a few Ph/s. I think that on this forum you should find interesting stories more or less related to BTC mining, for example if you are look on the work of kano and ck you will have, in my opinion, a story representative of a chapter in the history of BTC. If you're interested in industrialists miners, it's going to be more complex, I think, because it's a very closed niche.",

If you search for it there's a token sale I'm in the process of creating a game to support the token. There's two version's one for Vadermoon and one for GoldencoinJust want to put it out there before anybody tries to expose me someway. This book is separate from that venture but It will be posted on http://vadermoon.computer as a PDF download.I will put the first versions soon. As there are two now but I have to start working on the other one. It will things that the other does not have. you would have to read and find out. You can compare these versions to Christ and Morpheus.",

I can send you crypto to set up website. It's not that much to create a website but you can operate that link. Already trying to allocate control of the project. So, nobody has total control. As far as I know, when finding the best solution for a business, a book in your case, it is ideal to look for a combination of a name and a free domain at the same time. Like your Vadermoon token, you certainly don't want to find that after you've set everything up, for example, Vadermoon is a well-known bike parts company. Maybe you can try to ask ChatGPT for some title ideas.",

There are sources all over you can copy google and find stuff. I think you should mention the sources you used to write the book to not find yourself in a position where someone calls you a plagiarizer. I was pretty sure you had to use various resources. But try to remember them and give them the credit they deserve. I definitely understand giving credit to where its due. There is reason why I'm not too concerned about plagiarism because the complete work is more important than the credit. In my opinion anybody can be Coin Vader it's an open name i won't be looking to copywrite or get credit for it. I want my privacy like Satoshi did and names could hurt the product. I'm going to give credit to people in this forum if they contribute its documented inside the forum. I'm really only concerned about giving credit to the members on the forum. It was built from in this Forum even though it had another site before and all that stuff in the book. If somebody wants credit I would be happy if they signed up and claimed it. I want to see where the super ego lies and who's going to try to outshine the work. Who's more concerned about credit instead of truth. ITs sad to see the situation with Bitcoin and the courts. People claiming this and that and fighting over who started this and who owns that. Imagine if Bitcoin would have totally failed, you think they would be doing that? probably not. Who knows who really started Bitcoin the real ID. I'm looking for clarity and end game. Time to bring this money game to an end quickly. Thats the goal to free the average person without them even knowing what really happened but able to find out. Things got better worldwide all of a sudden. The truth spread through the internet quickly. Without anybody screaming hey where's my credit. The data will show so you won't have to try to prove. I'm going to make the book smoother and more attractive to readers as i go. It's important that I translate a ot of the information in different words so it gets received better if needed. Some of it doesn't need to be changed at all but I know I want it to flow like water. There are a lot of books already about Bitcoin but what about the future and how this can be used in society. Where's the use case and adoption? Bitcoin's great but the truth is only 7 transactions a second is not good worldwide. Bitcoin is still the God of cryptocurrency but what else is coming? bump the conspiracy talk. The Federal Reserve is supposed to release something this year in July. It's a currency War going on and Bitcoin needs some help. Bitcoin Vs the US dollar. What other cryptocurrencies are going to step up? If a group of wealthy people in America came together, they could crash Bitcoin back down to $2000. They could short the hell out of it. When you connected to the federal reserve who can print as much as money they want there's a problem. I would call it a possible prediction.  The price of Gold was corrupted so I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was hijacked.  When you see Billions of dollars being pulled out pretty quickly its obvious. Bitcoin is moving like someone is hitting a light switch its ridiculous. Something else has to rise up and help the original Bitcoin concept.",
