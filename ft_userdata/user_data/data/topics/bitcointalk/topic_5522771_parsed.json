But what is your goal? If it is safety, bitcoin blockchain is very safe. Also what that matters at your end is to protect your wallet. You can use cold wallet instead. Or get yourself a reputed hardware wallet.There is no coin that is comparable with bitcoin. It is the most adopted coin.",

My friendsaid that I should use MXR instead.  Someone please provide some clarification. If I should convert to XMR or isthis guy exaggerating?!?Depends on what you mean by \"tracked\", and it probably also depends on how you use your btc...A little bit of context that might even be more confusing than the original question:all transactions use unspent outputs as an input, and each transaction creates new unspent outputs, these unspent outputs fund addresses of whoever you're paying and usually a transaction also creates an unspent output funding your own change address.All transactions are stored on a public ledger, so if your friends defenition of being \"tracked\" means that everybody can see the transaction you created on the public ledger, he is right. If he means a seller actually knows which change address you own, and which unspent outputs you used, he is also right.If he means that anybody knows your identity, your location,... based on the blockchain, he's *probably* wrong. Transactions are stored on the public ledger, but they're just that: transactions. If you don't post your addresses on public fora, only people that either funded your address, or got an address funded by you will know part of the addresses you own (and part of the unspent outputs you controll). With some data mining, they might discover some more addresses controlled by you, especially if you re-use addresses.I used the word *probably* because a lot of people actually use exchanges or online wallets instead of using software wallet, hardware wallets or airgapped wallets. If you give complete controll to a thirth party, they'll know quite a bit about you (amongst other things, they probably know your ip, which addresses you generated, which unspent outputs you controll). If you completed a KYC procedure, they'll even know a lot more. If you use a software wallet, this is less of an issue... But even with software wallets, there's a difference... If you run a full node, you'll broadcast transactions trough your own node, and your own node will broadcast them further, but the peers of your own node will not know the transaction was created by you or if you merely rebroadcast a transaction you yourself received. An SPV wallet does require you to connect to an SPV server, and they might know a bit about you.Personally, i would not advice somebody to start using XMR. There's enough scrutiny for bitcoin users as it is, XMR has a much lower market cap, way less hashrate, way less nodes, way less users, way less people accept XMR, and it has a much worse rep than bitcoin. Don't get me wrong: my advice is just a personal opinion, i have no problems with people using XMR!If you're worried about your anonimity and/or safety, i'd probably advise you to look at your OPSEC. Don't use exchanges or online wallets, keep your own keys on your own devices. Make sure your keys are safe (use airgapped or hardware wallets), don't post personal details, stay away from KYC, use tor,... Also, don't re-use addresses, and make sure you're in controll of your unspent outputs.",

If I should convert to XMR or isthis guy exaggerating?!?As clearly said above XMR is a privacy coin but that doesn’t mean bitcoin which its transactions are publicly stored cannot be used as such too. Bitcoin is regarded as a pseudonymous coin which can be used just the way you like it. For privacy sake you can actually do the things stated above or simply do the following too. 1. Run your own node; running your own node actually gives you the ability to validate transactions yourself and also remaining anonymous by not exposing your IP to a public node you’re connected to if you don’t run your own node (but even with connecting to public nodes you can hide your IP by using TOR/VPN)2. Using different addresses for different transactions, as we all know all the transactions are recorded publicly but the only way to link them to someone is if the addresses are link through transactions and are also linked to a KYC platform. But avoiding any of these makes you stay anonymous",

Several people have suggested options to protect your bitcoin assets and now it is your own responsibility to put in the required effort.

Your friend could have been traced and tracked through many means apart from bitcoin as a matter of fact, having bitcoin is not the reason or means that your friend is tracked, it courbet from his details or devices so let it not sound as if Bitcoin security is not guaranteed.",

Ultimately, the decision is yours. If you're happy with bitcoin's level of privacy, stick with it. But you can take steps to improve it.  Use your own non-custodial wallet and generate new addresses.  Be wise with associations.  There are ways to use bitcoin privately if you need to.  And its transparency brings security benefits too.  Your friend's worries come from lack of understanding, not issues with the tech itself.",
