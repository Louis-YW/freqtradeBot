But what is most important is that you won't earn merits if you continue in this way, garner Bitcoin/crypto/forum knowledge and start communicating with others here, not to earn merits, but with a genuine desire to discuss, help others and improve the general forum quality.Quote from: JeromeTash on May 08, 2022, 07:24:54 PMYou could even get tagged for begging merits.He very well could. But that would definitely be an incorrect use of the trust system, cause from my interpretation, that is not what it was designed for. In this case, at best, the ignore button should do if it becomes constant and annoying.Quote from: xiangwei22 on May 08, 2022, 07:39:02 PMomg. 1 merit so i can post images. if you would be able to sell your merit points, you would have dumped most (if not all) by now.  Then buy a copper membership: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote",

That's not how the merit system works, you should learn how to value this and how you'll get hard work before you'll have even single merit.  Selling merit is also restricted on this forum and no one will risk their account just for that matter.The only solution that you have is to purchase a copper membership, it almost has the same feature as a member rank, it's ideal for a member that has a business here that can able for them to post images for their announcement thread.  Through Bitcoin, you can hide your privacy, just use a non-custodial wallet because this isn't required KYC.

You deserve nothing on this, good luck with your plan and I think with your IP address you can create not less than 2 accounts, more than that you need to pay a small amount of Bitcoin for the evil fees.Quote from: theymos on July 19, 2021, 08:25:17 PMOnly abused IP ranges have to pay a fee. The fee is an anti-abuse measure, and it is not meant to be (and isn't) much of a source of revenue.If any very-veteran members want to volunteer, I can give you the ability to whitelist users. (All Staff can already whitelist users, as well.) Perhaps then someone could create a topic like \"List of email addresses for people who can whitelist you for free\", which I could link-to on the evil fee page. However, these IPs have evil for a reason. If it was sufficient for them to just solve a captcha or something, I'd have them do that. Before whitelisting someone, you have to do something to be pretty sure that they're not evading a ban and just going to get banned again. You may get the impression from complaints on the forum that everyone hits the fee and it's never warranted, but this is selection bias: the fee is more rare, and the vast majority of accounts that hit it should not be whitelisted.",
