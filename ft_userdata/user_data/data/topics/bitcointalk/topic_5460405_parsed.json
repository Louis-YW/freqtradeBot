  "content": "On July 17, 2023, Russia withdrew from the “grain agreement” and officially notified Turkey and Ukraine, as well as the UN secretariat, of its objection to the extension of the “grain deal” for the export of grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports to the world market.In connection with the termination of the Black Sea Initiative and the curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, from 00:00 Moscow time on July 20, 2023, all ships en route to Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea will be considered as potential carriers of military cargo. Accordingly, the flag countries of such vessels will be considered involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime, the Russian Defense Ministry said.Thus, Russia stated that it intends to sink any civilian ships that will be sent to the Black Sea ports of Ukraine. This will greatly complicate the delivery of agricultural products to many poor regions of the world. Due to Russia's sabotage of the \"grain corridor\" in recent months, the world has not received an additional 25 million tons of agricultural products from Ukraine. In total, 1,002 vessels left Ukrainian ports during the year of this agreement. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine, since the start of the “grain agreement”, more than 33 million tons of products of Ukrainian farmers have been exported to 45 countries of the world.It is worth noting that after withdrawing from the grain deal, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian ports with missiles and drones for the third night in a row, trying to hit terminals with Ukrainian grain. So, on July 19, 60,000 tons of grain were destroyed in the terminal of the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk, which was planned to be delivered to the world market two months ago.With its piracy, Russia is blackmailing the whole world, trying to partially lift sanctions for its military invasion of Ukraine and jeopardizing food security in the world, thereby increasing the threat of hunger in many poor countries of the world.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://1prime.ru/state_regulation/20230719/841129477.html&ved=2ahUKEwjp-8fln5uAAxUCGhAIHUh2CGgQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Y-4 amIIxS74jQpfr8rfTwhttps://news.zerkalo.io/world/44156.htmlhttps://m.gordonua.com/news/war/rossiya-zayavila-chto-budet-schitat-vse-suda-idushchie-v-ukrainskie-porty-perevozchikami-gruzov-voennogo-naznacheniya-1673774.html",

Therefore, the only and favorite method of the Kremlin fuckers remains - TERROR, and an attempt to just \"shit on everyone\".  Terror both military and economic.At that, the official version is the failure to honor some promises and agreements.... It is ridiculous to hear an international criminal country squealing about agreements and treaties that it itself violates at every step, in total. But let's leave that for psychiatrists to investigate The real reason is the critical importance of the return of the SWIFT bank RosSelkhozBank. Why ? This bank is owned by the son of Patrushev, the head of the FSB. The purpose of this bank is to serve the money of the Russian top brass - laundering, withdrawal and other illegal activities with the criminal money of Putin and his inner circle. And no matter how the pathetic underfuhrer squeals that the dollar is worthless, his and his friends' savings are in dollars and stored in banks of the \"decaying west\" ) Everything is very simple - Putin's pocket does not get and loses money. And here will include all methods - from sending hand dogs (look who squeals about returning SWIFT to the specified bank), to direct economic and military terror ! There is only one way out - the destruction of the Rashist regime, as Nazism was destroyed in 1945 .... Otherwise, all this will continue and expand to the whole world",

But the perfect solution to all these problems is a peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine.Yes, I also heard arguments that the terms of the grain deal were violated, since grain was actually supplied not to the poorest, but to developed (quite successful) countries.  In my opinion, this is a rather weak argument.  Additional volumes of grain entering the market, of course, affect the world price of grain.  As a result, poorer countries can buy it at a lower price.  In general, I believe that we should strive to ensure that there is an excess of food in the world.  No one in the world should starve, let alone starve to death.  Human interests must prevail over national interests.  Nations are an abstraction.  Nation states are a relic of the past.  All people can have sex with people of other nationalities and have children from them Because all people belong to the same human species.  This is our reality, not the illusions that politicians juggle.  It is also necessary that there be no hatred towards other people in the hearts of people.  Only love can save the world.https://youtu.be/wKX6JkG2W68",

For them, it makes no difference whether they kill with weapons or by causing famine in some poor country.Besides, blackmail isn't going to help them, because we crossed the threshold long ago when negotiating with terrorists. It is true that some countries depend on cheap grain from Ukraine, but these needs will simply have to be covered from some other sources. Perhaps some think that Ukraine is irreplaceable in this regard, but only the EU produces as much as 6 times more grain than Ukraine, which this year is at only 21 000 metric tons, which is 12 000 metric tons less than the previous year.Source",

If these transport ships are attacked, the escort should elliminate the attacker with air-sea missiles and that would be it.Bullies should be dealt with immediately, otherwise they will become more confident.",

Putin literally has no other outlets for trying to force Ukraine to negotiate, but Ukraine has no interest in negotiating with this evil man and he could not be trusted anyway. Russia is an absolute joke of a country and their leader has taken them from faking an impressive army, to showing that they are completely incompetent.
