  "content": "So I never traded before and considering to do it now.  I know you can trade btc, eth and the main big coins.  There are also ton of altcoins out there like solana which is considered a big altcoin, and altcoins like stellar lumens which is a popular altcoin.  Then you have memecoins like dogecoin and many others that are on uniswap and pancakeswap.  I never used uniswao pr pancakeswap.Now if you want to do short term trading such as buy these altcoins and meme coins and sell them... let say it could be as short as few hours to the most as in a month or so.  But let say you want to be trading daily and thus probably don't want to hold a coin more than a week or so and just want to lock in profits if they have a target price for each altcoin or memecoin you buy.  Do lot of people do this?  Now obviously if you want to make money short term, this wouldn't be possible if the crypto market is going down right?  Thus if btc is going down a lot, pretty much all altcoins follow right?  Very few altcoins go up when bitcoin goes down.  However, I recall many of these memecoins don't exactly follow bitcoin''s price going up or down right?  I'm talking about those memecoins that show up and then probably are gone within few weeks.  Now these memecoins are all frauds right?  I forgot the exact term that is used for these but it's when creator of a coin puts it and then people buy and then the price drops... what's the term for this?  But even if you buy those coins and then sell when you make a profit, it's fine right as long as you don't hold these coins at the end when price falls?If you are planning to trade and make short term trades... do you suggest normal altcoins?  By normal altcoins I mean any altcoin in the top 100.  But probably it should be the top 50 or so.  What about memecoins?  Seems with memecoins you can make a lot more in what you put in right but the risk is higher?  However if you put say $1000 in a memecoin. It can 10x.  You can't really do that with any real altcoin in the top 100 that isn't a memecoin right?  Now if the memecoin goes to almost 0... well you only lose $1000.  But you can 5x or 10x your memecoin right?  So as of now and recently, are there altcoins or memecoins like that?  Such that you buy it and hold on to it for few days or week or weeks and then as long as you sell it before the price plummets you profit?The other question is if you plan to do this type of trading, what exchanges do you have to use?  I only have access to coinbase and gemini so I can only trade in real altcoins so to speak.  Sure you can invest in dogecoin which is a memecoin but it's a top altcoin in a real exchange lilke coinbase and gemini.  But when you talk about those memecoins... what exchange will you have to use?  Is it only uniswap and pancakeswap?  With them, you need to have ETH right?  Thus you send ETH to it and then buy those memecoins?  However, I heard in those exchanges, you have to use wbtc or something like that?  How does that work?  But in the end when you cash out if you can, you would be withdrawing ETH back right from uniswap or pancakeswap?  Or can you withdraw say usdt or usdc or btc back to your wallet?  Anyone here who trade altcoins and especially memecoins and give insight on this?  Also it's hard to 5x even with altcoins now right?  But memecoins it isn't?  Just the risk is much higher?  Now if you could buy 5 memecoins and one of them 10x and the other ones go to zero... then you profit right?  Also do all memecoins and altcoins go to 0?  Or it's always like $0.01 or $0.0000001?",

Quote from: jerry0 on December 02, 2023, 06:46:03 PMNow these memecoins are all frauds right?  I forgot the exact term that is used for these but it's when creator of a coin puts it and then people buy and then the price drops... what's the term for this?  But even if you buy those coins and then sell when you make a profit, it's fine right as long as you don't hold these coins at the end when price falls?Yes they are all frauds. Its called pump and dump shame. The ods of winning is super low and risk/reward ratio is not worth the try. In normal, good casino house edge is around 1-5%. With meme coins its like 90%. Quote from: jerry0 on December 02, 2023, 06:46:03 PMIf you are planning to trade and make short term trades... do you suggest normal altcoins?  By normal altcoins I mean any altcoin in the top 100.  But probably it should be the top 50 or so.  What about memecoins?  Seems with memecoins you can make a lot more in what you put in right but the risk is higher? I suggest bitcoin and if you are greedy and bitcoin volatility is not enough for you ... go with leverage. 99% of altcoins are not worth a penny. Its impossible to calculate if we are about to see a pump or a whale is about to dump to buy new yaht. Just think for a moment. How many projects from top 50 CMC are worth above $1 billion? $1 billion for an open source code that can be cope/paste. Without userbase and mostly without unique use case.

Its much better to do 10% profit (with stoploss, risking 10% loss) with 70% odds of winning than trying to do 100x risking 100% in instant rugpull with odds 1:1000.",

There are a few things I have experienced in the crypto space about altcoins. One is that they carry out token swaps; they can disappear without notice; a token could get delisted and exchanged; and also, there's how a token will be dumped, and the project owners can just abandon the project.So, when trading altcoin, always keep in mind that it could also cause you some loss. Although it's not all, you cannot tell which one is going to cause the loss. While I was trading, I traded altcoins, and I won't lie and say that I have actually made some profit, nor can I deny the fact that I also ran into losses.",

You might think that by choosing five coins, you're bound to have one of them increase by x10, but it's not as easy as you might think. Even if you select 15 meme coins, there's no guarantee of any profit if luck doesn't favor you. High risk remains high risk, and no matter how much you try to minimize it, meme coins are still very hard to predict.IMO, this is no different from buying lottery numbers every day, even with slightly better odds (maybe). Also, the knowledge of luck gained from this experience might not be more valuable than analyzing the top 10 coins. The assessment for meme coins often boils down to whether to buy more or not, nothing more.",

It's about the coin you invest in not how long you want to make the investment.@OP - Check out Bonk. https://www.coingecko.com/sv/coins/bonk its on the Solana blockchain.

Yes, bitcoin trading must be done long-term to maximise the profit and, of course, to gain a lot, but while waiting for the profit, people still have needs, so if they want to, they could do short-term investment or trading, not just in bitcoin but in altcoins and memecoins. Altcoins are the perfect crypto coins subject to short-term trading so that you could earn depends on how a trader executes his trade, but avoid memcoins. Even though it is also profitable by doing short-term trade, memcoins are subject to scams or are a very risky and dangerous form of crypto currency as they tend to go to zero value in a blink of an eye. So better stay out of it. I do long-term trading on some coins, including, of course, bitcoin, but I also do short-term trading or scalping so I can make some profit while waiting for a huge profit.",
