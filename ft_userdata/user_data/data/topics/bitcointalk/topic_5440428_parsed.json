  "content": "A positive feedback loop is a biological term Satoshi used to classify bitcoin, 14 years ago, which convinced me that Satoshi was/is a Full-time scientist; other than just cryptography, he knew all sciences, the human brain, neurology, etc. Because, he studied how the human brain works, he exited his product without fear, understanding that it'll strive without his presence or marketing efforts. What is a feedback loop? According to biology online; feedback loops are biological procedures that help to maintain homeostasis in the body. This occurs when a product or event occurs, and it alters the response of the body.Feedback Loop is classified into two parts; Negative and Positive feedback. In Satoshi's statement, he mentions only one, positive feedback, which is defined in simple terms as an increase, while negative feedback is a decrease. In this thread, I want to imagine what Satoshi was thinking before making his statement, was he only bullish? No, and partly YES. He only made things simple for us to understand that when purchase decrease, the value of bitcoin would decrease too. So, Satoshi saw bitcoin as a body that changes when an event occurs. Linking back to the definition of the feedback loop. In simple terms; bitcoin responds to what happens in the world. The same applies to the people that invest in bitcoin. For instance, when a hack occurs in the market, bitcoin perceives the danger, and a negative feedback loop is triggered. What does negative feedback mean in contrast to positive feedback? Negative feedback shows resistance to the alterations because it works to maintain the mechanism of the body to its actual state and reverse the change. The market would drop in price, and bitcoin would try to stabilize its price again. In the same way, people would stop purchasing bitcoin, which helps to even the write-up by Satoshi, it'll increase in value as more people keep purchasing. Contrarily, it'll decrease in value when the number of buyers decreases.  Positive feedback LoopA simple example is given using the ripening process of fruits to explain positive feedback loops. This helped me with the reality of why Satoshi grouped the market into seasons, bull and bear, just like in fruits. A tree like a Mango has its season of bearing fruits then it ripens and overripe. Aside from the positive feedback loop that sends ethylene to help the ripening process of fruit, one thing happens with humans, nobody nears a mango tree when the fruit is unripe until it ripens, a lot of people would be under the mango tree trying to plug it.Fewer people care about bitcoin when the price is trying to stabilize, but once it triggers and hits a new ATH the world will start talking about bitcoin and lots of investors rushing to buy and hold. Meaning that the human brain is also waiting for more people to buy bitcoin before they can buy. \"Which could attract more people to take advantage of the increasing Value\"In a nutshell, Satoshi already studied the human system and the emotional intelligence of people and then moved on without being bothered if his invention would progress or not. And it worked as he said it, more people more value. He didn't see a bitcoin that would experience Negative feedback, that's why he stated positive feedback, it'll keep increasing without stabilizing; WHY I SAID PARTLY YES ABOUT SATOSHI BEING ONLY BULLISH. But, centralized bodies and other factors like war, pandemic, bans, etc now caused negative feedback to occur, and still, bitcoin is working hard to resist and stabilize the alterations. What an innovation!Share your ideas, What do you think about the keywords \"positive feedback\" Satoshi used to explain bitcoin.

However, it seem his goal of maintaining a decentralized atmosphere for the ecosystem failed despite cancelling the employment of a centralized database to trace double spending, yet the centralized bodies like exchanges who joined the ecosystem, have ruined the precious idea of Satoshi, now our documents are at the mercy of hackers, and transactions controlled by a central body; exchanges can decide to lock a customer's account or block a specific coin from being transferred from the exchange to another wallet. It's a nice read, but I didn't figure out how it's related to positive feedback loop, can you brief me?",

Quite true, the market can be manipulated with pump and dumb to attract investors, it still zeros down with the fact that investors are just concerned about a progressive market. Neglecting the negative feedback caused by real life events, which can be taken as a plus to profit from while waiting for the market to stabilize again. In 2021 I've not experienced before the high rate of people that got interested in Bitcoin just in few months that it held at 50-60k. A good example of what positive feedback does and how it helps the value if Bitcoin.

So, I guessed not sure, but from his level of actions and innovation you would notice that he is a man with not only high IQ but he has a good level of EQ. If he can understand how the people behave and created an e-currency that'll work in relation with the human attitude and how the body works, he must have done a good research on the human brain before embarking on his journey. Definitely, Bitcoin works in similar ways how feedback loops operates in the human body. It's my response.",

There is a number of factors involved that can be related to Bitcoin's price. This is where in my opinion you are right. With an increasing number of users does utility increase. With increasing utility, the number of potential use cases increases, which in turn attracts more users who increase utility and so on and so forth. I have observed that myself repeatedly. People sometimes asked me what they can do with Bitcoin. My answer used to be very short as you can imagine, but by now there is a number of things you can do with it and with the number of things constantly increasing, more and more people decided to hold at least a little bit of Bitcoin. Although this is not a use case anyone has been looking forward to, being able to pay for VPN services in Russia these days still is a use case of great importance. The same counts for other countries that are trying to shut down VPN services. The easiest way is to block traditional payment methods from facilitating transactions for those services. That's not possible with Bitcoin. There are several use cases where political control or oppression is involved. Especially when you live in areas with uncertain social, economic and political conditions, I think it makes a lot of sense to hold some Bitcoin. Doesn't even have to be a lot, but maybe enough to preserve some flexibility just in case.",

For example, if the general News says bearish but Satoshi pushes a contradictory sentiment with good reasons, then it may not go bearish. These few people are typically the heads. They have the greatest effect on the price movements.During satoshi days the humans who use Bitcoin were collectively in control, with him or few others(the most intelligent of them all) having greater control. They could determine where they want the price to go. Same is applicable today but the current head has so much power to move the price that nothing on earth can stop it.So, the positive feedback is basically what the head uses most of the times. If the subjects are reasonably complaining about lack of money/uptrend he makes the price to increase for them to take care of themselves.To be the head you have to understand Bitcoin really well or better than the rest",

      "body": "It would seem we are headed towards a good ending. I agree. Perhaps we have already crossed the main line to a good ending and are already there.We would still see many people holding the network together in exchange for transaction fee rewards. The question is: can the transaction rewards for Bitcoin fall so low that it would become unprofitable to continue and the entire system would grind to a halt? And can that happen to Bitcoin, realistically? I think no. As long as people have an incentive to transact their Bitcoin, we do not have to worry. The biggest incentive is total financial freedom. From the government, regulations and banks. Especially if you live in a dictatorial country, you can offer services in exchange for Bitcoin without revealing your identity (as long as you stay away from centralized platforms like banks or exchanges) and nobody can take your money away from you. This way, The government becomes forced to comply with the wishes of their people. Paying taxes becomes optional. It all becomes a question of: do you want your country to prosper? If you live in a good country, yes. But if you live in a dictatorship, you have the choice to stop funding the governments actions. You take the power away from the dictators by refusing taxation and regulation. The governments are forced to bow down to the wishes of the people, not the other way around. Total democratic, anonymous and financial freedom.Worst case scenario Bitcoin switches to PoS or something else, which is yet to be discovered. The good news is we have over 120 years left until we have to worry about that. More than enough time to plan for eventualities.",
