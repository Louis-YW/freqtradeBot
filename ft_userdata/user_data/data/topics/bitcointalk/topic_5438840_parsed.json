I also have Makachev winning his grappling is very good and he can take down Volkanowski anytime with his size and take-down ability Islam just needs to avoid engaging or trading punches Volks has power in both hands, Islam is a complete fighter in wrestling but I see Volks offering resistance in this fight I have seen him getting out on choke na that was a perfectly placed choke, even if you don't offer that $5 chargeback Islam is going to win based on their ability and past performances.",

The next fights I can predict are only:Jon jones vs. gane  - Jones will win.   due to better wrestling and mindset. (If negannu takes him down, Jon can also) And  Gane ko rate is only 45%.  It is not like negannu 87% that he can only punch him, and he goes down. Jon will likely last rounds with him, take him down, and win by decision.Usman vs. - Edwards. Usman is a considerable favorite. But I believe Edwards will win because Usman starts to talk about depression and shit that waken his mind as a man.In an interview with Joe Rogan. I need to see how he speaks soon. This kind of KO is traumatic; many fighters never recover from it.  It will depend on how he trains his mind for the fight more than how he traims in the gym.",

Addressing the ban evasion, When I registered today, I paid 10$ for the register account fee for bitcoin talk. bitcointalk got my IP.I got banned before. When I pay again, the ban is canceled. So I don't ban evasion here. I paid the fee to unlock access.The thread was opened for a good cause to add engagement here and give some money back to users.I am wealthy, and I can afford to pay back a couple of users every fight.Hopefully moderator will remove all your spam.",
