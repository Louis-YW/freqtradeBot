Although there are some who appreciate the way PeachBitcoin works, there are also those who are skeptical. For one, it is an issue to some that your app is closed-source. You must understand that trust is not easily earned especially if there are security concerns raised. Perhaps you might want to spare some time and drop by the thread discussing your platform and respond to the legitimate issues raised.",

After localbitcoins, paxful, and others, there is a big audience to grab.With a correct business plan and a smart communication strategy, I won't be surprised if PeachBitcoin becomes bigger than Bisq and hodlhodl together. And I'm serious, the company has the potential and if everything is planned correctly, it can only work.People working for the company must be motivated. I mean, it's always exciting to work for a company and take the challenge when you know it can workI installed the application to use it. Very rarely I install something because I hate mobile phone, but PeachBitcoin is interestingWhat surprised me is this tweet:...8000 app downloads, 5600 trades completed... Quite high for a begining, but at least it shows there is a demand",

Those are all European fiat currencies.

Bitcoin is a currency of everyone or no one, but that's your decision.It would be best if the service were available globally, but the EU is still a huge market with just under 500 million people and one of the richest areas in the world. In the future, there is always the possibility that the service will expand outside the EU. As for Russia, it is not only a matter of a personal decisions, but also the fact that most of their banks are on the blacklist, and anyone who would try to avoid these sanctions by offering this kind of service would only create additional problems for himself.Quote from: Pmalek on April 13, 2023, 05:55:32 PMI tried searching for it manually and couldn't find it on my PC.

Always a good thing to see more non-KYC and real peer to peer trading platforms popping up (not centralized exchanges advertising themselves as P2P). Hope you do well!A few questions if you don't mind:1 - Your privacy policy states that you collect the details of fiat payment methods, as well as receiving bitcoin addresses. How long do you store this data for?2 - Your privacy policy states you share email addresses with MailerLite for the purposes of marketing. Why can't users opt out of this?3 - Your FAQ says the following:Quote from: https://peachbitcoin.com/faq/trading/When making a sell offer, the seller sends the bitcoin to an address that is controlled by him and Peach: the bitcoin can only be moved from here, if he and Peach both sign off on it....If the trade doesn't resolve normally, this address automatically comes into full control of Peach after roughly 30 days (to be precise: when 4320 bitcoin blocks have been mined).I assume this is a 2-of-2 multi-sig. Is this correct? Can you share your additional script on top of the standard multi-sig script which allows you to spend these coins with a single private key after 4,320 blocks?",
