So if the country allows banking institutions to partner with sportsbooks then I don't see what is the problem here.If someone is not interested in using the feature then they won't but we can't do anything to stop them which is allowed in the name of law.But what is the point of this proposal, are you against the idea of betting via banking apps? or betting at all?",

Do you agree with this perspective?The above image is the UX for a mobile baking app in my country. What has advantage also has a disadvantage and I bank apps are not different, this is Opay mobile bank app and what I love about them is the lightening transaction you get, there is currently no any app like Opay that is as fast as them and there customer support has improved a while now, unlike then when you have to run after them for a failed transaction.The problem here is that betting companies are the ones that do partner with them, when you check the betting feature, you will found out that there are list of betting site they support which means they are like partnership to improve gaming and gambling. However, I think the company should know better that such UX could increase gambling addiction because they have lightening payment, very easy to deposit money into gambling platforms; there should be an option where it can be disabled or may be by default, it's shouldn't have appear there until the user wish to do so.Another thing I found insecure about this feature is that any person close to you that knows your password can make use of the betting deposit without you the owner realizing they do it until you check your balance. People can even beg you to help them fund their betting site if they know that you use the app.",

I understand that this feature could trigger new people to start gambling but there's no way to stop these banks from doing the changes they want within their app.",

Do you agree with this perspective?The above image is the UX for a mobile baking app in my country. I for one think that any betting or gambling features on our mobile banking apps also qualify as a financial service or business service offered by the banking app owners. Money is involved after all, some even allow using crypto to gamble or bet, so why should it really matter the presence of a gambling feature on the banking app?Everyone has the reasons why they use the banking apps and if for some it's to transact, pay for services or goods, apply for easy short loans, for others, it might just be that the gambling feature suits their preference and is easier to use than a regular gambling or betting app. Gambling is a personal choice and such a feature if ignored, poses no threat or harm to the user of the app.",

Do you agree with this perspective?I can understand your point. Financial apps today, has  made it real easy to fund your betting accounts as well as paying for other services. There are also gamblers who gamble responsibly who find it easy and quite useful too to fund their accounts from their banking apps.Banks are getting smarter and of course for a small negligible fee, are  trying to provide services so account holders can easily pay different bills and fund various services without having to leave your comfort zone. You won't take away a service cause some people have overtime become irresponsible with their habits.",

As a gambler, I find it more convenient since I don’t need to convert my fiat to crypto just to play but this is dangerous for normal user that doesn’t gamble frequently and only become curious after seeing the bet option within the app. I wonder why the regulators allow this while this clearly endangers their customers on losing their assets despite there’s a disclaimer on the casino. I agree that this feature should be remove for general welfare.",

It is very clear that feature is meant for funding your accounts but i got a message about placing a bet on one of these banks, either opay or palmpay I can’t recall the exact one but i was shocked when i received the message and immediately i disregard it, why would a bank want it’s customers to gamble the money they saved with them?

My submission is that betting features on any banking or financial apps should be removed to discourage compulsive gambling and irresponsible gambling. Do you agree with this perspective?. I agree to this OP because i know how tempting gambling can be and whenever you have money in your account even when you have plans for the money you maybe tempted to place a bet and in the end you risk losing the money you had plans for. This feature is very dangerous and will affect alot of customers so i also think it is inappropriate to make such features available on any banking and financial app. Financial institutions should rather encourage and motivate their customers on how they can save money rather than making such features available. I am really disappointed and i don't think i will ever make use of this feature, i rather make use of a real gambling casino.",

If there are banks that offer people easy access to gambling through their banking apps I'd say it's taking things a bit too far, but then there's a problem of local laws. It's possible in some Asian countries this is completely acceptable and in accordance with the law, in which case we can't do anything but maybe stop using the bank and boycott its services.",
