I found such mass-payments option in Electrum wallet but this wallet supports only Bitcoin payments, while I need a wallet supporting USDT TRC-20.As far as I know, no crypto wallet app supports this for the Tron network. My advice, you better ask the 50 recipients for another network address, you can ask them to use BSC or Polygon to make it cheaper.Once you get their wallet address, you can just install Coin98 Wallet, their app supports bulk sending from 1 wallet to another. For complete information, you can read the following article: https://coin98insights.com/coin98wallet-multisend",

I know about cointool app but i don't know whether this is supporting tron USDT or not. You can check it by yourself.",

You are requesting another payment address that will have a much lower transaction fee. In addition, for USDT (TRC-20) 50 addresses delivery is not too long. It depends on the wallet you use.",

I've done some transactions before for USDT(TRC20) and it didn't cost me $1. That's not really a costly transaction and it is one of the cheapest networks to transfer USDT. If calculating the usual transaction that's being done, it's going to be about $0.5 well, that's a 50% discount from what you've said. But I don't know if sending the whole transaction in batches just like what OP is asking if that's going to him more. @OP I haven't tronsender but it's the one that showed when I've looked for some answers and suggestions.",

To reduce the fee, you can block TRON coins and get energy and bandwidth to have cheap transactions in the ecosystem.____I have not seen such wallets, you may have to use the services of a programmer so that you can enter 50 addresses and amounts and the software automates this task.",
