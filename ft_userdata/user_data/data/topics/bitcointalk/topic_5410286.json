Posting it in here with bullet points should at least be sufficient enough and making it self-moderated would make the thread clean and in order and away from spams.I had done some similar study before though I did not conduct any survey here. It was somehow...partially successful dissertation at least. Wishing luck to OP's study!",

The power of mixed method research is that you will be able to explore all the sides of your research question(s), there by giving you the ability to uncover and explore the different opinions of your sample population. By the way we're hoping to know what the result outcome and conclusion of the study will be. Goodluck.",

Buying BTC can be hardly called gambling on a certain asset now. Maybe on some tokens that pops up on a bullrun or those riding the popularity of bitcoin.You'll most likely get the number 3 to 5 filled for this question since there are many members here who play at crypto casinos hehe.",

Although i appreciate the study/output you're trying to achieve, but i can see the case here is not everyone use google especially when there is an email/data submission for privacy purposes. It would be better if OP make an alternative survey link that doesnt required any info like email (if there is). Edit: seems it doesn't required any email submitting the form. Anyway, i hope you get more respond on this forum to fill your survey.",

That's very good, and indeed the relationship is still very close and in accordance with the dissertation you made, but it seems that in your question number 30 it is not very relevant to the research you are doing because we also have to be able to distinguish between Investment, Trading and Gambling.When your focus is on bitcoin which comes from investing and trading, then indeed this cannot be related to gambling because it is clearly something different.",

Originally didn't notice but my dumbass at the last question missed the choice I picked and auto-moved to the next button which finished the survey. There's also the fact that I seem to be able to fill it up again, which afaik should be possible to be disabled. Might've needed google sign in but from what I know, as long as the email isn't a question itself then it wouldn't save the email as part of the response. I think the form itself checks whether you've answered the form and has its own storage of users who answered (Do correct me if I'm wrong).",

If they didn't heard it yet, they will get curious and maybe they will research about it. This can be an indirect way of advertising or spreading the word bitcoin which I like.Why it's unfair when someone don't use bitcoin on their dissertation? I think they are only scared if what will their teachers think about it especially if they live in a country where bitcoin is not legalized. It's not big deal though in my opinion if they will use btc or not. Btc adoption can still grow in other ways if that is what you want.",

The first thought of my professor was that we were going to use cryptocurrency to gamble and that would be one of our scopes and limitation of our study, but I kindly said no to him, lol. It was still approved at the end of the day, but the process of doing the study itself was hell since there were not a lot of samples to gather around my area at that time and usually we only resorted to online surveys.Since OP is already conducting a survey, I am pretty sure that his/her/their title was already approved otherwise no such thread would be made at all.",
