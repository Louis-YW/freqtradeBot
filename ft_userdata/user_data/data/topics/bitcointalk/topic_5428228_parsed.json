  "content": "After United States, now Canada. No magin, perpetual or future trading again on exchanges in Canada as Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the council of Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators, on Dec. 13 issued an update to crypto trading platforms operating in the country.https://cointelegraph.com/news/canada-bans-crypto-leverage-and-margin-trading-after-ftx-collapseQuoteAccording to the statement, all crypto trading firms operating in Canada — both local and foreign ones — have to comply with newly expanded terms, which ban them from offering margin or leverage trading services to any Canadian clients.https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/csa-provides-update-to-crypto-trading-platforms-operating-in-canadaQuoteEven with the adoption of these measures, crypto assets or financial products relating to crypto assets are high-risk investments. These risks could result from, among other things, crypto trading platform non-compliance with registration terms and conditions or undertakings, interconnectedness within the crypto sector, insolvency, hacks, price volatility and uncertain value propositions for individual assets. Canadian investors are urged to exercise caution and consider seeking advice from a registered investment advisor before investing in crypto; if they choose to pursue such an investment, despite all known risks, they should use a platform that is registered with CSA members. It is because they want to protect Canadian investors, we all understand that, but if I am a Canadian, I will not like that after gaining experience from leverage trading over years now. But leverage trading is truly riskier.I hope this would not go beyond the exchanges in Canada while Canadians should still be able to access other exchanges that offers leverage trading. Hope Canada is not like US that traders can not use foreign exchanges?",

But leverage trading is truly riskier.I don't think any Government or authority would really care about protecting funds of their Citizens. It's always just about trying to gain control. Most Governments see cryptocurrencies and rogue unregulated exchanges as a threat to their power when more people start using them. Unfortunately, very many scammers lurk in the same waters too and with the very sad events of scams and hacks, the Government finds an excuse of banning cryptos or the crypto exchanges and their services.Quote from: Oshosondy on December 13, 2022, 03:25:35 PMHope Canada is not like US that traders can not use foreign exchanges? They already have a list of banned exchanges, though not yet so big. It's Kucoin and Poloniex, so I believe such exchanges would reject Canadian KYC verified customers to use their platforms.",

In my mind, \"Want to protect the investor\" means no longer wishing to protect the investor from the risk of leveraged trading.  The impact of FTX seems to be giving them a headache receiving lots of user complaints demanding protection.",

No interest paid with derivative trading, but the liquidation price become closer to the entry price. You can still go with 2x leverage and think with right mindset, unlike someone that borrowed money from bank that will be having bad mindset because he is thinking of a way to return the money borrowed which might lead to a significant loss and that is a problem for him.People will not think to borrow from bank to trade if compared to how people are using derivative trading today. People use derivative trading, their money can get liquidated, but no issue of payimg anything back, unlike bank.",
