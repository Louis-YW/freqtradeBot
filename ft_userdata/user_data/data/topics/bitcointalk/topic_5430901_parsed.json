  "content": "Hey everyone.I little bit curious about the alternative AML/KYC on Level 3/4:- Proof of address- Proof of source fundSome of the exchanges could be asked this in your situation, but the main problem some of us could be don't have any of this document for some reason. Like we don't have proof-of-address because we still living with our parents & we don't have proof of source funds due we are fully freelance.If we get into this situation, is gonna be a problem for someone who doesn't have this document. Do someone facing this problem, and get some alternative from the service you're requested? otherwise we might be death (because cannot access the fund).",

As freelancers should pay taxes too so they need to have a sheet where they put their yearly income, so you should have something.Also at least where i live i can get a proof of address from government from the place that has all the addresses of the citizens so they can send official papers to them. In here it's called digital and population data services agency.But in here you have to ask for it and it costs something like $10 to get it in print with a official stamp.",

I know you are an Indonesian, just like me, and to solve problems related to KYC Level 3, I usually use a bank statement as my PoA. It really works well. To get it, you can go to the place where you made your bank account and then ask them to print a bank statement for your account. BTW, i think a topic like this should be on Beginners & Help.",

An example that may be use for proof of address is a postpaid plan for your personal phone.Quote from: ryzaadit on December 21, 2022, 10:22:44 PM....We have a minimum yearly-income to be paid taxed.If your earning are not passed the minimum yearly-income, then you're not really to pay tax.Are you not mandated to file a tax return even if your yearly income is at minimum or below it? You just need to indicate your tax payable is zero. I think any citizen of legal age is still allowed to submit so you may start with that.",

I think any citizen of legal age is still allowed to submit so you may start with that.We can choose option not to filled anything, If you already register a tax card and your total income yearly is bellow the minimum feel free to skip. People who are working, already getting cutted taxed by their company as well.",

For proof of address i was submitted my bank statement with last 3 months transaction history, if you will ask in bank they will provide it. Utility bill can be another way for proof of address. I donâ€™t know about proof of source of fund.",
