If they are not corrected, this forum may lack the quality posts it supposed to have. Newbies should accept how this forum is and learn in the process. Without the politeness that you called harshness, some newbies may not become better. As long as the quality of posts are there, this forum is good how it is.

So just like i have read other members say, one needs to grow a very thick skin here but if you continue to get upset by the way some members communicate then it would be best to actually ignore them, that is if you also are not repeating a mistake all round that got everyone pissed like creating multiple threads without any proper information or any thing substantial and help in them",

You cannot expect cordial communication from strangers on the internet, so it is better to try not to be affected by them.Many of the users here in my observation keep communication civil except for a few trolls. Blunt communication is not harsh or abusive.Quote from: Macoach on September 21, 2023, 06:23:46 PMIt's true that some posts from newcomers may be of low quality or show a lack of willingness to learn initially.

Or that questions is asked from alt account of someone who is in signature campaign. Such kind of topics is great place for signature spammers to reach their post quota easier with some generic answer.And advice for newbies and everyone in general.

Because just as a wise man once said that \"What Doesn't Break You, Make You\", when people criticize your post as a newbie, it's advisable to analyze why a member said what they said about your post, and not take it personal, but rather work on yourself, get conversant with the forum & it's rules, and try to always be on the safer side, why you do more reading than posting, since you are just a newbie and you have a whole lot to learn.",

There were new users or beginners account whom seems to be faking as newbie and yet trying to farm merits. Well its hard to tell actually nowadays but they knew somehow. I dont act rude or harsh when it comes to newbie or fake newbies. But if the topics is really an old one or been used or asked many times.

I am also a newbie but many like me really want to post and not read or learn. We all need merit to grow but some informations that have been posted long before now are still enquired by newbies and that makes some senior colleagues feel that we newbies are lazy to read. I advise we ignore the tune, take the corrections, read, learn, gather more information on the new things learnt from other internet materials. I must confess that this platform is very educative.",

In general, many users have found a lot of information on their own, without having to constantly ask. Or at least... they used the search function at their beginning! Be able to verify an information by yourself and finding original source is also part of \"the right approach\"",

Feel free to relate with others to tap more from their knowledge but sometimes too newbies cam be this funny though. They just do things not contrary to the rules and when they are scolded, they start crying foul pointing at their hands at their seniors of being way too hard and harsh on them.OP I was thinking you were talking or complaining out of your own personal experience not until I read through and it looks like you are just trying to see members response to clear your doubt.

We can't demand someone to give criticism in the way we like, right!?In my opinion, we as beginners should be able to adapt to this forum because in fact the more senior members still care about our development and progress as beginners here by giving us criticism so that we can change our mistakes.In all my time on this forum I have never encountered a criticism that was too harsh or extreme. All the criticism I encounter on this forum is still reasonable in my opinion.",
