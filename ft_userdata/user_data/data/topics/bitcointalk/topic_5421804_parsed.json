Yes, social media brand equity is something that any serious startup must take into consideration before purchasing a domain name. The value of matching social media handles can ever be overemphasized. That's why fortune 500 companies invest millions to acquire their matching handles. This domain gives the would be owner the advantage of kickstarting on a solid foundation with strong brand recognition.",

Do you mean we should update you whenever a domain name in our list is sold? Well, if that's what you're saying, I'm happy to let you know that Betves.com has Been sold and is now an established gambling company in Turkey.Almost 70% of the domain names in that list has either been sold to end-users or to other domain investors.  Betflexi.com has had number of inquiries and would have been sold long time ago if not that we insisted on using it.Now that we have decided to put it back in the market, I don't think it will be long before a smart entrepreneur comes for it. This is one of the best gambling name in the market and we're not asking for much money for it. So, expect it to sell soon.Another thing you need to understand is that domain name is not daily commodities that that sells every days. Sometimes it takes several years before the right buyers comes for it. While some times it take just few days or hours.Thank for your kind comment.",

It may be short but there are other more shorter names than this. A few that I can think of are BC.game and stake.com.  I don't remember saying that there are no shorter ones, and behinds, the BC.game and Stake.com you mentioned, are those domains up for sale as Betflexi.com?The comparison you did here makes no sense to me (am sorry for being blunt), if you must compare, then it would have made more sense if you looked for other domains in this category that are currently up for sale, this would have been a fair comparison. Quote they will need to follow it because many are going to think of that and it will be contradicting if the site doesn't allow small deposits or small bets.  I agree with you on this, but I believe this shouldn't be a problem because if I was the buyer, I wouldn't see this as a problem since gamblers naturally avoid casinos with high deposit and withdrawer limit, as well as high minimum gambling amount, and it doesn't matter what the name of the Casino is. BetHigh.com (for example) will still have to have a low deposit and withdrawer limit, as well as low minimum amount per bet, to keep their customers as well as attract more customers. Quote Marketing would still be needed because how can a gambler know that this casino exists if they will not market it properly?  Again, I never said marketing was not needed at all, I said the owner would not have to market so hard before they win some customers, and this is because the name \"Betflexi\", on its own already have this Ora of appeal in it, seeing the name immediately creates this appeal in you to want to try out the casino (this is my personal opinion and what I feel, I don't know how other people feel or think about it) Quote Also, I think there's nothing wrong to know if how much this cost even if you don't have intentions of buying it. You can try to pm the op or just click on the Betflexi.com link. There is a \"request price\" button that you can find there.I agree with you but this is only from the buyers perspective, the seller wouldn't see it that way.If I was the seller, my question would be \"why want to know the price of something you don't have any intention or interest in buying, and also don't have in intention of bringing a buyer?\" I don't have any intention of buying this nor even bringing a  buyer, what then is the essence of wasting my time, as well as the seller's time wanting to know the price?.",

The same one.This price and domain name can indeed have their own attraction where people can easily remember the domain name. So it will depend on the casino investor whether they will choose a premium domain or a new domain because before they create a casino, they must have researched, including choosing the domain name.",
