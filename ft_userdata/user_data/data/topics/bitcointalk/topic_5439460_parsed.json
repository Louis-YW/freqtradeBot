But he's not a DT member, so his feedback won't shown in trusted feedback. Giving positive feedback is need to be done for trading high amount or multiple trades, not only for one small trade.",

No one is going to trust a brand new account here amd neither they should.Quote from: jumbotrades on February 21, 2023, 02:12:29 PMno one can believe untill they trade better small Why should ppl risk anything to believe in you ? While they can trade risk-free on zero-trading fee exchanges like binance (and here you are taking 12-20% just as fees to trade with you).Quote from: jumbotrades on February 21, 2023, 02:12:29 PMi am since cryptsy and mtgox btce a lot may not even know them You maybe old in the crypto space as you speak (which I doubt lol) but you are very new to the forum with no contributions whatsoever. There is no point to believe in your words.Quote from: jumbotrades on February 21, 2023, 02:12:29 PMi just earn a small rate i know once someone trust they will come by Okay, while I know there would be little to none interested to deal with you with such high rates, I'd still suggest you to catch a reputable escrow who can hold the funds on your behalf while an innocent guy tries to deal with you.",

I hope you guys do this with all sincerity coz a lot of newbies are in the space who might not know their left from right. I really wish this avenue for crypto exchange should be redifined maybe into a registered website or app under any financial regulation to be sure people are safe. Money transactions requires great trust from the providers to be sure their funds are safe even with Escrow.",
