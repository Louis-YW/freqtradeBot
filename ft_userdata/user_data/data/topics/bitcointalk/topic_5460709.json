  "content": "This is a question for the sligthly more tech-savy Bitcoiners out here.I recently accessed an old wallet called mSIGNA. It was recommended about 7 years ago and I used it for a while. Now I want to access the remaining funds. This would only work if either I can connect to a node with this outddated wallet - Couldn't get it to work so far.Or by exporting and re-importing the keys to another wallet.The good news: I can access the public key list that was in use. And found an amount of slightly above 0.01 BTC that I want to transfer.I still have the password.The wallet allows to export the following (private) information:1. Seed word list. It's a 24 word list.2. BIP32 extended key3. Private key file (file ending in .priv) -> no idea what that is and if it can be imported in other walletsNow, I have tried to import 1) and 2) via electrum wallet.Here are the options I tried without success so far (wallet not showing any transactions in the tx history). Note, I am connected to a node and other wallets update correctly, so it's not a connection problem.- KEYRESTORE  a) I already have a seed - here the import is only possible by switching to BIP39 seed      I tried all 3 available address formats (legacy, p2sh-segwit and native segwit) without success. Also Detect Existing Accounts doesn't find anything. I left the suggested derivation path unchanged - maybe with the right path settings this could be solved?  b) Use a master key - If I choose this option, Electrum accepts the BIP32 extended key exported from mSIGNA. However again, there are no transactions recognized.- IMPORT BITCOIN ADDRESSES OR PRIVATE KEY - you can only import regular private keys, and I cannot export/access there from the mSIGNA wallet. - I played a little with this tool: https://bip32.tools/?lang=en But couldn't get it to create a list of private keys for me.If anyone can either help me to import my mSIGNA keys into another wallet so I can access any remaining funds or get mSIGNA to work again (meaning make it connect to a node so I can just send my funds) it would be much appreciated.Thanks in advance!Made this self-moderated to avoid spam and farm comments. Anything off-topic or doing nothing else than suggesting something already explained in my post will be deleted.Possibly helpful resources (edited)- mSIGNA github: https://github.com/ciphrex/mSIGNA- archive of old website: https://web.archive.org/web/20150316215945/https://ciphrex.com/Quote from: Kryptowerk on July 23, 2023, 11:28:38 AMI'm giving away 0.001 BTC for whoever helps the most to recover these funds. Will add info in OP. I reserve the right to decide at my own discretion who will get the funds - if more people are involved in finding a solution I might split it up.final edit: a solutionThe \"easiest\" way to access my unspent outputs /  a solution was provided here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460709.msg62604661#msg62604661Case solved / funds returned.However we still don't know the correct derivation path of mSIGNA and how to import the seed phrase or master private key into another wallet in way that lets you access your funds. (bonus quest for anyone interested, no bounty for solving it, though)",

Play with it until you find the right derivation path.Seems like the same or similar tool like the one I linked to in my post.The problem is, I can play with some of the settings but the \"Derived Addresses\" list on the bottom of the page doesn't come up with a match to one of the public addresses I can see in the mSIGNA wallet. My guess is BIP49 (or maybe BIP141) would be the right option, as they are the only ones producing addresses starting with 3. But playing a little with the derivation pathes (I tried 1-5/1-5) doesn't bring up a match.Something to note: The BIP32 Extended Key does never match the one from mSIGNA no matter which of the BIP options I choose, also altering some of the derivation pathes.Quote from: Knight HiderSegwit did not exist 7 years ago.--Knight HiderSegwit was implemented 2017 if I recall correctly, so the wallet must be around 6 years old as one set of addresses starts with 3 (first version of segwit addresses).Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 22, 2023, 06:29:58 PMI've found an archived version of their old website here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150316215945/https://ciphrex.com/It says there, however, that it was a multi-sig wallet.I've also found their old GitHub here: https://github.com/ciphrex/mSIGNALooking through the issues on that GitHub, people are talking about .vault files.

Multisig apparantly was optional.My guess it's only about finding the right derivation path. Wonder if there is any tool to determine which is used by mSIGNA here. Thanks for digging up that old pdf - no info on their derivation path used, though.Seems the derivation path issue was already around in 2017: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2144498.msg21524209#msg21524209Probable solutions to my problem- get mSIGMA to connect to a node (I don't have a full node)- find the proper derivation path used by the wallet & import to another wallet",

Yes, good point! I am 99.9% certain it's not a multi-sig. First of I would have remembered and written down some info about it on my seed-paper.But most importantly, I tried re-importing via the wordlist into mSIGNA and it worked flawlessly - they display a hash for each \"keychain\" (actually the HD wallet) and it is the same for the imported wallet via SEED compared to my original wallet.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 23, 2023, 05:32:12 AMQuote from: Kryptowerk on July 22, 2023, 09:09:13 PMMy guess it's only about finding the right derivation path.Having read through the .pdf again, I'm not so sure:QuoteNOTE: mSIGNA™ always uses pay-­‐to-­‐script-­‐hash addresses, which begin with the character 3 in Bitcoin, even for 1 of 1 accounts.There is no mention that they use nested segwit addresses, which is the type of address every other wallet will try to recover when given a seed phrase and a P2SH address type.

Getting close to sloving it, but seems the derivation path of mSIGNA isn't easy to find out.If anyone has any insight on the correct derivation path for mSIGNA or is tech-savy enough to find it in the code on github, please let us know!https://github.com/ciphrex/mSIGNAHowever, big update! I was able to retrieve around half of the funds. - mSIGNA allows to export transactions as raw data.- mSIGNA allows coin control.- So I just selected the public address I knew still hand coins on it, found an oldschool 1xxxx address in an older electrum wallet to send the funds to and created the signed transaction with mSIGNA and then exported it.- imported the transaction in electrum wallet via tools -> import transaction -> from text -> broadcast.- BAMMM it worked!However, because my mSIGNA wallet is not fully synced I could only retrieve the funds up to the amount the current balance of this unsynced wallet showed. Which is only around half of the total funds. Still a nice recovery.There are two more addresses with around 0.0015 BTC each that I cannot access this way because their balance in the wallet is too high. - If I want to create a tx inside the wallet it works and I can export it (even using the amount I know is on it because I can check via a current explorer).HOWEVER after importing to electrum (which also works) the transaction will be denied by the node, because the transactions includes an amount that exceeds the actual accessible funds. Why? Because the transactions also includes a change address that will receive the \"remaining\" funds - because mSIGNA is synced at a state that has too many funds than actually available on that address.Still, a nice tiny success.

This should (hopefully) be the easiest option going forward then. What I would do is the following:Get a list of all the addresses which still have funds on themCreate a new Electrum wallet, select \"Import bitcoin addresses or private keys\", and insert all your addressesIn that Electrum wallet, create a transaction sending all those coins to a regular address you controlAt the bottom left of the transaction window, select \"Export\" (you might have to select \"Finalize\" first), and export to clipboardImport it from the clipboard in to mSIGMA and (hopefully!) sign itExport it from mSIGMA, import it back in to Electrum, and broadcast itI feel like that was VERY close. Did all the steps on the electrum side - works well.When trying to import the transaction with mSIGNA I get the following error and immediately aborting \"invalid signature\" - if I just select \"import transactions\". When trying to import using \"import transaction (raw)\" I get \"Push operation exceeds data size\".",

Are you trying to consolidate a lot of inputs at once? Perhaps split your transaction in to two and try again with fewer inputs?",

Are you trying to consolidate a lot of inputs at once? Perhaps split your transaction in to two and try again with fewer inputs?Unfortunatelly not. I tried first with the 3 inputs I have and then just a solo input. Both didn't work.I noticed there might be trouble stemming from using a bech32 address as the receiver address and tried with a 1xxx legacy one instead, same results - mSIGNA shows an error upon import.",
