Bitcointalk Username: fiulpro Wintomato Username: fiulpro Test the gameWrite a small review here(edit your application post for this)*Pending* Here is my review: 1. The site worked fine, the device used was an android but there were slight issues since due to the chat option being on the bottom left some buttons were inaccessible. For example :  2. The server kept on disconnecting in mines which is one of my favourite games ! Which I do understand can be due to my network connection but all other games were working fine as well therefore i had no problem in other ones. 3. The best part was seeing some interesting games which honestly I have not seen on many platforms but I was playing demo mode in this : 4. Please do understand that am a very anxious better so for me the best game is _DICE_ and for that I usually look for few options like : 1. Ability to change it manually, losses and ranges 2. Minimum bet amount usually being fair Therefore this is my personal favourite game anywhere I played there, there was no problem at all, I love the chimes that comes when you win, I did loose ofc but only 3 times, I also wagered with the full amount provided, which turned out to be a blessing as well and I managed to get out safe ! Was able to bet 37× was supposed to do it 22× but it was quite addictive The game's seed was there as well at the bottom which helped me tremendously since for me it's good that there is an easy way to change it in a click. Finally the long awaited *withdrawal* On entering the address it popped out ' invalid address ' when I entered the right doge address but I clicked to see if that would work/not work, which I don't know if the money is lost forever but I would update regarding that. Best things was : Extra security available on withdrawalFee was amazing only 5 DOGE, kudos for that Loved the logo, site was engaging especially the tomato man on the left top side. Deposit bonuses available with the free spins as well but minimum amount to deposit is 20$ and minimum withdrawal is 15$ so I think that's also an amazing chance to get loads of free spins with it. P.s. I think the wager was 20 bets made, was it not ?? If not am willing to deposit 10$ again but ofc in btc and continue the betting till I reach 20*10? But I think it was 20 times, but seeing the people commenting a bit in a dilemma PS2 Update : Yes you do need to have at least 200$ to have a valid withdrawal request, was not sure talked with the manager and he was helpful regarding the cancellation of the invalid withdrawal thus let's see if I can try and win 200$ ! Update : was able to reach *2 that's all, put it all in on dice 🎲 with lowest possible risk but lost it all. Also changed the seed, randomized it before I put all of it on the bet !",

Rain was also fun to see. Then the jackpot questions with high rewards, hoping to reach level 2 so I can join.Cons:Whenever I want to check my profile just to see how much experience was being given, the game window will also close and the auto function will stop. Is there a way that whenever we just check our profile it will just replace whatever is open in the sidebar? So that the game will keep on even if you are checking your stats.It seems like it's also having problems when you switch to a new tab or a new window while in auto mode. There's also a time I was disconnected because I was not checking back on the wintomato window.I will add more if I see other details.",

You get some money credited and you can freely lose it without any regrets. How is that bad? Treat it like a lottery ticket with a 1/100 chance to win. You probably won't win anything, but you can't lose either. I'll try it out. Bitcointalk Username: darkangel11Wintomato Username: darkangel11The things that I've noticed while browsing: In the FAQ it states: QuoteWhat languages is WinTomato available in?Currently, the site is available in three distinctive languages which are English, Russian and Georgian, One can easily change it by clicking on the national flag of the language which can be found on the site’s top right corner at all times.Yet, in the language change there are only English and Russian options. So, I guess Georgian was planned but not added yet?  There's a casino forum and you can find a link to it on the site. I've found a month old thread there with an issue that hasn't been answered by anyone.https://coinfolk.net/topic/541/1st-2nd-3rd-deposit-bonus-issueI like the site for now. It's simple and works well. For now I've spent some time playing crash, plinko and slots. While crash and plinko worked fine for me with about 50% W/L ratio, slots rolled 8 losses in a row for me which basically ended my free bonus in less than a minute  I got some free money from rain. Not much, something like 1 USD worth of coins, but that's always a free roll or two. One thing I don't understand. Why the minimum withdrawal is 15$ with coins that cost less than 1 USD in fees to send across the blockchain? It doesn't make sense to allow people to deposit $10 worth of coins, but not to allow them to withdraw it unless they win another $5.",

It also has some E-Sport betting it lacks some games that I usually bet on, like Valorant and Apex Legend. So, I hope more E-Sport will be added. For Casino and Games part, like I said that I only do sports-betting so I don't understand most of the games, I don't know how to play most of them. And Unfortunately Wintomato doesn't have 'how-to-play' section for any of their game, it make me hesitant to play most of their game, so I only play Dice and Crash the only thing that I know. I know that most of people who Gamble should already know how to play most of the Casino Games, but I think adding a brief and short 'how-to-play' section for some games is not much work to do. Other than that, the overall UI/UX, page-transition, and connection seems great and I never experience any lag. And I think some people already mention that you need to be at least Level 2 to join chatroom, and to level-up you need to collect point by either Wagering, Betting, or Joining Contest, but after I wager for several time, I don't get any point from it, so maybe something's wrong. I can't make any review about the withdrawal, since I lost all the money they gave me, lol",

In other cases the maximum withdrawal amount per month is € 10,000.-To use chat we need to be lvl 2 but can't find information about how to level up.-The roll-over for the promos is x30.In general i don't feel like this is the right site to win big, because we will be not able to withdraw all if we hit a big multiplier with a big amount. And this will become a problem in the future. Is about time to see a user complaining about a big win that can't be cashed out.But in general, you have a nice casino there, i wish you great luck.",

Was deposited with 70 Doge worth $5 and after series of looses and winnings I increased my balance to 78 dog coins in my balance to continue playing and the experience was good like other platforms I have equally used.Deposit/withdrawal:They have various means of withdrawal process Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, Doge, Xrp  etc and bank withdrawal as well.Lastly I love the fact that they equally have the option where you can exchange one crypto to the other.Negative Experience. However they still got a little problem need to be worked on.1. Withdrawal limit should be reduced maybe somewhere between $5 -$10 2.Need to work on the stability of the site was playing my games and they went on mentainace, though I understand that is a new platform and they're still putting things together and could be as result of high influx of new customers registration and I don't know if they gave prior notice to that, but within few minutes the service was immediately restored and I continued playing my games.",
