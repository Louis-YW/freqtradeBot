But the news that is exciting the cryptocurrency market now is primary Bitcoin news, that's why it's important to note that Bitcoin can't be underperformed in this situation. Some altcoins used the opportnty to move multiple times as well, and who knows what will happen later next year? Patience is needed.Nonetheless, despite that many altcoins use this opportunity of Bitcoin's excitement to rise, there is still a season called \"altcoins season,\" where dangerous and unexpected bullish movements would happen. I believe we should hold on for that time before concluding on what will actually happen.However, I will continue to hold my BTC and ETH in my wallet but I do not have any strong belief in LTC if I must tell you my mind.",

Litecoin has passed it's prime and now just looks like dead coin to be honest we may see some occasional movementum in the coin due to bullish market but apart from that we shouldn't have high hopes with LTC as there are better alternatives to go with. The price of BTC and ETH usually rise together during bullrun and if BTC falls then funds starts to shift towards ETH which gives it further pump but a short lived one hence I would say whatever you have mentioned stands for BTC and ETH but not for LTC.",

The opportunity didn't doesn't have to come to everyone all at ones, some others might not be moved to invest immediately it got to them because they didn't had indepth knowledge about it and to play safe they had to spend time doing research about it. Whether you invested early or late in my opinion that's not really important, what is important is that eventually you have invested now and should be set to accumulate and hodl for long. It's surprising to note that not all that bought bitcoin 10years ago still hodl till date, some even sold even before the last ATH in 2021, so for me it's not about when you bought it's rather about how long.Quote from: philipma1957 on December 05, 2023, 04:30:20 AMOr does he just mean the BTC ½ ing will alter the other two? Am guessing that's what he meant and more. Therefore we should continue stacking particularly for those that think they've arrived late, however I don't see any significance tops Litecoin hodlers are going to make in the coming bullrun as the price movement lately hasn't been encouraging, but am positive Ethereum will be altered significantly by the bitcoin bullrun  next year.Many altcoin investors will be disappointed come next year when the bitcoin bullrun takes place as most altcoins would have little or no alteration at all, they would rather dump.",

No, this could still be another opportunity left to venture into the market, rembering not to leave in regret, it will be good to hasten up and accumulate now as the price is volatile and we expect a little uptrend before the year runs out.After the Bitcoin Halving definitely the price will increase same with Altcoins as per the uptrend movement in Bitcoin favors the Altcoin.
