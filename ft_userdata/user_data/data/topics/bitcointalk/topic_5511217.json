You don't need to invest that money, the fact that it's already in bitcoin you already have an investment that could grow as crazy. 10 years ago Bitcoin was at $400 when i started using it, and now is at $63000, so, we are talking about something bigger than x100 but the hard part is to hold for a long period of time, if you can do that, then you will find success in your investment.If you only want to invest for a couple of years, then i would recommend moving to another altcoin with a nice future, that way your investment would grow faster.",

Except he want to \"gamble\" by buy Bitcoin with leverage.Since he expect to earn 10x, he should expect their capital go down 10x too.",

It is not matter of your investment capital is big or small because with high trading volume of Bitcoin market, your $13-14M can be absorbed by the market easily.But to grow it up to 10 times, it is hard and I am sure you won't achieve it in near future. 10 times from now is $650,000 and you can imagine it is a very crazy price for Bitcoin. Assume Bitcoin price will double each cycle, as now it is unrealistic to think its price will increase 20 times for each cycle, and with an assumption that its all time high in this cycle is $100,000. You can make a math, to achieve $650,000 price target, it will need 3 more market cycles, that will be 2028, 2032 and 2036.However I believe Bitcoin will need long time than next 12 years, to reach to $650,000 and its market cap will be about gold marketcap.

The size depends on the capital allocated to Bitcoin investment. The average return obtained from large capital is certainly not small.Don't just give an example in the US, but globally the thing that is meant is nothing is impossible including your question on how it is used.Like the complaints of people who have let go of Bitcoin when the price is below 60,000 USD. If they had not let go at that price, they would have gotten a bigger multiple now than the amount they have.",

If you are investing in BTC or any other asset, it is important that you don't set unrealistic targets for yourself, this can push you to take crazy risks and lose your money, 10x in a couple of years is kind of unrealistic, you should lower your expectation.If you are have that money, you should diversify into other assets or investments, gold, business, etc, it is not a good idea to go into one investment with all your money. It is safer to do things that way, but like i said, expect realistic returns and keep your assets very safely.",

If it's about possibility, there is a possibility that it can.Quote from: robertcarlyle on September 30, 2024, 03:50:18 AMHow could this much bitcoin be put to work?  You're aiming for a 10x all for a few years. No one will ever know the answer for this question. We don't know even know many x that bitcoin is going to perform for this bull run. But if in estimations, 2-4 more cycles that you have to complete. Bitcoin is more stable now and lesser volatile compared in the past.Quote from: robertcarlyle on September 30, 2024, 03:50:18 AMWhat kind of investsments will allow this? Bitcoin.

Plus anyone with 13-14 million dollars should be more than capable of investing that amount and we on the internet do not enough information to give proper financial advice, but what I'll say is you need to set realistic standards when investing an amount of money and also give a realistic timeframe for which to get the ROI.Quote from: robertcarlyle on September 30, 2024, 03:50:18 AMWould this be feasibly possible or not?

It's possible Bitcoin itself will multiply to that level after a few cycles, but risking your bitcoins worth that amount while chasing more gains can result in you losing them.",

If you expect 10x profit, expect 10x loss. @OP, 10x ROI on an investment of 13-14 million USD in bitcoin seems very unrealistic, but not impossible, but I personally will not advise you to invest that in bitcoin right now. 10x will be difficult and will take longer to happen with bitcoin, but for some new altcoin, it can happen in a few minutes. That is the risk. So if you wish to make such a return on investments on such short notice in crypto, maybe you should be more willing to take the risk of investing in an altcoin, or rather, if you want to be patient and would like to wait for Bitcoin to maybe get that return on investment, then maybe you can still invest in it.",

Would this be feasibly possible or not? How could this much bitcoin be put to work?  What kind of investsments will allow this? Bitcoin itself is an investment on its own so there is no need looking for another investment to channel the Bitcoin into. Bitcoin has the potential to gradually grow in value in couple of years. What you want can be possible but it’s difficult to find such investment and no investment will be as beneficial as bitcoin so I would advise you to rather hold your bitcoin for a long period of time it’s really worth it. Any investment that promises you 10x profits should not be trusted, no investment can guarantee such profit not even bitcoin itself, it will take a whole lot of time to make 10x profit. All investments has their own risk so as much as you are expecting profit you should also expect loss too",

What the Op doesn't understand is that the money being in BTC is already an investment and what OP needs is to live the money for a long period of time and see the magic.But the big question is, how many people can hold such amount of money for many years.

It is for a couple of years but I don't think it'd be feasible at all with the market (unless we see a 10x the next year, which I highly doubt) so you might need to short every now and then and try to maximize the small pumps/dumps of the market. As for investing Bitcoin itself, no I don't think a 10x is possible at all.

I honestly think that at this stage with the current pool of users the growth is a bit more Logarithmic. The thing that could make it exponential at least temporarily would be mass adoption from the grass roots level. It's not so much how you invest it but who all is investing. Unless of course you're way out on the risk curve. This however could 0 you out quickly if you aren't careful. \"Leverage\" etc.",

That is a huge amount of money but I do think it can reach 10x in a few years. I do not think just holding it will give you the profits you are expecting. More likely trading should suit your profit goals and expectations. Holding is less risky and much safer compared to trading which involves a whole lot of complicated and complex process that you are going to need to learn and master. It could also be possible that you lose some money along the way but if you want 10x profit in only a few years then you should consider trading.",

I agree with you that that bitcoin price over the years has been reducing its volatility rate which means that the excessive increase enjoyed in the past is no longer going to be the case here again. If we look at the pumps even after halvings in the past you will easily see 10x movement but not now, the bitcoin community or holders to me are now too diluted that it volatility is and will continue to reduce but those that means there is no chance that the bitcoin price wouldn’t move 10x from its current position? I will say the possibility is a 50% chance but that depends on the holders holding time. If OP is actually looking for bitcoin to increase 10x in the next 10 to 15 years I will say it will be highly unlikely ti happens. But say a longer time like 30 plus years then I will say yes bitcoin with its current adoption rate has that potential to get close to a 7 figure price then, so with OP not been specific I will say in a very long term perspective yes it is possible but not longer possible in a short period of time",
