Back to the topic of investment in Bitcoin, just DCA it. That's the best thing you can do with Bitcoin.

That requires time and knowledge, can sometime eat you up on a bad day, change your mood and make your day or ruin it. That's why I don't do any of it, even DCA.

As a small part of the bitcoin community when you can't contribute much there is an easier option which is to simply become a holder in whatever amount you can afford in bitcoin.

You must be rich or wealthy to be a bitcoin capitalist and how will you get the money when you are poor. Owning a lot of bitcoin needs a lot of sacrifice and discipline to become successful in order to have such funds to lump sum hugely on bitcoin.I love DCA method because it gives room for the poor and the average to be able to buy bitcoin and build their portfolio gradually to a certain level based on their own discretionary income overtime. If an investor can be consistent and persistent with his regular buying for a very long time, he will be able to have a good size of bitcoin in his poor state in future. Another thing why i like the DCA method of investing is because it makes you discipline and know how to manage your funds because you will be committed to keep your bitcoin buying ongoing till you reach your bitcoin target.",

Well it depends on what an individual wants and the one they finds suitable for them because a Bitcoin capitalist can lose a huge amount of Bitcoins within a short period due to market volatility while a DCA strategy investor can grow their investments in Bitcoin as time goes on and even though a bitcoin capitalist can also make good profits why trading but it can't be compared with the profits and wealth of a consistent DCA HODLER even though it might take a lot of time.",

There is no other option for them than to find an alternative to buy Bitcoin gradually or go into other investments they know. DCA strategy has been discussed countless times in this thread, and it is confusing to be the best strategy when there are other strategies that one can still adapt to be successful. The only thing is than using DCA you are reducing risk in your investment, and it gives you time to gradually reach your desired amount of Bitcoin in your portfolio.

      "body": "Investments in Bitcoin have both pros and cons depending on a person's ability to withstand the risk and the prevailing market conditions. DCA divides the time plan for investments thereby mitigating exposure to risks associated with purchasing Bitcoin at its apex. In the course of history, it has been proven that such a strategy lowers the highs and the lows which invariably means that wealth can be built in a more certain manner over the long term especially in the depreciation phases. It has been noted that even though this approach is very modest in terms of investment protection, its DCA investor strategy has won the DCA investor strategy on few occasions by a whopping percentage of 668% between 2018 and 2024.On the other hand, lump-sum investing may give better results in very short bull market stages as price increases tremendously. For instance, in the period of 2018-2024 described above, the return of a lump-sum investment reached a phenomenal 1527%. The most important thing about investing for a long time using DCA is it is considered less risky and suitable to those who are committed to investing all the time, It encourages an investor to buy and sell at the right time to take advantage of the gains but increases vulnerability to short term market drops on the other hand.https://alphasquared.io/bitcoin-lump-sum-vs-dca/",

Every Bitcoin holder wouldn't mind to be in the whales category but the reality is that they can't afford to be, so they'll have to find a strategy that suits their earnings. The reason why I love Bitcoin investment is that it's not an asset that is reserved exclusively for the rich to hodl, there's really no excuse for an income not to hodl Bitcoin too. This is why the DCA method is a convenient strategy to accumulate Bitcoin on the long term, you don't need to be rich or \"capitalist\" to gain ROI in the future. Bitcoin is an all inclusive investment, if you can't afford to be a capitalist then do DCA method.",

There's only in general (afaik) DCA'ing Bitcoin or trading them.
