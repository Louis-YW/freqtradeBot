Anyone with smart contract experience willing to verify the burning mechanism and do a quick audit? Will send 200 (totally illiquid) SDX tokens for anyone who can provide useful info on the project’s contract. https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3aede23609a22bf4e0ba6986d1302a7088de2eb7https://g1x.xyz/",

It has an option to connect your wallet has a high change of containing inferno drainer. I am not sure why the token contract is important to you, if last tx of that token was over 2 months ago.
