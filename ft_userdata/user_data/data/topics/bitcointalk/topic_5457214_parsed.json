The only easiest way these set of people can save is to join a contributing team or corporate organization that you make contributions and the end of the stipulated time some gets the money. This way the Person sees the contribution as an obligation that needs to be attended to, and this minimizes excessive spending when one has extra money at hand. The second is not having to clear the necessary things before going into saving, so even if such person saves this money in the bank or any where they would still reach out to them when the needs that needed to be addressed where not addressed before going into savings. So on this one’s need should be tended to before saving",

If you are salaried person, start saving at the beginning of the month. I will tell you what I personally do. I receive my salary on 1st working day of every month. By 5th, all of my investments are done from my bank account. I have setup my banking account with debit mandates which automatically transfers my money into predefined investment plans and wealth management accounts. So by the end of 5th, you come to know your financial power and then start spending accordingly. This method really helped me. You may want to try.",

You have to pay for a Netflix subscription and a gym membership. We are so busy these days that we hardly cook our own meals, so we have to pay for eating out. So many things are outsourced nowadays, so you pay for whatever it is that you have outsourced. In fact, we may get to the point of paying for the air we breathe (I hope it doesn't happen). One other thing you should note is that if you live in a country where inflation is happening, you would notice that you spend more money than you used to spend on regular stuff. The two best ways I know to control this and have some money with you are to get more jobs and watch what you spend.",

Even if you don't activate USSD or internet banking or anything related to money, because basically every human being cannot avoid money even though they can avoid cash. But in this kind of case I just want to give you a little solution that maybe this can be very useful for you to apply in your life.The first thing you should do if you still don't support your own family is not to associate too much with those who are spenders because it can trigger you to be a wasteful like them too. That's the first, and the second is don't be too interested in momentary pleasures that might result in lasting difficulties for yourself, for example, like often following friends' invitations, basically they are very lazy at working to make money. So that you can also more easily lose motivation to continue working and making money in your own life. I think these two things can make you practice saving money before you spend it in any way that is completely useless, so you can consider these two things because they are directly related to the environment and to your daily interactions.",

Instead, I set aside a certain day of the week for shopping and make a list of the necessary things and products for the week. Buying everything at once in one day turns out to cost much less than doing it daily.I know the marketing tricks when the most necessary products, such as bread, are located in stores at the very back. This is designed to ensure that the buyer, having the goal of buying only a loaf of bread and passing by the shop windows, buys something else additionally.Therefore, in order not to be tempted by various unnecessary things, it is more convenient for me to purchase everything at once in one day. Nevertheless, I understand that such a strict regimen will not save me from walking with children and spending on children's goodies and toys.",

It is your difficulty to handle your impulsiveness. And worse is you're blaming it to other things. So to my response with your question, yes. It's probably a bad habit of yours but it can be easily to solve. First is forgive yourself. We all gone through that where we became irresponsible of our assets. Then practice accountability. Just know and accept that it is your fault. Not the money's fault or the banks fault. It's probably your own organization of your money, your priorities, or budgeting. Most importantly is the action. You work on how you spend your money. How you plan to risk it, invest, or keeping it. Just know that regardless or wherever you put it, there's always a risk.",

(Many will say, your words are not matching like in the first para and here and many will say, how could you declare not giving money to loved ones as saving money) the point is, she always buy waste and unnecessary things from which i want her to stop. And, i always save money when i am in my friends because they also find a way to waste your money, even if you have in your atm so i just do not hold atm card with me. Hehe. I might be declared as miser, but i am not because when i know it is time to spend money i do not hesitate, if you really wants to stop wasting money then only keep what you need for your regular expenses and the money left behind, use it to invest in BTC.

Measure your daily needs.2. Measure your monthly and annual needs.After that, measure your income per day, month and year, whether the expenditure is large or a little income or if the expenditure is greater, try to reduce it, only buy what is necessary, 30% of the money you get is turned off / frozen.So many solutions from me.",

Hmm for the second reason, I am not sure how can you justify well it's not your task but still, as you are asking why it is difficult to hold so you should answer the inflation's impact. It is difficult to hold fiat because inflation regularly decreases your buying power. For paper cash and ATM cards, people are now used to e-payment apps and even now people are shifting to digital crypto wallets which they use to invest in the market and make their daily payments. Well, it's not our topic being particular to the topic bro the point is the technological developments and trends of crypto made a great impact on the dominance of crypto over fiat money. So as with the passage of time, the fiat is losing its value and utility in the economic circle.",

It's our habit only. Just assess the situation that you had previously with limited money in hand. Will you be borrowing money? Or will you be okay? If you would be okay then you are spending money in a wrong way but if you might have to borrow money eventually then you are right it's just the expenses that you have are unavoidable and absolutely necessary and you need to raise up your income in this scenario to ensure savings.",

Even if you keep your money in the bank and you don't take an ATM and also don't have M-banking on your phone. but then you have an urgent need, so you will still withdraw the money somehow and use it. even though the distance to go to the bank is very far, I'm sure if there is an urgent need, you will go that long way and head to the bank to collect money.But if what you mean is when we hold a lot of cash then we become more wasteful then this does happen to some people. Because cash is very easy to use. so it's hard to refrain from using it. an effective way to stop this is simply to limit the cash we hold. namely only holding cash for the amount of the budget that has been calculated to meet only basic needs.",
