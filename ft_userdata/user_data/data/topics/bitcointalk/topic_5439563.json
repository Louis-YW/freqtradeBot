I discovered a lot of new information, particularly in areas of decentralized and centralized exchange. However, that is not the main reason I decided to write this brief article.When they keep telling us, especially newcomers, to avoid altcoins and stick with Bitcoin, it's all about the difference between decentralized and centralized exchanges.As a newcomer, I assumed that altcoins could also be stored in non-custodial wallets, but I later discovered that only Bitcoin could be stored in non-custodial wallets such as electrum, Exodus, and the Ledger Nano X. If we can't store our coins in a non-custodial wallet where we have full control over them, why should we buy other coins or tokens where we don't have full control just because exchanges give us half power over our investments? So, if you own other coins or tokens, you don't have much control over your crypto investment because exchanges can bring any laws that may affect you in the future or even steal it.I can't give advice because I'm not knowledgeable enough to give it to a newbie, but with this little write up, I'd like to advise my followers newbies to stay away from all other coins and tokens except Bitcoin, and if anyone is holding Bitcoin in exchanges, he/she should try to move it out of exchanges for proper storage.",

Bitcoin has a best decentralized network and altcoins have worse networks for decentralization.

You always can but you must use open source non custodial wallets.It is not true that you say people can not store their altcoins in non custodial wallets. Except very scam altcoins that don't have their blockchains and actual networks. If their coins or tokens are on good altcoin blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Harmony, Avalanche, you can import their smart contract address to non custodial wallets and store that token.People just like to store their coins in accounts on centralized exchanges and skip all warnings about risks.Cryptocurrency security checklistReminder: do not keep your money in online accountsKeep Your Crypto #SAFU (CZ's Tips)",

Although Ledger Nano X seems not to have some altcoins on its mobile live app but they could be stored on the USB wallet; coins like Luna and Cardano should be stored on it. They also some non custodian coins wallets that could store them such as Trust wallet although it is not an open source wallet. In entirety altcoin are just centralized coins that would actually crash when it supported exchanges gets hack. Imagine anything happening to Binance exchange and KuCoin exchange then their self coins like BNB and KCS could also be in danger.",

Electrum wallet is built for Bitcoin only. You mixed the whole facts up, altcoins can be stored in a non-custodial wallet just as how you can store Bitcoin in one, mind you, some custodial wallets also accept Bitcoin too, for example, Free Wallet.  Find a noncustodial wallet for altcoins and you will receive your private key or recovery phrase when opening the wallet. You still have a lot to learn about crypto wallets, it's too early to advise on crypto wallets right now.",

So, accessing your coins if you have your private key or seed is also a function of Altcoins in general.

We can always correct them, but I think he did have some humility there when he mentioned he does not have enough knowledge. But the topic is been a decade routinely opened here about altcoin and investment. Pretty sure he did some homework researching those. What we can do is encourage them to study first, before playing a dangerous path on altcoins. Sure there are ways to earn on altcoins no doubt about that. But we must help them to control and discipline their selves from doing heavy on it to avoid such bitter loss.",

Where do you get this idea in the forum because you definitely not reading a post from a reputable member here. The reason why most user here preferred Bitcoin over altcoin for newbie investment is because its volatility is not that high compared to altcoins. Also Bitcoin is the only true decentralized project the creator is unknown and inactive for a long time which gives this token run by everyone that wants to participate. But some altcoin is decentralized too like Bitcoin in terms of Blockchain model.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on February 12, 2023, 10:07:26 AMAs a newcomer, I assumed that altcoins could also be stored in non-custodial wallets, but I later discovered that only Bitcoin could be stored in non-custodial wallets such as electrum, Exodus, and the Ledger Nano X.Altcoins can be stored too on non-custodial wallet.

It was just created for fun but people see prices rising under Musk influence they blindly jump into investment so what's the profit ratio for them now? They are pump with fake volumes so whales who holds the major supply can cash out profits from your pockets and in end they dump it over you so better stay away from them.If you see bitcoin has lost significant part of its value in the past but still stands strong in comparison and that's mainly due to utility it has so understanding this can help you a lot.",
