  "content": "With no prejudice, please check the whole page and then conclude.Website: https://BlaBlaGame.ioWeb Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20220430165716/https://blablagame.io/Telegram: https://t.me/BlaBlaGame_EnglishLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/BlaBlaGameFiWhitepaper: https://blablagame.io/assets/docs/BlaBlaGame_White_Paper.pdf?v=1.3Smart Contract: https://bscscan.com/token/0xa278f6f606B9A72E888e3Bb62393BfD83881ea78https://BlaBlaGame.io presents the world’s first Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Crypto. They have operated this idea since Nov 2021 and with two failed ICO stages so far. But why do we believe BlaBla Game (BLA) 100% is a scam?5 REASONS YOU SHOULD NOT FALL INTO THIS PROJECT:1. Providing false statistics: After fact-checking the data provided about the games, users, and financial transactions by the project, we realized that every number you see on their site is fake by a vast difference. As of writing this article in Jan 2023, they have no holder, and the founder owns 100% of the tokens. On the other hand, how could they have started the ICO 5 months before the token launch (May)? They created the SMART CONTRACT and BLA token in Oct 2023 and did not distribute any tokens until Jan 2023. Don’t those 2,500 people who invested more than $27,000 expect to receive their tokens? 2. Low activity in social media:The Bla Bla ICO is one of the least active on social media. They don’t have money to pay for ads, attract audiences, marketing, and pro content production. Antidolos tools found 15% fake followers on Twitter and YouTube, and there are about 40% on Telegram .3. There are no funds for Ads and Marketing: They do not have any AMA, Ads campaigns, tutorials, or plans to be listed on exchanges. If they don’t change their situation, don’t start extensive marketing campaigns, and can’t attract private investors in the shortest time, they will sink into this smart market.4. Lying about the users, players, and achievements: They claim users have already played this game 85,000 times. And at the time of writing, the platform has over 2500 players. They exaggerate their status and try to show themselves as a successful project with a high number of users. But this is not true. If you check https://blablagame.io, you will find they have less than 10 active players. 5. Fake team and abuse of people’s names and photos: What is certain is that they don’t want to reveal their real identity and abuse people’s names and photos. But if they intend to stay in this market, why should they do this? We leave the answer to you.BlaBla Game (BLA) Whitepaper is Full of BugsDo Not Expect Legal info!Where is The Bla Bla ICO Location?They do not have any license to start this business, and the Bla Bla ICO is not under any country’s tax laws and company registration. They have no location and can quickly disappear.We tried our best to be optimistic about BlaBla Game (BLA). Based complete analysis and review we did on Antidolos Media, we found out that the Bla Bla ICO is a scam. Which is decreasing compared to the supply of tokens. We do not suggest investing in this scam.BlaBla game 2023 is a scam or not? Antidolos Media concluded by surveying https://BlaBlagame.io, socials, and all financial details. Because of the small number of participants, fake team, and lying about everything, unfortunately, we do not suggest buying tokens from this game, maybe there will be a better procedure in the future.Although we’ve provided various examples of Crypto scams, you still have to take responsible actions for a good profit.If this page is not complete and sufficient, you can find the full article with documents, evidence, and complete financial, media, team, idea, and Whitepaper details along with photos in the link below.https://antidolos.com/blabla-game-bla-is-a-scam-ico-dont-fall-into-its-trap/https://antidolos.com/blabla-game-bla-is-a-scam-ico-dont-fall-into-its-trap/",

Unfortunately, i don't think ICO will still ring a bell to investors, even airdrop has lesser publicity and participants either here, twitter, facebook and other social media sites.I agree that most ICO projects today are only looking to scam new investors. But you’re wrong if you think that the number of ICOs has reduced. I can see the opposite every day you can see that on Bounty section here, with new projects emerging and starting with a presale phase. In the meantime not all of these projects are scams. I have worked as a manager for some projects that started with an ICO phase and followed their roadmap and everything stated on their whitepaper. It’s hard to find legitimate projects nowadays, but that doesn’t mean there aren't any. Regarding the BLA ICO I can agree with the OP on some points. It looks suspicious and appears to focus on gathering investors' money rather than their future plans or the problems they aim to solve",

The main difference between those is that IDOs used \"decentralized\" launchpads to raise the money, while ICO were conducting sale directly on their website. The end result has been the same though, majority of people losing the money. Coming next bull run, you can be sure that owners of these shitcoin projects will come up with some new way to attract investors, but under it it will be the very same ICO crap that we have been seeing for years.",

Such a gibberish name.2. I just want to reiterate what has been said about ICO. It's true that ICOs are long dead gone and that's why if there are projects that still find their luck through it and don't even have a legitimate project to begin with, you've got already the red flags. Before when it was too popular, their target were millions but now, on this project it's just $50k and they're half way on it if it's true.

They don't know how much research is needed before bringing a project to the market, so they try to promote the project quickly by using such funny names, because funny names spread quickly. They know that such behaviors are effective in carrying out their evil intentions, so nowadays scammers are getting a chance to survive because people are more greedy.",

Just saying that something is fake without any proof doesn't really convince anyone. I tried to do some snooping around to see if I could find out more about their team. It appears that Inna Halahuz, the CEO, is a genuine person. However, I couldn't find any reference to the BlaBlaGame project on her social media profiles. According to her profiles, she is from Netherlands (not Ukraine) and part of the marketing and BD team at Crowny.io, as well as serving as the CMO of obsworld.io.Twitter | LinkedInI couldn't find the original version of the image that was used on the blablagame.io website, but there is a black and white version on obsworld.io: It seems unlikely that an individual who maintains an active presence on social media would completely overlook mentioning a project that they supposedly have been leading as a CEO for over a year and it raises serious questions about her involvement in the project.",

We shared the Backstage (BKS) private draft (5.5 score) with the founder and asked them for explanations. We wanted to hear their words before doing anything. After receiving the documents and explanations, we found some of them convincing and published the final version with a score of 6.1.  3. I ask you to do something.Suppose all our words are nonsense. Read the review for yourself.https://antidolos.com/backstage-bks-blockchain-is-a-high-potential-on-the-downslide/If these are false accusations, then why do Backstage founders are so worried?  We only expose the strengths and weaknesses of projects with evidence.But the final decision is with the audience.4.
