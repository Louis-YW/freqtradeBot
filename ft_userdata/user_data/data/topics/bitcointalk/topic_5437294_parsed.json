  "content": "I saw this while checking crypto news today, but it is actually not true.This year, USD increased above â‚¦850 before it dropped to around â‚¦750 now. I have read about bitcoin selling at premium, but I noticed that people are getting this wrong at times, if it is pertaining to Nigeria.If you use search engine, you will see central bank of Nigeria dollar to naira conversion rate which is the official rate of dollar conversion to nairaCBN rate, $1 = â‚¦460 naira as of when I wanted to ost thisParallel rate$1 = 752CBN rate is the official rate of converting dollar to naira, it is what search engine would likely bring up if you searched for dollar to naira conversion. But in Nigeria, people use parallel rate, which is also called the black market rate. The parallel rate is usually nothing new and it is what Nigerians are using to convert to naira and what crypto exchanges are using for p2p and trading pairs, but while CBN rate is only displayed as mark price but not the rate Nigerians are actually using to buy or sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.USD CBN rate today is â‚¦460Bitcoin price now at $23700Multiply both to get bitcoin price in Nigeria which is â‚¦10,902,000But not what people are using for the conversion to buy or sell their bitcoinUSD parallel rate today is â‚¦752Bitcoin price now at â‚¦23700Multiply both to get bitcoin price in Nigeria which is â‚¦17,822,400This is the rate bitcoin buyers and sellers are usingThis is the news:Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-premium-hits-60-in-nigeria-as-it-limits-atm-cash-withdrawalsThe price of Bitcoin in Nigeria has skyrocketed to well above market levels amid continued efforts by the central bank to push its citizens into digitalized cash.At the time of writing, the price of 1 BTC on Nigerian crypto exchange NairaEX is currently 17.8 million Naira, equating to a whopping $38,792.This represents more than a 60% premium over the current market price of Bitcoin, which is around $23,700 at the time of writing.It comes as the Central Bank of Nigeria has continued to impose limits on ATM cash withdrawals amid an ongoing effort to accelerate its shift to a cashless society.The bolded part of the quote pissed me off, how can it relate to bitcoin selling at premium. Bitcoin is digital too while cashless policy is about digital. Nigerians can still withdraw above â‚¦500000 ($665, parallel rate) while organizations can withdrawal up to â‚¦5 million ($6650, parallel rate) before extra charges.",

      "body": "cheers Charles-Tim, I appreciate the clarification and wish Martin Young of Cointelegraph would be here to read this. A little mistake: I think you omitted the letter \"p\" on the spelling of \"post\" there ðŸ‘‡.Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 30, 2023, 07:32:10 AMCBN rate, $1 = â‚¦460 naira as of when I wanted to ost thisI have gone through the article, and I don't blame the author, Martin Young, because he is not a Nigerian and can't really understand anything about the exchange rate of dollar to naira (CBN rate) the way you did. It is better not to write instead of giving wrong information to the readers. How ever, the bank rate has always been what the Bitcoin sellers in Nigeria are using to calculate the Bitcoin price, despite the fact that the CBN rate is lower. The rate calculation has always been that of the bank, even before the enactment of the new law to limit withdrawals to #20,000 naira per day.I think the bank rate you talk about is also being referred to as the \"black market rate,\" which is popularly used to calculate for P2P trade and exchanges and not the CBN rate.",

      "body": "Yeah they did the same thing with my nation too, and even Iran for a while which is a futile information considering you can't just buy somewhere and go to Iran and sell there, that's not going to happen, and even if you can, you won't be able to take your money out of there neither. It's a digital thing, everywhere all around the world, even in nations that's blocking bitcoin, the price of bitcoin is price of bitcoin.The very best case for anyone is to find someone who has no other option and make them take a 10% cut, that's about it and nothing more. I understand people want to find a way to get rich quick, but this isn2t the way to do that, they need to find another method.",
