  "content": "Good day everyone.I'd really need your advice on something I'm debating within myself. Okay the screenshots below is a running ticket that's been on since Sunday, I carefully selected 2 games for each day using the same market options for all the games( Home or Away to win).  I've been carefully watching the game every single day as everything has been going as planned, although there were times I panicked as some matches almost went bazaar. But thankfully everything went well. So today's the final day and I've been given an incredible amount as my available Cashout, so I've been waring against myself since morning if I should take the cash out or if I should just allow the game to finish playing. Honestly I want to leave the game, besides it's just 2 games left and the games are likely to play in my favor, but who knows, these things can be so unpredictable. What if I take the cashout and then the game plays ( which I believe will happen) then I'd be loosing over half of my winning, and then what if I leave the game to finish playing with intentions of taking everything and it goes otherwise. Please guys I need your advice, the first game starts in a couple of hours and I still can't decide on what to do right now.                                                                                                  BET'S OUTCOME/RESULT HELLO EVERYONEI PROMISED I'D COME BACK WITH UPDATES ON THE OUTCOME AND RESULT OF THE GAME. I SHOULD HAVE UPDATED Y'ALL EARLIER THAN THIS BUT I'VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY WITH STUFFS. AND SO I DECIDED NOT TO CASH OUT AND LET THE GAME PLAY THROUGH AND I DID. BUT UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE GAMES TOOK A NEGATIVE TURN AND RUINED EVERYTHING. I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED BUT I'M STILL NOT REGRETTING MY DECISION BECAUSE THAT'S GAMBLE FOR YOU, SOMETIMES YOU WIN, SOMETIMES YOU LOOSE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE KEPT IN A TIGHT CORNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS, SOMETIMES YOU MAKE THE RIGHT ONE, AND SOMETIMES THR WRONG ONES BUT THAT'S THE WORLD OF GAMBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT Y'ALL WOULD GONNA LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE BUT I DON'T REGRET MY ACTIONS AND IF I'M TO BE FACED WITH THE SAME SITUATION AGAIN, I'D STILL CHOOSE TO LET IT PLAY THROUGH.",

Sometimes, it will only just be a single match which may be the last match that will make someone lose. I did it sometimes ago, I won all the matches but remaining one match with the lowest odd of 1.05 and I lost it. If you are winning already, you can cash out, but if you can afford to lose the money, why cashing out.",

It creates a lot of adrenaline rush within the individual gambler and that would be some disturbing position to be in.It’s not abnormal that the options for a cash out is always way less or at least half of the potential win but, you really have to understand two things here.One, cashing out too early means, you’re still in profit and that’ll be at least 17X of your stake.Having yo wait and you eventually win, you still profit.Which ever one that happens, you get to be contented and focus on what is at hand than what is expected in potent.Meanwhile, it takes just one game to void a prediction and leaves you with nothing. I’m sure you’re aware of that.I took a quick look at your bet and you’ve chosen games from Bundesliga and Serie A in the 12 market options.I must say, I don’t see how an X would be coming out of those two bets. If I were you, I’ll let it run. It’s something that could easily play out in your favour.That’s my take but, it’s up to you.",

Are you fearful of losing money? Can't you afford losing the money you wagered? I believe that if you are insecure about this you should cashout. To maintain a bet till the end demands confidence and rationality from a gambler. When they are lacking, the consequences can be worse if something goes wrong, on the opposite of what was firstly expected. However, only you can decide what to do, because people here don't know your personality, therefore they don't know what outcomes will be best and worst for you.Think about it, what is preferable: to lose all the money knowing you could have earned half prize or to win half prize knowing you could have won the whole prize? These are the two worst possibilities that can happen.",

This is the reason why I play a ticket twice so that I can be able to cash out one of the tickets and leave the other to run till the end.",

What the user wants is to win as well as every other gambler but, can’t really decide on what is acceptable with a huge probability situation in the way. I suppose that’s the purpose of this thread and looking at how close it is to strike gold or should I say, Bitcoin.If we look at the thread you provided in that adhoc link, I think the options and potentials are entirely different with the one on OP. I mean, the games in the link is the damned El-Classico, Barcelona vs Real Madrid. There is a lot of rivalry in that game. We can’t say the same for the games OP has placed bet on.Also, the market chosen is one that allows for just anything except a draw which is very plausible in these games.",

And this particular one I did, made me restless cause the amount that was available for me to cash out was significant and if I should wait for the last four games I’ll realize an even greater win just like in your case but the only difference between us was I did cash out what was available at that moment but in the end everything entered. But since you’ve decided to stick with the game I do wish you luck.",

Anyway, I like the cash out option because it allows you to run away with some and leaving some for another day but if you still get to another lucky day, you will still run off to leave some money behind you. It is actually up to you.Regards to your potential, you already have a huge cash out from your potential with two games remaining. Logically, the reason I think the cash out is huge is probably that the game will favour you and they are trying to tempt you to forfeit some, but it is still under risk, anything is possible with gambling. You might still lose it.But what I advise people who are in such dilemma is that you can cash out and use a huge bankroll to restake the remaining games on the option you want which maybe be same option you staked it before. Like you can restake it with 100,000 naira from your cash out of 300+ naira, with that you would have 200+ naira as profit if the restake didn't go your way but if it does then you have more potential.I wish that you take a decision that will favour you but remember, I think they say a bed at hand is worth more than million in the bush  Quote from: Solosanz on December 01, 2023, 03:14:12 PMSince I'm a brave gambler, I never did cash out or withdraw my bet, I want to see whether my prediction is correct or not. Of Sometimes this is one idea that makes us to go down even as when it is a very little thing that we could have avoided. I get your point though, to prove that you are actually master of your game or your predictions so that you will defeat fear but at other times it also pulls a gambler down.",
