  "content": "Lately I noticed my posted images via https://imgur.com are reading something else like \"bitcointalk image proxy invalid image.\" The first thing that came to my mind was that the image has been corrupted somehow but was lucky to see other topic's images displaying same and similar errors. The most important post and service aspects of the forum was not left out.I was able to use another URL to upload another image yesterday and the image is still there as I write.Since I can't find anyone talking about it, I am curious as a new member to know what is happening on https://imgur.com. There must be a reason for an image uploading site to just be disabled and the alternatives were left alone.Good opinions will be appreciated.",

      "body": "The issue I noticed it about a week ago, and a lot of forum members have been complaining about it here on the forum, and a user has also created a thread regarding the issue.  Imgur images suddenly became invalid.  There have also been alternative suggestions to the imgur issue, and joker_josue created a specific design for Bitcointalk users to avoid this kind of imgur issue in the future . TalkImg.com: Image Hosting for BitcoinTalk  Edit: Today, a new progress was also launched by TryNinja . [Script] Imgur to TalkImg: automatically fix your broken images  The issue of Imgur is no longer something new here on the forum, and very soon all those whose post images are affected will have them fixed up again, and those old posts will go back to normal again.",

You must know how alt works before accusing another person. This is not a place to play, take your nonsense elsewhere and stop playing over-know.I just captured this image on my profile via formerly created thread to shame you. Check and see who created the topic and maybe the error is viewable or not.https://ibb.co/J3pw6bbQuote from: Bureau on May 14, 2023, 01:19:47 PMImgur is on a mission to destroy itself  . What happened exactly I do not know but if you input the url on Google you will find the mess. Earlier we used to visit the url imgur.com. At the moment if you enter the same url on Google it gets redirected to imgur.io. They might have accidentally forgotten that the links they gave for sharing the images do not automatically get forwarded to the .io domain. Thank you for sharing reasonable information but my domain with them continues to read .com not .io.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on May 14, 2023, 02:12:36 PMOP, is your vision okay?Do not expand the discussion, close the topic.Nothing is wrong with my vision, it is an innocent skip.
