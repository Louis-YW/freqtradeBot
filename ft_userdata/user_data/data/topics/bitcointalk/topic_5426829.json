But yes why not trust a brand new account?Just because if you offer a \"wallet \" as a collateral  (I guess you mean a private key that can unlock funds for 2.1 btc)... basically you can keep a copy?  (well, basically this is not a valid collateral).Moreover why you don't send by yourself all these \"small inputs\" in one transaction and unlock this amount?Add a decent size fee and you have your amount in 10-30 minutes.obviously you don't have a transaction error  that's a really lame/silly excuse.",

Read it You're not the first, although having that many small inputs is uncommon (but not impossible). What did you do: collect faucets for years?Anyway, in Bitcoin Core it's fairly easy to handle. First, enable Coin Control: Settings > Options > Wallet > Enable coin control features. Then, go to Send > Inputs and manually select a bunch of inputs. You can sort them on size and start with the largest ones. Select for instance 100 at a time, set the lowest fee (1 sat/byte), and send the entire amount to a new address that you own. Keep doing this until you have no more small amounts in your wallet.If you're desperate enough, I can do it for you (at a price).

Bitcoin Core is fine, no need to switch to Electrum.Yo. This was extremely helpful.It's working, kind of slow, but I'm consolidating the smaller inputs.And to answer your question about what I did. Essentially yes. I wrote some screen capturing software to look at some faucets and click the button once every whatever time the faucet had. Started it in 2015. It worked and didn't , might have had more by now if the software was any better.I'm a software engineer, not really familiar with everything crypto.Thanks again for your help",

I wrote some screen capturing software to look at some faucets and click the button once every whatever time the faucet had. Started it in 2015.In that case you may also have a couple hundred bucks worth of Forkcoins. But don't bother about them as long as you have any Bitcoin in that wallet. Also, for 2 Bitcoin, you may want to look at a more secure storage method than a hot wallet (connected to the internet).QuoteThanks again for your help You're welcome",
