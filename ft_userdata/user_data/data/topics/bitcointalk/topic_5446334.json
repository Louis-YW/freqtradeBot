  "content": "The problem with Fractional reserve banking system.QuoteFractional reserve banking is a type of banking system in which banks keep only a fraction of the total deposits made by customers in reserve, while the rest is available for lending out to other customers or investing.This means that banks are only required to keep a certain percentage of the deposited money in their bank vault or at the central bank. The remaining money is loaned out to other customers who need the money to finance various activities, such as buying a home, starting a business, or making a large purchase.Fractional reserve banking allows banks to make profits by charging interest on loans while ensuring that depositors have access to their money whenever they need it. So, they are under the condition to let their customers withdraw mass amount of their deposits, thus creating a crisis.This is the reason why all the Banks are broken. They are lending out money to people which they don't have or own. And the most concerning thing is counterfeiting. If a normal person does it, then it's a crime, but when the central banks and government does it, they can get away with it. This is the one thing that hurts the economy the most. When they go bankrupts, the whole pressure is put upon taxpayers. This is a criminal scandal. Bitcoin could solve all of this. Counterfeiting could be avoided at all cost with this, and bitcoin having limited supply makes it impossible to create more, as they are able to do with fiat currency. Other aspect of Bitcoin is already known to people, so I don't want to talk about those now. All I want to know is, how good is it in terms of preventing these crises.Â  What is your view on this?",

Before the FTX saga there was Luna, before Luna there was Mt-Gox if people should have learned it would have been a long time ago and centralized exchanges will struggle to survive, the only thing closer to Banks in crypto space are centralized exchanges.This is why I called CEX the bank of the digital space, and it is also why I still blame some developers, I wonder why they have not been able to come up with a decentralized exchange that is 99% close to everything that a CEX has to offer, but in a Decentralized form, this is why Bitcoin existed right? Everyone should use Bitcoin as an example, and also follow its way.",

The only difference is that centralized exchanges cannot just create new bitcoin out of thin air like banks can with fiat, but they are very much fractional reserve just like banks are.Right, an exchange could go broke and any entity using that exchange would go broke along with it, but the Bitcoins would still be somewhere and not leave the economy/economic cycle. Someone else would have it and either save it or reintroduce it into the economy. With fiat the problem is that pseudo-value is created to represent assets, like a house. That is where the real bubbles are generated because that pseudo-value fiat is not backed by any real EVA, i.e. by work or effort of some kind. It is pure dust that out of pure volume makes the house bigger than it is. Once the market realizes this, the dust dissolves into thin air, houses literally collapse and lose their pseudo-value, and since this is a systemic issue the entire real estate industry collapses, spilling over to anything remotely related to that industry. With Bitcoin this pseudo-value creation isn't possible in the same way. Someone either has the real Bitcoin to buy a house (which can still be overpriced), or not. If it is overpriced, someone else gets a good deal, but the overpricing has sort of a cap concerning the industry.Could pseudo-Bitcoin be created? Oh yes! But imagine someone coming to you saying \"hey this is Bitcoin-TA (thin-air), I want to buy your house, I pay a good price\". The person could accept the offer, but knows that the Bitcoin-TA should be invested very quickly because Bitcoin-TA can lose value due to infinite printing, aka inflation. Now one might think the person buying with Bitcoin-TA got a good deal as well, but let's assume that every house, every estate that was bought with Bitcoin-TA is also labeled \"TA-Estate\", such that everyone knows all these objects have been bought with Bitcoin-Thin-Air, meaning that there is no real value backing the estate, that more Bitcoin-TA could be printed any second. Everyone buying a house with Bitcoin-TA will also only be paid salaries in Bitcoin-TA from when the contract for the purchase is signed. Greed will get this Bitcoin-TA economy going, but over time people will become suspicious as estate prices are rising while salaries are not. It is all too good to be true, and there are always enough people that it is too good to be true, but it ignore it regardless. The Bitcoin-TA economy will crash at some point because of market uncertainties as nobody knows the real value of the estate as the money used to buy it isn't based on EVA, but created out of thin air. An economy based on real Bitcoin has less options for monetary policy, or let's say less scope, but with less scope also comes less risk. Some say with less risk comes less opportunity, but that only counts for a few % of our population as those who are rich and play it smart are the ones who win when bubbles burst. Just imagine someone wants to buy a house and someone wants to sell a house, the question will be whether the buyer decides to go with a little bit of a smaller house with the label \"Bitcoin-Real\" and the seller prefers \"Bitcoin-Real\" over \"Bitcoin-TA\", because that is the route to go if you want assets that are backed by money that is based on EVA. Bitcoin carries value on its own merits because effort must be put in to create it. Bitcoin-TA doesn't. The problem is that there is no USD-REAL and USD-TA, we can't differentiate whether the dollar bill we hold in our hands was just a button on a keyboard or a human being's or machines hard work.",

There is now no requirements for banks to have any money on hand whatsoever. I was reading the OP and the first thing I thought of was this. It should be renamed because the system is no longer even a reserve system at 0%. However, it's not 0% in all cases, for example, in Europe the ECB maintains a reserve of 1% for deposits with a term of less than two years, lol, and 0% for the rest.The funny thing is that since the fractional reserve system has been in place, the world has reached high levels of development and welfare, but I guess that's like the temporary welfare of someone who keeps refinancing credits to spend more and more, until it all blows up.

I don't see it either but I think that things like the SVB cases and others attract people to bitcoin and even if it is a small percentage, it makes some people understand that if you manage your bitcoin keys it is an amount that you own, just as if you own and hold an amount of gold, but the numbers that appear in your bank account are a mere bookkeeping entry based on a house of cards.",

The problem might be that too many people use custodians to manage their funds and then the thin air bubble game begins again in the books of the custodians, here Coinbase. But @o_e_l_e_o I think I have some trouble to get my head around the example I myself provided with the real estate transaction. For such a transaction you actually need real Bitcoin right? Are you only referring to on-platform lending services where users can use fake-Bitcoin (aka leverage) to trade on platform and either lose or win thin air? As soon as it comes to transactions of Bitcoin vs. real assets, on-chain Bitcoin will be needed, right? Or does Coinbase operate a Bitcoin lending service where they send Bitcoin off-platform to users requesting a loan? So to say, they keep 10% real Bitcoin as a reserve, lend out 90% off-platform and cover the 90% + even more via typing thin air Bitcoin into their books? Perhaps you can help me get a better understanding here. I feel I might be missing a piece of the puzzle.",

We have to rely on banks because we cannot do without them for now, do you have a job in real life? I do, and my salary is paid into my bank account, and if you do, i am sure that's where yours is paid into as well. When people and friends want to send you money, you can't give them your BTC address if they aren't BTC enthusiasts, so they have to send it to your bank account.Quote from: tjtonmoy on March 26, 2023, 02:37:34 PMAs said on OP, when people withdraw massive amount of money from banks, they face crisis.Look, if a bank run happens, the bank is surely going to collapse because of their fractional reserve system, but if there is massive withdrawal of money from a particular bank, where are people going to put all that money? You and i would say BTC because we believe in it, but there are millions of people who do not, so they would just put the same money into another bank they think is safer.",
