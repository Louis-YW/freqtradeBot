  "content": "Past Discussion: Africans at 2024 Paris Olympics Quote from: Hewlet on July 26, 2024, 06:37:29 AMThe Olympics games is up and running with African football teams heavily represented. For the men's category we have representatives of the African teams which are;1. Guinea, 2. Morocco 3. Egypt 4. MaliWhile for the female category we have two African teams;1. Nigeria2. Zambia.From the results of the first leg played at the group stage,  Guinea which is in the group comprising of France, New Zealand and USA lost her first match and is currently at third place in the group A while  while Morocco won against Argentina and secured all three point standing on the second place of the group B, Egypt had a goales draw against the Dominican Republic which they should have made effort to win considering that Spain is in same group with them while mali had a 1:1 draw against Israel at group D.It's a fair start for the male African team and it's good that some of the teams are doing well and are at the top of their respective groups. For the female teams, it appears as though they are both at the group of death with both teams currently lying bottom of thier respective group's. Zambia suffered a 3:0 defeat  in favour of the USA while the Nigerian supa falcons lost 1 nill against Brazil and still have Spain and Japan upfront. Parent Discussion:  World Cup qualifiers - CAF Don't you just hate it when the international break comes and as an African, you feel left out because there isn't a discussion thread for we Africans to discuss international Sport/football tournaments like our counterparts. Well that feeling should be a thing of the past as this thread will serve as a dedicated hangout joint for discussion by all forum users (both Africans and foreigners) interested in Africans in sport.This thread will be updated with everything Africa Sport/football worth discussing, each tournaments, round fixtures, table standing etc. Feel free to drop your prediction on table toppers, match winners and discussion as any tournament progresses etc.Ps: Previous thread has been locked and a self moderated thread was created to moderate spam and off topic discussion.",

Nothing would please me more than seeing the follow up against spamming innit.Concerning the Transfer Markets, Liverpool are good with the Introduction of Africans that I know, as they did with big names like Sadio Mane, Mohammed Salah, Matip, Baby Kieta etc but currently, I double doubt if they're in for our Nigerian Chukuwueze, he's been monitored and well wanted by Aston Villa ans his former Boss Unai Emery. Liverpool seal deals with Mo Salah and Cody Gakpo, I ain't seeing em chasing any other attacking options again. I'll consider it as speculations.Kalidou Koullibaly joined Chelsea this season why move him outta Chelsea so fast ? Besides the Senegalese is doing a great job at the heart of the defense with Thiago Silva.Franck Kessie is more likely to make the move,  I feel like he is uncomfortable with Barcelona at the point in time. But Tottenham Hotspur already has lots of players that plays same role as he does, what is the recruitment for again ? LOLFinally, AFCON qualifies in a bit, our group seem easy if not for Sierra Leone, aside them Nigeria are sure of taking three points from all of the other sides ( countries )Last year we didn't do well, I hope we go harder and better, can they successfully chase thise playing politics amongst the Nigerian Football Federation ?

His abilities are being wasted at Barcelona. He's a very good CM that thrives in the double-pivot system. He's the kind of player Conte likes (physical and technical). When people talk about African players they focus mainly on the physicality of the player which should not be so, especially with Kessie. He's more technical than he is physical. I watched him a lot when he was in Milan and he's a very good midfielder. He can help dictate the game. He knows how to win the ball back and has the technicality needed to deal with the ball when he wins it back. Tottenham would be a good move for him since he not getting any playing time in a Barca anyway.",

His superb performance for Morocco in the world cup has certainly earned him some level of recognition in Europe and attracted Klopp who sees him as a good addition and someone who will add strength to Liverpool's defense. Still no news from Napoli concerning Victor Osimhen, I think the club is still holding strong on their decision to keep the player at the club past this January transfer window.",

It will be a good decision if he decides to stay or the club decides to keep him, whichever way you decide to put it. Moving to another club at this time may slow down his performance because he will struggle to adapt to another set of players and another type of play. Stay in a club that values your input, win trophies for them first, and then maybe he can decide to move to another league for another experience and form of competition.",

On other hand, Aboubakar will play well for Manchester United if the rumors are true. and this will greatly advance his career. Right now, Manchester United needs a striker who can frighten the rival defense. These are the attributes he possesses. He is physically fit, quick, deadly, and obviously quite self-confident.",

I isee all of that as rumours. He should be with Besiktas currently trying to reach agreement, it's one of the drawback to the Dutch player Wout Weghorst transfer move to Manchester United.I see what Al-Nassr are trying to do, they just want to play the football all around Ronaldo, unlike the way it was at Manchester United.About the age of Aboubakar, he's not the first to be signed at the same age, other examples are, Edison Cavani, Odion Igalo and Cristiano Ronaldo.",

I used to think that he was comfortable playing in  crystal palace because of the respect they have for him there and the name he has built for himself there as well. He is in his 30's and now could be a great chance to try out his talen in another big team instead of just wanting to play to retirement in crystal palace.  Take Casimero for instance.I have watched  Zaha play, and seen his movement on the ball, He still has something to offer any team that signs him.",

Zaha is the kind of player that loves to be the pointed man or the main man in team. At Crystal palace he just drives the ball and at 30 I don’t see him do much of that. A move to a big team might need him to settle in a little bit and at this age Zaha doesn’t has that time. He missed a great opportunity when his move to Arsenal didn’t go through.It’s quite different comparing him to Casemiro. Casemiro was played for Real Madrid for almost all his life, winning titles most importantly 5 UCL with this experience he can settle into any team in the world. Not withstanding that they both play a different role.",
