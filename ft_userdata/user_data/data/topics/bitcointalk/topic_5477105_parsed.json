That's why as a slot player you must limit the time spent, gambling, as the house edge could be a 2% winning possibility for the player. So, no need to feel bad about losing too much in the slot, or the complications involved in playing slot games. In the slot, the terminology, enjoy gambling erupts. Because if you are the type who doesn't enjoy playing slot, you'll go home very sad, due to multiple losses. I experience this a lot and battle it with playing smaller amounts. The casino can try to change my strategy by offering me wins, so that I'll wager more amount. That's where we slot players test the mansion of confidence in us, whether it's well built or just vulnerable and can be swept away by the tricks of the casino. Additionally, don't switch from one slot machine to another. Try to understand a specific slot machine or slot game. Unless you know the house edge placed on a slot game by the casino, don't place too many bets on that machine or game. Most house edge is half of one percent, you can read or research on how housing edge can be calculated. It'll help you have a clearer view of what amount to expect from the casino and how much they'll make off every single bet you stake on the slot machine. I think with this information, getting the house edge right, you won't bother about the complex nature of slot games and just enjoy the fun.

Recently, there was a thread regarding slots, and quite a few other users felt that they weren't worth it. Personally, I agree with what you've stated, and I believe it's due to the nature of the game that doesn't leave you with much wiggle room. Certainly, that's in favor of the casinos and not the user, as you're not able to choose your odds nor do you have any options.Slots are an old-fashioned game that was extremely popular in physical casinos. Their philosophy is pretty straightforward; you just pull down the lever (or click a button) and that's it. Personally, I don't think they're worth it, and I avoid them like a plague.",

Why bother to think too much, when we can just enjoy the entertainment these gambling games gives.  There are explanation about volatility, and RTP of slots and they seems not hard to understand.  Just don't mixed it with the terms of other games and obviously we will get confused.These features is purposely implemented to give players a different kind of gambling experience.  but if you look at it, it is the same as dice but with just an automatic adjustement of odds to win thus slots triggering different multiplier wins, unlike dice that have a linear odd result which can be adjusted manually.",

Sometimes you need some level of skill to play slot game and that is why the house have a high impact and interest in the game unlike dice where all that is needed is just to roll the dice and hit the lucky number to make a winning.",

      "body": "I think it isn’t a correct comparison since both types of gambling games compared are independent of each other. Of course, comparing two different games and accordingly deciding which game to prefer is an important thing for a gambler but I think it isn’t possible to reach a conclusion with such a comparison.Gambling games come in many different varieties and each game has its own way of playing. Depending on this playing style, the effect of the luck factor, probability of winning and risk rate vary in each game. So, each game has some advantages and disadvantages.For example, to continue with the current comparison as stated in slot games it isn’t clear what rate of profit will be obtained in the next spin but it also has advantages such as high winning potential and free spins. On the other hand, in the dice rolling game it is known how much profit can be obtained compared to the bet amount in case of a possible win but the profit rate doesn’t increase without increasing the risk rate.",

      "body": "And that's one of the reasons why more gamblers like slot games. Finding the unknown multi-win and the unpredictability of what will come out, although I don't really believe that. Even in Keno, I don't think there's such a thing as RNG (random number generator) because if that is the case then we could've seen a lot of winners of those 10 number picks. Slots may have different images but most of them have the same type of system. Then, they must also change how the multi-win will come out. There are only a few slots that I hate the most but the others that I've tried are all good when it comes to RTP. Yes, sometimes they don't give back for a long time but that is because they will give out a high multi-win. I witnessed that a lot of times so those who have deep pockets will certainly have a better chance to win than those who will just try once or twice.",

I think dice are also manipulated by the casino somehow. While I was reading about using Dice rolls to create a private key, they're cases where people could predict what the outcome of a die would be, maybe the fault could be from the manufacturers; unfair die. Somehow the casino can manipulate it, but people would argue it's not possible. However, the dice games are easier to win compared to slot games. But the required skills aren't going to give us more wins compared to the number of times we'd lose money playing slots. Players will always find it difficult to enjoy slot games unless they join a comp club. Then it'll be easier for them to benefit too much while playing slot. Slot games are better played offline, in casinos, where the player would be rewarded per points and given free hotel rooms, food or even show tickets. As for online players they just have to enjoy the game win or lose.",

Depends on each player, I myself as a slot player always look into RTP and Volatility of the slot before I played the game. It is important thing to know (at least for myself) because it is related to which game is the best to play based on the RTP and volatility. Even though it is not a guarantee that it will give a better result but at least playing games with higher RTP is better if I started with small amount and lower RTP + high-extreme volatility is good to be played when I have more funds to play or when I want to hunt big multiplier. It was complicated to understand when I knew about it for the 1st time, but experiences and learn (by reading) make it simple now.",
