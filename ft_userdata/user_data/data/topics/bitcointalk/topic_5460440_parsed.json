The Best Crypto Copy Trading Platform - Tools, Tips and How To Start in Just MINUTES...You've probably heard of copy trading before, maybe even gave it a shot on a smaller platform. Yet nothing compares to the sheer scale of Binance, delivering an experience that feels completely fresh.Over the years, copy trading has been on the rise - it's obvious why people want to emulate the techniques of the best traders possible. With this strategy, you can reap the rewards of proven tactics while ditching the stress.Now, thanks to Binance's new Copy Trading platform, you can track and mimic the top traders on the globe's largest exchange platform, offering a vastly different perspective from previous, smaller scale encounters with copy trading.WHY IS BINANCE'S COPY TRADING SO UNIQUE?Firstly, the traders you want to copy, the top-notch ones, they're all on Binance. The pro traders who crunch crypto all day, every day - chances are they're doing it on Binance.The second massive factor for the pros is the unrivalled liquidity Binance provides. Its popularity results in high trading volumes, making transactions faster and more efficient. Many people don't know Binance's sheer size - they're currently reporting daily trading volumes around $6 billion - Â its closest competitor, Coinbase, is doing 10% of that.Liquidity is key, particularly when you're running automated trades like a trading bot, or copy trading.

Keeping 90% is much better than I've seen elsewhere!A hot tip when selecting who to copy - click on the username from the lead traders' list. This will open their profile, from which you can view their 7, 30, and 90-day history. Make sure their record is consistently profitable in each time frame before committing.OR LET THE MASSES FOLLOW YOU...Fancy yourself a market guru? Prove it!
