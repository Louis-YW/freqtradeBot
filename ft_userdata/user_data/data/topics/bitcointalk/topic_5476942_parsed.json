China had been among the countries that had been trying to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine include the one between Israel and the Palestine which is a good move to create peace in the world. If now China decides to invade Taiwan, it could be a big blow to the Chinese economy and I don't think she is ready to create enemity among other nations that had be interceding for peace.",

China is a force to be reckoned with, militarily speaking They have huge and powerful military influences and they have the second to the highest gdp among all countries does this mean they can easily invade Taiwan? The answer is no Taiwan might appear small and weaker out of the two but Taiwan’s geographical location and military power makes it harder for China to ensure a win If this war ever broke out it will be massive and extremely destructive for both countries China’s economy is gradually deteriorating because of many factors their economy is expected to decline in the following years which will make it risky for them to start a war",

Today, China is working hard to expand its soft power globally through economic aid, cooperation and education, as well as presenting itself as a peaceful country and a generous friend to every nation. However, its potential incursion into Taiwan could damage China's reputation and disrupt its economic and political relations with other countries. Hopefully there is no current or future war between the two sides.",

However, its potential incursion into Taiwan could damage China's reputation and disrupt its economic and political relations with other countries. Hopefully there is no current or future war between the two sides.I have talked but this topic with someone who is actually from Taiwan, he explained to me that China would like to annex Taiwan for political and historical reasons, rather than economical reasons. It seems that in the Chinese culture the true leader of the nation (formerly the emperor) would be only considered to have the supreme mandate given to him from heaven if he had political authority over all provinces of China, including Taiwan. So historically, however the president of China is, he cannot forfeit Taiwan or give up on apparent efforts to reconquer it, because it would translate into serious damages to his reputation and power. As far as I understand, the president of China who manages to successfully take Taiwan back would be remember for the rest of history as the actual leader who had the mandate given from heaven.",

      "body": "I wish that the news was false about the rumors of war with China invading and taking Taiwan as their territory. There's a long history with these two countries while China doesn't consider them as an independent country but more of their territories. They can claim whatever they think to a country that's known to many.While it is an allied of the US, there goes the handshaking of Biden and Xi which signifies that they're now having some deals and agreements that can also stop this potential invasion of China. The problem is, if China doesn't like the movement of the other parties, they might just do on their own and just bully the allies of it. And also the neighboring countries might be in trouble and that's why they're also needing some help from its alliances knownly Russia. But if all of these can be done in talks, hopefully all of them will result with a peace talk and just work on their economic agreements and deals.",

So I doubt that it'll ever degenerate to China, fully invading Taiwan, or a full blown war, because the two countries have been coexisting with each other in hostility as far as I can remember. Besides China, must have learned a very big lesson from the Russian, invasion of Ukraine, everybody thought that it'll be a walk in the park for Russia, but reverse is the case today, because Ukraine, has refused to back down. So China, must understand that they can not just walk into Taiwan, and invade them easily, because of Taiwan's strong ally which is the US.",
