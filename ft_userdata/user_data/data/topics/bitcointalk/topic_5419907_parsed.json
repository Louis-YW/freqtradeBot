      "body": "Every time they want to pump a bunch of shitcoins they say that it is \"golden time for 'crypto' adoption\" like in 2017 when the ICO scam was very popular. The thing is apart from bitcoin, nothing else has any real adoption in the outside world. All we see outside of bitcoin world is a gambling market where people make bets on crypto prices.The fact that your question is all around exchanges is a good indication of what I said.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM2) What could be the solution for Exchanges that they can really build trust among Crypto InvestorsThe only way I see is if they find a way to guarantee fund security. Something that could be enforceable by law, not just empty promises. So that if they got hacked or tried to run away, the law enforcement could catch them and force them to pay the users back.Realistically that is never going to happen.Quote3) Is this the time when people start to realize that p2p exchanges and trades are much more secure in terms of security of fundsDecentralized exchanges have their advantages but also they have disadvantages. For example they are usually less convenient to use and are slightly slower with lower liquidity. Sometimes they don't have certain coins listed (like stablecoins such as Tether that last time I checked wasn't included in Bisq).Quote4) Do you believe the crypto Market Evolve in future even if things like this keeps happening Crypto market will only evolve when the developers start innovating instead of creating endless number of useless coins and tokens.Quote5) What other options do users have as these big exchanges getting closed, and building something will take years of development and trust among users..DEX like Bisq!Quote6) Does Govt should Intervene and Make sure Exchanges does comply with Enough Liquidity..Yes, specially since they are intervening when it comes to KYC and invasion of users' privacy. They should at least provide something useful for the users too. But that too won't happen...Quote7) Does these tokenization be scrutinized before listing and all real information's (regarding owners)  should be made public, so future action can be takenYou can't take any actions against the shittoken scammer even if you have all their information. Bottom line is that they created a useless token and users bought it out of their own free will before they got dumped on.",

      "body": "The main problems (especially recently - like ftt but perhaps others too) have stemmed more from fud created by centralised exchanges. It's also a lack of communication between exchanges, big centralised entities that don't talk are probably the worst at trying to innovate and keep the economy stable - but it's likely exchanges make more money off volatility than they do off stability. I'd envisage they made a lot from funding rates last night and will continue too until volatility settles again. 3. Dex P2p is a lot more secure and often means you don't have to let your funds go until the other party has started to send theirs (especially when it's escrowed). It's generally been cheaper for withdrawals most of the time too as you can set your own transaction fees.4. They'll have to and probably keep doing but there'll always be problems when relying on a centralised authority (savings/retail banks got a bit too comfortable before they stopped being used as much).6. Governments don't intervene because the people expected to don't: normally exchanges. Exchanges could resolve a lot of problems between themselves, they just don't communicate well. And which government would you expect to devote time to this too? There's enough that don't comply with a lot of international assemblies already, is one government going to help with the economies of others for nothing? Governments are after long term revenue over short term profits, they're probably not going to want to do much here unless it allows them to do that (it could if it means they'll have trained workers to do it though).7. I think knowing who's releasing a token is quite important. If the token has good utility then surely putting a public identifier (even an address) behind it is going to mean you can prove you were the owner and attract others to your newer projects/tokens.",

      "body": "Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM1)Now looking at a bigger picture these issues does happen mostly on centralized exchanges.Problems often occur with new crypto exchanges, most of them don't care about the types of coins they list, for that many exchanges end up with bad reputations, but the problem doesn't happen with the reputed exchanges, they can figure out which ones are the best and which are the bad types of coins traded on their exchanges.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM2) What could be the solution for Exchanges that they can really build trust among Crypto InvestorsMaybe, investors are tired of some meme coins and types of coins that are not worth it, to gain investors' trust I think every exchange needs to consider the best and good value coins so that investors believe the coins can really be trusted by theminvestors.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM3) Is this the time when people start to realize that p2p exchanges and trades are much more secure in terms of security of fundsNot all countries carry out p2p trading methods, the convenience of trading depends on the exchange and country.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM4) Do you believe the crypto Market Evolve in future even if things like this keeps happening Of course, I really believe, the crypto market has good developments and opportunities in the eyes of the public in the future.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM5) What other options do users have as these big exchanges getting closed, and building something will take years of development and trust among users..Do not understand.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM6) Does Govt should Intervene and Make sure Exchanges does comply with Enough Liquidity..There are certain places where the government interferes and interferes in the Liquidity policy of the exchange, they have already done so, they can only verify the source of the tax, good crypto assets, but they can't control the users trading on the exchange.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on November 08, 2022, 07:38:49 AM7) Does these tokenization be scrutinized before listing and all real information's (regarding owners)  should be made public, so future action can be takenYes, that's for sure, the proof is that you can find the type of token after being traded on the exchange, if the token is not responsible and their development will delete the token.Example: Luna.",

It is for their good that the problems that may arise in the future can be reduced or they will not encounter those problems. Thus, they can choose the exchange they are looking for and avoid other problems.Quote1)Now looking at a bigger picture these issues does happen mostly on centralized exchanges.It may be true that it happens in most centralized exchanges, but there are still centralized exchanges that can provide good service to crypto users or they can use a non-centralized exchange.Quote2) What could be the solution for Exchanges that they can really build trust among Crypto InvestorsAlways managing their exchange from all things that can cause user inconvenience is something to pay attention to, even small things like how long it takes for their coins to go into their wallet or other processes.Quote3) Is this the time when people start to realize that p2p exchanges and trades are much more secure in terms of security of fundsI guess it will depend on the individual as I still see a lot of people still using centralized exchanges and they can benefit from that.Quote4) Do you believe the crypto Market Evolve in future even if things like this keeps happening The crypto market will develop better in the future and only those exchanges working hard to provide good service can grow bigger and better than now.Quote5) What other options do users have as these big exchanges getting closed, and building something will take years of development and trust among users..They can find another exchange, be it centralized or decentralized and start sending their coins there to start trading. That means these exchanges need to be able to ensure that no serious problems occur on their exchanges.Quote6) Does Govt should Intervene and Make sure Exchanges does comply with Enough Liquidity..It seems that the government has intervened in the exchanges as it implemented some regulations to monitor each exchange's progress in its country.Quote7) Does these tokenization be scrutinized before listing and all real information's (regarding owners)  should be made public, so future action can be takenThe exchange needs to check for tokenization to make sure the project is not a scam project that can trick its users into losing their money because it concerns the reputation of the exchange itself.",
