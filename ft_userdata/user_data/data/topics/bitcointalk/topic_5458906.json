  "content": "WTF is winning in crypto?Most think it's about making money but the more important metric is keeping the money you make.Hitting 100x in a bull run is possible but most lose it all!So how do you keep it? By not being a complete wombat with your risk. Time and time again I see people risking 30%+ of their capital on a single sh*tcoin  This is a bad move.Almost every crypto you invest in could dump to zero quickly. The odds are less likely the bigger the project gets, but it’s not impossible, look at $LUNA. The smaller a project, the higher the chances it can rug or crash to zero.So, you need to cap the percentage of your portfolio you risk on any one project based on the risk. This is how I do it. source Gambling ZoneMine is simple, I risk 0.1%-3% of my capital on high-risk projects, the dodgier the project, the less the risk. This is the gambling zone. You might hit a 1000x return here or you might get rugged, who knows I appreciate that 1% is not worth investing if you only have a $200 portfolio. In that case, the best solution is to keep working and put more money aside so you can have a proper portfolio.Golden ZoneI risk 3.1%-8% on medium to low-risk projects. This is where most of the money is. Here you can land a 200x return so extra risk is justified. Obviously, not every project in the golden zone has 200x potential many of them are higher caps and will struggle to do a 20x, let alone 200x, but that is still a great return!But there will be a handful of medium to low-risk projects that make absurd returns like SOL, AXS and a few others did in 2021!Safe-ish ZoneVery few projects can be considered safe, the main two are obviously BTC and ETH which is as close as you can get to safe in crypto. The rest are safe-ish, these are projects like $ARB and $BNB.Safe-ish projects generally won’t give you those insane 200x returns because the caps are far too high.But the likelihood of them going to zero is very low so they are much safer.Capital AllocationAs a general rule of thumb, it's okay to risk less than what the zone indicates but never more. Meaning that with a crypto like ARB, which belongs firmly in the safe-ish zone, it's fine to risk less than 8%, but never more than 20%.The upper limit of the zone is a firm max, and the lower limit is a loose minimum.Now, some of you might be thinking, \"WTF? 6% of my capital is like $60\"...If You Have A Tiny PortfolioA lot of knob wombats will tell you to gamble it on shitcoins in the hope of hitting a 1000x but that is complete nonsense. You may as well play roulette because it has better odds than gambling at the shitcoin casino.If you have only a few thousand or less the best option is to invest in low-medium risk projects in the golden and safe-ish zones and keep working a real job to slowly and safely build a portfolio. Once you have more money you can start messing about in the gambling zone.The point is, you do not want to up your risk a whole lot more to try and make money faster. Risk management is key to long-term success.How To Decide A Cryptos Risk Level?I feel like most of you have a good idea of what's low, medium and high risk but if not let me know and I will do a thread on this too!",

As informative as it is, it didn't tell us the story of how you lost before you won, but only showed perhaps what you read to make you understand better. I don't know if I could go through a loss of my investment in crypto up to 2 times and still continue to do so in this kind of economy.I do admire you persistence and consistency which led to your win.",

Well, reading through actually revealed a lot of useful information. I have heard from many people how they made money investing in ICO and I have equally heard some say they lost a lot to ICO. Since I did not see any mention of ICO in the post, I am guessing you are recommending projects that have made it to the market.",

Nai impatient caused im loss. Has im see sae things are not working to di way im want am, im for moved dem out and invested dem in bitcoin. As @Truthlovecoins tok am, di whole thread sef e dey won kind but I tried understand am. 4 di way I take understand am, bi like sae im loss from two platforms o. One for investment and di Oda for gambling. 4 investment, though I know know for altcoins/shitcoins bout bitcoin before you invest, u go understand di market, starting from di bear to the bull so that u no go loss like day but if miscalculate and invest anyhow my brother u go loss well but for even as dat if u understand di market u go still regain ur loss and that is how investment work.For di gambling side of the tori. I will blame u for losing all. When u invest 0.1% - 3 in the capital project, and you loss it, that should not pain u because that amount is very small to start a reasonable project that carry good portfolio, you would have invested about 40% so that when u loss 5%, u can still use di remaining percentage to upgrade the project.",
