If your token isn't on BSC, ETH, Tron and few other popular projects you are out of luck using Trust wallet, no room for new Chain/Network unless the team add them, this sucks..",

Now, I no longer use trustwallet on my phone so I cant guide you, but I remember exactly I used to use trustwallet to add new tokens. But if you often use your computer to work, then metamask is a better choice as it has both browser and mobile versions. As FatFork said, you should edit the title accordingly.",

I only heard that if you will be able to adding the new network when you will be create a new wallet. I meant when you are creating a new wallet and trust wallet will give you the list of chains that already supported by it. I never heard that if trust wallet is having a manual feature to add the blockchain like what already available in metamask. IMO metamask is the most friendly wallet for any blockchain for now.",

      "body": "They're doing that to reduce against scam coins listed on their wallet, I wouldn't call it sucks, but if your project are genuine and will become big, your coins and network will be listed by them. So you need to prove if your project isn't scam first.Quote from: Tony116 on October 31, 2022, 09:39:54 AMYou are wrong, trustwallet has same feature as metamask, you can also add new network or new token right on trustwallet wallet.If you're don't know what you're talking about, it's better to shut your mouth than spreading false information. It's impossible to add other network, Trust Wallet only serve some network they've list and you're can only add new token with that's network, you're not allowed to add new network. If you don't believe, install Trust Wallet and try it yourself.",
