  "content": "Pizzas for bitcoin?Quote from: laszlo on May 18, 2010, 12:35:20 AMI'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. Â I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. Â You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. Â I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.Thanks,LaszloHe did a first or only trade with jercos on 22 May 2010.Quote from: laszlo on May 22, 2010, 07:17:26 PMI just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.Pictures: http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/Thanks jercos!Archived pictures: https://web.archive.org/web/20121202201145/http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/Transaction: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48dlazslo's post about that address.He let the offer opened Quote from: laszlo on June 12, 2010, 08:14:44 PMThis is an open offer by the way.. I will trade 10,000 BTC for 2 of these pizzas any time as long as I have the funds (I usually have plenty). Â If anyone is interested please let me know. Â The exchange is favorable for anyone who does it because the 2 pizzas are only about 25 dollars total, maybe 30 if you give the guy a nice tip. Â If you get me the upgraded extra large ones or something, I can throw in some more bitcoins, just let me know and we'll work something out.My 1 year old daughter really enjoys pizza too! Â She just smears it all over her face if you give her a whole slice, but she does eventually manage to get most of it in her mouth (minus a few loose toppings of course).He ended his offer on 4 August 2010Quote from: laszlo on June 04, 2010, 05:51:05 PMWell I didn't expect this to be so popular but I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore Â  Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already but I'm kind of holding off on doing any more of these for now.Looks like he traded more than 10,000 BTC for more than two pizzas. I don't find any post of laszlo on bitcoin talk that how many pizzas he bought with how many bitcoins before the offer closure.Jameson Lopp tweeted. That offer ended up with 8 pizzas for 40,000 BTC.Quote from: https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1660632690209456134On this day 13 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged 10,000 BTC in return for 2 Papa John's pizzas. But the story didn't end there!Turns out that Laszlo REALLY LOVES PIZZA. He kept his offer open for some time and eventually ended up purchasing 8 pizzas for a total of 40,000 BTC.Quote from: https://twitter.com/lopp/status/152835756573373644812 years ago today, Laszlo Hanyecz had tens of thousands of bitcoin he had mined just burning a hole in his pocket. He also had a hankering for pizza. The rest... was history.Fun fact: he kept his pizza offer open for a while and in total purchased 8 pizzas for 40,000 BTC.Quote from: https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1009782892728389632Many Bitcoin users are aware that Laszlo Hanyecz bought 2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 BTC in 2010. What's less known is that he kept his pizza offer open and in total purchased 8 pizzas for 40,000 BTC.Anyone can confirm this information please.Anyone from 100 frequent members in 2010 can make confirmations, please.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=109.msg5141191#msg51411913-4 years ago there were less than 100 people frequenting this forum, and I was pretty happy to trade 10,000 coins for pizza.",

Do you believe I should reply to such a crybaby? They cannot accept their mistake and shut out others' mouth who doesn't support them. The fact I shared is based on common sense. Laszlo indeed bought more than two pizzas. But that doesn't mean he spent 40K Bitcoins to buy eight pizzas. He never stated that anywhere in the world. So, I am wondering where those kids collected this information. What is the source? I don't want a reference like \"Trust me, bro\". Why are those kids on the internet and a public forum if they cannot take a simple suggestion? Who gave them internet access at twelve years? I did not want to reply to him. Since you noticed and quoted me as well. I decided to talk to you about this so that kid doesn't get angry again. I would say he successfully spread the false claim and reached his goal. His main goal was to get something, and he received one from you. You never forget to feed those hungry Kids! Let me begin my response like this:I don't mind giving merits if a member makes some good points, even if I might not agree with the member or even understand exactly what the points might be, and even if later it is shown that the member might not be adequately backing up what they say.There seems to be some directionally correct evidence for what UchihaSarada had posted in the above OP, even if in the end, UchihaSarada might not have backed up everything that he said very well (and?Â  Does the backing up need to be perfect?... sure you also have a right to criticize him for not backing up his points well enough and also making whatever points that you had already made).. but there were a few others in this thread that did some additional backing up some of the points that were made in the OP (even if all of the points might not have been exactly correct or substainable (and maybe inferences have been made too).. and we do not even know if the points have been disproven, either).You are asking me what I thing, and to me it seems that you (John Abraham) seem to have strong feelings about UchihaSarada failure to adequately back up his framing of history on the topic of whether Lazlo might have had several other times in which he bought pizzas with large quantities of bitcoin.. including possibly 4 times and such as 10k BTC each time. Â Seems a bit much to actually spend 40k btc on 8 pizzas, but it is not totally out of the realm of reasonableness .. even if it might end up NOT being technically correct and even if you, JA, label UchihaSarada as disingenuine, fishing for merits and/or purposefully spreading misinformation (which are all valid criticisms.. even if you might be wrong in your criticisms, too).. which seems a bit much of a claim, too.. On a personal level, I hardly give too many shits if the exactness of the substance of what was asserted by UchihaSarada is true or not (but I was asked my opinion), and from my perspective, it does not seem to rise to the level of disingenuineness (from the OP), even if there seems to have had been sloppiness in some of the research.. but was anyone killed? Â except UchihaSarada might have (perhaps, arguably)Â  received some undeserved merits.. perhaps? perhaps? Â I don't even know.. I don't feel like I gave any undeserved merit to UchihaSarada in this thread or anywhere else, merely because it is possible that UchihaSarada might have not done very good research in his opening post. Â The point that I was attempting to make about this \"escalating quickly\" relates to the post that I had cited in the other thread whan I posted the \"this escalated quickly meme), and my labelling the matter as \"escalating quickly\" does seem to relate to what I had seen as a lot of emotionalism in responses that likely does not deserve so much emotionalism.. which seems that both sides have been getting emotional about the motives of the other member on the other side of the \"debate\"... Surely members can disagree on matters, and sometimes we end up getting pissed off at each other... and sometimes we make up later and sometimes we don't.. I claim that I don't tend to hold grudges, but sure there are some members who are a wee bit irritating to me too.. so irritation can flow in either direction.. even though some members seem to be very well liked by almost everyone. Dolly Parton holds that title in main stream media.. Through my years in the forum, I have had some battles with some members, and later it seems that we get along well these days, and surely there are some members who really seem to dislike me too.. so there's only so much that can be done about some of the differences in perspectives and personalities, and sometimes members rub each other the wrong way... what can we do about those kinds of personal variances?Sure I also don't have any problems with some exaggerations or even purposeful emotions coming through posts that do not appear to rise to the level of losing one's cool... so if any member seems to really lose their cool and to get overly emotional in their posts (or their responses), then they are likely losing points in any argument that they might be trying to make.. but sometimes the emotions will cause them to not give any shits.. and just want to vent their frustration, Â which surely seems a losing approach to any debate, whether on the interwebs or even live attempts at debate.. don't lose your cool, but instead get your opponent to lose his/her cool. .. even though sometimes emotions can win on certain points on the interwebs (but not too frequently.. it's a kind of exception to the rule.. of not losing your cool in regards to random peeps on the interwebs). Â  And, hey I don't even claim to be Mr./Ms. detached from emotions, and surely I throw some emotions around once in a while, and sometimes I even have been known to go overboard a wee bit too much in whatever I say, how much I say and even my tone (lack of humbleness, and even arrogance)... including even irritating myself, from time to time.Many of us should attempt to not lose our emotions on the interwebs, even if we might find some other members to be irritating, but in the end, if you want to lose your emotions, then go ahead.. it's a free country, the last time I checked... wait.On your other point about whether to respond, surely sometimes there can be advantages in terms of not responding, especially if you already know that you are devolving into emotional posts.. and surely it is up to you, whether to respond or not.Frequently, I tend to respond when I feel that I have been directly attacked (or referenced), unless I feel that I had already sufficiently/adequately addressed whatever point is trying to involve me, or I might refrain from responding if it appears better if I don't say anything.. so of course, there is discretion that each of us has in terms of whether we should respond or not.I believe that most of the times when I choose to respond, I try to not take it personal (or to make my response personal.. even though you never know, I might choose to throw in a few zingers for funzies, from time to time, too.. so there is a kind of balancing and attempt to figure out how important the topic might be to me). Â There is a lot of variations in choosing to respond and how to respond.. and frequently it can be difficult to figure out how to leave emotion out or whether it should be left out, which the rule of thumb would be to leave it out and only strategically employ it...and if you strategically employ it wrong, then sucks to be you... members sometimes will end up getting themselves banned, suspended or red tagged by other members because they are unable to stop their battles with other members... or maybe sometimes they just end up forcing themselves into a kind of rage quit. Â those are choices.. and surely sometimes not easy to figure out when to stop.",

Let's forget about the merit thing. I know you have seen tons of them in your forum journey. I hate when people create a separate thread to discuss something they are not sure about Bitcoin-related history. I don't rely on some specific Twattar influencer or public figure to back my claims. Whenever people are on the internet, if they find something interesting, they can search for more details on the internet. Guess there is no information about what they are searching for, which means they are looking for something that does not exist and did not happen. It seems Lazslo bought more than two pizzas But look at the title of this topic. It has a question mark, indeed. But, The title is misleading or somewhat clickbait thing. Do you like clickbait titles or thumbnails? QuoteYou are asking me what I thing, and to me it seems that you (John Abraham) seem to have strong feelings about UchihaSarada failure to adequately back up his framing of history on the topic of whether Lazlo might have had several other times in which he bought pizzas with large quantities of bitcoin.. including possibly 4 times and such as 10k BTC each time.

I often see people create threads to discuss something that should not be discussed or isn't worth discussing. His topic title indicates Laszlo exactly bought Eight pizzas for 40K Bitcoins, and this claim doesn't have any reference. For reference, he used three tweets from the same unnamed Twitter handle. A single person cannot claim such a thing without proper evidence. I am concerned because this will change the history of Bitcoin. I believe we are still in the early days, and we should defend against any kind of miss information. I know you know about metamorphosis and how it works. This Bitcointalk thread will be used as a reference to validate the claim that Laszlo bought Eight pizzas for 40K Bitcoins.

Â those are choices.. and surely sometimes not easy to figure out when to stop. Look at the way he responded to me in another thread. I don't think I've said anything bad. People who cannot take criticism should not be in the public forum. People could have a different opinion than yours. If you have a point, talk to them and defend yourself with your point. But, some people choose not to show their point and like shit. They start making personal attacks and being aggressive toward others who criticize them. I don't think I've been in battle in my forum life. I tend to ignore when I see trolls and users talking pointless, and I don't see any reason to respond. No matter your point, you won't get the answer to your point. Getting pissed off at each other is a common thing. But, when we talk to each other and sort out things, there is no problem. You cannot expect calmness from a twelve-year-old kid. Yeah, angry people who give death threads and dox others will get banned. About the red tag, I don't think forum members should tag others based on the way they talk. The feedback system was introduced for trading-related use. But we still use it for other purposes as well. Sometimes people tag each other for their personal matter, which makes it pointless. Whoever use it for their own favour should not be on the DT network.",

Quote from: John Abraham on May 26, 2023, 06:56:21 AMLaszlo indeed bought more than two pizzas.Quote from: John Abraham on May 25, 2023, 03:32:07 AMDon't come to a conclusion based on a single Twitter handleYou did not read and quickly say my topic is a conclusion.Quote from: John Abraham on May 26, 2023, 06:56:21 AMI would say he successfully spread the false claim and reached his goal.False claim, but what claim is it?Quote from: John Abraham on January 20, 1970, 12:07:37 PMBut look at the title of this topic. It has a question mark, indeed. But, The title is misleading or somewhat clickbait thing. Do you like clickbait titles or thumbnails? A question turns to be a conclusion in your view. What?You only have conclusion, claim with this topic but I only wanted to get help to verify information from those tweets and lazlo's posts.I will never reply to you because you are not frankly with your posts.Thank you JayJuanGee. Your post makes sense.I de-escalate it and if anyone can confirm those trades, I much appreciate it.The pizza transaction: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48dSome big transactions after that, until the announcement to close the pizza offer.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/33009032b3d69a2a29f8bdbbfa6848616989058d057bf60f075b6f8ca4fc1fdahttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/fcb670aeda87ccef4d16f8fc818051a60cee9d47dd83e2787b62140398b4cb2fhttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/df2f96a440bac38e7e408bab50636bad898e71d2707bc95d950f4a6baeabea3ehttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/c98546d415d502e4f9d9d3df3e6a9e3f5183ba5cd6416539e052749ec35dc2fchttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/77036fa2ac75212be1ce93e8e1008d5cb2bcbb51aa560a5fe29c9c1423bbd00ehttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/8d41a2590899ba287052422ed69f98c94baf3ee2af2ddd10a60d058665abaaa6https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/7aaa37a2775a1bc61841248ec559a210d18717cb2cd12899e40606b6c88e13c1https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/c2f8553c1fbe7669a7afcf3da2158fa986f6614b494690be4fdf5517c6772e33https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/9c5c5f2a00041f601f1828efba71415722279116ad3e8526f67ac9b5c3714465After that, I don't see big transactions and it matches with laszlo's post that he had to spend less bitcoins when he got less from mining.Those transactions could be for buying things or only moving coins to another wallet, address.",

Â You seem to be saying that you don't know anything about the transactions except that you believe that they were transactions of bitcoin that Lazlo had somehow spent after receiving those transactions into a wallet that he admitted that he controlled (and presumably from mining).However, personally, I think that it would be better for you, UchihaSarada, to describe whatever information that you believe might exist regarding any of the transactions that you pointed out (if yo say that you don't know anything more about any of the transactions, except for what you already described in that they were coming from a certain wallet that Lazlo had at one time proclaimed to own), then surely maybe you have very little information in regards to each of the transactions.. but there might be some members who at least would be able to build upon the transactional information that you presented.. to the extent that other members are interested in the topic or interested in following through with your \"assignment\" of work in which you may or may not have had done enough of the work yourself prior to presenting the transactional information to others in which you would like more work to do or for them to use tools (or information) at their disposal that you may or may not have (or know how to use/employ).Don't get me wrong.. I am not even sure if you may well not have had already done as much work (and looking) into the source/recipients of the bitcoin transactions as you are reasonably able to accomplish... even though it seems to me that many times it is much better for members to error on the side of doing more research and work into matters than they might otherwise want to do, merely because they raised the topic, otherwise they end up getting accused of trolling/fishing for merits, as you have been accused of (even though you have already likely done enough work to show that you are not guilty of the same level of accusations that you have been accused of, but you are likely not completely innocent either.. even though you are surely continuing to look into the matter (a topic that you have described as your being interested in knowing more about - and perhaps even that you might have backed off of your initial claims to some extent, which seems to be a good thing to modify your claims, if it ends up that the available information is not really supporting your initial claims as much as you had initially speculated).",

If they are still here and can confirm it, it is good.

Massive regret.Regardless of whether you're right or wrong on the numbers, unless I'd kept a much bigger stash of bitcoin after buying those pies (and held on at least until the price was $50k) I'd be having nightmares to this very day.Â  But from what I've read, Laszlo doesn't have any regrets, and to be fair even if he did miss out on some serious profit, he did become quite famous.Â  A lot of people would pay a much higher price for a lesser amount of fame than Laszlo got--he's been mentioned in books and his name is inextricably linked to the bitcoin-pizza connection that has been commemorated with things like Ballet wallets and probably a lot of other collectibles.Whether it was two or eight pizzas doesn't make a damn bit of difference as far as I'm concerned, and there's no controversy anyway as the community is helpfully chiming in on.Â  Man, I love this forum.Â  Too bad Laszlo isn't active anymore.",

If I was lazslo, I would feel regret or not feel regret about those pizza deals.I would feel massive regret if I sold all my coins for those pizzas and I did not own any coin after those deals. Like if I only have 10,000 BTC or 40,000 BTC and sold them all for pizzas. Then I only got empty wallet after those deals, I would feel those deals are my big mistake and regret a lot years later when BTC has very good parabolic price growth.I would not feel regret if after those deals I still have coins which can help me richer when BTC made its all time high in 2013, 2017 and 2021. No regret if with only 100 BTC or 1000 BTC after those pizza deals, I still was able to be millionaire or billionaire.",
