There’s no point on depending your life on a volatility asset while you can have a stable source of fund to support your life through normal jobs. Don’t make your life miserable just to ride to the trend of Bitcoin. Just invest what you can afford to lose and focus to your real life. Don’t use Bitcoin to escape from your reality because Bitcoin can’t save your financial freedom if you don’t any initial capital to begin with.Of course,  sir you are right and your view are not different from mind may be in the use of words! but the message is the same.I try as much as possible to include all aspect but in the area of entire cryptocurrrncies which encompasses all other blockchain based tokens/coins. And one can build a normal job through Bitcoin it all depends on the sacrifice one is willing to pay to attained that position. One of the way to measure stability in life is having a steady flow of income and having the resource to push through life expectancy, i have seen individual building a life round Bitcoin but that doesn't mean their dont invest in other sectors like real estate there is need for diversification, but that does not eludes the fact that Bitcoin is an hedge above inflation.",

Everyone has the right to think as he pleases. For some, bitcoin is money, someone is ready to invest in it, and someone is not ready to wait a lifetime. I prefer a quiet investment, without fanaticism, and without denying my own work, from which I allocate some interest to invest in bitcoin. Again, I am not rejecting the study of bitcoin, but I am not suggesting that it be celebrated as the center of the universe on which my entire life may depend.Do you want to refute it?",

Not all have btc and how could we can depend on something that we arent sure of in the future. You ought to mean was we can not stay hungry or losses money for living if we have bitcoin? If this is right, then aboslutely wrong cause bitcoin is a technology and still evolves in somehow but we cant assume it only go yp in value, likely it could be some sort of investment like stock that go up and down so still its not a thing that can save us from poverty or guaranteed us to be rich alone.",

Bitcoin is indeed decentralized, but that doesn't have anything to do with whether you can depend your life on it or not. Furthermore, Bitcoin's independence from third parties doesn't in any way guarantee anybody that he/she can depend on it.Bitcoin is referred to as decentralized because it doesn't have a central authority that decides or operates or has control over the network. It's not decentralized because \"you can depend your life on\" it. That statement doesn't seem to make any sense.",

Human life cannot be dependent on Bitcoin because it is not something necessary for human life - a living being depends on air, water and food to survive. Bitcoin is decentralized, but in order to exist it needs electricity and the Internet, and of course devices that will verify transactions.Quote from: Odusko on September 17, 2022, 07:00:57 AMI have read so many comments on how risky it is to depend your life and finances on Bitcoin even on this forum some members have made such wrong comments without adding any explanation to what reason it is to make such comments and assumptions thst can mislead newbies  and building a wrong minset in some of the established members of this forum and some other cryptocurrency communities...You read such comments for a reason, not because someone (at least not the majority) wants to have a bad influence on others (especially beginners). People who don't understand what Bitcoin is are often victims of their ignorance, whether it's a simple financial loss amid falling prices and panic selling, or various forms of scams. How do you think the people who invested their savings in Bitcoin when it was worth $40k and more feel now?",

This is why others are pursuing to invest in cheaper altcoins, but we all know that many of those altcoins are just shitcoins in the end and aren't reliably worth holding in the long-term.",

The risk is already there it's just up to someone to minimize the risk and not to mention the unpredictable volatility is already a huge risk.

When it comes to bitcoin, some individuals only consider the investment aspect, I mean the theoretical aspect without giving any thought to the technical aspect. People frequently overlook this aspect, although it is not their fault for doing so. People lose interest in mining because of how the mining tools are expensive to buy. Without becoming too technical, grasping the fundamentals of mining can be helpful when one starts using bitcoin. Bitcoin is beneficial on both a theoretical and technical level; you just need to decide which one would work best for you and start investing.",
