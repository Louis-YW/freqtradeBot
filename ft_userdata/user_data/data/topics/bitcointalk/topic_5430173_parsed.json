  "content": "Voyager Digital, who first stopped all withdrawals and deposits earlier this year and then declared bankruptcy, accepted the offer from Binance and will sell their assets for 1.022 billion USD. If I remember correctly,  FTX also planned to take them over, but we all know how that ended up so at least I hope people will be able to get their money back.Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/19/binanceus-agrees-to-buy-bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyagers-assets-for-over-1b/Voyager Digital, the bankrupt crypto lender, said Binance.US has agreed to buy its assets for $1.022 billion, the firm said on Monday.The bid represents the fair market value of Voyager's cryptocurrency portfolio, which has a current market value of around $1.002 billion, and an additional consideration of $20 million in incremental value.\"The Binance.US bid aims to return crypto to customers in kind, in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities,\" Voyager said in the statement.",

Buying this company means your carrying all the responsibilities for all the existing customers money. There’s no benefit on doing this besides making a good publicity for binance by saving user funds trapped on the DeFi.Binance.Us is operating independently and probably CZ is using it so that US SEC can’t touch it since they are now attacking the main Binance.",

It's Voyager's customers that they will have the right to. So this deal is not literally Binance.US buying Voyager Digital assets worth $1.02 billion. The assets won't actually be liquidated. Binance.US won't be shelling out $1.02 billion. They will only pay $20 million for the right over Voyager's customers. Once that's approved, the customers will have their funds back. They're free to decide on what to do with them. This is now way cheaper than when they first made their bid for Voyager against FTX months ago. Binance.US originally offered $50 million for the same, and they lost. Now they won with only $20 million bid.",

Headlines everywhere have it that Binance will buy Voyager's assets amounting to more than a billion as if Binance would actually release that huge of an amount. Of course, it won't. But Binance has already benefitted from those news already, especially from those who only read the headlines and not the details. This is probably more business than a statement or a proof of something. So, this isn't altruism for the sake of Voyager's clients, either.",
