And then execute it.Thank you.Do you have any collateral?In case you're unaware, newbies don't get non-collateralized loans here. Â Unless you have Bitcoin or some other alt-coin to offer as collateral, you are unlikely to get a loan, and more likely to get tagged as a scammer.More can be learned about collateral suggestions here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=577765.msg6311902#msg6311902Another thing to note; unless your deal involves bitcoin this offer should be in the Alt-Coin marketplace, not here.Good luck.",

Collateral helps to protect the lender from fraud which has been happening from time to time otherwise without Collateral, the lenders may not be able to recover assets lost through Loan defaulting, and they would be out of business in no time.",

But they could give you that non-collateral loan if provided that you've got a regular job or business that's stable and can assure them that they'll be able to get paid on time just as what you've said. Getting a loan through the forum from the lenders, if you lack requirements from their rules, you're unlikely to get what you're asking for the loan.",
