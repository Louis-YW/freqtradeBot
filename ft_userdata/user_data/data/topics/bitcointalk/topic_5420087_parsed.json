  "content": "LoyceV gives out secular as forum rules(LoyceV gives out secular sayings, that not included in forum rules, as forum rules)Quote from: LoyceV on February 05, 2025, 10:58:06 AMI don't want to post in the troll's self-moderated topics, but I wonder if he's seen this post:Quote from: theymos on January 13, 2020, 04:46:57 AMWhy are you guys posting the old names of people who clearly needed their names changed for privacy reasons? Obviously any data posted online is going to be quickly archived somewhere, but that doesn't mean that your highlighting/reposting of it has no effect. In some cases you may literally be putting lives in danger. If you were investigating a scam or something, that'd be different, but you seem to just be indiscriminately & recklessly dredging up data that would best be forgotten.I. Admin's sayings are admin's sayings. With which you can agree or not agree. Disagreeing with common sayings at usual discussions between DT-cians is not violation. II. Forum rules are forum rules. Which everyone is required to follow. Violation of rules is a crime on the forum.",

I won't fall for his trolling anymore.",
