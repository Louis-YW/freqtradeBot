  "content": "I need help understanding how seed words were used in 2012. I understand that there was a standardized list created in 2013 but what does that mean for my 2012 seed words? I'm trying to piece together the words and all the ones that I remember are in the standardized list. Is there a chance that if I find my seed words they won't work? Are there abandoned seed word lists? Would they still create a new wallet in something like Electrum?",
