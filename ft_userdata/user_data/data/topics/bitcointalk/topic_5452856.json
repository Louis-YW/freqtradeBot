  "content": "Hello everyone. I'm happy joining this community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. First of all, I’d like to say I’m not an island and I’m here to learn (which makes me open to corrections), share my little experience and engage in the activities of this great forum. I've been been a fan of the cryptocurrency world for a while now and I'm eager to expand my knowledge and connect with people of more experience. I came across bitcoin a few years ago on an article I stumbled upon which led to my cryptocurrency journey. First, I was skeptical about it and had trouble understanding how it works, but as I did my personal research for more insight, I discovered the so many opportunities it has to offer. Since then, I’ve involved myself in different cryptocurrencies. It has also not been so smooth for me which is why I’m excited to be part of this community where I can connect with people and share ideas and experiences that can expand my scope in the world of cryptocurrency.I’m excited to take part in the discussions, experiences and also gain more knowledge which y’all have in store for me.Thanks so much for having me here and I’m still always open to corrections.Yours sincerely,Framelover.",

      "body": "@OP you did the right move of learning about cryptocurrency first but you should focus on major cryptocurrencies so that you won't waste your time and money.  Avoid engaging with cryptocurrency projects that aim only to milk the investors of their money.  Such cryptocurrencies are called shitcoins.  They are created for the obvious reason of getting money out of thin air and rely on hypes and misinformation.  They even claim to be better than the major currencies when in fact they are just copy.If you may, you can focus your attention on Bitcoin since it is the dominant cryptocurrency.  Although the profit isn't as huge as the hyped meme coin and shitcoins, you are assured of its established liquidity and community.",

Crypto is a great alternative to main fiat currencies. I think that blockchain mechanism is the new step in digital banking algorithms. The main problem is whether banks will adopt the technology for digital fiats or already existing cryptocurrencies will become stable transaction instrument.",
