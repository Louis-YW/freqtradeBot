That's a red flag. I'm not ready to go deep into this project for you OP, this is 100% a pure scam project, start looking into more stronger PoW coins like Flux, Ergo, Ravencoin or Ethereum PoW, these projects are way better.",

      "body": "The project has nothing to do with legit mining Algos like POW. All I am seeing NFT mining which is pretty fake. Also on just visiting the link, the straight away ask for your personal details to sign-up including passport number  I created an account using fake details and logged in and guess what, they are just selling some shitcoin and ask for very sensitive personal details in the name of KYC verification. I would suggest you avoid using them completely.There is nothing about mining with GoldenSand.org",
