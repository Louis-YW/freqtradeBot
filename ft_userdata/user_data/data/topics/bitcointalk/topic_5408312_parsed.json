Do not expect to have the same pump that it has got before for the next bull run.We're not Nostradamus but that's what most likely happening for the altcoins that have too much pump but there are some exceptions like Ethereum and BNB. But to have that idea, is you shouldn't really expect a lot.",

So don't know if you can really expect a good rise in its price. I have the feeling that just like most meme tokens, they will die down slowly if the team won't find other ways how to sustain the interest of the community. Though I am seeing SHIB to be included in the payment options in some gambling sites but I believe it is not enough to maintain their market.",

As of now it's still an ERC20 token, which means with the current high ETH gad prices its still not a suitable payment option as compared to the likes of Doge. Maybe if they create their own blockchain or when ETH goes POS. Things might get a little good.I still think it's one of those tokens where one can easily make x10 ROI if the bull market is back.",

With regard to meme-coins, I was and remain a big pessimist. All this excitement with meme-coins will gradually subside and then they will have an unenviable future. Maybe I'm wrong, but I have no desire to invest in them. There are a lot of noteworthy cryptocurrencies in this market, and meme coins are too risky to invest in.",

Considering it's supply, the total market cap has to reach few hundred trillion USD in order to reach that one dollar mark which is impossible. So my recommendation is not to waste time in such meme coins. They are not worth your time. Bitcoin is available at a super discounted price. If you really want to make good investment, the time to buy bitcoin is now! Take it or leave it!",

It's one of the main cryptocurrencies from the initial years of crypto market, what guarantees some sentimental value to the currency till nowadays, which hardly ever will cease at some moment futurely, keeping the currency influent at crypto scenario.

Don’t expect too much with SHIB because that could be another trap and you might regret that later on. Though, whales can still manipulate this token in the future, as long as there is a hype then SHIB can still hold into his position, if you know how to ride with the hype, then this can be an opportunity for you but don’t expect that much.",

Also, the supply is really huge for SHIB, they should continue to burn the supply and have a limit on this if its still possible. Right now, I don't want to put money on any meme token, the hype is gone right now but it we might see another surge if the market enters into another bull run, don't expect too much with SHIB, just look for a realistic price.",

If he accepts the risk, he also deserves the reward he expects. Shiba may create a new hype or disappear, who knows?",
