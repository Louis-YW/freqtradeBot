Because he doesn't want the \"profit\" - on paper become a \"loss\", the trader closes the trade for an insubstantial profit and his emotions will make him FOMO back in the same asset if he/she sees it's surging again. Does anyone want to be a weak trader? I believe not, BUT we plebs are all probably the same. That's why I stopped \"trading\" and started HODLing Bitcoin. All weak plebs should HODL too.",

If the trader keeps closing a trade even though the profit is less than 1R he is a weak trader. But if a trader closing above 1R, probably he is a wise trader.Weak trader don't fully trust their trading plan, maybe he didn't do enough backtest on it. But a wise trader, know when to exit not because they afraid of losing but because they see that the market will go against you.",

      "body": "In the past, I'm is type of trader you mentioned, selling out of fear that the price wouldn't go any higher. This happened with altcoins a few times. Even though the profits aren't significant, my trading math isn't strong enough to overcome my emotions. Now, I've chosen to set targets when HODLing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only asset I hold for the long term because it's the best. I have target to sell all of my BTC, which would give me enough money to buy something I've been dreaming of, especially since I've been DCA since it was around $20k.I really want to buy a property for my small family's living space. Well, everyone needs a home, and it's a great honor to own one. This way, I can restart my Bitcoin journey after having a decent place to live. My resolve is strong, and I'm not easily swayed by FUD because of this goal. maybe some people also have strong resolve when they have a clear goal, much like I do.",

It's how you are strong in trading. If you can not protect your capital by cut loss to close your position and exit the market, you are stupid.Does it make sense if you are too strong by holding your position for days, weeks and ignore all risks, then at the end, you lose money by market crash, margin liquidation?It is not strong but stupid trader.People can call you as a weak trader by closing your position than wait to get profit but if it means you have to take higher risk, you should not follow them. You are a weak trader in their eyes but if you successfully protect your capital, it's just fine. It is your money, not theirs so they are free to say whatever they want to satisfy their ego.",

A little wait might gives you more profit but it is not guaranteed.. Market will not work according to your strategy and there is possibility that your trade oppos your strategy.. I think exit before the target is sometimes essential for risk management.. Exiting from one trade doesn't mean that now we will not take any other trade.. We will now look for another opportunity which more favourable and we will lock our fund once again in other trade. Remember, changing strategy according to market conditions and securing profits when needed showcase your ability that you are strategic trader..I think this decision is not about weakness.. it's about making wise decisions to make more secure your investments.",

      "body": "We all claim to be traders and we can claim to be traders but how many of us can claim to be a wise trader. Most of us traders don't feel much need to research the market, they usually trade with some volatility in the market. Although common traders trade in this way, the wise traders think several times before taking a trade and research the market several times to see which direction the market may go if they take the trade. They take trades only if something positive comes out of their research.  Being weak and wise are two different things when it comes to trading. It's okay to be weak in the sense that we don't have the courage to trade because we have no idea about trading. For this reason if a trader is weak then he does not risk his money. All of us Tedders need to know about trading well and then start trading.",

It's about securing gains and mitigating potential losses, considering that we are in volatile markets where conditions can change rapidly. As a wise trader, recognizing that the market is unpredictable, it's better to lock in profits as a strategy. There were times when I preferred to stick to my TP levels and believed in long-term analysis. However, discipline and patience did not align with my preferences, so taking such risks could release potential profits.",

This time, Taking profit is really good because you already gain some despite it didn’t meet your target since you can always open new position once smoke is clear which you will knew if you analyze the chart.Remember that taking profit early is still much less painful than taking loss while you already have the opportunity to gain profit.",

However, quitting doesn't always mean that we are weak, sometimes we have to do this especially if we never see any profit anymore. If we could think deeply, about why we should do this and spend time without any good result while quitting will help us save ourselves from losing and we save time as well. In the end, it was not a wrong decision but a wise decision. And this will also remind us that not all the time that trading is profitable as losses are also possible depending on the market condition.",

Let's say you already entered a trade and you already set your take profit price and stop loss price but suddenly the price action went in a different direction, different from your expectation, so this time you can close the trade in profit even if your target price is still not reached. If that is your reason, then wise. If you don't have any basis, then weak.",

Personally, I prefer to trade continuously as long as I can make a profit because the purpose of trading is to make a profit, but because it is uncertain and cannot be predicted accurately, of course choosing to take profit by exiting the trade is also not a wrong choice. Although remaining in trading with a larger profit target is also quite wise for a trader.",

People trade for profits, so if profits are already achieved, then it's normal for traders to make an exit. Even though you don't get to achieved the maximum profits you set in your trades, as long as you're not losing, for me it's a wise trader. However, if you trade and lose and you decide to exit from your trade, for me that clearly shows that you're a weak trader. As long as you are not suffering from consistent losses, then I don't see it wise to exit from a trade, but hold your coins and wait for the right timing to exit from your trade.However, traders have different point of views. If they think that would cut their future losses, then maybe exiting from a trade is a good option. But if you trade to gain maximum profits, then it's wise if you analyze the market well and trade only when the market seems to favor your trades.",

For example, you have done your analysis and the market is moving according to your calculation. But suddenly the news breaks out, and the market could move entirely the different direction. Or it could be a good news which will push the market upward more. In case it's like this, you need to change your strategy and adapt to the situation you are in. The crypto market does not always move based on calculation and analysis. There are sentiments as well. It can highly influence the market thus we need to use strategies to minimize our losses and maximize or profit. But it is also important to stick to the plan to avoid getting emotional. If you are comfortable with your profit then you should stick to your original take profit target. If the market is going to move opposite direction and you are already in a profit then it is wise to close the trade and take the profit. Search simple it depends on situation you are in.

Securing profits is idealbut there are really times on which us traders does really go further more. Why? because we do feel out that we can really still make more.Getting further doesnt mean that you are greedy but rather a sort of butonce you are really that confident with your trading skills then it would really be that something that could really be the reason on why you would really be proceeding into.Dont think about being weak or strong because as a trader then changes and decisions would really be that could be altered if its needed.Dont mind about those things along the way because it s really just that normal that adjustments and alterations could happen.
