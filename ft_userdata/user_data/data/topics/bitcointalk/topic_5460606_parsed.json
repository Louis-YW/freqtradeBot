This topic does not belong in the Bitcoin Discussion and I suggest you move it to the correct board so that the moderators don't have to do it for you. I trust that it was simply an oversight on your part, but try not to make it a habit.",

I haven't tried this yet, and I have a doubt about it. I am not sure if I get you correctly or not. Are you talking about following leaderboard traders and open positions like that? We never know if they are bot created by Binance. I won't be surprised if they are doing it do liquidate traders. If people follow those traders, they might fall in to trap. But some of my locals confirmed that they tried it, and it worked well for them. I thinking to give it a try with a small amount.",

      "body": "In a normal user's trading display, I can't even tell the difference between limit and active/aggressive orders. \"Hiding\" orders is almost useless on my side, all exchanges which have high liquidity and trading volume are full of bot activities. In addition, the exchange's account summary feature also reads your overall P&L as a percentage, not order type or frequency. I don't think there's any place to hide.Maybe there are more reasonable intentions than just \"hiding\" orders from the order flow theory you mean. cmiiw",

      "body": "I always use order flow everytime I trade, you can make it if you know how to read market structure. The price creates higher highs and higher lows if it's an uptrend and if it's down trend the price is consist of lower highs and lower lows. Other traders just use break of structure to confirm if it's uptrend or downtrend. You can determine this easily because this is a swing point but for beginners it's quite difficult. If the trend is uptrend, and you anticipate that the current price is the higher low, the expectational order flow is higher high. In that way, you have a higher chance that your trade will materialize.",

This could be a good idea if you don't believe in yourself but one must be sure of the trading capacity of the traders they copy their orders.And the moment they didn't copy it rightly as you said, then they are deceiving themselves.",

I just follow some professional traders and their analysis based signals and then I try to make my own research on it. After that I try to enter the market. For me it's a bad habit to copy professional traders based on order flow. It may cause you harm of your assets if they share something promotional. So always try to learn by yourself when opening a trade beside you can follow analysis based signals or trading activity from the professionals. If you can implement their strategy that will be helpful.Quote from: david678345 on July 21, 2023, 08:42:04 PMIf I am not wrong (according to the Order Flow theory) professional traders use limit orders...and most non-professional traders use active and aggressive orders...It's not necessary that experts will only use limit orders. Experts are aware to follow market volatility according to their trading strategy. Sometimes we have to make aggressive orders, sometimes limit order. It's all based on the prediction and analysis. Obviously aggressive orders cause losing funds most of the time.",

      "body": "Professional traders don’t always use limit orders. When there is an event they need to get in quick and might do a market order. Also their stop losses are all market orders also.It won’t help you trying to seek out large limit orders however. Most of the time when we are a large bid or ask. We think it’s strong support or resistance. However with crypto, what normally happens as we approach that level is the order is pulled. Most professionals use maybe TWAP which is hard to catch because many of them use random variables such as the time and order size. Hence it won’t help you there.",

In trading, you always need to be careful with your assets, Signals, and Copy Trading in any sense is injurious to your funds. I know people can make good gains through taking risks but bro wait a minute are you really sure about if that profession will try to manipulate your funds how you are going to know if you don't even know the ABCD of trading so learn trading first than try whatever you want to.Leaving your funds on the mercy of other is a stupidity commonly done in greed. Never belive the leaderboard profession traders because there can be never 100% transparency in the trades.",

It better to do trade with your own mind. Since that will help you about how to trade in the long run. If you keep on following others then your own mind wont get necessary training and you wont be able to trade on your own. Start with small capital, increase it with time as you learn from your mistakes.",

So as always follow as a student not as a broker. I always use to say your funds are yours only and you are responsible for your own decisions.",
