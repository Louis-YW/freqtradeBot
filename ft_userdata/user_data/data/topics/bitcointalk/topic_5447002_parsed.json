  "content": "Just recently news came out regarding Rollbit casino which is popular amongst thousands of users here on the forum as well as outside this community. Rollbit also has its token with the ticker RLB. After the news came in regarding its licensing issues community has been aggravated since then and RLB is losing its value at an alarming rate. The token has fallen by 20% in jus the last 24 hours which is devastating for the Rollbit casino itself. The reason for the fall is simple, Rollbit has not been able to tell the community freely that they don't have any such issues. This has created ambiguity among everyone. This might be making everyone leave the casino and sell their RLB tokens if any. This also makes us think that factual analysis of the company matters a lot when it is listed on the exchanger and could impact the pricing in long run. All they have to say is their license is on annual period however its still unclear if they have it running or not. QuoteRollbit says Curaçao authorities are currently engaged in an annual license review, which is why its logo is removed from the site.Crypto casino Rollbit says it hasn’t received any indication from authorities that its “operation are problematic,” however traders are not convinced and are selling the platform's RLB token.CoinGecko data shows that RLB is down 20% in the last 24 hours, or 37.5% over the last two weeks.Crypto Twitter has noticed that Rollbit has removed information pertaining to its license from Curaçao, a Dutch Caribbean island off the coast of Venezuela, which is known to be an offshore hub for online gambling.Rollbit recently began to offer crypto derivatives trading, which is not covered by its current license. Some users have noticed that information pertaining to crypto derivatives is hidden until the user logs in.“We are actively communicating with our licensor about the renewal and will provide an update as soon as possible,” Rollbit said in a Twitter update. “Although this is typically an internal process, we recognize the importance of transparency in such a crucial aspect of our business.”Today our community raised some concerns regarding our license status, which we're addressing below.- Our license is currently in its annual renewal period, a standard procedure for Curaçao-licensed platforms like ours.- We are actively communicating with our licensor about…— Rollbit (@rollbitcom) March 31, 2023The online casino said it has implemented minor user interface changes based on their licensor's recommendations, which it claims is a common request during the renewal period.Crypto Casino Rollbit's Token Drops 20% Amid Licensing Concerns",

Now, apprarently, it turns out that there is a bigger issue going on with their license not being renewed before the expiration date.Well, why in the world Rollbit did not take into account the renewal before the so called \"expiration\"?  And what's this?Quote from: https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/regulation/casinosCuraçao casino legislation does not recognize renewal of casino licenses. Every 3 years a new casino license application must be submitted and processed.",

      "body": "Something doesn't seem right with Rollbit. It's unfortunate that while they are slowly building up their reputation rather smoothly it seems they are doing something fishy backstage. I smell greed. Well, first and foremost, it seems to me that gambling and trading don't really go along quite well. I've just read the news of Beaxy, a centralized exchange that just ended its operation, whose founder misused the company's funds, some of which went to gambling. There was also the infamous Sam Bankman-Fried who allegedly lost at least a hundred million of FTX's funds to gambling. It's also worth noting how this derivative trading that they are offering is hidden. And it's primarily because it isn't licensed at all. And these two products, casino and exchange, are offered in the same platform. I doubt Curacao, notwithstanding its questionable process, would approve of it had they known it.",

With everything going on with regulations and their issue with the license, I think that they got some warning. Especially now with so many crypto exchanges facing regulatory hurdles. Also the way they responded to the license renewal period just made themselves dig in a bigger hole. I would becareful using the site in the short term.",

Although this legal problem seems to be serious for many people, but there's no one get scammed yet, so I think this problem will not ruin their reputation. But to be safe any gamblers who have funds on Rollbit need to withdraw it.@OP why this matter discussed on economics section? this should be moved to gambling discussion section.",
