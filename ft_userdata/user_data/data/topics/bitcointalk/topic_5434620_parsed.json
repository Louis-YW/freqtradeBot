And I had a small collection - those with larger ones are probably look at easily 2x to 3x the loss that I have.I get that. But everyone is kicking and screaming; rightfully so. Just hope there are more individuals behind closed doors problem solving. A ton of money flows through sales here - there is potential to right all the wrongs. Even at a scaled level, but that requires a lot of community effort/commitment. For instance, every % of every sale for a year here on the forums could go to a fund to make sure those most impacted one day are righted. Again, a random example of a million things to be done.Point is, we can definitely overcome this, if we want to. I would prefer it to be in the form of a new collectible - because well thats the hobby. I don't hold a voice here though, so I'm just stirring the pot.",
