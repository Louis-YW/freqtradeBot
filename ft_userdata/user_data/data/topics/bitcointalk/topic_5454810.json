Looks like he's using AI for commentsSorry, I chose to message you instead of posting in the scam accusations thread. (Please don't mention in public that I reported it)Profile link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3527029Proof:As you can see the reporter don't want his profile to be in public so respecting that I am posting it on behalf of him. I have done some of my investigations but it seems fighting against AI is not as easy as it was for plagiarism.@Bitcoin_people, if the result comes negative from majority opinions then please accept my apology in advance but if you found guilty then you will be banned participating from any of my campaigns until 2nd January 2023 2024.Thanks to you all in advance. I would like you know your feedback.",

Obviously many people are in this for the Bitcoin/sats, but honestly I don't count myself among them as I don't go out of my way to make posts for money. I look at a lot of people in campaigns and it seems all they do all day long is shitpost to get as much BTC as possible. If I started doing that for example it would be pretty obvious. Just saying how I personally feel of course.",

You removed his name, but it forwards to his Bitcointalk profile when someone clicks on the quote link. You may want to remove his UID as well. About this matter. This is a shitty thing people do. I guess he did it to reach the maximum post limit to get weekly from the campaign. I have seen he received the bonus multiple times. It's not easy for someone to write over 90+ posts each week. Maybe he decided to get help from AI. I suggest he delete all his AI posts before moderators punish him. Edit: I've Checked some of his posts as well. It doesn't seem AI-Generated. Some AI Detector tools giving false information, I guess? I don't think you need community feedback about this matter. You already mentioned this in your campaign thread;Quote from: Royse777 on January 11, 2023, 07:22:22 AMTo prevent AI domination effective from today we are introducing an incentive for forum users. Find AI written posts on this campaign and report to me either in public or in forum PM, please be sure you have enough reference to support the claim. For successful report the reporter will receive the weekly payment instead of the accused campaigner. The campaigner will be removed immediately.",

      "body": "I also tried to copy some of my latest posts on the website that anonymous reporter has shared (thanks for sharing anyway), and most of them are less than 1% fake (some are even 0%), but there are 2 of my posts that has more than 30%. I also don't know if this AI detector is reliable or not as well.Anyway, I don't know if it's only me, but I despise users who are using ChatGPT for their advantage here in the forum just to get a few bucks in their signature campaign. IMO, it's obvious that the OP has used AI apps to maximize the quality of his posts. I just don't know why people are using it here? To gain merits? Self-validation? To show here that you are a good poster? I mean it doesn't make sense (for me).Quote from: John Abraham on June 02, 2023, 01:10:11 AMI would suggest he delete all his AI posts before any moderators punish him.We've seen previous report from a user who has been caught using AI tools in his posts, but what he only got is a neutral trust, and a ban from campaigns that Royse777 is managing, and will be managing in the future. Deleting his AI posts will be useless as well because he has been exposed already, and I guess it's almost certain that he will be out of Yomix anytime soon (if proven he's using AI).P.S. Well, I guess that the site that the reporter has posted isn't as reliable as it is because @pakhitheboss tried it on another AI detector, and it seems that it says there that it wasn't an AI written post.I tried using the AI detector website that @nutildah has shared here: LINKLINK LINK LINK LINKOn the first post that is suspected to be AI written, 2 of the sites said that it is created by a human, while the 2 said that it has made thru AI.On the second post that is suspected to be AI written, 4 of the same websites that I used said that it is created by human.On the third post that is suspected to be AI written, 2 of the sites again said that it is created by a human while the 2 said that it has made thru AI. TBH, it's hard to detect which posts are created by human, and which are created by AI knowing that these AI detector tools have different outputs for the same posts. The only time that we will know that the suspected user is using AI is when he, himself says it. If the accused is using or not, I still despise using AI to earn here.",

That user was also denied his last campaign payment. I checked the text with 2 other AI detectors and both said his reported posts were written by a human. The user sent this proof to the manager, the manager accepted to send him the last payment but, however, the user remained excluded from the campaign.Seeing that different websites give totally different results makes me wonder about the accuracy of some of them. Perhaps, excepting the website results we should also take into consideration the user's reputation, in such cases?Quote from: Royse777 on June 02, 2023, 12:45:11 AM@Bitcoin_people, if the result comes negative from majority opinions then please accept my apology in advance but if you found guilty then you will be banned participating from any of my campaigns until 2nd January 2023.Perhaps you want to update the highlighted part?",

However, since you understand your friend so well about Bitcoin, your friend is particularly interested in investing in Bitcoin. But of course you need to warn them about this before investing in the Bitcoin market. They need to be made aware of the risks involved in investing when the Bitcoin market is volatile at times. Make sure you are well-informed about all aspects and then give advice for Bitcoin investment. If you don't tell him about the volatility of the Bitcoin market, he could be particularly vulnerable. So I think it's best to invest in Bitcoin later after understanding that the investment will be successful and profitable.Hivemoderation.com: 0% AIWriter.com: 73% AIContentscale.ai: 27% AISo I mean the posts aren't good. They are bland, uninformative and perfunctory -- par for the shitposter course. But I don't think they are necessarily AI-generated.

You should always take into consideration that these are not 100% accurate and you have to use more than one tool (even chatgpt has one from his own site), along with the human factor and common sense because sometimes we have the so-called \"false positives\".We caught one because he admitted to using AIs'Quote from: bbigtart on May 28, 2023, 02:50:48 PMI admit that I was wrong. I used AI ChatGPT at first I didn't know it was strictly banned in forums. But these few days I just found out, coupled with this incident I also realized that what I did was wrong and fatal.Everyone has a concern that they are going to be flagged for using AI although they are not using AI, we need a reliable tool to detect AI, I support Nutilda's finding with so many AI in the market some of it will show false positives.",

At this point, there was nothing he could do; he knew he messed up by acting without adequate investigation. Both the reporter and the campaign manager later apologized, and the user received his payment, but his slot had already been given to someone else. I also asked the reporter who reported the case to quit playing with people's reputations using some shady unproven AI detector, but based on the message you received, he appears to be the same person who sent you the report. People don't learn do they? not him.Looking at the posts he reported, they had grammatical and phrasing issues, which AI will not generate. There is no AI detector out there that is 60% accurate.

There are some controversies in detecting AI written articles or posts in the forum and in the other hand, victims do not agree they use AI unless proven beyond doubt. 2. But there is a way out. There need to be a standard. Recently you kicked a user out of your campaign @bbigtart. He admitted that he was using AI for his posts. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454218.msg62312182#msg623121823.

I think sapling.ai was used for @bbigtart and that same sapling.ai is used for @bbigtart. The question is, will sapling be so inconsistent such that he will be correct in case one and totally wrong in case two. I don't think so... This is my feedback.",
