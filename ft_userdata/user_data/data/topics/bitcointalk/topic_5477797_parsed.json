Don't say that just because your mom said it, you can tell her that it's too dangerous to drive because it's broken. Talk to your mom properly and you can also find a way if it is still possible or not so you know what to do.",

      "body": "Your mum should understand that while try to chase money, she should also care about her safety. She doesn't need to force a bad truck into the road because it may become collateral damage to other road users. Money is good but the love for it is bad as it leads to evil because you can take wrong decisions as a result of the chase for it. Health is wealth and the need to be alive is a more important goal to securing the future. Moreover, your mum would have been aged and should pass over certain responsibility to you regards to how to make money. She needs more rest and since you have volunteered to take up the business, she has to consider that you are younger with energy and can face challenges more than her. She only needs to build trust with you, guide you from the background with her experience.",

What is up???Understand you mom that money is really important, but also try to make her understand that the truck is not in good condition and if you push to make a round trip for it then you might get a problem since it could possibly broke down in streets then might face certain violation or worst you can put the life of other people in danger. Maybe you mom doesn't understand the truck condition that's why she think its fine to drove it for last time so a proper talk and maybe try to point out the issue personally then tell her that this is the issue that need to fix immediately. I know its hard to correct some people that doesn't understand the situation but its your mom so be calm on discussing the situation and try to make her know the condition since for sure everything will be fine with the issue you want to raise.",

Everything includes money that's why it is very important to all of us because we can't live without it and Let's be realistic here. However, based on your interpretation, Seems like your mother doesn't even thinking about the situation and how you will feel, what's important to her is to generate an income even if it cost you harm and damage. give yourself a time and break for now and try to talk with your mother and just say all your thoughts about the way she treated you and how you really feel because sometimes they didn't know that it is too much for you. last thing, just set a limitation to yourself and learn how to refuse sometimes.",

She is thinking of me like a tool to get income even until now that I have my own family she still demanding me to give most of my salary to her which I already refused.Parents should be the one providing for their offspring and I really hate being a victim of poverty transfer from parents to child. Parents shouldnâ€™t start a family if they still have some backlog burden on his parents and siblings.",

Let's not expect that there will be a fair fight. In short, I agree that money can fix everything, but not everything can be fixed by money.",
