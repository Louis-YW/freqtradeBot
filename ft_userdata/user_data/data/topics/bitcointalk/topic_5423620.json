I didn't support Mark Zuckerberg because he wanted to become the richest person in the world by creating more assets as a stablecoin and because Mark Zuckerberg wasn't even interested in Bitcoin, I refused to give approval to the US and European governments either. If Mark Zuckerberg had created a stablecoin, it would hardly have benefited users.",

Elon musk is far worst than Mark Zuckerberg when it comes to money, the only reason people hate Mark Zuckerberg is because he doesn't respect privacy. Mark Zuckerberg can't ask you to pay money to use his platforms, he'll give you for free but he'll steal your private information to sell them for profits while Elon musk has boldly come out to tell people to pay to be verified on Twitter which just takes aways the whole point of been verified in the first place as now everyone can be verified. Lastly stablecoin aren't profitable and Elon musk doesn't partake in unprofitable business so that isn't going to happen. Elon musk would likely make dogecoin a payment currency on twitter then implemention a stablecoin as he knows he'll make more profit from the dogecoin.",

As far as I know, most of the users of twitter are into posting stuffs than watching videos (if I'm not mistaken). So think of this: if that token will be used for twitter usage, will it be sustainable. But this is just measuring tendencies and possibilities for the token since Op have mentioned about stability with the token's market value. If we would base or compare to stable coins such as USDT there is a continuous usage of it in transactions. This would be a possible alt, and being stable is somewhat impossible.",

Most of the whale use that condition to do trade and get some little profit. Because whales will had huge bitcoin which they brought from the entire bear market. Most of the whales play huge role in the crypto currency market. They are huge responsible person for the bear market. Only few whales had influenced the bull market and get profit from it. Because making profit from bull market is not a easy one. Surely the long term holders will play the important role in bull market.",
