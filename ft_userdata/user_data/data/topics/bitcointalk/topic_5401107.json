  "content": "As the title says, one of the more popular fast food chains in the United States started accepting bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). One may say that it's not a real deal as they will do it via 3rd party service (in this case Flexa) but its a good news nevertheless and a step in right direction. Expecting that these big chains accepts bitcoin directly is kinda naive, but the way things are developing I don't think that its out of the question in the relatively near future. After all, who would have thought 10 years ago that bitcoin would be in situation like this?Quote from: https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/149684/chipotle-will-now-accept-cryptocurrency-in-us-storesChipotle, the popular Mexican-style fast-food restaurant chain, will now accept cryptocurrency payments through Flexa, a digital payments platform.  Flexa supports around 98 currencies, including BTC and ETH. Customers can use the app to pay for food items in any of the nearly 3000 Chipotle restaurants in the United States.",

And such a huge amount was used to purchase food. Nobody, knows what future Bitcoin holds 10 years from now! The little amount of Bitcoin used to buy a meal today can be worth a huge amount of money 10 years later as bitcoin can be broken down into satoshi. What I'm I saying in essence? The fast food chains that accepts bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies today are said to be taking a huge risk but, on the long term I don't see any risk attached to it. A friend said on his comment about accepting bitcoin, that it'll affect the price of products and they'll keep changing their prices as Bitcoin price fluctuates. I don't think this case is attached to using bitcoin to buy perishables because Bitcoin don't perish so any amount of bitcoin used to purchase food is helpful to the fast food chain on the long run and I see it as a reason why many of them are taking this step as a means or investing their food into bitcoin regardless of the volatility.",

The question also arises as to how much Bitcoin will be represented in payments given the fact that as many as 98 cryptocurrencies are available - and for many most of us who are mostly focused on Bitcoin have not even heard of it.See the list and see for yourself, and my personal favorite is of course the first space currency available on planet Earth (soon on Mars) Source",

A friend said on his comment about accepting bitcoin, that it'll affect the price of products and they'll keep changing their prices as Bitcoin price fluctuates. If they use a payment processor, they really bear no risk as they are not holding Bitcoin in their cash flow, it's all being converted to fiat immediately. This also means they do not have to change their prices. If a product is $10, it would be displayed for that amount. Anyone who wishes to pay in BTC would be paying $10 worth of Bitcoin regardless of how much Bitcoin happens to be at the time.Quote from: Accardo on June 02, 2022, 01:35:13 PMI don't think this case is attached to using bitcoin to buy perishables because Bitcoin don't perish so any amount of bitcoin used to purchase food is helpful to the fast food chain on the long run and I see it as a reason why many of them are taking this step as a means or investing their food into bitcoin regardless of the volatility.Again, they are not investing in Bitcoin, just profiting from the Bitcoin and crypto community to get more traffic and backlinks.",

Usually, people will be curious about how it works so they will gonna try it and make content out of it.

I reckon most businesses who would start accepting Bitcoin would always start using 3rd party services. I don't think they'd ever get the mindset to provide a system themselves when third-party services exist, not to mention that it would only incur more(probably) on their side if they were ever to provide their own.

It needs one of these apps since you don't have to wait for confirms or anything like that. Kind of like Cashapp / block with crypto payments. It's keeping it all in their bubble.Not perfect, but it's a start. Yes you have lightning and other options but this has to be painless and simple for the users and give the workers a simple interface. Let's face it, it's fast food you don't want to have people standing waiting for my lightning node to try to find the best route to the chipolte node.  As of now, Flexa has not asked me for any KYC info.
