Someone recently contacted me to see how much it would cost for me to break up my silvers set and sell them this coin from it. I told them 2.4 BTC (I think, give or take a few bits). While a 0.4 BTC premium seems like a lot, I think the day will come when you won’t be able to find one of these at any price. Albeit possibly far in the future.",

If I didn’t have a few, this would be vaulted for the ages. Similar to the recent silver Doge CI auction I did, I like to offer things up for the community from time to time. I’d rather these stunners go to someone here than a random investor who can’t fully appreciate them.I’ve had offers at 1.25 1.3 - looking for 1.4, which is more than fair given this beauty’s condition.Cheers!",

I wish the 0.1 silver casascius would be available with only a 40% premium, but yeah, that train's long passed I guess... This one's out of my league, but my guess is it should sell easily. : )",
