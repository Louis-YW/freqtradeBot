Well, with regards to this newly elected president that is bitcoin lover, this is good news for the crypto community as it’s going to create a positive boost most especially if this president will be able to create promotions about bitcoin so that their country will be next in line with El Salvador that is totally on bitcoin.

But I think the legal tender clause would only be appropriate if it declares bitcoin legal, as Argentina has a large number of bitcoin/crypto holders.  As has been done by El Salvador's President, Nayib Bukele, he has accepted Bitcoin and declared Bitcoin legal following all principles of legal tender. And he has bought many bitcoins which will protect him from future financial storms. Because Bitcoin is the most suitable way to invest for a long time, because Bitcoin will definitely have high speed with its own speed. El Salvador's Volcano Energy is generating energy.",

He was vocal about his plans and visions and seems determine to do just like he said. He challenged the financial systems and promised to embark on several reforms that will change the status quo including the central banking system. But I see a little problem in all of them. Will he have the political will to challenge the powers that be? Argentina is not that of a strong country and they have a lot of unsettle businesses with IMF, can Javier Milei withstand the pressure from these powerful organisations? As for the future of Bitcoin in Argentina, the new administration will most likely legalise Bitcoin just like El Salvador did but I don't think they will see the benefits immediately because they have a lot to address ranging from unemployment, inflation and poverty.",
