      "body": "The bubbles burst a long time ago. Many stocks were trending down since last Summer. Bitcoin peaked at the end of the year.In some markets real estate is getting a small correction but not much. Yes inflation is high and so is employment numbers and with commodities being high also it means a recession. However if it is a recession it either hasn’t started yet or it’s a minor recession.",

You do not have to expect that things will get ameliorated when things like war happens. Wars are antithetical to progress and economy will fall. If you check at the countries that have gone into war especially those with little or no technological development before the war, they have ended up being impoverished the more after the war. War breeds inflation no matter how you try to avoid it so nothing is fixed with crisis because stocks get fallen leading to depreciation of currency.",

      "body": "Everyone keeps believing that the market will get back to normal, it will be a pain because something that goes up that much, doesn't come down easily and it will hurt many people while going down. But that doesn't change the fact that we will not be facing any ease after it's done neither. The problem is that, it will happen again and that is going to hurt us beyond repair next time it happens.Many people act as if we won't have a crisis again, but as we have seen we had one within span of less than 15 years and both of them really shocked the world. It makes younger generation poorer and poorer and poorer, whereas older generation already got their wealth when the world was good.",

Most likely not, these are unprecedented times. There's been reasons for past big recessions, and we've never really recovered from any of them. We've just sort of patched over the problems, without actually solving them. Now, I don't know when that dam is going to burst, however right now we're definitely heading for one of the biggest recessions we've had, and that's without even thinking about the compounding impact it would have if past patching us sort of comes away from the seams. Covid, and a pretty massive war that has been funded by most of the world. That's going to be felt, even in developed countries. We've already seen fuel prices skyrocket, and housing prices. Now we're seeing gas, electric, and food prices shoot up. People in developed countries were barely getting by anyway. Bitcoin, probably doesn't solve any of this, as this is going to happen in the short term.",
