Only believers or those who find the real value want to keep those NFT's but the majority of the market are not believers. Most of the people who are on the NFT trend are just there for the possible profit they can get out of the trend and now that the trend is gone, this is what the NFT craze ended. There are literally very small amount of people who are really willing to spend the amount they had just paid for the NFT they had bought during the bull market. If people somehow find NFT projects still profitable, there's a chance that we can have a recovery on NFTs.",

It’s better to purchase real paintings and other collectibles physical instead of purchasing random NFT which the image can be copy and produce by other people with different NFT brand.NFT is a scam market because its easy to manipulate and most of the scammers is using this sector to scam. You can add meme coin sector on this.",

Is it still possible for NFTs to recover their credibility?according to predictions that there will be many NFT assets that will have almost zero value, since the emergence of the NFT phenomenon, it is clear that the value created from a piece of NFT is only based on hype, there is no clear use case, everything is created purely by hype. When the majority of NFT assets are at the peak of their hype, we often see unreasonable prices, it's really a pity for those who buy expensively but now suffer big losses because what they hoped for didn't work out well.I predict, it will be difficult for some NFT assets to have great value again, people have already left it.",

Most of the pictures are not worth the money that was asked for them. People were stupefied by the trend and thought that these NFTs would go up in value all the time. History is cyclical. In 2017 they sold all sorts of ICOs under the guise of garbage, and in 2021 they sold all sorts of NFTs. All these projects were dead from the beginning, but the hype gave them insane value. Now the market is being cleared of all this garbage that was generated a few years ago.",

Critics will say that it's an entire scam because of how overpriced those NFT arts and stuff. It's not a scam entirely but it's also used by other scam projects. The concept was good but it's not really sustainable and the market from it doesn't stand a chance if it's just all about the niche and purpose that it has got.

As for visual NFTs, the only empty monkey and elephant collections were those who spent thousands of dollars on these digital collections and bought and sold them. The last ones they had left suffered a terrible loss and the possibility of them rising again is extremely uncertain. Altcoins seem less risky to me, but NFTs will be reborn again.",

Is it still possible for NFTs to recover their credibility?No one knows on how it would really be ending up on which its neither that it would really be having a recovery after this bear market or would really be totally goes down to the floor or bites the dust. We know on how this market works on which if a certain trend dies out because of lack of interest and demand then it would really be that too obvious and its cap would definitely be depleting until it dies out or there's something new that we are seeing in the market. NFT hype had already touch up the floor + having  this bear market then its not really that a shocking condition.It is really just that sad into those investors who had invested out with those pixelated images or buying out some NFT's in multi million dollars and ending up on getting a few bucks.Some biggest losses?Logan Paul’s NFT suffered the world’s largest devaluation, with a loss of 99.9995% of its original value.https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2023/07/22/biggest-nft-losses-web3-industry/For sure the list is really that really long and doesnt really stop on that.",

We can no longer expect them to grow but instead of seeing them dying because they are at our disposal, investors never see them as valuable anymore. Just like ICO and IEO, after having their great moments, they started to decline and heard nothing. As we saw in NFT's situation, it is just the same trend and we know that is hard to expect projects that have no use case to sustain and stay long in the crypto space but rather see them gone.",

There is real art and in my deep heart I want to buy it as a collection but the price is beyond my reach so I never buy NFT unless from airdrop and bounty.But when the metaverse project was coming out there were a ton of metaverse projects and play to earn the hype even hotter than ever some rappers and US artists bought land and I also bought a couple of land and invested in some projects that turned out to be scams.

Is it still possible for NFTs to recover their credibility?Nothing new TBH. I've seen these type of events happening in the crypto space for the past few years that I've been into crypto. As for NFT's, this is the reason why I'm kind of hesitant to invest into lots of NFT games, and arts during it's hype. The fact that it doesn't have neither value nor, use case at all is what is on my mind. I mean just imagine those Bored Ape NFT's or those Mutant Yacht NFT's who are worth thousands of Ethereum, but they don't have any use-case at all or any benefits for the investors. How is that possible? I don't want to say it, but it's kind of a straight up scam, and who benefited from this one? Of course the one who created those animated JPG's, and PNG's. As for the investors? Bye-bye money of course. Is NFT a scam? I want to say it is, but unfortunately for me it isn't. There are still some NFT games out there who are still operating despite of what's happening in the market for the last 2 years. I mean it also happened to DeFi where many projects turned out to be a scam. It's also the same with NFT's. I don't know if NFT's will recover after what happened to them, or they will become popular again after what happened in 2021, but I still believe that there will be a few NFT projects out there who will stay for... let's say at least 3 years or even more.",
