  "content": "De world largest exchange, Binance dey set de pace for odas to follow, dis time de exchange don mark anoda significant achievement by integrating lightning network to its platform. De feature don go live and users fit log on to deir Binance account and access am thru de deposit and withdrawal section to carry out transactions.Wetin be lightning network? Lightning network na de layer 2 scaling solution build on top de Bitcoin blockchain to address some of de challenges wey dey plague de base layer network. The following na de benefits wey Binance users go get for using de lightning network:1. E dey help increase de number of transaction per second, thus dey reduce de congestion of de network.2. E dey help make transaction faster as users fit confirm transaction within seconds or milliseconds. 3. E dey attract lower transaction fees and na good opportunities for individuals and businesses to carry out micro-transactions.

      "body": "This will help in lightning network adoption. But people should know the difference between 'custodial lightning network wallet and account' and 'noncustodial lightning network wallet'. If it is not your node, it is not your coin. Most lightning network wallets too, like the wallet of Satoshi and many others are centralized means of using lightning network.Quote from: sokani on July 17, 2023, 08:41:52 AM3. E dey attract lower transaction fees and na good opportunities for individuals and businesses to carry out micro-transactions. This is true.But if you run your own node and open a channel directly with another node, sending bitcoin that way required no fee. Also lightning node runner set the fee for lightning network users that depends on them, the lightning node runner may set the fee to any amount, he may even make transaction fee to be free (0 BTC) if he wants it like that.Quote from: sokani on July 17, 2023, 08:41:52 AM4. E dey increase privacy as users fit perform transactions off-chain.But there is no privacy about this, it is custodial and totally centralized means. Binance still have full control over your coins.",

I know say small business owners like me no fit to easily accept bitcoin as payment for our goods because of the high transaction fees, but as binance don add lightening network, e go reduce high transaction fees, and encourage transactions between buyer and seller for binance.

All you have to do is to click on receive or deposit and an invoice would be generated for you, which you can send to someone that wants to send you bitcoin through lightning network. If you want to transfer bitcoin to someone, the receiver will send you an invoice which you will use for the payment.",

De integration of LN go benefits Binance users and maybe increase their user base. From de reaction of de news from some of their users, I come realize say e get some people wen dem wan send small amount of bitcoin to anoda exchange, dem dey like convert am to anoda coin wey d withdrawal fee dey minimal like TRX before dem send am, and trade am back to BTC wen de deposit successfully reach de exchange. But with de integration of LN and as many exchanges begin to support am e go help users to swiftly withdraw and deposit BTC.",

      "body": "@Mate2237, sokaniDo not be surprised that some wallets are also making lightning network to be centralized just like with Binance. Example is wallet of Satoshi and many others like that. Even noncustodial wallet like Bluewallet make lightning network possible just like Binance before, until some months ago that you have to run your own lightning node before you can make use of lightning network on Bluewallet. Most of the lightning network wallet that I know are centralized and the node runners are having incentives that they are collecting from people using their wallet, just like Binance. But the fee are little to the extent you do not need to compare.On OKX the fee was very small before, but when I check it now, the fee is now 0 BTC. But likely this can change at anytime.",
