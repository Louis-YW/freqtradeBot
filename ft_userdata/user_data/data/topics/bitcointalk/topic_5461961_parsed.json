  "content": "QuoteNotice of Removal of Trading Pairs - 2023-08-042023-08-02 04:05This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.Fellow Binancians,Binance will remove and cease trading on the following spot trading pairs at 2023-08-04 03:00 (UTC):Spot Pairs: ATA/BUSD, BNT/BUSD, COS/BUSD, DF/BUSD, DOCK/BUSD, OSMO/BUSD, STRAX/BUSD, XNO/BUSDPlease note:Users can still trade the above assets on other trading pairs that are available on Binance.Binance will terminate Trading Bots services for the aforementioned spot trading pairs at 2023-08-04 03:00 (UTC), where applicable. Users are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses.Where any discrepancy arises between the translated versions and the original English version, the English version shall prevail.Thanks for your support!Binance Teamhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-of-removal-of-trading-pairs-2023-08-04-c2bc8eaae3264576921b4999cf00fe12So, I got a notification from Binance about the termination of their Trading Bots services for some spot trading pairs. I am curious by nature and it didn't take me few minutes to try and investigate why, seeing that the major token in the pairs to be terminated is BUSD. Here's my deduction on the reason why: 'Binance has been under a serious lawsuit from the U. S SEC for sometime now and it could be why Binance management has taken some steps to remove these trading pairs inorder to reduce the pressure of SEC’s attack on the surface. Perhaps, the U.S SEC will treat the case against the top exchange with more leniency.I also think that Binance could be taking this step because its origin isn't from the U.S, thus why the attack on the exchange is bearing down hard. It is also that the U.S SEC could be rallying around a new comer exchange project which will be launched in the U.S and would allow regulation of its decentralized system for customers/users by the SEC. Could it also be that since the BUSD tokens are backed by US banks, they poise as fully secure because the FDIC-insured these US banks that BUSD uses.BUSD also has the features of a normal bank because it is fully collateralized, meaning that it is backed/supported by an equivalent amount of US dollars which is currently held in its reserve.With these aforementioned points, one that stands out is the fact that maybe Binance simply want to be decentralized. The exchange may want to delve fully into cryptocurrencies by concentration of focus on working model and not be bothered about the government and their dollar rates, fees and regulations.What's your take on this? Any thoughts?",

Binance is taken out of the competition in US so now it does not matter either Binance uses BUSD or Not because i don't think so busd is registered in US according to your statements it dos but afaik it doesn't. (So please confirm me it).Secondly, we all know pexos has stooped the miniting of New BUSD so now we have only those which are already minted. Means BUSD are lesser now even According to CZ BUSD was registered in US but now it's now. Well, coming to the point.Cz has stated in a news that he is working on another stable coin which will be registered legally in Japan and the name is FDUSD which is already in circulation.QuoteEurope, First Digital USD is a programmable U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin managed by First Digital Group and licensed in Hong Kong. The company listed the FDUSD stablecoin on Binance on July 26.So now what i think is Binance is working to leave busd and wanted to migrate the trading volume of BUSD towards FDUSD. It's just assumption from the following news.https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-cz-binance-stablecoin-strategy-tether-busd",

      "body": "Hmm, well I think it's a smart move as Binance holds a strong name in the crypto market they should only list the worthy projects, delisting the scrap is a good move in my view. Weathers its SEC's pressure or the Binance's own move it is good in the broader view. The altcoin market is now full of scrap and copy projects I will support the same type of actions by other exchanges as well they should only list the quality projects. It will directly support the volume and market capital of these projects.",

Look at the historical volume of these pairs and look at how much of it was binance and you will realize that it's not that big of a deal at all. I believe that it's not going to be that unique either, we are talking about low volume pairs getting delisted, it's as common as it gets and happens as frequently as you might imagine. As long as an exchange doesn't make a profit from a pair, they will end up delisting it because it doesn't worth keeping it and diluting the market. There isn't really anything that is special and crazy going on behind our backs.",

When the company that did the audit canceled the report it is already a bad indication. CZ seems to want to cover it all up by saying all coins are $SAFU to make them calmer. But I don't know, people nowadays are looking at Binance because of $SAFU, I also trade there, but I would never keep all my assets there.",

BUSD is slowly dying because paxos has been banned from generating new units. People know that the days of BUSD are numbered and for several months they have been looking for alternatives by transferring their dollar liquidity and trading habits to other pairs (USDT, USDC), which makes the volume start to decrease and thus also the liquidity, especially on unknown shitcoins.",

Eventually the volumes will dry down and there won’t be liquidity and hence why they are removing BUSD. So this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. People won’t want to keep BUSD long term anyways since they are going to assume it might be risky since they are to cease operations.",

For others, they can see this as a bad news and there are some who will panic.I agree with you that Binance won't die that easily. They have fought lots of battles before and I think it many of them was harder than what they are facing currently so people should take it easy. There are still other parings out there that they can use if not BUSD. I'm sure they will soon get used to the change.",
