  "content": "Well first to all and as far i know most of us are not so old.SO for the majority of the years i has live, i dont see so many \"black swans\" like this time.For anyone who are guessing what its a black swan its an unpredictable or unforeseen event, typically one with extreme consequences.The MOST big Black Swan of the year was the start of the War in Ukraine with Rusia one of the main powers of the world directly involved. This develop another Black Swan, the huge jump in Energy cost.This one trigger another one, the Inflation rises.And today we still seeing the efects of this Black Swan, its still developing.But.... How this affect the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies?.In a BIG way, nobody spect a bear market in the traditional market and this bear market damage the crypto market because today the two are realted to each other making the bear market in crypto more complicated to solve. (a lot of companies are invested in crypto).The jump in energy cost , make the mining not so profitable than before. The mining industry its living a really decay and you can see this, browsing not so much,a lot of companies are in bankruptcy.Can you imagine the ETH for example without the change to PoS?.  A lot of people who put his money in mining can lose his money easily because of:- LOW price of ETH.- High and in some cases exponential increase of the cost of energy.And the most \"new\" black swan its.....USDollar being again so strong in the market.https://twitter.com/tradingview/status/1575111389118595074Nobody can expect this one year ago.PS: Yes i know a lot of this things were developing before, but nobody expect to happen this fast or nobody think can really happen no matter what its.So what can be the next black swan?.",

This is the first it happens in our generation,  almost like things are going from bad to worse without anyone knowing how it will all end for things to go back normal. To me I think the biggest is covid-19,  it literally short the world down on a standstill. Russia-Ukraine war does not have such an impact on the entire world like covid-19. It was a time of history. First in my lifetime I see the power house America with deserted busy roads and places. Imo, I don't see any other black swan as big as covid-19.",

They have come in cycles throughout history. At a time when the majority have forgotten the circumstances and events which led to the previous disaster(s).The generation gap contributes heavily towards society not learning from the mistakes of our ancestors. Causing the same errors to be repeated over thousands of years of history.Its hard to imagine how much life can change for the better. Or the worse. Within a short span of time. Many of us have never really seen a drastic adjustment to our own standard of living. Hopefully, we can adapt to our changing circumstances and thrive in spite of them.That said there are many, many, historical precedents which foreshadow which direction black swans will trend in. Schools made history a boring and useless topic. But there is such a thing as real history. Which can be useful for predicting future events.",

Also, the war in Ukraine started in 2014 and culminated in 2022, and the fact is that many believed that aggression on this scale would not happen, but some warned all the time about what the consequences of such a war would be, but no one was intelligent enough to understand the message in time. Therefore, more or less everything was predictable, as is what will happen in the future, and it depends on what some senile old man or madman who thinks he is defending Europe from Nazism will do.Quote from: darxiaomi on September 29, 2022, 06:00:52 PMCan you imagine the shitcoin for example without the change to PoS?.  A lot of people who put his money in mining can lose his money easily because of:- LOW price of shitcoin- High and in some cases exponential increase of the cost of energy.I corrected you a little, because people who invest in anything must be aware that it can turn into ordinary garbage at any moment. That \"merge\" was known a long time ago, so anyone could either sell the token, or sell the devices they used to mine it - and all those who didn't do it still believe it's worth being in the game, which I personally call \"proof of stupidity\" (POS).",

But then some things happened occasionally, and I was like 'okay, surely that's it, and it'll all be boring and normal now'. Then the pandemic hit, and I certainly DID NOT see that coming in my lifetime. All those tests, lockdowns, masks, almost all of my Master's education being online... I thought that surely this is the big thing we'd tell the next generation as something very major and bizarre. And then my country gets fully invaded my an aggressive neighbour, and since then it feels like many things are still possible, and we might be entering the dark times. I've always thought that human progress was a real thing (not the obvious technological progress, but, like, moral progress). Now it feels like that was a misinformed position and a temporary de-escalation, while who knows, maybe the Third World War is just around the corner, and maybe it will even be a nuclear one.",

But so far the world is still holding it together and trying to move on. If you had asked me last year I would have said inflation was way too low for the long period of low interest rates. And now with double digit inflation rates, it's way too high. Hopefully next year things will go to normality again. I wouldn't call the high USD a black swan event, because there are two ways to look at it. First is the high dollar, but this also happens due to weakness in the other currencies. The Euro is screwed because of the energy crisis from the Russian embargoes, and many emerging markets are also screwed because of higher food prices and higher oil prices. It's the relativity to other countries that makes USA so strong right now. The next big black swan event that could make everything worse and send the whole world in crisis would be if China invades Taiwan. The probabilities for it to happen are not so high, but with everything going on this year we might underestimate that risk.",

Once you start seeing the larger patterns in the histories, the repetitions you start seeing tend to have similar causes.  Don't Ignore the major holy books.  No I'm Not religious But those books are direct views on the human psyche and descriptions on how and why things go wrong.Humanity likes to think that it has little or no instincts and is in control of itself most of the time.  This is utter Bullcrap.  We have many instincts, most of which we are very unaware of, which is one of the many reasons people are so easily lead around by the nose.  People with more knowledge of how your operating system works can drag you around without much trouble.   Being aware of how you yourself works Will Not make you a better person But it will make you less foolish.
