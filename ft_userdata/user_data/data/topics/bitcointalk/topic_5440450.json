  "content": "This is alarming story of a woman (age: 70) who started dating a man over the internet, and sadly ended up giving away $200,000 in BTC. This is really not good news for the crypto world. Though we stay safe in our daily routine, if it was not for the Bitcoins then she would have fell for $200K in fiat itself because she was Scammed with Crypto Romance! Though she did everything for her love, it was sadly a scam and that's the kind of world we are living in right now. This story is from Nottingham, United Kingdom. The lady was pensioner and was dating this man via online dating site and eventually they both got involved to the point where man tricked her emotionally. He tricked her to send $200K so that he can end his contract with the current employer and he will come to her for life long togetherness. Though this story ended up in tragedy of scam, Police were able to recover around $135,000 for her and she was at least back in a life with her savings. The real question is, isnt this is sad to see how people are scamming each other around the world with fallen levels of kindness?QuoteA British pensioner living in Nottinghamshire parted with $207,000 after becoming a victim of a bitcoin romance scam.The police managed to restore some of the stolen funds and warned people to be extra vigilant with online dating due to the rise of similar frauds.The Latest BTC Romance SchemeThe Nottinghamshire police said a woman in her 70s transferred over $200,000 to a suspicious bitcoin address belonging to an individual she was dating online. The person in question orchestrated the scheme from Nigeria, and his only goal was to steal funds from the pensioner.The woman, whose name was not identified, started chatting with the scammer in May 2020, who introduced himself as a US Army surgeon. Their communication in the following months progressed to a relationship and switched to Google Handouts.At one point, the wrongdoer told the woman he was in love with her and needed money to end his contract and be with her. He insisted that the only way to receive funds was if the lady transferred some to a particular bitcoin wallet, promising to pay her back in time.She withdrew cash from her bank account and deposited the notes in BTC ATMs across Nottingham. However, the lady soon realized she had sent over $200,000 of her savings to a fraudster and not a noble surgeon who wanted to be with her.After opening a case, the local police partnered with her bank and managed to refund her nearly $135,000. Still, she felt devastated and warned others to be extra cautious when Web dating.Police and Crime Commissioner ‚Äì Caroline Henry ‚Äì highlighted the authorities‚Äô efforts that helped the woman restore some of her drained assets. She also urged people to contact law enforcement agencies as soon as they have any doubts about such scams:‚ÄúWe would also urge anyone going through a similar scenario to contact the police. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed to tell us what you are going through. We can help and support you if you are going through a rough time.‚ÄùThe police further said people should not stop using dating sites but follow some essential rules, such as never accepting friend requests from individuals they don‚Äôt know. Revealing too many personal details or sending money to someone they have only met online are also to be avoided.The Similar Case of a British ManAn anonymous UK resident parted with a significant amount of funds after a woman he was messaging on a dating website conned him. His mysterious lover, called Jia, displayed herself as a successful cryptocurrency investor with ‚Äúinside knowledge‚Äù and told him to invest in bitcoin via a dubious application.The man ended up allocating $200,000 when he saw his balance ‚Äúhad been cleared.‚Äù He asked Jia for an explanation, but she was reluctant to help, saying she had to fly to Australia and spend time with her sick aunt.The desperate person realized he had become a victim of a cryptocurrency scam and admitted that if it was not for his mother, he might have committed suicide.How This Woman Lost Over $200K in a Crypto Romance Scam",

And since we are in the computer age, people take advantage of these amenities and commit atrocious acts. I wouldn't blame the lady for not seeing through the fake and scamming intentions of the guy because he probably may have looked genuine and concerned whereas he was only preying on her emotions¬†Sad that she fell hook, line and sinker for the sucker but good thing too that at least she was able to recover a greater part of the funds. One just has to be careful and wary of these scammers, though.",

Usually in these type of scams, it‚Äôs hard to find the scammer and the money or Bitcoins were lost forever. The real question is how they were able to get the money back? And what about the rest of the Bitcoins? The scammer have sold the rest coins? Nevertheless, it proved that the scammer was a newbie, and didn‚Äôt use the mixer to mix the coins, for which i guess the police have traced him back. It‚Äôs really sad to hear about such scamming incidents. Moreover we can only warn people to be careful about these scams.",

It is really unfortunate, and this story has been repeated in various parts of the world before and not only in the UK, so there is no crypto romance and dating for money, whoever asks for this really does not have sincerity in his feelings and it is good that she has recovered a large part of her stolen money and I hope that the police will catch this scammer and imprison him soon.",

Such scammers exist not only online but also offline. And such fraud is more prevalent offline than online. It has become a news item due to the fact that Bitcoin is involved here. An old woman may have trusted this scammer a little too much and as a result of paying such a large amount of money she thought nothing of it and didn't even feel the need to inform anyone.
