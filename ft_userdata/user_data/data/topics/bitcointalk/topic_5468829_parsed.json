If you notice price of things dey go up anyhow and e nor dey gree come down. The challenge with real estate investment be say you fit go buy property from person, the person go sell for you and come still sell the same property to four other people or you go dey invest in those fake real estate companies way dey advertise say you fit own your own land with just 100k. Other than that, real estate dey really boom.",

But I am not into it because I think it requires huge amount of money, unlike with the small amount of money that you can use to buy bitcoin.Quote from: SatoPrincess on October 01, 2023, 10:50:39 PMThe challenge with real estate investment be say you fit go buy property from person, the person go sell for you and come still sell the same property to four other people or you go dey invest in those fake real estate companies way dey advertise say you fit own your own land with just 100k.If someone do not know what to do about real estate, he should consult his lawyer to show him the way. It is better to pay your lawyer some money than to lose a property because you are not having the legal documents and government backing.After a proper guide from your first investment, you will be able to do the necessary steps after that without anyone in the next investment, but always consult your lawyer whenever and wherever you think is necessary.",

E be wan ask say, for naija , the business dey easy abi e hard, if you no say you get experience for the business abeg come make you share knowledge on how to do am. So before I go tell you some things make I make you understand say difference dey with the way you read about Real estate for online and wetin dey happen for Nigeria. Oyinbo real estate is mostly about buying already built house, office building etc either new ones and they rent am out or old ones and they put small money into am and rebuild the thing to today standards come rent or sell am but Nigeria own is mostly about land with other few people wey get the cash wey dey buy estates and come rent am out dey collect yearly rent. Make we talk about the buying of land aspect of Real estate because na that one cheap pass and they very profitable pass for Nigeria. The business dey very easy to do when you get the cash and do am well, no go alone go buy land because for Nigeria they way you present yourself na so people go threat you. Go with lawyers and witness (men wey get weigh for the community wey you wan buy land) and finalized the deal with your landlord, after that one make your lawyer follow up with other necessary documents to get to make you have full ownership of the land then secure your land with fencing. When you do things like this, even the landlord go fear to wan resell your land. QuoteIs real estate business lucrative in Nigeria?To answer your question yes, e dey very lucrative but you no go do am like small pikin or e get people's wey be say their only work for life na to dey steal people land with legal or spiritual way and dem go come for you so you need dey prepared. If you get better 5-10 million and land never too cost for your area, brother go buy land and fence am. When development go come your side na when you go know say real estate business na blood money. Land wey you buy 1 million fit give you 5/10 million when you commot all expenses from the land. Just no joke with your investment, secure your land very well, settle the other small small things wey dey dey for land buying so dem no go get any reason to talk say you no pay for you land finish come sell am and even though you dun do everything, keep money for court cases as dem go surely come but with a good lawyer and all your documents intact, you go always win your case.",

      "body": "Real Estate dey hard to get on to because you either but for resale of you build and if u want take that as a source of income, u need to check ur pocket to know the level u  fit invest on. This na why most real estates get doomed to fail where by, them no overview their venture on the scale of wetin them dey invest on and the capital set to take rise the investment.So in a time along the lines them dey fail to fit Finnish up that which them don start leaving the venture on suspend or on pending probably unable to carry it on again to a finishing level and if to be resale, e go come be like say u be distress seller cuz the matter don choke and u go decide to sell am the least instead of a to talk lost.Otherwise, if u succeed to the finishing levels, u don stand to a reliable earnings source of income with no random marketing skills required and doesn't require employees way supposed dey cut ur incomes as u receive.This also no require you things like restocking like our other conventional business but maybe once a while requires u to do maintenances but depending on material qualities. This also saves u management stresses. Most happy 1 of am be say na long time goal of financial obtainment whether na empty land for resale of a built structure for resale all legit. Land no dey routine and no today and tomorrow house dey stay b4 e fit require just maintenance.Warning>>> If u most get on built structures, you must get to a modern style so that e no go cost u waste of finances as a case of restructuring & be aware say na modern world we dey now & people dey go 4 modern tins so ur structures must be modernized and ur land must be in a acceptable locations considering disasters such as flooding area's, I security areas and good land soil textures to fit give reliability to ur structure on-top.These considerations and the case of the modelity has made real estate business a competitive business sector and people also look at something furnished that can be affordable.For sure in life wetin good requires a lot and once achieved na 1 in town. So as this real estate business. So as far as this say come to existence that \"Great thing's doesn't mostly comes from the comfort zones\", so as people, landlords and landlady's and so on leaves their homes to elsewhere for greener pasture sake so more real estate is in demands and so on it e riches the investor on that sectors.",

Real estate is making people and I think that is one of the trending businesses currently and that comes with a good bag of money it is not only in Nigeria but it is a global thing houses are a necessity that plenty of people need, it is just like a product you can not do without just like food too, because if you go to most of the major cities see most of the building in some estates for places like Abuja were you see good buildings in term of quality and standard but in term of affordability is not affordable at all how can an ordinary man be able to buy a house worth of 200 to 400 million and even more no be juju be that.Going to real estate in Nigeria is easy for marketers but not for investors because seeing does house you will know that millions are spent on houses, but marketing does houses can give you a good percentage if you are able to sell any of does houses,  if you have interest in real estate you can try your luck.",
