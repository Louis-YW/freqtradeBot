Staking Solana in the past months has been not just hitting two birds for me, but more because of the potential airdrop from several projects. I mainly stake it on Jito, then deposit those JitoSOL into margin.fi. Both protocols (Jito and Margin) have points system which likely is meant for their upcoming airdrop. So with that strategy I got:7% SOL yieldRising SOL priceJito pointsMargin.fi pointsThat's four birds with one stone.",

For USDT it can be considered but for staking, you need to lose ownership and trust a platform that can be hacked at any moment so it is not a goos strategy in my opinion.",

Remember that every staking program has a time period (on-chain), I once had an unpleasant experience when I was staking $ROSE coins, because unstaking took a lot of time, I lost my selling moment, and that reduced the return I should received.Staking should be done during a bearish market (case study on a token that you are sure of its fundamentals), which will make you stronger to become a diamond hand.",

Is staking the perfect passive income strategy for the bull market, or are there nuances we should consider?Staking is another way we can earn in the market while we are holding. since there had been speculations that the bull trend would be in a moment, it is important for us to keep holding our coins in our portfolio or transfer it to exchanges where we can be able to stake it and earn extra coin while we wait for the bull market to come. The only way we can make interesting profits from the market is buy taking the risk of buying and holding. Staking is a way of holding and earning at the same time putting our coins in use while we accumulate more coins for the bull market loading.",

And it doesn’t matter if you are staking during the bull run or not, because even if it was the bear market, the tokens you earn can still be of great value whenever the bull run comes. I’ve made some gains from staking and it’s something I would greatly recommend, however, you should DYOR as the token/coin matters a lot.",

In the bull market most of the projects usually go up so if the token you are staking is fundamentally strong, you can earn a good amount of passive income at the same time your token price will increase eventually. In the bull market even a stable coin can give you a good APR on the lending platform if you don't want to take unnecessary risks.",

I know that in a bullish market we can easily spend generously and make money easily through many different forms, but everything is only serious when the problem is as risky as those things. Like a few cases in the past from the XRP story, but anyone who falls into that situation will realize that nothing is absolutely safe in investment.",

Is staking the perfect passive income strategy for the bull market, or are there nuances we should consider?Staking is lock up mechanism to prevent people from selling, there is nothing good about it as I have experience in this market. Let us do some simple analysis:An altcoin promises to give 9% APR for staking reward yearly. Now, you staked your coin to improve the security as they say and then all of a sudden, the coin start pump and this pump happen in just a week to a new all time high but you cannot sell because there is a penalty if you don't reach the agreed date and may even take 14 days to unlock just to prevent market dump. In the process, if you are a whale that unlock, it's going to inform traders that a load of coins will be unlock to the market in 14 days and smart money will sell their coins and exit before that day leaving you with loss from staking and loss of not been able to sell at all time high. What's the profit you get in staking?The only time I think it's ideal for staking is in bear market. If you buy a coin, you can stake it when nothing good is happening at that time, you can be earning some good passive income but it's better to unlock immediately as bull run approaches so that when the coin hit all time high or have enough profit, you can simply sell your token and exit the market in peace. Staking in bull market is just a strategy team are using to avoid people from selling and reduce coins in circulation.",

I had a friend who staked $DOT during last bull market when it was trading around $50, thinking to have stable income with it. What happened? It's now trading at $5. With $DOT's staking apr ~15%, he would have been better of selling his stash then at $50, and buying back later. He'd be having lot more $DOT this way compared to his staking earnings.",

Fast chain and environmentally friendly coin is everywhere so Proof of Stake is at peak now even tho developer tweak it like DPos, Masternode, etc. So it gives a lot of opportunities for passive income strategy.The best way to staking is at bear market in my opinion because the coin is at cheap rate you can continue DCA and stake it at the same time so when bull market you can sell some of it or just sell the earn from staking. Eth usually over 4% annual but there is ton out there more than 4% if you surf the DeFi world you can even earn more than that",

If it's altcoins, I'd say staking can increase the potential of more profits but this is only recommended for a user that wants to max out their potential earnings. Otherwise, it's best to just self-custody the tokens. For Bitcoin, there's no staking activity so I think OP was talking about altcoins specifically. If the next bull run plays out like the ones before it, staking would be the best route for anyone looking to max out gains in that you earn staking rewards while enjoying price gains on capital and staking rewards tokens as well.",
