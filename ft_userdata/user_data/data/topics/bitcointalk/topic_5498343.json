Regulatory bodies and financial institutions are increasingly encouraging and merging Bitcoin into their systems, indicating how reliable  and potential for legitimate use in the business.Bitcoin is legitimate to us in the crypto world and to all bitcoin enthusiasts asides from those set of people that don’t want bitcoin to become legally used in the world. Despite the transparency in bitcoin and how it has helped to change the narratives of the world to some aspect, some group of people still find it unattractive and will always see it as a scam. Let those who believe in it embrace it and those that don’t should not make others feel they are trailing on the wrong path. QuoteBitcoin is reliable for easy transaction, it is a system way of saving, it is transparent in trading.Due to its unique financial stability companies are happy to use it in the legitimate ecosystem due to its legal rights in the country.Not all countries have actually made it legitimate to use and also seen it as a legal entity till date. The few of them that are okay with it have strict regulations imposed on its use and that has made them limited to some extent of its maximal use when looked into.",

Regulatory bodies and financial institutions are increasingly encouraging and merging Bitcoin into their systems, indicating how reliable  and potential for legitimate use in the business .As far as I can tell, regulatory bodies haven’t been much of a pro-Bitcoin up to this day and that’s mainly due to the fact that, Bitcoin is above regulations once it isn’t at the exchange level. The only way there could be some regulation to how Bitcoin operates is by regulating the CEX that exists within the system and that haven’t been archived with great success.Hence, for regulatory bodies to be so pro-Bitcoin to the extent of encouraging and merging it into system, I don’t agree very much with that. You don’t find these people encouraging what they can’t have control over. It’s the sole reason while many nations are against it.Also, you might be confusing Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. I think the blockchain technology is the one thing you might have talked more about in your thread given that, it’s one way to ensure proper ledger arrangement and tracing, which is verifiable by everyone and anyone around the world. This also isn’t peculiar to Bitcoin as the technology have been applied in various fields for its reliable and ease to data collection, reproducibility and verifiable model.",

The only scams is into those hyips/ponzis or simply those scams that lurking around on which they are really that trying out to make use of Bitcoins main advantages like being anonymous and non reversible trait on which is why it would really be that commonly be connected with those fraudsbecause those scammers could really be able to get out without being traced. Well, even if we do tend to look on how its been that called or whatever it would be neither be a scam,.fraud thing, but still it is really that standing strong despite of those issues or whatever things that been connected to it.We are still on that adoption and recognition period on which only a few percentage of world population does know about Bitcoins existence. Sooner or later when we are really that heading into that point that it would really be that recognized by all.",

So, saying that a country that has banned BTC and crypto does not mean they can't use blockchain technology. Our government has banned crypto but they initiated a project to implement blockchain technology in a bank you can find the news on Google.

So considering the ban ratio with legal ones, I think these 54 or around it, are the dumb ones, they should really have accepted crypto otherwise they will be late in the race, and the later they will start the more late they will arrive at the destination.",

With the introduction of Bitcoin, transparency has become a topic in the world of finance. What makes most of us like Bitcoin is because Bitcoin is not backed by the government or world bank, which means it's never affected by monetary policy and inflation rate.The Bitcoin security was well designed by Satoshi. Allowing every validated transaction to be evenly broadcast on all nodes, which means everyone (node), sees the transaction and permits it. Distributing of transactions on the Bitcoin network has made it very difficult for attackers to penetrate.Bitcoin is reliable for transactions, but sometimes it might be difficult due to congestion, but I think the LN got you covered if you know how to use it. A system of saving (investment) is a general practice even on Bitcointalk. We all accumulate Bitcoin in form of investment, some for long term, while others for short term.I don't think companies are investing for the financial stability you mentioned which I find confusing, but  I think that they are investing heavily due to what Bitcoin have to offer in the future, and that's massive profits for all investors.",

For this kind of thing, it goes back to some media that always gives bitcoin as something negative which ultimately changes the stigma for ordinary people that bitcoin is a tool to damage in the end without them looking further because the media always gives unfavorable statements in the news that occurs for bitcoin.In addition, the truth is that those who still say bitcoin as something bad happens because they are reluctant to find out more and only see the outside without wanting to know what it is like inside that makes bitcoin will be considered a scam even though they do not understand and do not know what bitcoin is and what the function of bitcoin is because they only think that because they dont know how bitcoin works but if in the end they have tried to be in bitcoin and learn well then I can guarantee that their views will change .",
