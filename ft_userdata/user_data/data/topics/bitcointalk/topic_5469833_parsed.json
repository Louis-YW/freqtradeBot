For others, they won't notice it much, but if an individual has a passion for trading, having an idea to be able to predict the direction of the price is really a huge help.It's just like me; I just now somehow understood what it means in its actual appearance when doing trading activity in daily chart trading. I will look forward to this series you will do; it will be a great help to the community that wants to expand its knowledge of crypto trading.",

Price action is what some traders mostly use to analyze market movement and keep things in the right proportion. We need to action canddle stick pattern very well because this gives us a hedge in the market so when we see a particular candsle stick pattern, we can be able to understand what the market is likely to so next and how we can act on it. Trading is very inspiring and full of learning. Even the professional trades are still learning to be a better trader and earn from the market.",

Keep sharing OP.For me, the doji candle are not confirmation candle that the trend will reversed because it only indicates to an equal volume of demand and supply in a specific time frame. Mostly it was used as a confirmation that the trend is running of strength and the reversal will going to occur soon. The best reversal confirmation candlestick that we can consider is the pin bar because it clearly indicates that the opposite direction are now in-control of the market. We usually see it in the chart before the impulsive trend occur.",

Well and this is the importance that we must have time to at least pay attention to market movements or habits that often occur in one of the markets, when we are used to seeing events that are there then obviously then it will greatly help us to be able to look for clear indications that will result in a fairly precise decision about buying or selling. I think this will be very useful for those traders who like to invest in the short term. Honestly, I am also one of the traders who always create their own strategies from understanding the candlestick patterns that I get from market habits, I feel it myself that this is a fairly effective way. Therefore, I have also told several people that trading is very difficult and cannot be learned instantly because of course we need time to know the habits of the market first, one of which is by always paying attention to the charts that occur in the market.True, not everyone can understand everything in trading, especially in understanding this very complicated candlestick, I also took more than a year to learn some candlesticks that have indications and influence the next market movement. In my experience do not use too many indicators there because each indicator has a different meaning in terms of indications and you will be confused when the indicators you use contradict each other. So just use a few indicators, one or two to determine the support and resistance areas and then after that you can look for confirmation from candle formation, if all of them show the same direction then you can start to open trades.",

There are people who still follow these old methods to trade crypto but there won't be much positive result from using them. Support and resistance are the only two most powerful price actions that can give accurate predictions most of the time in crypto.You know, I want you to understand that support and resistance are undeniably two of the most important concepts when an individual trader performs technical analysis. Where we can use it to predict something, we want to know where the future price movement will go. Take note that the word \"future\" means it is coming or it will happen; it means we are predicting the possible direction it will go, which also means we are not sure if it will rise or fall. This is where you should understand that there is no 100% accuracy in the prediction we will make.I also want you to know that support and resistance levels are not always reliable. It should not be used in isolation to make decisions about the trading we do. Now, my question to you is: How can you identify the support and resistance, dude? Are there things to do here? Of course, yes. What should you do to identify support and resistance? When you answer this question of mine, you can tell if you have enough knowledge of trading, and if you don't know the answer to this question, I can tell you the answer here so that others here can know.Because if you can't answer this question of mine exactly or even close to what I expect, all I can say to you is \"Study more.\" Because even though I already know something, I'm still studying it until now.",
