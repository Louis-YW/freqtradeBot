  "content": "Monday 26 December 2022 around 17.30 WIB, a boat and 185 Rohingya refugees were stranded in our territorial sea area. Based on the confession of one of the refugees, they had been on the high seas for 35 days since the start of their journey from their country of origin, the condition of the refugees was very concerning because many were dehydrated, while the Police, TNI and local people began to take action for the refugees and evacuate them to safer place.Our government has endeavored to provide initial assistance as a form of humanitarian solidarity, starting with the provision of a public kitchen as a place to eat/drink for them, beds, blankets and medicines as an initial step in emergency response. Many social organizations started arriving on the second day, humanitarian volunteers, social organizations and social activists also helped.Some of the assistance, in the form of clothing, food and other needs has been fulfilled temporarily, the health condition of the Rohingya refugees is really apprehensive, because they experience dehydration, itching and there is one four month pregnant woman who is quite worrying.¬† MEETING WITH LHOK KAJU COMMUNITY ENGLISH CENTER (LEC) REFUGE ASSISTANCE PREPARATIONOn the third day, the Lhok Kaju Engglis Center (LEC) community and I began to be touched by what happened to them, moreover there were several small children who were stranded along with 185 other people on the ship. We started to discuss and try to see this case as humanity and intend to provide assistance, so at the end of the discussion we agreed to conduct a survey of their needs, because my community does not have special funds assisted by any institution, so I took the initiative to sell the bitcoins that I got from the campaign Duelbits managed by Hampuzz for necessary needs.At first glance the Duelbits campaign managed by Hampuz has been running for 118 weeks and I just joined this campaign for more or less five weeks and I think almost everyone knows this campaign, so I don't need to explain at length.This is complete data of refugees?Male 83 peopleWomen 70 peopleChildren 32 peopleThe total number is 185 peopleOn the fourth day, we started visiting refugee camps and brought 50 aid packages in the form of food, drink and clothing, we also provided haircut services for Rohingya refugees, at 10.00 WIB we arrived there and started distributing the aid we brought, while 3 barbers had also carry out the work according to the agreement we have planned, some of the volunteers that I have have also tried to interact with children who are still quite difficult to approach, because they may not have recovered from the trauma they have felt, until exactly 17.00 WIB all distributions have been completed and going according to plan.¬† HELP PACKAGE PACKAGING PROCESS¬† JOURNEY TO REFUGEE PLACES DISTRIBUTION OF HELP PACKAGES TO CHILDREN DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTHES FOR REFUGEES AND RECEIVE BY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES¬† POST TRAUMA EDUCATION AND PLAY WITH REFUGE CHILDREN¬† ¬† REFUGE HAIRCUT PROCESSConclusionI want to do any work that can be useful for others, even though it doesn't seem to have a big impact on refugees, but this is proof that the Lhok Kaju Engglis Center (LEC) community has sensitivity towards other people, even though this assistance is not that big and has meaning luxurious. But most importantly our presence can give them a smile on the suffering they have.There is a lot of support on the bitcointalk forums proposing that Satoshi Nakamoto be awarded some sort of Nobel prize or whatever. But I don't think that's enough, because we never really got to know Satoshi Nakamoto, so I don't think this gift will affect anything. Personally, I am taking another step in honor of the great work launched by Satoshi Nakamoto, by bringing social values closer to the people and starting small things that will make bitcoin adoption more acceptable in the future, despite what I do not necessarily successful, but at least I've tried to bring bitcoin closer to adoption in the area where I live.I hope that when many people start to believe in bitcoin in the future, then from there the role of bitcoin can touch many people, not only as an investment, bitcoin is also able to touch social and human values that are practiced by many people.Personally I want to thank you very much Satoshi Nakamoto for the great work you have created, so it has had such an impact on my life.Thank you very much Hampuz for trusting me to be in the campaign that you are managing, so that I can carry out social humanitarian activities.Finally, thank you very much for the Lhok Kaju Engglis Center (LEG) community, we have been together for a long time and have done many charity activities for several humanitarian activities.",

The initiative for helping those in need is really good and a much needed one. Donating your 5-weeks signature campaigns earnings go fund this project is no easy thing, there are other personal needs you could have used the money for but you chose to help others. No matter how small your donations were, the people will be happy that someone showed care for them, that act of kindness alone will give them hope to face another day.",

It is an exciting thing to know that those in need of help were helped by you and other community members and am glad the government is also taking necessary steps to help the refugees also by providing essential relief materials and you and other community members also contributing to your quarter to see the trauma refugee getting helped. But I will like to know, are the refugee victims of war or just meditation travellers? But all the same, I will like to thank you once again for putting humanity first.",

Just by the way thoughI know alot of peeps in here have planned on this; spreading the love to places where they're needed the most which is exactly why I encouraged everyone ( pon' the BTT Christmas celebration thread).. I guess you had a nice clue on that, though I wasn't expecting you to have conceived the sane plans too, kudos dude! I dunno why, but I believe this dude isn't a billionaire like most of us in here -- that's to let everyone understand that if we think we truly LOVE without GIVING, it ain't worth the stress at all. Secondly, it's not about how much anyone has -- I've been running several voluntarily projects that involves alot of cash on my own expense for strange people I don't even know... I know alot of peeps have been doing same too ; I believe in the impact we make, not how much we've made.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

      "body": "I want to share something after reading this post. When I was like 16/17, there was this dude I knew, and he used to earn his income from freelancing. As far as I knew, he earned almost $2000 per month. I was curious and also wanted to make money like him. So I asked him to teach me. He used to do graphics design back in the day. With a borrowed laptop from a friend, I used to learn from him. That laptop was very low spec. So that didn't go so well. But when I started, I used to think that if I make even half what he makes, I can help a lot of poor people. I can build a house to live for those who lives under the open sky in winter season. Skip past some years. Did not know what happened to me. All these pressure and all problems made me forgot about what I have wished for. It's not like I don't help people. I do, and I try my best to help them as much as I can. But you my guy! You are just something else. As someone dealing with all of this, I can feel how you also have your own life to deal with too. Yet you are helping these people while doing all these too. You have made me think about my past again and my dream to do it. From today, I am going to save a portion of my income towards helping people who needs it. Pray for me and wish me luck so that I can become like you.Respect man! <3",

Trust me?Quote from: Wiwo on January 03, 2023, 09:38:53 PM>snip We have never tried to ask about this problem, because the presence of our community was purely a small effort to help them. To be honest, this point is a question that we avoid quite often, because it will give birth to many wild assumptions about the concerns of fellow human beings.Let the answers you get from various media, because we personally don't want to enter too far into the conditions they experience.Quote from: Sandra_hakeem on January 03, 2023, 09:44:19 PM>snip Hopefully you and I are always involved in social activities, who are able to give affection to people in need, not how important the amount is given, but the extent to which we can give each other to those who need it.There will be another life that makes them pray for our safety, it happens for the efforts that I have made before.Quote from: tjtonmoy on January 03, 2023, 10:48:29 PM>snipThat is a considerable income if you live in our country, with that much income you will be able to build a non-formal school for underprivileged children, as I have done together with other volunteer friends in the Lhok Kaju English Center community (Lec), this school is still running until now and I am a permanent donor who still set aside the income that I get in Bitcoin investment and in the business that I developed.Bitcoin Changes Lives, Touches Non-Formal Education for Underprivileged ChildrenMay we all do the same and greater than what I did, we will be remembered after we are gone, based on the kindness we left while we were still alive, this glory is actually a prayer that will continue to flow when we are gone.Quote from: Frankolala on January 04, 2023, 09:30:55 AM>snipEveryone has the same opportunity in spreading love and affection of fellow human beings, sometimes people are too reluctant to start, even though they have the opportunity to do the slightest and I'm sure your abilities will be far greater than what I have ever done.The duelbits campaign that I live at this time, only a way to the small things that I do, is not comparable to what other people do, but there are still many big things that we must continue to do together.CONCLUSIONQuoteIn honor of the great work that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, by spreading love for Bitcoin values to the closest people and to all people in the world, without having to see religion, ethnicity and culture. This is more commensurate than giving a Nobel or whatever name is called.If everyone takes small steps to spread the values of goodness listed in Bitcoin, then one day people will judge that bitcoin can not only be used as an investment, but will touch other things that are more useful.",

Great, your LEC community has come together to help each other on a humanitarian issue. Your desire is very big in helping others even though they are your distant relatives from Rohingya.I think you are an activist right now, it shows in how you and your community are doing it for people.
