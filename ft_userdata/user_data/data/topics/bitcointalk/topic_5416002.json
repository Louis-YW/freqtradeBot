  "content": "What is the Bitcoin Halving (Halvening)?New bitcoins are issued by the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes. For the first four years of Bitcoin's existence, the number of new bitcoins issued every 10 minutes was 50. Every four years, this number is cut in half. In 2012, the number of new bitcoins issued every 10 minutes dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25. In 2016, it dropped from 25 to 12.5. In the most recent May 11, 2020 halving, the reward dropped from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block.In the upcoming 2024 halving, the reward will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.                                               Bitcoin Halving Dates History               2012 HalvingThe 2012 block halving was the first halving and happened on November 28th, 2012. The halving block was mined by SlushPool by someone using a Radeon HD 5800 miner.New BTC Per Block Before: 50 BTC per blockNew BTC Per Block After: 25 BTC per blockPrice on Halving Day: $12.35Price 150 Days Later: $127.00       2016 HalvingThe second halving occurred on July 9th, 2016.New BTC Per Block Before: 25 BTC per blockNew BTC Per Block After: 12.5 BTC per blockPrice on Halving Day: $650.63Price 150 Days Later: $758.81     2020 HalvingThe third halving occurred on May 11, 2020.New BTC Per Block Before: 12.5 BTC per blockNew BTC Per Block After: 6.25 BTC per blockPrice on Halving Day: $8821.42Price 150 Days Later: $10,943.00     Current Bitcoin Block SubsidyThe current Bitcoin block subsidy is 6.25 bitcoins per block. When block 840,000 is hit in 2024, the subsidy will drop to 3.125 bitcoins (BTC) per block.SourceThe next bitcoin halving is less than two years, to me, this period will be different because, for the first time, I really am paying attention to important aspects of btc and keeping myself updated as well.I can't really say much about previous halving other than just reading about them (probably because I was not holding btc) but now is different because I have been accumulating in every little way I can. So dear colleagues, What are your expectations? other than price increase  *Do you expect to see widespread adoption and acceptance?*More involvement from big companies?*More popular?*Increase number of users?*Any other.......",

This is wrong too. New bitcoins are generated in every block mined. It's estimated that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average. A new block may be mined in a few seconds. It's also possible that it takes an hour.",

Assuming the average block time for these blocks will be exactly 10 minutes, the halving should be 828,070 minutes later which is 575 days, 1 hour and 10 minutes later. With this assumptions, the halving will be on May, 02, 2024. You see exactly the same date on Coingecko and bitcoinblockhalf.buybitcoinworldwide (which was used by OP) and coinmarketcap (which was mentioned by you) are using different methods for estimating the halving date. For example, you can use the average block time of previous halving periods or average block time of the previous difficultly adjustment period. No one knows the exact date of halving.",

In fact, it might not have any impact at all, aside from the FUD or FOMO people might experience before and after, and the price growth often happens months later, which makes it unlikely that it can be reasonably attributed to halving and not some other events.Even this post shows the price 150 days later (so after a significant amount of time), and the increase is by, like, 15-20% (apart from 2012), which isn't anything that couldn't happen without halving.I don't have any particular expectations for 2024 event, and I am almost sure we'll see a major price increase of Bitcoin before that because it's still a long time away.",

We all know that prices are going to rise again after the halving in 2024. The bitcoin miners are wanting to be compensated for the reduced mining rate. If prices for bitcoins are not rising after the halving, the miners will just stop bringing new bitcoins to the market. That means that prices have to rise or demand for bitcoins as to fall. It's not realistic to expect a slowdown in bitcoin demand, even now with the World having to deal with so many issues there is still a lot of trading happening in the bitcoin market. I am not sure if we are going to see a new ATH in 2024, but rising prices means that bitcoins become attractive again as investment. And the higher the price rises the more new investors are going to join the market.",

I also expect that ahead of the halving, the bitcoin price will be higher than the last ATH price and maybe over $200k as you said.",

And since Bitcoin is growing older, many more people are interested and accepting it as a profitable asset, so I think we will have a lot of new investors who will want to profit on the expected price pump around the halving.On the note of the price speculation, I wouldn't really speculate a number since we don't know how will the market hold until the halving. A price increase is inevitable, but we don't know what the current price of that period will even be, it might even be less than expected. Of course, fingers crossed for a huge ATH",

Miners have no way to make the price go up by just mining, if that would have been the case we would simply buy three times the gear that is mining now, and look, the price would have to go up 3x times cause mining is not profitable!Quote from: buwaytress on October 05, 2022, 09:47:29 AMDidn't feel too long ago to me when we had last halving, it definitely doesn't feel too long more to the next one. 3+ BTC per block may seem even \"admissible\" to miners if you consider how long they've been enjoying and taking profits (and yeah many are supposed to be almost underwater now but still think that's an exaggeration) It's not an exaggeration, I'm looking at a machine earning 7$ a day (soon $6 the way the hashrate is going)  with free electricity and the same machine going for around $2k on the market, 3 years of ROI with free electricity. Yeah there have been good times in mining, one year ago we were talking about $40 a day for the same machine but think of the future, with this kind of revenue once you have a miner breaking down, do you think of replacing it or you would simply keep with just what you have?",

Of course we will see improvement in all of above points but it will not be a gamechanger and none of them will depend on halving (which is the point of this thread). If talking about halving I'm sure that each new halving will have lower fundamental impact on bitcoin value. 4th halving will have negligible impact on value, no one will care about 5th one because:First halving decreased inflation from 25% to 12%, second halving from 9% to 4,5% third one from 3,8% to 1,9%. So every next halving has weaker fundamental influence on price Fifth halving will decrease inflation from 0.4% to 0.2%. No one will really care that day. No matter if bitcoin inflation is 0.4% or 0.2% its both close to zero compared to 10% CPI.",
