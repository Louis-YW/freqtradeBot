  "content": "For years I have been using 24 x ver008c risers without issues - never had one go bad.  But there's been numerous new versions come out since then and the latest seems to be the ver016 which has two LED displays (voltage and temperature).  It also has 10 capacitors!  I've ordered some to try out but I'm a bit skeptical that 10 capacitors will make any difference whatsoever compared to 4 capacitors.  If anything, there's more chance of failure considering a single shorted capacitor can kill the board.  Sounds like a marketing gimmick like those 10 bladed razors.  More isn't necessarily better.I also wonder if having a metal shielded slot makes a difference.  Has anyone found improved stability with the newer risers?  Like ver010 and up?",

If the old ones didn't haveany problems how can the new ones be more stable?New GPUs have more power volatility so the extra caps might be useful, they're also quite heavyso the extra support for the slot may also be useful. I hate that everything has LEDs now.I certainly wouldn't pay more for them. I'd also be concerned about any new model untill it has been proven.",

      "body": "Metal shield would help depends on how you mount the gpu, if you let the riser (screwed) carry the gpu then it might help.Voltage might be good, when there are minor burns in wire the gpu can't pull more power and less hashes (if the system didn't hang)..i think, amps is a lot better indicator than voltage.If caps backs each other, like if 6 out of 10 is working and 4 are bad, the riser still works, then more is better. I think it acts as electrical noise filters.Led lights should indicate something like gpu is unplugged/loose, riser is powered off (12v power not connected), and usb cable not connected.Makes troubleshooting a lot easier.I got an old motherboard i'm stil using circa 2007 or 2008. There are four led lights, if they lit all green then i knew checking on the rig is by remote login, if not then i might need to plug the monitor to check what's up.",

Temp in the mining room (specific spot, where rig/gpu is located), it will be useful if you are reaching max allowable temp in your mining room.my problem with that v016 is that it reduced the power connection (sockets), yeah a pcie socket is sturdy enough for the power supply of that riser, extra sockets are useful for me.",

      "body": "Yeah, those new risers definitely look better in quality (both in components and soldering) than some of the older ones.Assuming those capacitors are in parallel, each one would share a portion of the current, thus making it easier on each individual capacitor. By the grouping it would appear they are in three banks, protecting three different sections of the circuit board, but without actually looking at one its hard to tell from just the picture. Assuming the the capacitor quality is equal or better than previous generations of these risers, I would think it would be a more reliable design and thus reduce the chance of shorting.I also have never lost a GPU due to a riser going bad. I have had my share of bad risers, but never one causing any direct harm to the attached GPU or MB. In any case, the better quality on these new risers is much appreciated to help protect the newer more expensive GPUs.",
