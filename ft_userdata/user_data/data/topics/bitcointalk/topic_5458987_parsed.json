Hell, you could even melt down and distill plastic into use-able fuel which won't gunk up the motor (much).It's not without its own solutions though. QuoteModified fuel systemsMost diesel car engines are suitable for the use of straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the viscosity and surface tension of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity; otherwise, poor atomization, incomplete combustion, and carbonization may result. One common solution is to add a heat exchanger and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO. The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up, and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil_fuelHuman ingenuity.QuoteBut I do like the idea of using waste to fuel Bitcoin mining. Another good idea would be to ferment alcohol from scraps or methane gas from cow dung.¬† I think philipma1957 posted something about starting a small scale mining farm that uses methane as an energy source besides his solar mining enterprise.",

Sure, it takes advantage of waste vegetable oil that would otherwise go to waste or harm the environment, but isn't burning oil even worse for the environment? On top of that, the actual effectiveness of such a generator is seriously up in the air.In my book, a smarter approach would be to store that oil and put it to good use in a different way. How about using it to heat buildings or greenhouses during those chilly winter months? Not only would it be more eco-friendly, but it would also serve a practical purpose.",

It sounds like a lot of extra work, but at the same time they don't seem to have many ASICs, so it must be feasible.Apart from that I find the concept interesting, I'd love to be able to recycle a polluting and wasteful resource to power some Antminers. Even if it's only two or three S9s, for example, they're will give satoshis that are practically free, and many of us (at least in my case) have old ASICs that have long since paid for themselves, which we could \"sacrifice\" for such a project.",

I've looked, and found several sources that are a bit contradictory. However, if I take the source that gives me the highest daily minimum wage in Guatemala, I come up with 101.05 GTQ for a day of 8 hours' work, which gives me around 12.94 USD.So 765 USD profit is not negligible, it would be like two months of local minimum wage. Where I have a little more doubt is on the ability of these ASICs to last over time in a stable manner if they don't bother to monitor humidity. Just as, to get the numbers mentioned above, they'd have to be able to keep them running 24/7, and I don't think that's the case.In any case, this is further proof that in low-income countries, BTC mining can be a game changer.",

I can't see how mining is a game changer for low-income countries, if the miner generates enough money for them it means the cost of buying and running that miner is also high with respect to their income, someone who lives in a rich country can save enough money in a week to buy a used miner for $500 without having to starve, someone in a poor country will need to work for months and months to afford that same miner.So really it's pretty much the same equation if you can easily afford to buy the miner - the income will be little to nothing, if the income is good, then you can't easily afford to buy the miner.In fact, if anything, one could argue that BTC mining favors the rich countries, people in rich countries have access to a lot of money, have excessive electricity which they can access,¬† in a pool/low-income country, none of that exists, and supply of electricity is probably not close to cover basic needs, expensive, unreliable, no source of funds to pursue any meaningful mining operation.As for these folks using cooking oil or whatever shit -- none of these methods are sustainable or feasible, you may come up with whatever way of generating electricity, but as long as the other folks can generate it a lot cheaper by burning coal or gas, it makes no sense, you are essentially competing against every other miner, whoever finds a way to make the cheapest electricity will win in the long run.There is a good reason why U.S miners could not compete against the Chinese, the Chinese had access to cheaper power and a lot of money, and so they did sit on the mining throne from the get-go until China banned miners, as soon as that happened, the second most potential country was the U.S, they have a lot of money and cheap power (not cheaper than China but cheaper than most other potential countries).Now the U.S is taking the lead, who else can compete against them now that China is gone? Russia, Russia has a lot of money and cheap power, how cheap? we don't know, but the bottom line is that you need both MONEY and CHEAP POEWR to benefit from BTC mining, which is why only countries with those two elements can afford to heavily mine bitcoin.",

      "body": "Quote from: mikeywith on July 13, 2023, 11:30:47 AMYou're right, but at the same time, there are places where electricity is close to free, and minimum incomes are low. People who earn more than the minimum income there can accumulate cheap, second-hand ASICs from a long-term perspective. There are also those who back in a days bought L3s (for example) at 70-80 usd, who mined on Nicehash or converted their LTC/DOGE into BTC and sold during the last bull run, must have been very pleased. Or with a 100 usd S9, actualy you earn 0.00090849BTC per month approximately, ROI would be 5-6 months with a dirty cheap electricity. It makes sense for someone which is almost not paying electricity, even with the rise of difficulty. So if the said guy accumulated cheap S9s or S15s for example, when difficulty was lower, it could be profitable for him.¬†For example, I was recently in Kosovo, with someone who had very very cheap electricity. He collects the cheapest ASICs possible, and has been accumulating them for a long time (several years). This gives him an income that's not insignificant back home (minimum wage more or less 200 EUR in Kosovo if I'm not wrong). Of course, we're not talking about mining on an industrial scale, but what I was trying to say is that over the long term, some people manage to obtain a small amount of sats that is not insignificant in proportion to their country's minimum income.It's much the same in Russia, where there's industrial mining that requires a lot of resources and investment. But you also meet people who have a few dozen ASICs accumulated over the years that generate an income that would enable them to live a little more comfortably. Of course, this isn't possible overnight, but I sincerely believe that places where the cost of living is low, and electricity affordable, are one of the few interesting opportunities for 'pleb' mining, even if it doesn't even represent 1% of the total hashrate and is insignificant in the proportion of the total hashrate.I can give my personnal situation as an example. Where I live, incomes are low, but if you manage to earn 100 EUR a month, you can already say that your rent is paid in most of cities. That's appreciable, even for people who earn more than the minimum wage. Personaly, when I work, I earn like 6-7 times the minimum legal salary, so I could afford to buy more ASICs from time to time. My mining farm is not crazy big, but thanks to it, if I wanted, I could stop working now and just sell my BTC each month, and live in a very comfortable way as long as the difficulty stays in her actual range. It wouldn't be possible in a Westerner country or in a country where cost of living is high. So keeping all these accumulated sats aside for the long term makes a lot of sense in my situation. It's almost free DCA, insofar as my ASICs are already profitable.On the other hand, from a professional, stable and industrial mining point of view, I totally agree with you. But that doesn't mean those guys who make the equivalent of a minimum income in \"BTC Savings\" every month don't exist, and in their case, if they accumulate these sats and sell in bullrun, it can be a very profitable game for them. Even if it's on a small scale, the ratio of earnings to cost of living could be to their advantage",

Russia, Russia has a lot of money and cheap power, how cheap? we don't know, but the bottom line is that you need both MONEY and CHEAP POEWR to benefit from BTC mining, which is why only countries with those two elements can afford to heavily mine bitcoin. Getting old cooking oil forever (years) can be done.¬†So I would argue the 'free' fuel could be endless (well for 10 years or more)But running a generator for 10 years I am not so sure.Getting the gear could be easy.A farm could dump gear the cost would be shipping it.I could give the guy m10's, s15's, t15's for shipping cost and a few dollars.When I was in the navy I could move a reasonable amount of gear from port to port.There were no miners in 1978, but if there were and a Philippine had the setup above I could get them 5 miners every year or so.People can make do. When all they have to give is labor the chance to burn the old oil as fuel and make a few more dollars would mean they would.I do think the stumbling block would be the generator not the fuel not the miners not the labor.Yeah the mining gear would die off fast 1-2 years at best.But the generator is a big cost. Hard to replace.",

There is a huge difference between someone living next to a river which they can drop in a turbine and power up their TV, and someone who lives in a desert and has to dig up a river all the way to the nearest lake, most people don't live next door to rivers, most people don't have a power generator sitting at the back yard, oh, and probably most KFCs don't change oil too often, so you need a lot of stars to align so can mine bitcoin using cooking oil.",
