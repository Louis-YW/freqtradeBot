  "content": "Hello Everyone,This is my first time I'm using Electrum Multisig wallet. I've created a 2/3 multisig wallet by using 1 Trezor Hardware wallet and 2 Electrum generated multi-sig wallets (I created one and then close the windows without adding other 2 consignees ... and on the second attempt I created new wallet and restored the old multisig wallet I cancelled by using master pub key and attached my hardware wallet to make the 3/2 combination) ... but now whenever I transfer funds from my wallet it only get signing command from my hardware wallet and Sign & Broadcast button grays out .. and status of the transaction become Partially Signed (1/2) and I don't see how to Sign my transaction from other two wallets I created on my laptop .. I even tried to create and new wallet by importing one of the created wallets but that wallet shows nothing ...",

      "body": "We'll need a bit more information to be able to help you out here. First of all, do you have the three seed phrases, one from each of the co-signing wallets? Secondly, you say you can sign a transaction using your Trezor, but you can't sign it from either of your Electrum multi-sig wallets? Do the addresses in the multi-sig Electrum wallets match up with addresses from the Trezor multi-sig wallet?",

      "body": "Ok, so if you've got the seed phrases then you should be able to recreate things and your funds should not be lost.The signing you are doing with your Trezor wallet - are you doing this via Electrum too? If so, when you created this wallet, did you use the master public keys from the other two seed phrases along with your Trezor wallet?If this is the case, then that wallet will only ever be able to sign one of the three parts, since it does not have the private key from the two Electrum seed phrases.You'll need to create a new Electrum wallet, using one of the Electrum seed phrases, the other Electrum master public key, and the Trezor master public key. Once you've signed the transaction once with the Trezor, you can save it to your disk and then load it in a wallet created with one of the Electrum seed phrases to sign it a second time.",

      "body": "well thank you so very much, this solved my problem. But I still have few questions to understand it completely and I'll be more than happy if you can help me out further.1- after creating a new wallet using 1 wallet with seed and the other one with master pub key + attaching trezor device, now when I go to send button and hit sign in my trezor signing pops up and when I sign it from trezor device it just simple send payment without asking me to sign from the 2nd and from the 3rd owners?2- in future what if these 3 owners (2 Computer wallets + 1 Hardware device) get apart ... how can they restore this multiple wallet if they don't have complete 3 wallets on hand? let's say I lose my hardware device but still have 2 wallets with seed and master .. how can I even restore my wallet without hardware ..? on 3/2 wallet creation it ask must to restore from all three otherwise it won't work ..?3- I tried to restore my 3/2 wallet by using 2-2 multisig wallets using 1seed + 1master (without hardware)... and seems like it doesnt' restore the actual wallet .. it is just a new wallet of 2-2... how can we restore these kind of wallets ..?4- Multisig only works for Bitcoin. What if I can use a hardware Trezor device which has many other crypto assets like ethereum and other assets, would my other assets would stay on the same hardware wallet ..? I mean whenever I need to transfer/access Bitcoin I use multiple using electrum .. and when I need to access other assets I use trezor suit to access them .. is it possible to use one device for two purposes ..?",

Usually, a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet is split across three wallets, so that each wallet contains only a single set of private keys. With such a set up, to make a transaction you must first sign it from one wallet with one private key, then move it to one of the other two wallets to sign it with a second private key. Once it has two signatures, it can be broadcast.However, you can also set it up so that a single wallet contains more than one set of private keys. If you have a wallet file which contains both an Electrum seed and can sign from your Trezor wallet, then this wallet will be able to provide the necessary two signatures on its own.Quote from: ilmeaalim on September 29, 2022, 09:30:40 AM2- in future what if these 3 owners (2 Computer wallets + 1 Hardware device) get apart ... how can they restore this multiple wallet if they don't have complete 3 wallets on hand? let's say I lose my hardware device but still have 2 wallets with seed and master .. how can I even restore my wallet without hardware ..? on 3/2 wallet creation it ask must to restore from all three otherwise it won't work ..?If you lose your hardware device, then you will still be able to recover your multi-sig wallet by using the seed phrase from your hardware device which you should have backed up.To restore a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet you either need all three seed phrases, or two seed phrases plus the missing master public key.Quote from: ilmeaalim on September 29, 2022, 09:30:40 AM3- I tried to restore my 3/2 wallet by using 2-2 multisig wallets using 1seed + 1master (without hardware)... and seems like it doesnt' restore the actual wallet .. it is just a new wallet of 2-2... how can we restore these kind of wallets ..?That's not how it works. Once you've created a 2-of-3 multi-sig, it will always be a 2-of-3 multi-sig. You cannot convert it to 2-of-2 and you cannot \"partially\" restore it. You will always need all three components to restore it.Quote from: ilmeaalim on September 29, 2022, 09:30:40 AM4- Multisig only works for Bitcoin. What if I can use a hardware Trezor device which has many other crypto assets like ethereum and other assets, would my other assets would stay on the same hardware wallet ..? I mean whenever I need to transfer/access Bitcoin I use multiple using electrum .. and when I need to access other assets I use trezor suit to access them .. is it possible to use one device for two purposes ..?Yes, your Trezor should be able to simultaneously support a bitcoin multi-sig wallet and altcoin single-sig wallets using the same seed phrase.",
