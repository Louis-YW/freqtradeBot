This is what CZ planned at the beginning when he introduced blockchain to immediately contained hack scenario in the blockchain which a decentralized blockchain canâ€™t do quickly. CZ learned a lot of lesson on ETH big time hacks before that cause them split blockchain.Of course many will not agree about this kind of centalization but this is beneficial on scenario like this because they can act quickly to contained the possible the damage. I believe this is a disaster if this issue occurs on Ethereum blockchain. Good for Binance they are lucky to notice the issue quickly.",

For sure they will add extra layer of security or any means to improve the defense as much as possible to avoid such panic and chaos on some of the holders of bnb. A hack could create panic selling and CZ and his team are fast to move and handle the problem. But shutting down the network is completely a big failure to a big chain like them. Well thats a con of being a centralized project but thumbs up for CZ doing a counter measure to the problem right away.",

Since users funds are safe, this news hasn't made much of a panic among the people.Binance has handled the situation by halting the binance smart chain which is against decentralization but if not done so then the hacker would have stole more.If this doesn't happen again then good because this is the second time a hack has happened in the binance ecosystem.The third one might send a negative signal around the people.",

For further updates, you all can visit CZ's official twitter. You can view the account. BSC Blockchain Now pause until any New Update About Hacking The main thing about the story of this hack is that nobody cares about decentralisation now. Before they stopped the Solana blockchain, now they stopped the BNB blockchain and froze the stolen coins. On the one hand it is good that funds are saved, but on the other hand it shows that any one of us can lose your coins if just one person decides to do so.one by one blochcain was hacked, from SOLANA and now BNBCHAIN, of course this is a bad thing for the image of cryptocurrencies in the future, the question that will be asked is whether blockchain is still safe? I myself am now very careful about storing assets, and it is better to store them in a hardware wallet.",
