If the story is real, either the OP doesn't know about the security implications of using a trust wallet or the OP might not know the difference between a closed-source and an open-source wallet.Â 2. Maybe the OP created such a thread to see if it could make some merit out of it, thinking he has taken the right step by using what he believes is a self-custodial wallet and calling Atom wallet evil based on their recent hack incident.",

I have seen useless posts receive high amounts of unnecessary merits.There is no need to crucify the \"meriter\"Â  Not going to go too far off-topic, but crucifying inappropriate merit-giving is absolutely appropriate.Â  Or at least questioning it.",

Well, let's leave it for the moderators.And, as you said, the amount would be around 0.01 BTC. I mean, if they really are paying that much to shill their services, then that's a lot of money, and I would love to join that (haha) to earn in BTC (just kidding). Well, I read the topic you mentioned above completely.And there was no proof from the OP that he really transferred that much money into a trust wallet. He should proof it by showing us the details of the wallet, or at least share the screenshot if he was afraid or cared so much about privacy and anonymity. Overall, it really looked like he was trying to sell us the biscuits from TW, but I don't think he has to. I also use TW, but of course not for holding purposes.",

This, my friend, is neither interesting nor amusing. Step it up!Haha, you should ask Joeyp, \"Why so serious?\", I also read that thread just today. Due to the topic of Joeyp, the story was really interesting and full of details. While reading that, I started to think that OP must be some type of storyteller, but when he started to explain the features of Trust Wallet, I also became skeptical that OP was promoting TrustWallet.But why does he have to? I mean, there is no need for it. Trust Wallet is already so famous and used by a lot of people in the crypto market, but still, old competitors need some intentions too. But these intentions can be gotten from bad image too, like last time many people reported a bug in which the assets are shown in the explorer but are not visible in the wallet.",
