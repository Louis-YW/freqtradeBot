  "content": "Moderators, please do not move this topic, I will like bitcoin board posters to contribute because they are the people that recommend monero most. Some people know the importance of privacy coins, example is to convert bitcoin to a privacy coin and convert it back to bitcoin which can be an alternative to mixing and coinjoin.According to what I have read online, there are many privacy coins, I have read about dash, zcash and many other altcoins to be a privacy coin, but on this forum, only monero is talked about. If monero only the true privacy coin? Are those like dash and zcash also a privacy coin or not truly a privacy is the reason you people are not them? Or this is related to centralization and decentralization?",

It has been stated Zcash is more regulatory friendly (which possible it can be regulated) and Dash is using CoinJoin, I have read on many posts said CoinJoin has a flaw and not really private.Quote from: https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-privacy-coins-monero-zcash-and-dash-explainedMonero: Monero is the best-known privacy coin and has the largest market cap of the bunch, as of this writing. Forked from an earlier coin called Bytecoin in 2014, Monero anonymizes critical details such as both the sender and recipient, as well as the amount of the transaction, using techniques such as ring signatures and single-use addresses. Each coin is also fungible, unlike with Bitcoin, because they are indistinguishable and have no traceable history.Zcash: Heavily influenced by Bitcoin (and featuring the same 21 million coin cap), Zcash implements zk-SNARKs to ensure that all needed conditions are met for a valid transaction without exposing any personal, confidential data. Zcash offers multiple transaction types ranging from fully public to fully private, so it’s potentially more regulatory-friendly than Monero, and fully shielded transactions can include private memos, as well. Zcash development is led by the for-profit Electric Coin Company.Dash: Forked from Bitcoin with the aim of improving upon the original cryptocurrency, Dash can mix multiple transactions with CoinJoin (called PrivateSend) to obscure potentially identifying details. Dash similarly makes its privacy features optional, and also has an InstantSend option for rapid transactions that are confirmed within two seconds. Dash has found popularity in countries that have seen enormous inflation with their respective fiat currencies.",

      "body": "Because Monero does straight up full anonymity while other privacy coins offer just enhanced privacy that has some flaws.  This raises some issues.First of all, with coins that have optional privacy like Dash or Z Cash, you get one big problem.  The community is split up into two, giving everyone the possibility of looking at the more private one as the suspicious side of the coin.  If you and I use monero, we both get the same level of privacy so basically even if you do not care about privacy at all, nobody can say I am more suspicious than you are because both of us are under the same camouflage.Second.  When you have optional privacy you know where to attack.  Monero's blockchain is not public unlike Bitcoin's.  So even if we both make a transaction and you do not care about your privacy, there is hardly any way someone can find out where to begin an attack of de anonymization.  If we have optional privacy and you turn yours off, they already know I am the one who tried to stay hidden and so they know who to go after.Third.  Fungibility is starting to become an issue with Bitcoin I must say.  Now that tainted coins are becoming trendy for institutions and exchanges, your 1 Bitcoin are not always equal to my 1 Bitcoin.  Monero solves this issue by making sure there is no visible history of your coins.I think Monero will continue to survive and live a long life next to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has the big advantage of being first and catching the public's eye.  But with privacy becoming less and less prominent all around the world and with everything going digital and cashless, I think there will be a time where people will start looking for a more private alternative of Fiat or even of Bitcoin.  Blockchain Analysis is definitely advancing up to an eerily intrusive level as well, so at some point in a future world we might have Bitcoin as the replacement for Card and Monero as the equivalent for Cash.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Everyone who has tried has failed.CipherTrace's method for tracing Monero transactions was to combine a whole bunch of off chain data, such as people publicly posting their addresses or transactions, data from centralized exchanges and other third parties, social media profiles, and so on. They did not manage to do anything on chain. The IRS offered a $1.25 million bounty to anyone who could trace Monero transactions. CipherTrace were unable to claim it.After going unclaimed for over a year, the IRS instead gave $500k each to Chainalysis and Integra to work on Monero tracing tools, with the prize of a payout if they could build anything useful. No prize payout has been made.Note that no other \"privacy\" coin has ever had such a bounty, because they can all already be easily and widely traced by a whole variety of blockchain analysis firms.",

Some acclaimed privacy coins are proven not to be as private as they claim or they have optional privacy settings, which cannot be considered to be a totally private coin. Unlike Monero which is arguably the oldest privacy coin. In two years time, it will clock a decade. So, it has been tested overtime since it's protocol is purely open source. Another big factor is that Satoshi is indirectly linked to Monero, so that Satoshi vibe is still there.After making some research about Monero, I began to wonder why it's adoption isn't expanding much. This coin has the potential to excel and last as long as bitcoin can last. Well, maybe its time is not come yet, so many are not interested about their privacy yet.",
