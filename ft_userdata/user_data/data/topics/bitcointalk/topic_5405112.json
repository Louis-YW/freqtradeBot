  "content": "Bank of Russia Ready to Legalize Crypto Mining If Miners Sell Minted Coins Abroad. The Central Bank of Russia would agree to the legalization of cryptocurrency mining, provided the proceeds from the activity are converted to fiat outside of Russia. The regulator’s latest position on the matter comes after it softened its stance on the possible use of cryptocurrencies for payments, even if only internationally. Full Details: https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-ready-to-legalize-crypto-mining-if-miners-sell-minted-coins-abroad/ Do you expect Russia to legalize cryptocurrency mining this year..?",

They cannot sell all the oil, gas and electricity they make due to the sanctions. They need money, badly.Then why not bitcoin? Mining bitcoin can be done and they will acquire coins that are valuable and can be sold everywhere avoiding sanctions.Just, in the same way the western countries no longer accept Russian gold, it can easily happen that such a move from Russia would cause troubles on Bitcoin markets (and related regulations).",

Due to the sanctions the Russian power grid is going to get more fragile since obtaining spare parts for things is going to difficult*4) The general feeling that the Russian govt has gone from yes to no to yes to no and is looking back to yes again on mining & BTC in general. Will people make an investment into BTC equipment and facilities if they feel that whenever this conflict / sanctions end the government will go back to no...-Dave* This is not a comment against the Russian power grid, but grids in general most of the world is using components from all over the world to make their grid work.

Be it transformers / generators / controllers / etc. No one country manufacturers it all.I don't think that would be an issue, maintaining and even expanding electricity in its basic form is pretty simple, if we were talking about cutting edge where you want efficiency to be 99.9% instead of say 95% then ya, you would need other countries' know-how and technology, but burning coal, gas or diesel to generate power can be done easily, I live in a 3rd world country and we managed to do that for years during sanctions and even civil war, so I highly doubt a country like Russia will have a problem in that field.However, there is a bigger problem, Russia is a corrupt country ruled by a single man, the constitution and laws are hardly enforced, and the government can just claim that you sold your BTC to Ukrainians and treat you as a traitor and hang you in one of the public parks, or they can nationalize your company/mining farm without any compensations, so even those Russian investors who can afford to build huge farms will likely not take the risk, I imagine only someone who is has a high army rank or close to Putin's circle would mine there safely.",

Russian government or any other communist government can not be trusted. Russia is possibly thinking to bring some forex supply inside the country and that's why they have softened their stance against cryptocurrency. It is probably due to the ongoing war with Ukraine. But if it is not for the war, their direction can change quickly and may again out a ban on crypto mining at their will. That's the problem with communist governments who don't believe in individual financial freedom.",
