I've followed trading signals from other people. It works by giving buy and sell signals and stopping losses that we have to follow. But unfortunately, it doesn't always work because there are times when the signal that is given misses what it gives, so some of us experience losses, including me.And so is the pump and dump group where they give the name of the coin to be pumped but we have to be able to follow it at the right time when the name of the coin is mentioned. This is the most difficult because the time to buy the coins has to be right. Otherwise, we will buy too late and make us have to bear the loss. And since then, I have decided to learn to trade on my own and never depend on trading signals from other people. And even if I pick up on that signal, I'll look into it further for any other clues. So be careful if you want to join any trading signal group, whether paid or free.",

He tried to join a lot of them knowing that he'll gain knowledge on how to trade properly but he ended up badly and losing money. It may not be the same story as the others but that's the reality he has talked to me about and he's no longer with those. Although, he's still into mentorship and courses that he's paying for and I'm not sure if he's doing pretty well now. Speaking for a friend of mine, that didn't worked properly for him and he's regretted that he's spent hundred of dollars into paying those premiums.",

I have some experience with this but that was free since it was coming from my friend. I've noticed that with those signals I've got from him some have work and I earn a profit. This means that not all of these signals give me a favor and it also does to him as well. Now, if we think that relying on other signals is good, I would say that it was a good start and it is actually profitable if it comes from paid signals, that is something we need to be careful of. They are actually just good for you at the start but in the later part, they will give you the wrong signals.",

Relying on your trading activity is never been that good or something that referrable.We know that if things turns out to be bad then we cant really blame out someone but rather only ourselves but if you are really that following on someones calls and signals then you would really be mainly pointing out fingers into them. Just like i said that it wont really be that a bad idea on snipping out others analysis which could be applied to yoursand this would really be involving lots of trials and errors along the way on the time that you've been dealing with trading.",

I tried doing this back in the day it's completely useless1. \"Free signals\" are used to build group numbers2. Once the group has so many members they start asking for subscription or make a VIP group for \"premium signals\"3. The trick is they (owners of the group first buy the shitcoin) and then send the \"signals\" to VIP members to buy and afterwards post the signal in the bigger group.People rush to buy due to FOMO, Price pumps and the signal providers dump off the shitcoins on those users in the free group 5. They post results of very good performance and the cycle continues on another shitcoinThe only way through trading is by learning how to trade and making technical analysis yourself.",

While some individuals may have had success in following signals provided by others, it's important to approach such signals with caution. There have been cases where signal groups have been accused of self-serving motives, such as promoting pump and dump schemes or using the group for their own financial gain. Ultimately, relying solely on someone else's signals without conducting thorough research and analysis of your own can be risky.
