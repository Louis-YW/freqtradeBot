If dem talk say A na black, no just believe but do your own finding before you believe dem. This guys are hustling, most of dem are newbies like us but dey just have a large social media following so dem dun take dat pros become influencers. Some projects self dey tell dem things to talk because dey know what will drive people to pick interest in their projects so nobody everything wey we dey hear from their mouth be their own thoughts. Influencers are there to bring publicity to the project and not your guide to a safe investment just as people dey believe everything this influencers dem dey talk and make investment based on what dey say, that one na very bad investment practice, no use anything wey you no sabi how e be just because another person talk say e go well.QuoteNo matter how you like or enjoy any content creator this does not make them genuine, they get paid for everything they endorse (it's not free), if you must use what they endorse always make sure you do a very extensive research about it.Even when dem dey free like the project no pay dem for the promotion wey them dey do, no forget say most projects get a referral commission program wey anybody fit use to make money from affiliate marketing. E just dey like 1xbet wey we dey see many influencers dey promote, most of dem no get any official partnership with the company but just affiliate marketers that get paid through referral commission so make we no dey believe anything wey we see. If you dey find better cryptocurency platforms to use like exchange, wallet. Ask question for here and we go direct you go the ones wey we dey use and dun confirm say dem legit and even after recommending, still do your own research before you use dem. No believe anything wey you see online both on and off the forum, as all that glitters is not gold.",

Make beginners no take every crypto enfluncer as crypto Lord if not they may risk losing their money. Social media is full of lots of scamners,  people just  they find how them go take money from beginners and beginners they fall to it because them just they too desperate to make money.",

They are in for the money. Make una nor get me wrong, not all of these crypto projects are scam or terrible but some of them never mature enough. Make I give una an example from personal experience. Una abi this Roqqu. I think it is a crypto exchange app built by some Nigerians. One of the reasons wey make me download am na because say this influnecer, Aproko Doctor, influence for them. Him talk about how the app na this, the app na that. Una nor go believe say na Google form dem use dey do their verification process. You need to fill out your information on the Google form. To even do this, you must even first sign in to your gmail. The main koko be say, e don reach 2 months now wey I submit my KYC for verification, them still never verify me. And mind you na the same verification documents and details I submit for Binance, Kucoin, and Remitano. And all these ones nor even reach 24hours aside Kucoin wey be 24 hours before I was verified.",

We need to dey shine our eyes, just as BrainBoss talk social media influencers no be financial advisors, dem too dey street like us.

This na one reason besides the fact say government want control the citizens, wey make them say them want make every social media account dey registered. Cryptocurrencies na the trend for most young guys when you ask them their hustle, but watin dey more common na this shitcoins vendors wey fit carry person money disappear at anytime. Most of the promotions on social media serves to help the popularity of cryptocurrencies surge on social media platforms, thereby creating a correlation between social sentiment and crypto price fluctuations.Crypto vendors like Binance, luno, paxful, Coinbase, only do well to ensure crypto buying and selling or facilitate transaction Payments and should be well known before using them. No be issue of say my favorite celeb dey advertise one crypto vendor wey just start business, then I go just rush go begin use am. Many of the influencers no dey even use the vendors them dey influence.",

They can do or say anything to get paid, and they don't care about the feelings of their fans, but they are only after making money. Social media is a place which people promote scam and claim that the project is the best, when they know that it is a lie. Na so one of my guy come tell me about one shitcoin, and I tell am say na shitcoin but he say na one celeb dey advertise am.
