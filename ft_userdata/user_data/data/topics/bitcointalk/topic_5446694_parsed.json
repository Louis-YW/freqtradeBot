  "content": "I got an Airdrop token about $100,I told a friend of mine about it but his reply was like 'Have you heard about Honeypot token scam', I was perplexed at first,Then I did research about it and discovered that the $100 dollar Token is an Honeypot token. Here is what I found out from my research :Honeypot is a term use by Cyber security professionals to tag something that attract one's attention and then trap them.Honeypot crypto scam are Tokens which one are unable to sell. This is different from lock tokens because when you try to swap or sell the token your gas fee are stolen and transferred to the scammer wallet. It may look cheap but imagine accumulating gas fees of about a thousand victims, that huge right?Aside from stealing the gas fee the scammer may also be able to steal wallet key phrases. How to discover honeypot tokenThey are mainly created on Ethereum, Binance and Polygon Blockchain. If the token is on binance smart chain then you can search for the token on bsc scan through the token Contract Address and look for its liquidity (check the numbers of sell order of the token),while use EtherScan for Ethereum token and Poly Scan for polygon token. When checking for the number of sell order, observe that if the number of sell is small be cautious and if they are no sell order then it will likely  be an honey pot token. Note: If you see only green candles on the chart across all timeframes, chances are, there have been no sell order and so its likely a honeypot token If the token is on binance smartChain you can also use Poocoin to check for the liquidity. There are other ways to know if a token is an honeypot, this include 1 Verifying their website :If the website has a poor development that a warning. You can also check when the domain name is registered by typing the domain name on  whois.domaintools.com and if the token is registered some hours or 24 hours before the project starts, then its likely a scam. 2  They don't have review from Trustworthy company 3 Avoid Tokens having few or wallet for holding it4  Check their Social Media Account. Scam projects usually have stolen and low qualities photos, grammatical errors, no links about the information of the project and making post like : drop your Eth address 5  Check for reviews about the Token before investing 6  Sending spamming messages in your Dm, which includes their wallet key phrases. This is mainly seen on Twitter, Discord, Facebook and any other social media. I once got one on Twitter, Never what it was called but I knew definitely that it was a scam because of the fact that no body will just give out their wallet key. There are other ways for identifying Honeypot Token, So I will like those who don't know about this scam to  do more research, To know more about how it works and how to identify them",

There are so many promotions like discount or airdrops and you should recognize that to avoid such risk.  I think Ive got victimized of this one time, due to my degen apetite but it turns out a scam at the end.",

It is widely called a multi-signature scam, mostly happening on Tron. The seed phrases given is legitimate, but the trick is, that particular account(wallet) has been set up to require another different account to authorise the transaction. The wallet truly has some tokens and the scammer lures the target to take away that token by making them send some coins for the gas fee. The target can't do anything since the wallet itself is fully controlled by the another wallet.",

We should always be careful and hopefully newbies should learn the things to avoid in here so as to never be a part of the victim statistics.  These tokens have a value but they are still fake. They only imitate the original token's name but if you will compare them carefully, that's the time you will see their difference. You can't sell them obviously but if you attempt to, that will be dangerous because your wallet might get hacked.When you apply for an airdrop, bounty or similar, it would be better to use a disposable wallet only and then delete them after use, so that your main wallet will be safe from these threats. If a newbie will only take time to read, they can come across information like this and they will know what to do next. Learning is free but it only takes time so one must not be lazy.",
