I followed a YouTube video on bruteforcing the wallet.dat file but no luck.This will be your main issue.That \"balance not available\" isn't too much since after you fully sync your blockchain to the network, that 'triangle ! icon' will disappear.First of all, not even the developers can recover users' password from a server or some sort, only the owners know about their password.Bruteforcing is your only option so you need to at least know something about your password: parts of it, some characters, etc. to limit the search space.Without remembering any info, your only chance is if you've used a very short or simple password that can be bruteforced with 4~9 character combinations or \"dictionary attack\".Since you tried bruteforcing already, I'd guess that you've already done those simple bruteforce attacks, if not, try them.If you do not have the resources, I'd also suggest you to try the mentioned service by others above, the owner has quite the reputation.He wont accept it though if you do not have the slightest idea of the possible password.",

If even after syncing Bitcoin core that balance unavailable message still appears then you will have to brute-force the password once again. Â I must say that brute-forcing the password requires some very powerful hardware and those hardware will not help in brute-forcing it until you don't know some part of the password. In that case you will have to rely on a legit crypto recovery service to brute-force the password for you and you'll have to do that at your own risk. That's the only available option for you, but if you have some idea about the password then you can still try your luck by brute-forcing it yourself once again.",

(being skeptical isn't bad either)I agree with you that providing a screenshot will not prove that someone is the owner of the wallet, but I asked that in order to see that what's happening on his side. The guy also provided us with his wallet address via blockchair link and that's why I said that he's the owner of the wallet and has access to wallet.dat file. I know that people can share someone else's wallet address and they can have screenshots of Bitcoin Core's main tab in order to prove that they own the wallets. But in this case the guy seems genuine I guess and he has tried his best to decrypt the wallet himself but didn't get any success in decrypting the wallet.Quote from: nc50lc on September 22, 2023, 10:44:57 AMAlso, the \"balance unavailable\" has nothing to do with the password since Bitcoin Core encrypted wallets can show balance even if it stay locked.I guess when the wallet is encrypted then it's required to enter the password in order to view the balance and transactions. Sometimes when core is not synced fully that can be another reason to show the message \"balance unavailable.\"",

That doesn't fix the underlying problem, and that is that he can't spend his coins without the password that he has lost. The balance is already confirmed by looking at the information available on blockchain explorers.
