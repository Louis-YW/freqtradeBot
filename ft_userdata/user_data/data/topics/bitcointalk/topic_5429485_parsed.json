  "content": "Yesterday I happen to meet with a long time friend who isn't based in the same city with me due to the nature of his job as he does not work in same city. We grew up together our childhood days, went to the same primary, secondary and same university in the same city. He called me informing me he was in town if we could hangout I accepted the invite as a childhood ally. We had series of conversations about life, affairs, family, business, and lots more. We discussed more about work and finance too so he inquired to know more on my stand how i was faring. I could not hold myself, I laughed. He said he was surprised i had not asked him for a dime but rather i was the one giving to him whenever he calls for backup. He asked me if i could help him out with other means. I told him i had no other means currently than blockchain and bitcoin. As a pro bitcoin enthusiast, I had to put him through the system although he was skeptical about it but he was able to assimilate all i told him.I had to start by lecturing him on the inception of bitcoin, founder of bitcoin, benefits of holding bitcoin and as well the disadvantages involved so he would be knowledgeable of the whole process. Before we started the conversation on bitcoin,  i had to tell him about how i started too so he would know what it took me and how i persevered holding till it was breakeven time. I as well lectured him on best wallets to use which will not cost him much gas fee for transaction. As private key is important, i told him about it and how to secure his wallet, showed him how to identify his wallet address and private key upon setting up a new wallet. Looking at the market situation, i gave him an insight of how it works and encouraged him to take advantage of it to buy and hold just as i did.He was overwhelmed by my lecturing and he said to me if he had known about this he would not have been stocked up in some situations he found himself in and thanked me to revealing this to him. I was practical about the whole process so he could see it for himself and also have idea how to do it himself when he goes back to his station.He asked how he could get bitcoin i told him that is not an issue. I helped him set up a wallet and he scale through his KYC  and he purchased $50 worth of bitcoin which he withdrew to his private wallet for his own safety. Nevertheless, i had to introduce him to this platform using myself as a case study. I opened my profile to him showing him across boards and how things are done here, possible engagements on this platform, rules and regulations and how to earn tokens. It was a wonderful session we both had having this lecture. He was very happy because i had to put him through the system and as well showing him my source of income which he himself admit that nobody would do what i did by showing them their other source of income. I just took the risk because i want him to be financially free as a childhood friend. He thanked me a lot for revealing this to him.This is what i have passion for, bitcoin  promotion and adoption,  on-boarding and leading people to financial freedom. Like the saying goes, \"education is power\" this is what i like doing so that people would be informed about the happenings and development on blockchain space.",

I don't know what you do, but you will make a good coach. I sincerely begin to envy such enthusiasts for promoting bitcoin live in your country.",

You have done a good job to create more awareness about bitcoin. Your friend would spread the news about bitcoin if he develops interest and confidence In bitcoin.I also observed that you are a very creative writer because your writings are well-organized and coherent. That's a very outstanding skill. I am also suggesting that you consider venturing into content development and copywriting section of the bitcoin space. Keep up the good work mate.",

      "body": "I'm happy you met an old friend and discussed Bitcoin together, but it seems to me from the text that your friend is in a rough financial situation. When that's the case, investing money into something, even in Bitcoin, poses a big risk and breaks the rule of not investing what one can't afford to lose. $50 isn't a big sum, so that's probably alright, but I think it's important to repeat the main rules and risks to people who are new to cryptos, especially if they are in a fragile situation and are desperate. I'm not saying you did anything wrong, maybe it's just the original post not representing the full picture.",

I agree with the prior comment here that you shoulx bd wary about telling or persuading your friend to invest as his money is strictly on a budget even if he doesn't tell you that. That being said I appreciate the fact that you gave him a rundown of how bitcoin works. But at the end of the day the decision to invest should be entirely his, with little to no intervention. I'm saying this because I myself burned brifges accidentally by urging friends and acquaintances of mine to invest in crypto, some of them lost significant amount of their capital and they blame me for persuading them. You migjt say your friend is not like mine but just be wary.",

But let's say I just meet someone, I'll be reluctant though, I don't know maybe I was just to make sure and that I will be comfortable to explain what bitcoin is to a person that I know of instead of a stranger. But just to be fair, you also have to explain the pros and cons of bitcoin, not just that it will give them huge profits in the future. They should understand that it's very volatile and that the price can really go down hard in a bear market.",

Introducing your friend into bitcoin today sets up for a better financial discussion in future. Talking about source of income, I don't know the niche in cryptocurrency that earns you money; trading, hodling, development etc. Earning in cryptocurrency differs and it'll be better to study your friend, know his interests, skills and activity then initiate an idea to him on how he can fit into the cryptocurrency market and make money. Showing him your source of income means he'll definitely do your kind of work in the cryptocurrency market, which he may not be a good player like yourself. It'll be better to ask him some questions, through his answers you can conclude on the niche that is better tailored to his skills. For instance; I have a friend who is good at grasping phone numbers easily, he could dial people's numbers offhand, I advised him to go into writing codes and today he's exceptionally good at 4 programming languages. That's the power behind thinking for others, friends sees our potentials more than ourselves. However, keep up the great work.",
