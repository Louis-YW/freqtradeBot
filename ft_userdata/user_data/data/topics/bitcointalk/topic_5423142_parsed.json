Can such game be in the casino? Cockfighting is very popular in our country so I often see this kind of gambling especially that my father has been into it for a long time. But i’m not into it since I’m more fond with online casinos and sportsbetting. But if  these kind of gambling will be introduce in the casinos, I don’t think it’s impossible. However, with these rams going in a fight, then there should be a very spacious casino that would cater to these type of animals.",

They also share their opinions to the younger generation from their young age. This leads to the new involvement of the generation to the cock fighting. Some people also involved in cock trade for the game of cock fighting. Government of many nations encouraged the cock fighting with their people. Some people do this cock fight over year to year.",

How the hell are we supposed to build a better world for our children when things like this are not banned?Animal right or protection only exists in the developed world. Most developing nations don't have sympathy or compassion for animals. Animals are treated as if they don't feel pains or have feeling. I find it very strange that a footballer was criticized and even fined for kicking his cat. While in my locality people starve and even beat their animals with wipe. I feel terribly sorry for animals in my country that I had to adopt a dog that was starving to death out of compassion.  But come to think of it, what is the difference between boxing and cockfighting? They are almost the same because they both involve living thing with flesh and blood. We have heard news of boxers or even wrestlers dying in the ring. Do you think all violent sports should be stopped?",

But in most case, for you to win this kind of gambling, you must have first observed the way the animal fights before staking your money",

In Philippines, you can see cockpits in different cities. Older men are addicted in cockfighting they sometimes organize it outside the field or even in their own backyard which is actually illegal. I haven't seen ram fight personally, I've seen them hit their heads on tv and didn't imagine that they could end up dying from it. This is just cruel, however, people will utilize anything they can bet on just for fun.",

I believe that this should no longer be held as these things have lives like us, and should always be free to roam around and do what they want. If they are killed for nutrition, I guess it's somewhat okay. But we are forcing these guys to go into survival mode which, afterwards they will still be killed if their injuries are so severe that they can no longer walk or do things on their own. We may be breeding chickens, pigs, cows, and whatever livestock you can ever imagine for food, but most of the methods used to slaughter them are often painless in this day and age. Plus, they get to live in an okay condition since they are being fed and whatnot, so raising livestock for food > raising cocks for human entertainment.",

Can such game be in the casino?You have to live in a pretty sick society and be pretty messed up in the head to think that pitting two animals, who would in most situations be reasonably peaceful towards each other, into a fight to the death or serious injury. It's a sadistic mentality and shows how certain countries are stuck in the stone age with a very long road to ever be called civilized. Many other countries stopped doing this many decades or even centuries ago when they began to appreciate life even more, over barbaric short term blood lust. The fact that it is all done in the pursuit of money just makes it even worse and shame on anyone who supports such cruelty to animals, it seems immensely hypocritical and the opposite of how a religious person might claim to be.",

Unless they will have someone to really see who is the favorite and who is not. But very hard to maintain for casino operators.
