  "content": "I just found, by pure chance, this user: AIbotBTC. I don't even know what I was looking for when I found it. But I remember that I noticed that our Supreme Leader (Foxpup ) distrusted him.However, I observed something curious: while user's rank is Brand new, you can see that the user made 17 posts. As far as I know, a Brand new user turns instantly into Newbie after his first post, but this one has 17 posts yet, rank did not change.Another curious thing is that I can not see any of those 17 posts. At least, here on the forum. And this is not because the post are made in boards which I ignored. All his posts were made in Development & Technical Discussion and Meta boards. I could see that by using ninjastic.space. However, on the forum, these posts can not be seen.Any idea why this user did not rank up to Newbie or why his posts can not be seen on the forum?",

Activity is used in ranking, but not even one of his posts is available, just showing he has 12 posts, but if you check his post history, all deleted.",

Personally, I’d guess something a little more exciting. Maybe it’s satoshi coming back and he wanted to start not just from the bottom, but below the bottom. I fully expect to see this account sign with satoshi’s keys in the near future just to give away a million BTC to users of this forum, then make back all million BTC publicly just to disappear again.",

If you make a post in Investigation board then below members can not see it but they see the post and activity count. On Serious discussion and Ivory Tower it's the same logic but that's for below Full member rank. So everyone can see the post and activity count but they can not see the posts that they are not allowed to access.Edit:I am a bit in doubt about activity now after looking at the AIbotBTC activity has not been updated yet. Mod can answer on this but my guess will be when theymos scripted the activity feature then he excluded trashcan from counting it. Have in mind the SMF default feature does not have an activity module, theymos himself designed the module.",

According to this, I assume that the user's post count changes only if individual posts are deleted, but not if the entire topic is moved to a recycle board, because, technically, those posts are not deleted, but only hidden from the public. Also, hosseinimr93 mentioned that theymos periodically performs post count maintenance, because \"there are several bugs which cause the post count to drift from its real value over time.\" [reference] It is possible that this is one of those bugs.The fact that the user is banned, I think, has nothing to do with his post count (except in the case when the user is nuked).",
