When gambling then it is really just that common sense that you should set out some limits and not really just crossing the line or your so called border on which you do know and you arent that dumb on how much money you could really afford to lose or make use on gambling field.When on the time that addiction kicks in just because you do tolerate out that kind of boost of emotions then this is where you do usually commit out these kind of impulsive actions basing up on the situation that you are into. Gamble on the amount which you can afford to lose and dont ask for more if ever you would be losing a gambling sessions.People do usually get wrekt when they do tend to go overboard beyond their limits. They cant just simply stop and call it a day.Im bit guilty of these things when im just starting up on gambling but on the time that i do make out some realization then you would really be able to control out yourself without harming your finances and play accordingly on the leisure time that you do seek on.",

Gamblers should not chase losses tooin my experience, if you are on the losing side while you are playing the game. take a pause, assess the situation and check where you are at your set budget. sometimes gamblers are getting lost once they are suffering losses after losses. and they forget all the budget constraints they have. you need to be firm with your decision if you are setting your limits. always check yourself if you want to continue or not, see the bigger picture of what you're about to execute.",

I reckon people should have a budget set for entertainment or money set for expenses you'd use to spend for yourself, take a small amount from that instead of separating it. It might also be useful to read self-exclusion terms in a casino, maybe try to put it in a easy to access button like bookmarks (or anything if you have something easier and faster). Lastly, don't be dumb enough to chase for wins/losses. Just take what you can get imo. It's not a job, sure you can feel frustrated if you lose but limit it to that.",

I totally agree with the part of pre-planning a budget before you start your gambling. That is a very responsible way to save yourself from losing all your money. Also, perhaps inviting a friend to hold your budget for you and ask him to not give you any of your money in the case that you should feel like you are starting to lose control. That might also be a smart precaution to take? Avoiding alcohol intake during gambling might take the fun out of gambling for some people. Its basically part of the entire gambling experience, is it not? Unless of course you have had a drinking problem in the past. If you had an addiction problem In that case it would be better to stay away anything which can be considered addictive. Gambling included.",

Engaging in gambling activities is not mentally exhausting. In fact, during my afternoon breaks or after finishing my daily activities, I often find myself playing games of chance or monitoring soccer games. It's a fun pastime, as long as you don't feel sad when you lose small amounts of money that you've deposited.Gambling can be a fun and entertaining activity, but it's important to remember not to let it negatively impact our financial stability. It's crucial to only gamble with money that we can afford to lose, and to never let it interfere with our financial responsibilities.Quote from: paxmao on May 11, 2023, 11:03:57 PMSeek help if you feel you are no longer in control.

While some of us are not telling our wives we gamble online, you get to have a budget. You definitely had chosen a great wife. Whether married or not, however, one will still have to manage his funds to live so in order to just keep it that way a person should just bear in mind the bills to pay and food on the table.

Some gamblers are just bent on gambling so hard, making sure they win something before they stop, and some times they may not win anything, so they keep going. Even if they end up winning, they might have gambled off a lot of money and might not even win up to half of what they have lost. It's very necessary to make a budget and specify the amount that the person will gamble off, so that once they exhaust the money, they can stop gambling without minding if they won or not.I don't know how others feel, but I think gambling is intuitive. Without those budgets, a gambler might not even realize it until they have gambled off a lot of money.There are these street bets that I usually see people doing in my country. Some young guys on the street who gamble sometimes end up gambling with their phones; they can even go to the extent of gambling with anything they have on their body, which includes their clothes, trousers, shoes, or jewelry. This is no joke; one day a guy has to walk away from the street bet with only his boxers, which means he has gambled with everything he had on him.",

Like how some other gamblers use like 3 or 4 percent of their income, if my total monthly income is 10,000 and I allocate 4 percent of it to gambling it would amount to 400 dollars which I pretty huge, IMO.What I normally do is that I just take a fixed amount like 50 Dollars and spend it on gambling and as soon as that money get exhausted I quit for that month.QuoteAnything else anyone can think of? Like... read this post before gambling? If I should add anything to this list it would be, \"be time conscious\" although allocating money also plays a role here but aside that you should set a time limit for yourself, because most times when we're on the winning spree there's this urge for us to continue playing and also when we're losing there's also the urge for us to start chasing losses.Just put a time limit and once your time is up just log out of your casino and focus on other part of your life that needs attention.",
