Again, we deeply regret any inconvenience that may have been caused.Saying this because I've been following his case closely, IMO, it's not that difficult.Putting aside the very questionable suggestion your live support ask him to do, you initially voided Gekke's bet for an incorrect odds, which later revised to exploiting unfavorable odds, while what he did was looking for a bookie who gave him the best odds. I failed to see how this is an abuse.I think it's equal counterpart to wanting to buy something online and you open several shopping apps to see which app gives the best price. You're free to correct and educate me on this matter.",
