I used arbitrum,zksync,arbitrum nova, and some other. During this time Aptos airdrop has been given to testnet users and fortunately i also recieved 150 aptos token worth 1100$ that time. after aptos airdrop, many youtubers made video on retroactive airdrops and testsnet. i again started using these chains and added testnet task also to qualify for airdrops. i spend more than 150$ on these tasks. at once I felt that i am just wasting time and money but i did not give up and continued my worked. some days ago i was in need of money and I took a loan to cover my need. suddenly i saw the arbitrum news of Arb token and it makes me pleased that the community will also receive the airdrop. So here is my small story with arbitrum AirdropI used three wallets for arbitrum and all was eligible for the airdrop. Ma main wallet was eligible for 1875 token. One old wallet was eligible for 1250 tokens but unfortunately it phrase was stolen by hackers and third one eligible for 625 token which was a combined wallet with my cousin and brother.First I claimed my main wallet tokens and sent it to bitget and bybit and made a profit of 2100$ which was the biggest airdrop ever for me. In the combined wallet I sent a token to arb contract mistakenly and its totally wasted. Hacked wallet tokens was claimed by hackers because they used a bot to claim airdrop and an automatic transfer to another wallet. I repay my loan and also 1500$ still available. Arb supply is very big which will not let this token pump hard like other coins. What do you think about Arb Token? Is it a good option to take entry below 1$ or I use my fund in btc or Ethereum?",

Is it a good option to take entry below 1$ or I use my fund in btc or Ethereum?It’s currently circulating supply is 1.2B with current price of 1.3$ per token. This current price is still low considering Aptos reach 18$ per token with 1:10 supply ratio. Arbitrum is a widely use side chain. I believe there’s a huge potential for this token to pump more once this bull run confirmed and continue. Congrats on your profit. It’s not bad to hold some of your airdrop tokens just in case the price pump hard.",

The inflation of arb is already projected to be around 2% every year. I think that it can still go below $1 anytime. The question is when will that happen with arb? Since it was offering reward for the holders that participated in the governance. Think about that. If you are still holding arb now and you will also able to participate in its DAO or governance.

What a nonsense prediction. I suggest you to did some analysis before trying to create a non sense prediction like that. Solana was L1 and it has around 550 millions in total supply and almost 400 millions in circulating supply. Do you compare it with a L2 token with 10 billions total supply? Use your sense, please.",

Look at Cardano, it has a huge supply and has a market cap of $13 billion, and a price of $0.37 per token but during the last bull market, it hit $3 per token, and you are telling me $ARB will not pump?",

If you don’t want to miss the opportunity again, better to analyze it now and see your price entry.$ARB is still a new project but I also believe on this, I’ve seen their platform and many are already using it. If they continue to introduce more good projects, there’s a big chance for them to pump more. Remember an old project like this, they started at a small price but eventually they pump more as many still adopting the project. $1 can also be a good price to buy with $ARB, but if you are waiting for some corrections then its possible as well, I’m still bullish with $ARB though.",

Massive selling pressure from airdrop receivers and I don't say it is bad idea to accumulate Arbitrum when its price is cheap. Though it is good plan for 2024 bull run, you must wait a few months before making your accumulation on Arbitrum. Months later, if you accumulate ARB, you should hold it till more than middle of 2024, a few months after Bitcoin 2024 halving.After that halving, cryptocurrency market will have a new big bull run and it is when you can take profit with your ARB.",

This project allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with lower transaction fees and faster transaction speeds than traditional trading platforms.

I have a strong belief in the future when these markets are large as they can help increase diversification in the crypto market, while also being able to settle.

Big difference in solona, aptos and other chain coins is that Arb is not the main token used for gas fee which will not increase the demand of this coin like solona. i am not expecting price will go up high as solona or Aptos reached all time high. i am comparing this Arb token with Optimism and i think 3$ will be likely good entry to exit.At this time the only Usecase of Arb token is i think Dao voting where you will delegate token. Many users are holding for voting purpose and they still believe that they may recieve another good airdrops from Arbitrum projects. if other big Usecase reveal than i think we may see 2$ very soon. from two days Arb showing very good potential and despite of huge supply, its price pumping speed is very good.",
