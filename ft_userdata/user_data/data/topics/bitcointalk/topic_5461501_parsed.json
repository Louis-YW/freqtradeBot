I think an answer to these questions and other contributions or objection to my opinion will help a lot of us learn. Just put up into your mind that, if we do able to reach out $69k price ATH wayback into past bull run, how much more on the upcoming one? We might be seeing about having no fresh new capital or new money that mightflowed into crypto space but come to think that fiat could be unlimitedly be printed.  . Institutions and lots of huge investors are really just lurking in the shadows and just waiting for the right moment to get in.We know that halving event is really a common trigger on having that bull run and this is why if ever you do have some doubts about potential price spike into those times then i cant blame you.You would normally be having or creating these kind of impressions basing up on the current market conditions that we are seeing on which doubts and hesitance about the upcoming bull run would really be there and foreseeing that it might not happen anymore this time.We cant just really that underestimate the investors around, it might look they might not be there anymore but on the time comes then for sure we would really be gettingshocked and make out questions on where the hell those money came from.",

It is not that complicated, the rise on the price of bitcoin should be caused at the early stages by the miners, once the halving takes place they will receive less bitcoin for each block they mine, so in order for the miners to keep themselves on business they need to increase the price at which they sell their bitcoin, this causes the slow increase on the price we see at the earliest stages of the bull season, then once this growth passes a certain point investors and speculators begin to invest in this market driving the price up, which later brings retail investors and finally newbies to the mix.",

The amount that is mined per month is like half a billion if the price is $1 per doge. And why it’s price wasn’t sustainable at $0.70 when Elon was pumping it. People need to understand how market cap is important. Easier to take a million dollar cap coin up than it is taking a billion dollar coin up.",

Just as we are all optimistic about the future price of Bitcoin, there is one thing that has happened in the past bull markets that made Bitcoin see those tremendous increases in price during the previous bull cycles was that the Federal Reserve was in a continuous printing of money which is not happening now, right now, Fed is removing liquidity which we don't know if they going to continue towards next year which happens to be next Bitcoins having which might affect how far that the price might go.",

      "body": "If Bitcoin market is determined by speculative traders, it can rise and fall even without an influx of new money. The price can rise when speculators refuse to sell, waiting for growth, and buy more. But eventually they will sell and crash the market. This could mean that over a long period the average price will be constant, but there will be bull-bear cycles with huge ups and huge downs. I think the potential for new money in Bitcoin is fairly limited, because most of the world views Bitcoin as a risky and volatile investment. People tend to take risks if they are convinced that it's a good risk. It's hard to do so with Bitcoin.",

They're now showing openly that they recognize Bitcoin as a legit asset or a new investment class. As a currency, the adoption is also moving forward.The halving is anticipated because new supply will now be scarcer. So even if the demand is not growing terribly high, since the amount of new supply injected into the circulation is cut into half, there will definitely be a change in the price.",

Halvings reduce the supply of new bitcoin, so assuming a more or less constant demand, the price tends to rise. It is like a snowball that makes bitcoin be perceived as more valuable and people are willing to pay more for the same amount. This has happened in previous halvings and we assume it will happen in the next ones, the only thing is that the reduction in supply will have less and less effect on the price proportionally.",

Bitcoin has obviously gone to institutional level and there is no doubt institutional funds are what is driving the market at present. Nevertheless, the uncertainty in the global financial systems such as domineering moves by the west, resistance by BRICS nation and others might actually present Bitcoin as a suitable alternative to many international investors as opposed to the secular believe in gold.",

I think an answer to these questions and other contributions or objection to my opinion will help a lot of us learn. To be able to reach that market price of around 100k dollars we definitely need a lot of money that is needed to be poured into Bitcoin, at the moment the money was just us small traders and we actually did a great job increasing the market price of bitcoin of around 30k dollars and we notice that the price remains around that range, there was some resistance and it wouldn't increase or decrease around 29k$-31k$ and in my opinion, it's a great sign already. You are right about that, it is going to be a huge amount of money, so we need billionaires, companies, institutions, government money, etc, one thing here that could be a catalyst is when the government starts to print money again, that just means that there is more money than can be put on cryptocurrency or Bitcoin that could easily spike the price of Bitcoin.Im is optimistic about it as well because there are still a few people in the world who know Bitcoin if I'm not mistaken it is less than 5% of the world population, and if I'm going to base it on Bitcoin adaptation in the past year the Bitcoin really is adapted on a lot more countries, companies, businesses, etc. Just based on that I could easily assume that the coming Bullrun is going to be bigger than the last Bullrun.",

I highly agree that new money is need to be injected to the market to be able for Bitcoin to reach a new high.  If there is now money coming in on the Bitcoin market, we can only see BTC slowly declining in price because of the continuous influx of new mined coins.Bitcoin market needs really new capital, reason why there is a need for a consistent adoption to maintain the price range.  Hype can help to convince people who already invested on Bitcoin to pour more money but it is not sustainable because one way or another these people are going to cash out for profit.QuoteThe tough question is: How will new money flow into Bitcoin? Is the excitement around Bitcoin halving enough fundamental to cause a sustainable surge in price? A massive adoption either by individual or institution can be the source of the new funds needed for Bitcoin surge.  This is also one of the reason why developers or holders that invested a huge amount of money integrate Bitcoin in their business, create apps and promote Bitcoin so that Bitcoin will have newcomers to inject fund in the Bitcoin market creating demand pressure.",
