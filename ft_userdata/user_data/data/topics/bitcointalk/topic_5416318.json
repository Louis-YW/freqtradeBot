  "content": "An interesting news (and somewhat awaited): Visa partners with FTXCNBC: Visa partners with FTX in a bet that shoppers still want to spend cryptocurrencies in a bear marketTechCrunch: Visa dives deeper into crypto as FTX-linked debit card expands outside USQuote from: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/visa-partners-with-ftx-in-a-bet-that-shoppers-still-want-to-spend-cryptocurrencies-in-a-bear-market.htmlVisa is betting that crypto investors still want to spend their digital currencies, even as prices plummet this year.The payments giant is teaming up with global exchange FTX to offer debit cards in 40 countries with a focus on Latin America, Asia and Europe. The cards, which are already available in the U.S., will link directly to a user’s FTX cryptocurrency investing account. The move allows customers to spend digital currencies without moving those off an exchange, “like you would with any bank account,” according to Visa’s CFO.Although FTX starting - sooner or later - to offer Bitcoin (and maybe other crypto) related debit cards worldwide is pretty much normal and probably expected by some of FTX customers, I find interesting that it's said that \"Visa partners with FTX\" and not the other way around and I find interesting that FTX partnership is directly with Visa and not a 3rd party provider like we've seen in the \"previous generation\" of crypto cards.Clearly, FTX is moving in the direction to compete (someday) with Binance.Quote from: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/visa-partners-with-ftx-in-a-bet-that-shoppers-still-want-to-spend-cryptocurrencies-in-a-bear-market.htmlIt’s Visa’s latest foray into the space and adds to more than 70 crypto partnerships. The San Francisco-based company has already joined forces with FTX’s competitors Coinbase and Binance.I guess that there are bits I'm missing, since I thought that Binance cards, for example, are issued by Swipe, not by Visa directly.",

The debit card issued by Coinbase is though a bank but it's still considered a Visa partnership. Just the way it is.In the end does it really matter if it's a Visa card issued by Bank X for service Y or if service Y does it all themselves? Banks already have the back end and customer service and everything else in place. Even if service Y wanted to do it themselves, they would probably still wind up dealing with a 3rd party just due to startup costs and time.-Dave",

It is a direct partnership that recognizes FTX as a legitimate financial institution. I reckon Visa might be more willing to work with FTX because Sam and his team has been very busy working with regulators in complying with the proper licenses. Binance used to avoid regulations before CZ accepted the reality that it is impossible. FTX is very much ahead of them in compliance, however. There might be some regulators that do not want to talk with CZ because he avoided them before hehehe.",

But the same news was putting Binance onto the same list as FTX and from my knowledge Binance cards are issued by Swipe, not Visa directly (as I already said).So maybe it's in the way DaveF said, Visa takes the opportunity to get themselves into the news although it's not them who has made any actual direct partnership? It also may be that the journalists have no idea what they're writing about and some part of that news is mistaken. I really don't know...",

People have different approach in working with money and it's hard to change their mentality in this matter, especially when they've found the goose with golden eggs.I wrote here and there on bitcointalk that people should get to also enjoy their money, hence \"hodl some, spend some\" tends to be more appropriate.But while I may have some expectations from (some of) the people on bitcointalk, I pretty much don't expect more than this (or anything at all) from a generic commercial news writer.",

VISA move is not a surprise at all, especially as it was made very late.And I think that I already said it: FTX was inflating too fast and started to look like a potential treat to Binance's supremacy. Maybe you remember that there were also topics on bitcointalk about FTX to get the \"crown\".I would not be surprised if CZ knew pretty good that something is rotten there (inside info, spying on competition) and has done the move to protect his businesses' supremacy.I guess that his math was that if he doesn't do this this now and the new bull run starts, probably FTX would have been getting the money to fill the gaps; maybe he didn't expect either to see a giant Ponzi there.However, this \"Visa partners with FTX\" didn't age well",
