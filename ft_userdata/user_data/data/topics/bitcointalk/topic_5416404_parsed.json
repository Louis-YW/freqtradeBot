Then suddenly my dad showed to me his iPad about Binance to check if its legit or not. I said that it’s legit once he installs the correct app and not the fake one. I thought he just wanna install it and explore, but he seriously wants to buy some Bitcoin with his extra money that he didn’t need for now. He just wants to try buy and hold Bitcoin. He already knew that I am in this industry for a long while, but yeah it’s never too late for him to buy his first Bitcoin. I have never convinced or forced him to buy BTC since I started my journey. He’s just being interested in all of a sudden that’s all. So I educated him about the basics, managing financial risks, fees, etc., letting him understand and acknowledge that there are no promises or astronomical guaranteed returns. I also sign him up on Binance using my referral link and assisted him in setting up 2FA, KYC, etc. He wanted to buy using his credit card, but I rather have him buy through me instead to save fees since I can transfer USDT to his account immediately on Binance without fees and convert it into Bitcoin. So yeah now my dad has some Bitcoin in his Binance account.",

Yes, as a bitcoin user, of course everyone will be happy with what you just said. But it's good to explain more about bitcoin, or even bitcoin basics as a whole. I'm afraid your father will fall victim to a scam, I mean it's better to anticipate it before something happens that we don't want.",

Probably he was influenced by one of his friends or work colleagues so I become curious on the source of motivation for him to invest.

Your dads motivation miht help me to convinced my family too.Check too if he understands carefully what he is entering because he might be educated by someone who has a ponzi background on crypto.",

It always feels good having a family member finally convinced about Bitcoin. And it is even better if we also bring them to realize what Bitcoin basically stands for. Decentralization, for example, is such an amazing concept. The finitude of Bitcoin's supply and how it is absolutely predictable is something the old dogs would probably be surprised and be curious about.",

The joke of the comedy was that the boy introduced his parents to cryptocurrency without properly telling them about it and it's versatile nature. In your case OP, I hope you have properly educated your dad, so he doesn't call you to fix the entire crypto situation if he starts seeing his investment looking like it is going all away.",

[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416383.0] Recent events should make you withdraw all your coins to your own wallet: Part 3 [/url] and i think this could gives you more reasons to fasten your steps on deciding to own your coins with you and not with centralized exchanges or third party.",

But more needs to be done if I am right, but my advice might be more important if he has more BTC in his wallet. Binance is a good exchange to buy Bitcoin, yet you need to explain further to your dad that Binance is a custodian wallet and has limited reliability especially when the money is much and he wants to hold the crypto. You guys might still move the crypto to a non-custodial wallet with an open source if he wants a long-term holding.",

One thing I don't understand though is how come you sent him USDT to Binance so he can buy it from there, instead sending your father bitcoin directly to his own non-custodial wallet.
