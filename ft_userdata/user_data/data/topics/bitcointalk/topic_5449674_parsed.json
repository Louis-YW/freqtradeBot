The decision of the court of appeal has been that yes they are organisations that have to pay winnings for the games they decide to offer.But there is one more thing: The courts are not the ones who run these casinos. So if they can't steal users funds anymore by simply closing accounts, common sense says they'll be finding new ways to cheat customers.... So watch out to play only provably fair (that you actually understand) games and live games where you can actually verify you're not being cheated.Edit: For the people posting here, saying this is FUD, go ask FortuneJack if no legal procedure is going against them. If not, ask them if they paid me already or not (with interest for being about 2 years late on payment). I am not giving any evidence, nor am I giving any details.Edit 15/03/25: The result of the lawsuit is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5534261.msg65132998#msg65132998They managed to leave the country during the legal process, please visit that page and support the flag created against them.",

I was curious about the ongoing lawsuit how was it? Does the FortuneJack know about it and what is their response to this kind of allegation.",

Let us see how it goes, if truly there would be a lawsuit against ForjuneJack, there would not be another thread created about it. But we should know that scam accusation and lawsuit are worth separate threads.",

But I get it, them not paying their customers for their wins is a different story so I understand why people are so quick to jump in this topic.Addendum: It strikes me that you are the one that's filed a lawsuit against them, provide ample evidence in court along with the conversation screenshots of the agent that you talked to so you can have a good fighting chance and be able to get paid for your wins.",

If the lawsuit is hidden by the court, it only means that this thread created by PaperWallet is not useful, because what he wanted is for people to withdraw their money because of the lawsuit which we do not know anything about yet. Anything hidden for a reason not to let the customers of an organization to withdraw their money means the court has done their investigation on the organization and see that customers money are safe and do not want the organization to collapse because of customers panicking.",
