  "content": "I created a standard deck of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers all Bitcoin themed. Bitcoiners are loving them and they're a great orange-pilling tool for poker night! Here's a link with pictures and feedback from customers: https://twitter.com/NEEDcreations/status/1626646307145191427?s=20If you'd like to save money and buy with bitcoin directly from me, let me know here or message me on Twitter @needcreations. Or you can buy from Ebay or Amazon with fiat.Ebay: https://www.ebay.com/itm/266054608846Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHD7G9X?ref=myi_title_dpI put a lot of love and research into these cards. I've always wanted to create something like this and I'm happy with the result.
