The 67K price peak is your ceiling price which means anything below it is a steal because Bitcoin price always beat the ATH during bullrun. You should focus on accumulating and increasing your Bitcoin quantity instead of looking the price in fiat.You can acquire it through mining or buying it on exchange using fiat. I believe buying it is your best choice since you can instantly hold Bitcoin and be one of Bitcoin holders by using your fiat money that is infested by inflation.Quote from: Learn Crypto on October 20, 2023, 12:30:21 PM Is investing in Bitcoin easy or complicated?

Many exchanges provide P2P services, you can make purchases through them. A little advice if you want to invest in BTC, keep your BTC in your personal wallet and don't store a certain amount of BTC on an exchange for the security of your investment.Income from BTC investment depends on how much BTC you have. Buying at low prices and selling at high prices also has a big influence on profits.",

One of the factors that affect most people is that they are more passion for profits without knowing the ups and downs in the Bitcoin, however if your purpose is to make a certain amount of money within a certain period in Bitcoin I will strongly advice you to think twice because the market is very volatile and the chances of getting a particular amounts within a certain time is not guaranteed, so the best way is to hold for a long time. Just like every other investment, it has to do with patients and the only way to enjoy your Bitcoin investment is by holding it for  long and at last you will no how potential Bitcoin is.",
