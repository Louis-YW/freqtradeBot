What people will use to know that he is Satoshi is when he sign a message from one of the oldest addresses that were used to receive 50 BTC block reward during the earliest days of bitcoin. Faketoshi has not been able to do that but saying he lost the private keys. He is a liar.",

It is obvious that he is chasing fame and popularity; he thought that maybe many stupid people would believe him. Sorry for the term used, but that's how he thinks about people.But you are right in what you said in the end, that if he really is Satoshi Nakamoto, he must have had an account here since at least 2011. That's why he can't show any evidence in that regard. Now, because of his stupidity, he ended up paying him $1 million.Those are the consequences of his lies that are told on the social media platform.",

What other evidence that's so simple as logging into your Bitcointalk account to prove that you are really who you said you are? How about signing trsmactions for his wallet?

In my opinion, if indeed he said that he lost his key because this was more than 10 years, I thought it was a lie if the one who said it was from Satoshi. It means that it becomes normal if it is someone else who does not understand the value of Bitcoin but someone who claims to be Satoshi and says he loses the key? Come on, why can't you lie better? Or he can prove himself by accessing the Satoshi account in this forum. Of course he can recover the account if he is indeed a real Satoshi.",
