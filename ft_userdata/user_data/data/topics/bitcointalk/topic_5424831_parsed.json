  "content": "Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto to make us not to be dependent on third parties such as government and banks to control our money. Satoshi gave us the opportunity to control your coins (money) without the interference of anyone. He also made us know that bitcoin is an alternative currency to fiat. This will mean that there is no limitation with bitcoin. Bitcoin is an absolute freedom. My point is that people should stop making others feel that they are not enjoying the freedom introduced by Satoshi by not following bitcoin principles strictly. Freedom is freedom and should mean freedom. If I decide to live a private life that no one knows how much I own, that is great and it is called freedom If I decide to do KYC on all the exchanges and gambling sites, that is freedom If I decide to leave my coins on exchanges, that is my choice, and it is called freedom If I decide to share my private key with everyone I know, that is freedomIf I decide to use and reuse one particular address for all my transactions, that is freedomMy point is, no one should detect for anyone how to enjoy the freedom. You can only advice or teach, stop seeing people using exchanges or doing kyc as anti bitcoin.",

Even now people are with a state of mind, using centralized services is good for some reasons. Particularly getting help, if something wrong have happened with our transaction. Some were not in a situation to understand that having the key gives us the complete control over the wallet. This will change and to experience the change it takes time and even now we're at the earliest days of cryptocurrency usage around the world.",

True freedom is that no one will control you and that is why bitcoin was created because of freedom against the government. That is why we need to educate those who are new to cryptocurrencies because they did not know what they do, they think it is freedom but it turns to the dark side like losing your money.",

It's called responsibility(freedom and responsibility can be viewed as one thing, but being irresponsible has little to do with freedom). Every person is responsible for his/her own financial situation. The people are responsible for their own financial mistakes, but sometimes they simply get manipulated and lied to. In that case, the scammers take the responsibility.I don't think that using crypto exchanges and doing KYC is anti-Bitcoin. KYC is required by the law and the people are complying to the rules.Trusting a third party with your coins/money is definitely anti-Bitcoin, because the whole concept of Bitcoin is to NEVER trust or rely on a third party. Be your own bank. Satoshi never told us to trust custodial centralized crypto exchanges.",

It's a correct observation that by using Bitcoin in a centralized manner, like storing it on exchange, you lose a lot of the benefits of Bitcoin and introduce the same old risks of the traditional finance systems. Just because you are free to do something, it doesn't mean that it's a good idea or others shouldn't be able to dissuade you from doing so.",

If bitcoin is made as an alternative currency to the Fiat currency from your point of view, then there is a limitation in it which is also contrary to your point. Like if I want to buy shirt in my locality I can't use bitcoin to buy the clothes so I have to sell the bitcoin first before I can use the Fiat money to pay for shirt. And that is a big limitation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is an alternative coin, and that means bitcoin did not come to take over Fiat currency but it came to support it and make it stronger. The only thing is that bitcoin removed the third party control. Everyone control their funds. So if you have 1 BTC for 10 years, your 1 BTC is still intact. But in Fiat banks it you have 1 million, it will reduce within 1 year because their service maintenance fees, electronic maintenance levy, card maintenance levy, SMS levy, USSD levy and Internet Maintenance levy etc. Because of all these levies and fees, BTC comes the best of all.",
