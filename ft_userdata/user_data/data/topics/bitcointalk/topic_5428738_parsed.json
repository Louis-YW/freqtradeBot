  "content": "Every game that we come across in life was originated from a village or community. This is our own traditional game that has been there ever since, it is called 'Ayo' which means a game for intellectuals,this is because it needs some mathematical calculation to win the game. It is a board game in which two persons can play in a competition but a home or for fun 2,3,4 or six players can play it. It is called ayo because the seed that is used for the game was gotten from a plant called ayo.In my country especially in the western part where this game was originated, during festivals or traditional events,this game is used for an open gamble as a means of entertainment to the people. An amount will be paid by the participants in other to participate in the game,at the end of the game the winner will be given a huge sum of money and he will be respected by everyone.Can this game be included in a casino platform ? Do you have a local game in your country and what is the name ? How will you feel if you see it in an online casino,will you be happy to play it or will prefer playing something new ?",

That game is called, Mancala in Southeast Asian. That uses small stones, seeds, or any small objects that can be put in the hole.But in other countries, there are different names. That is Congkak in Malaysia, Dakon in Indonesia, and Sunka in the Philippines. I don't know how it is possible online but I think it is more fun to play.",

Yep, I never saw this game in gambling sites or casinos, but it seems interesting to have this game in online casinos.It will be fun, especially if the way to play it adapted from its common/general rules.Source: https://hot.liputan6.com/read/4622861/20-macam-permainan-tradisional-indonesia-yang-perlu-dilestarikan-ingat-masa-kecil",

How will you feel if you see it in an online casino,will you be happy to play it or will prefer playing something new ?In Brazil there is the game of the jaguar (\"Jogo da Onça\" in Brazilian) which is a game originating from indigenous peoples that is usually played on the ground, on the ground and the pieces can be simple stones where one of the pieces represents the jaguar and the another 14 (which need to be equal to each other) represent the dogs.This is a strategy game for only two players, where one of them will act as a jaguar and have the objective of capturing the opponent's pieces, similar to the game of Checkers.The other player acts with the dogs and aims to corner the jaguar and leave it unable to move.In fact this was the only typical game from my country that I could remember, I'm not sure if it could attract any audience on an online betting site, even because it's a very old game, few people know it, much less who play in casinos.",

It also involves a carved wood and either small rounded shells or marbles or stones or seeds as the pieces. But this is seldom played already. This used to be a pastime game, way back when there wasn't computers, cell phones, PSP, and internet yet. Many children probably don't know this local game already. But I think this is also offered in smart phone versions. But I doubt there is a casino that offers this. I guess it's probably because it's not that popular or perhaps it's not really a game designed for casinos.",

      "body": "I don't think said game is applicable, if this is the same game on my mind it should be possible to technically win the game by counting, even if the difficulty is ramped up since you're against a player, counting would still heavily influence the game, and that leads to describe it as a skill-based game instead of a luck based one. It can be fun as a small part of a big festival, as a temporary one, but in a permanent case like in casinos? I don't think it's going to fit.

It was a rather fun past time as a child indeed but I think the game isn't rather well-known even back then, afaik only a few of my childhood friends even knew about it.",

I'm not sure if some of them are actually in casinos already, but I never encountered them. My observation is that casinos have the usual casino games.",

I played this also in my childhood(2 decades ago) which is the first one to fill the last hole with marbles or stones. Sad to say in this generation most of them is they already forgotten it or don't know what is these games. It is usually played for fun at reunions and also kills your time around 3 pm. I also haven't seen any online games about this (or I just haven't researched it) but definitely will play it again.",

This game did not start as a board game, I remember then as kids, that we  usually dug holes into the ground and used the seeds from palm kernels to play this game. Our fingers and palms always got dirty from digging and playing, and it took some time to get set for the game from digging and gathering the seeds to play the game with, but it was a fun game. We couldn't play when it rained because the holes are dug on the ground, we couldn't play in the evenings and night as well as the game could not be played indoors, anytime we wanted to play, new holes had to be dug and we had to play only at convenient times in the day. In a bid to navigate all that, I guess it is were the idea to make the game into a board game originated. Very happy seeing our very old local game discussed here.",
