Please answer only base on your personal experience and scenario because I want to see if people like me struggling too when it comes to handling faith and gambling.I don't consider it unethical personally as as long as you have great self control and play only with money you can afford to lose I see nothing wrong here or unethical.It surely can degrade really soon and going from ethical to unethical in a lightning fast move once you become addicted and cannot stop gambling.You only think about it at the point it becomes an obsession and you don't care about your family,work or any social life that you may risk if continue to do so.Now it becomes much worse than unethical,it becomes a disease which is difficult to recover.My personal experience is that I have huge self control so for me is no problem gambling nor unethical.",

The things that certain gamblers do are unethical, but gambling is not.If you steal money from your relatives after you have lost in order to continue stealing, that is unethical. If you gamble behind your wife's back and even ask for personal loans to finance your vice without her knowing about it, that is unethical.We could talk about whether the fact of being a gambling addict could make us consider the person who commits unethical acts less guilty, but it does not free him from all guilt.",

Certainly unethical from a certain religious point of view, and linking it with remorse makes that opinion even stronger.What if you changed your mindset? I don't mean to be against religious opinion, just an exception for myself. I have said many times (despite other users disagreeing) that I gamble to lose, more precisely I pay to enjoy the entertainment that casinos provide. If I have lets say $10, then I will set the price for each round for example 20x round it will be @$0.5. If other people say I gamble, that's fine. I personally think, my way to have fun with my money is in casino services.",

Some Faith totally forbid gambling and consider it unethical; some other faith only considers gambling Unethical when it becomes done too much out of control. Know your faith and stick with your beliefs. If your faith sees gambling as unethical and forbids it, it becomes sin to go against that belief while you are under that faith. If your faith allows it, but says you shouldn't do it too much, you should also follow your faith, it becomes a sin to gamble too much, but not a sin to gamble itself.",

So it's quite normal to get confused by this question. I personally feel that if I am using my own money for gambling after taking care of my liabilities and responsibilities, it shouldn't be unethical at all.  My own money is my own property and I have every right to do whatever I want to do with that. But it becomes unethical when I don't take care of my liabilities and instead gamble with that money. But that's my personal take on it and it may not match with your own belief.",

I know that this is being discussed many times but in your personal opinion not the general post shit. Is gambling unethical? Please answer only base on your personal experience and scenario because I want to see if people like me struggling too when it comes to handling faith and gambling.This is my answer to your question friend, if we base it on the bible, what is written in this book about gambling is bad and wrong. This is clearly stated in the bible.Now based on what you said, the reason why you continue to gamble is that it gives you happiness even though you know it's wrong. That's how we are people, when we are told that it is bad to gamble, our answer is always \"Why is it bad to be happy?\" Even so, even if it brings us happiness, let's just remember that everything wrong and bad results are always bad.Now is this an Ethical question? if we base it on the bible again, it is clear that it is not ethical. Because even if we face the God we believe in, I'm sure we won't say in front of God that gambling is ethical. Because we know in ourselves that this is bad and God doesn't want it. We just insist that we're happy even though we know it's wrong.",

However, whatever the argument is, it will not have a big effect, let alone solve the problem you are facing. I also embrace faith, however, in truth if I involve everything with religion, then I am a sinner.  however, let's be realistic. do you think everything that is prohibited in your religion is still very relevant in this era.I am fond of gambling activities, however, as long as I don't harm other people, and don't neglect my small family, moreover I am responsible for myself.that's fine.",

I am especially against when someone imposes their opinion on me - I believe that this is a personal matter and everyone should choose for himself (if it is important for you to know, gambling is not unethical for me).Secondly, I think that you should not \"sum up all your spending on gambling\" and be upset by the result, as this is a destructive approach. If you think in this direction, then you can \"cross out\" from your life all unnecessary (but pleasant) expenses, rest, time spent on entertainment, communicating with friends, etc. and come to the conclusion that in this case you would be a multimillionaire.

Is paying tax ethical, if you live in a country that uses your tax money to pay for things that go against your religion? Like capital punishment?
