Many of these platforms were built to last for a while and then move on with people's money after they've met their goals. You must learn about cryptocurrencies and conduct extensive research into the types of projects to invest in as well as the exchanges you will use to purchase your crypto assets if you are new to crypto trading and investment. There are reputable exchanges where one can feel safe when trading. Exchanges like Binance and Kucoin have a great reputation, and it is recommended that you choose one of them.",

Has anyone else been scammed by FX-Chain? Don't send them any more money. Asking you to send money so that you can withdraw your money is a very common scam. There is no reason why they can't deduct a withdrawal fee from the withdrawal.They may give you some complicated reasons, but don't just accept their reasons without verifying them. Post them here.Quote from: Apeterd on May 23, 2022, 07:50:19 PMThe profit I have earned on Algo trading and special trades has been very good but the problem has been withdrawing the funds  They tell you the profits have been good only because they want you to give them more money. There are no profits.",

Is there any way I can get this back?When I asked about deducting fees from my account as opposed to me paying them upfront I got the following reply\"The fees cannot be deducted from your account as the funds are being held in a segregated accounts\"I presume this is all part of the scam! They did pay me back 250USD a few weeks ago, I wanted to make sure I could make a withdrawal before I put more money in.Because the Crypto transfer is getting blocked and apparently now returned they are sending me a international bank transfer today which can take 3 days, I have asked for proof from the bank that should come this morning.They are still answering the phones and e-mails so at some point I guess it will all go quiet",

It's very likely that it will amount to nothing, but you really have nothing to lose by trying.Also, probably report this to the likes of Binance and such. Maybe you get lucky and the scammers end up sending the funds over to major exchanges like Binance. Don't get your hopes up though.",

Is there any way I can get this back?There are common sites you can use for trading like Binance, OKX, Coinbase and many like that, it is good to do a research about an exchange before you will send your coins to an address given to you by the exchange, they will not refund you any money, it will just in a way you can deposit byit can not withdraw.I will advice you to consult your lawyer for help, but do not think you can recover back you money, the probability is low, if you pay in bitcoin or altcoin, it may not be traceable and the money is just gone. But if you have money for investigation, you can report to your lawyer. Avoid not to be scammed twice, you may see some recovery services online that they will say they can help you, they only want to scam you too.",

The modus operandi is unfortunately well known, where by you are asked to pay further sums in order to retrieve your funds, using some half-baked excuse about taxes or fees. Obviously, if you pay, you’ll engross the loss even further.",

I would recommend you reconsider your online activities that led you to start sending money to those scammers and be exposed to such scam opportunities.I tried to do a Google search on FX Chain and the results show audio software. Searching for \"FX blockchain\" suggest a project called Function X. But that's not it, is it? That token is listed and is trading on several exchanges.",
