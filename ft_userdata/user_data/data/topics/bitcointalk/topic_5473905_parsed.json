  "content": "Greetings everyone here on this forum, I hope you guys are all having a wonderful time. Alright, please there is this pressing issue which I have noticed to have been occurring here on this forum for over a lone period now, and yet it has been on an increasing number which I will like us to discuss & deliberate what possible solutions can we use to address this menace, and I'm sure most of you should be asking what am I taking about, and by that I mean \"Forum Loan Defaulters\", just as I just came across This thread recently, and the main reason why I created this thread, because if we all keep mute, not only are these defaults likely to damage  themselves, but our entire forum community at large, and as such we all need to come up with best possible solutions to address this menace, in other for lenders to be able to determine who is and who is not eligible to get a loan, so as to drastically reduce the rate at which people default for loan, while we maintain the integrity this forum has always got once day one.So here are my few solutions to solving the problem of loan defaulters.1. Do not give a loan to an account that may have been found to have woken up after a very long time: It's been proven that people buy & sell accounts here on this forum, and I think it's high time people giving out loans consider how active a person has been on this forum before issuing loan to them, so as to avoid future issues of loan defaults. (E.g imagine a person buys a Hero member accout for $300 and then use that account to take a loan of $1000, that individual must have probably made a profit of $700), and as such they don't mind damaging such accounts with multiple red tags.2. Do not give a loan to anybody whose wallet address shows he/she has not been receiving  inflow of funds for the past 120 days: Just as 120 days is a factor to be consider while joining a signature campaign, I highly recommend how much comes in & out of person's wallet who intend to take a loan also be considered, because this is money, and it will be very bad to give loan to someone that have been proven not to have a steady inflow of funds. Because how is he supposed to pay back loan of he is not having steady income?3. Do not give a loan amount to anyone whose  his/her full 3 months signature campaign payment can not afford to settle such loan: Imagine a person earning $50 weekly come and asks for a loan of $500 from a lender, because to me, no matter how active such person may have been on this forum, such loan should not be granted, as it is a complete red flag. As the only loan that should be given to people is an amount which his/her Full signature campaign payment could be able to able to pay between 1 or 2 months, because normally nobody will want to be giving out his full weekly payment, and as such if then happens to pay half, then it will be able to take him 2 to 4 months to complete his loan payment.So that's all I have to say..  However, What have you to add to this, as your opinion will be very important to those that have been lending loans here on this forum. (e.g Shasan, DarkStar, Condoras).Thank you & may God bless you all.",

Received funds is not a good indicator for trustworthiness because the person who has a lot of funds coming in could just chose to not pay.You only take a loan if you have an urgent situation to deal with and don't have enough BTC at the moment without buying more.",

This rule would affect them but they lenders sometimes give out this loans to people still because they check their account activity and the trust they have kept in past trades. Even if this is implemented people that want abscond without paying would still carve a way to do it.QuoteHowever, What have you to add to this, as your opinion will be very important to those that have been lending loans here on this forum.

The only way would have been a collateral loan but that isn’t achievable due to the forum and location Quote from: shasan on October 20, 2023, 11:37:19 PMBefore accepting a loan I see a few things about them:#Trust# recent merit# recent post# Signature campaign.",

If it's just for profit alone, the amount of money that defaulters have stolen from him is enough reason for him to stop his loan service, but he or she just seems to be someone who is out there to help those who are in need and with an open mind, and he trusts people need help. It's just unfortunate that most people take his kindness for weakness. I have come across a thread where someone even suggested shasan end his loan service due to the high rate of losses that he has been recording, but his statement back then was that he doesn't plan on stopping that any time soon, and many were saying things like he should turn his service into a charity kind of thing since he just likes to help people. But that's not the case. I have benefited from the shasan loan service when I needed it, and I pay it back so fast because something I was expecting came in earlier than I expected. That's what I believe the service is for, but some people are just out of their minds for others downfall, which is really not good.",

      "body": "You have spoken and written well but let me clear one thing we don't know here, any one who have an evil act towards borrowing money can never be changed no matter how hard or strictly the lender may seems to be. In real world outside this forum there are people who are in founds of accumulating debt here and there not because they don't have means of pay back but it's an evil acts or do I call it wicked acts maybe I can say bad spirit in them that do not allowed them to settle their loan. Even though all this are implemented we would still have defaulters, so what I will like to suggest is that if possible lender should try to confirm from the manager who is managing their campaign to know how long it would last so that if giving any campaigners a loan he would know when their campaign will last and he will also know maximum amount to give to such person, after confirmation the lender should keep records so that when another participants come to apply he would know when their campaign going to end. Then lastly, just as you said lender should reduced the rate at which he release money at least maximum loan for a regular person should be $1,500 ( I mean a reputable user who often take loan from them) and also in long term project, then rest application should be limited to $300 to $600 maximum and this should be based on your account rank, for full members $100 to $150 max, for Sr. member $150 to $300 max, then for Hero/legendary $300 to $600. But if they request above this then lender should know how close or how often they have been doing business together or possibly he should have direct contact with the person either whatsapp number or Facebook username should be shared in pm to established additional trust.",

I think that was then if he is giving out such huge amount of loan without any collateral but currently I don't think if he would still try to give out such amount again. Although I can't judge but can only give to people he has been doing business with no doubt, if any new person come to seek that huge amounts I don't think it will be possible currently. However, what I outlined may not be the final solution but rather as a contribution if they feels to implement the suggestion then it's left for them to readjust the amount which might not be exact what I listed above.",

There are other lenders on the forum who constantly request collaterals, and you can check their page to notice that their service is not active at all, even though they have not stopped their services.The second option may be more practical, but the possibilities must be determined and ways to deal with them, especially in the event that the borrower fails to pay for a week or more.

In addition, there are other ways of earning money off the forum to be able to repay their loan. These should be taken into consideration and left at the discretion of the loan giver.",
