Bitcointalk is not like other social media platforms where you can use various emojis or styles. I am taking the meaning of the lightning zapping feature wrong here or you are taking it wrong. Because according to me it is a feature in which we can send money to someone's wallet address using the lightning network. And this feature will be included in the specific places mentioned by the OP i.e. profiles, posts, topics, comments, etc. And I think if that feature were added then it would be of great help to the topic creator. And if a person or topic, post, or comment creator can get some money on making some post, then why would a person not want that? I mean if I will be provided a chance to make some money on my content then why would I not want that.",

Because every platform has its own ways of compensating the members, and the method of this forum is so unique and authentic, even though the merit system is not that old relative to this forum. I really think we don't really need this upgrade, and it definitely needs a lot of modification and work, and I don't think that they or any other administrator would do that. I hope this will be added using some patches.Then Ninja and other good developers might come up with a patch that could be added. But even if this feature is added, who will send you or someone some small satoshi just because he or she liked your post?People are not that cheap, but they just don't want to give away their funds, especially satoshies. I hope you are getting where I am.",

Right, I was just about to post that.Quote from: Quickseller on February 20, 2019, 01:11:00 PMPeople are free to open LN channels and send tips if they so choose. LN is probably unsuitable for tips since the recipient has to be online. That's why these LN tipbots all hold your money, which I'm not a fan of. If you're using LN through a trusted third party, then you're better off not using it at all.The forum does not want to accept money from users, and it is not possible to manage tipping LN network service without the need for a third party.The most you will get is the ability to add a QR to your account, which you can do by modifying your avatar.",
