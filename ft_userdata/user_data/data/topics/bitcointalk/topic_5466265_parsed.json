We often come across terms like Web3 and Web 3.0, but until now I didn't know that it was something different, that is, that the goal is quite similar, but the ways to achieve those goals are different.When it comes to Bitcoin, the speaker intentionally (or out of ignorance) puts Bitcoin in the same basket with altcoins, that is, she thinks that all cryptocurrencies are only for trading and making profit, completely ignoring the reason why Satoshi invented Bitcoin.As for the rest, she talks about everything, from NTFs, dapps, DAO, which she compared to communism, and a lot of other things that seem like a bunch of nonsense connected in one sequence, but I think it's too superficially explained for anyone who doesn't have at least some prior knowledge in order to make an objective conclusion. I think it is quite logical that the web develops and goes in a new direction where it tries to achieve some new goals in order to satisfy what people are looking for in the 21st century. In all of this, there will be complete failures, countless scams and failed ideas, but also things that will undoubtedly change our lives.",

It's not that I blame someone for having superficial knowledge about something, but considering that the person is speaking publicly and that the number of views of his video will be significant, those who watch it can get a completely wrong impression about why Bitcoin exists and why there are alternatives to it. Of course, the most debate is about price and profit, we are all responsible for that in some way, but at least we can warn from time to time that Bitcoin has a completely different function, which some actually use.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 10, 2023, 03:53:29 PMScams and failures are normal when it comes to new inventions, what is not normal is complete lack of actual use cases years after the tech got introduced.

Volatility is the biggest problem for many, but even with payment processors, people have a hard time deciding to spend their cryptocurrencies, because tomorrow or in a month they may be worth much more.Unfortunately, the freedom of the internet and the possibility for everyone to create their own cryptocurrency or token has its downsides, and scammers take advantage of this. When there is a call for more regulation in that sector, people usually protest because they consider it a restriction of their freedoms, but at the same time when some scammer pulls off a fraud of several billion dollars, they point the finger at the same regulators and demand that they do something.I don't see how it will be possible to keep the same freedoms and at the same time prevent all bad people from doing bad things - all the warnings coming from all sides simply do not meet the understanding of all those naive millions who just want their chance to succeed.",

Bitcoin and Ethereum, so-called blockchain technology and all of the crypto sphere is now showing similar rate of progress. Bitcoin today is not too different from Bitcoin at launch -and same goes for Ethereum and its ecosystem. If the Internet was as slow and clunky as it was at the time of its inception, it would have never became mass adopted.",

It might seem slow now, but each discussion, each project, is a step towards a future of widespread crypto adoption. I don't really like relying on regulation to improve the rate of adoption. Not to mention people can already run their own payment system with open source software without giving any personal data. I believe the key issue is the technical side if we're talking from the seller's perspective. Other than that, I do believe Bitcoin already reached its goal as a trustless payment currency that doesn't rely on central authorities to issue and confirm new transactions.Sometimes I wonder what kind of future are people looking for when they mean \"world-changing tech\" or \"mass adoption\". Is it being able to pay for your coffee with BTC in 1 second, use your BTC on your toll-gate without relying on fiat conversion, be able to live with your BTC on a remote island, or something else? It doesn't help that sometimes they just lump different projects together without explaining the developer's ideas when they start the projects.",

World has quickly moved to the next big thing in the internet - AI. Meta scrapped the development of their web3 platform after realizing that people are not coming back to use it over and over again. It's just like NFT. Any tech that doesn't provide value to human life, are bound to die. That's exactly what happened to Web3. No one had lost perspective but Web3 doesn't provide a long term value to us. Game over!",

They are the makers of centralized investments, in which control is transferred from the companies like Visa and MasterCard for payment services that claim to be decentralized, while they control everything, as the owners of smart contracts and mint function can make any change. In the blockchain, adding more currencies or making some of them invalid is a transfer from central banks’ control over cash to third parties, but it is far from the development of the Internet and the concept of Web3. The economic background is what makes the opinions of these experts inaccurate because they are still measuring cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, in Traditional economic terms.",

Volatility is not a hurdle but you can use it to gain an advantage. I wouldn't say that scams are a hurdle either because they are normal everywhere.There might be other real hurdles out there but they shouldn't stop us from doing what we love.

Not much movement is heard from any other tech giants on web3. It was just a hype which died faster than ICOs and NFT. From my perspective, I would support Sabine because I strongly feel a lack of vision in web3. With millions and millions of dead token, exit scams and a lack of practicality has murdered that entire hype. But that's what free market is all about.",

The one being discussed is mostly related to crypto, which means those who offer interconnected devices and apps. I don't think ICO and stuff like NFT need to succeed before you can call Web3 arrived, since people can definitely use their wallet to connect to apps like DEX and so on. That being said, I don't think what they promise has been achieved due to various reasons, such as a lack of interest or terrible security on smart contracts.",
