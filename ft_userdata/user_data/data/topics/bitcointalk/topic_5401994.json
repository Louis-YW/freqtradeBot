This sounds great as it could offer more learning opportunities to those who are interested on it, and could change the mindset of the people that bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme. I just hope that the government of the state won't interfere on this as this could threaten their fiat like they always believe. Well anyways, as long as everything is for free, i don't think that people will not bite on this. Hopefully the program will succeed and could create changes on part of their learners.",

There are no 'known' personalities in bitcoin, that is why it is so decentralized.

You are right, the resources out there are just waiting to be tapped but some people need motivation why they need to get interested in this market.Even after and during the education with 'bitcoin academy', the students have to look for resources themselves to advance their knowledge, it is impossible to advance in knowledge of bitcoin without your personal effort, so the students in the end fall back to the resources they have left untapped for a long time. There have been a lot of things happening in the network in the past 13 years to motivate people about bitcoin, that is the reason i do not feel this will attract people that are really interested in bitcoin.",

There has always been a clamor for Bitcoin awareness, for Bitcoin education all around the world. Here comes Jay-Z and Jack offering free Bitcoin education program, contributing to the goal. Why does it seem that some are suspiciously questioning it? Are we not appreciating the fact that there are individuals who adopt a proactive approach in helping people become aware of Bitcoin? A lot of people, if not most of them, lack self-initiative. Oftentimes, a little nudging would help.",

I suggest you read the line carefully because I never stated that Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme. I only highlighted that some people believe Bitcoin would make them rich quick and because of that most Bitcoiners are skeptical to introduce Bitcoin to them. I recently introduced Bitcoin to my cousin and he was comparing it to some shitcoins investment scheme that promises to give people 49% returns in one month.

Bitcoin education is key to it's adoption and advancement. Be it seminar, academy, conventional or non-conventional education people need to hear and learn about the opportunities Bitcoin offers. One of the biggest  obstacle to the success of Bitcoin in Central African Republic (CAR) and El Salvador is lack of awareness or knowledge of Bitcoin process. NGOs are investing huge human and financial resources to ensure that the inhabitants of these nations become conversant with Bitcoin.It might be strange to you that most people in CAR don't have access to the internet or electricity. How would they learn from the internet.Jay Z and his partners are doing a tremendous work and they are even giving out free WiFi and smart phones. This program will really go a long way in empowering interested participants. We must learn to appreciate every effort made by anybody to ensure that even one person learn about Bitcoin.",

It turns out that  Jay-Z is very well versed in the basics of bitcoin, which he is ready to teach with the help of an educational program. But I have a question, where did he learn all this? Maybe he has an old account here and we don't even know?  What is the fee for these courses? It would be great to know what kind of information these courses provide if any of the forum members visit them. I don't think it's for the sake of learning something (as if it can't be done here), perhaps out of curiosity.It is difficult for me to evaluate this event in view of the fact that little is known about it. I can assume that there is an element of advertising for bitcoin in this, thanks to well-known and public figures like Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey. It also remains an open question for me whether their goals are so disinterested.",

Let's compare and contrast the experiences. Many have been burnt for accepting this irrational belief.Quotesome Bitcoiners have been very skeptical to introduce it to some friends and colleagues.Well, skepticism would depend on the angle the person wants to introduce Bitcoin to his friends. When I came into this industry in 2017, I was all over the place talking to friends about Bitcoin even when I didn't know much about it. It was like singing a strange song to them. Most of them didn't get interested. Fast forward to the present, they want to get into it now. On this I will say, if you get to tell someone about Bitcoin and they don't show any interest; don't bother them. Just leave them, at their own time they will come around it.BTW, I like the fact that Jack isn't any more the CEO of Twitter at a time this is happening. Otherwise, scammers are going to latch at this to claim to be Jack on Twitter to offer fake crypto giveaway. Even at that, idiots are still going to fall prey if anyone dangles a free giveaway before them.",
