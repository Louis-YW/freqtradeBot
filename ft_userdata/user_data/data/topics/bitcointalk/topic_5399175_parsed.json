In other words, if a buyer and I agree to pay in Bitcoin, do we need to check the law before registering the contract?Overall, although it is a rare case, the growth in the use of Bitcoin is on the rise and soon we will hear more similar stories.The funny side is that the user has sold Bitcoin before the last crash.",

Does it mean besides the costs in bitcoin for the property, the buyer has to pay extra costs for the deed of sale and registering the property (taxes to the government), right?The price of houses in Portugal is very high, unfortunately. For example, a house in Lisbon (the capital) hardly sells below $400k.And although the person buys the house in Bitcoin, he will have to pay the deed and the respective taxes in fiat.Quote from: PaulBf1 on May 25, 2022, 01:21:43 AMI  never understood how bitcoin can be used in large scale buyings like these.the coin itself is not stable and highly volatile and although this may be fun and all in a bull market but in the bear case as we stand today that BTC you recieved can lose 1/2% of its value in a day.For 3btc + transactions this is alot of money and an unessecary risk taken by the sellr.I don't think btc was supposed to be used like there,not unless it got severly regulated or backed more.This is very subjective. You say it's a risk for the seller, but the same goes for the buyer.Now that the price is down, it was a risk for the seller. But when the price goes up again, it's already a risk for the buyer.Then it all depends on how much Bitcoin you have. For those who have hundreds of Bitcoin saved, maybe it pays to make this type of purchase, rather than converting into fiat and paying capital gains (in Portugal you don't pay).Quote from: uneng on May 25, 2022, 02:35:42 AMOne of the properties, for example, was pricing 130BTC, and after few minutes when I checked again it was 129.7BTC.In turn, the price is fixed in the act of deed. That is, the exchange rate of the day is the amount paid for the house.",

But lets just see if there's something good deals with this since for sure the buyer or seller compensate and consider the volatility when making a deal.",

But lets just see if there's something good deals with this since for sure the buyer or seller compensate and consider the volatility when making a deal.But when the seller accepts to sell with Bitcoin, it makes no sense to be thinking about converting into fiat right away. It makes no sense.And we come back to the same. The risk is for both sides, the price can go up or down, so it becomes risky again for the buyer/seller.",

In other words, if a buyer and I agree to pay in Bitcoin, do we need to check the law before registering the contract?Depends, for example in the UK there's something called a stamp duty, which is basically a tax on a house purchase over a certain threshold, so if you did go above that threshold, then yeah you would need to pay the tax on that. Other countries might have different things too, plus you're going to need solicitors to sign off all the paperwork to be above board. Anyway, it's always best to make sure you're ticking every box you can when it comes to big purchases. So, consulting with legal representatives is always recommended.",

Back to the OP's topic. If Bitcoin isn't completely illegal in your country you can use your Bitcoin to purchase houses, cars, or any assets that you want.Not only in Portugal, but even in my place I saw there's a house and lot for sale in 4 Bitcoin.  But I think as a buyer, you should contact a lawyer and ask advice for on this matter first to know further if you aren't violating the law.",
