The bull will surely set in no long time but it's still not a guarantee yet investing with caution is still recommended but in the world of investment it's only risk takers that makes the difference",

And all the media persons and content creators are either really paid to do this stuff or they are just copying it from someone who is paid to do this stuff.",

Some people do not expect to see huge price falls because they expect to see always a bullish market while even a crash is necessary for the market because during this time some people will have to exit and leave the market because of having weak hands also some buy orders need to execute in lower levels, buy general if you have a long term investment plan even a market crash cannot be scary.",

But whenever the bull starts again, wailers will join the market very late and when the big guys cash out, the market will dump on them. It is repeatedly but we never learnt the lessons. It is just the nature of crypto, that is the spirit. This same thing is the reason newbies fall victims of fake icos and projects, because it is the period of bull that all the projects will show up and it will be difficult to know which project is genuine or not.Inflation is already killing the world, yes there won't be collapse of the economy because the government is ever ready to print more fiat.",

Look at the conditions to go there, and you will lead the entire humanity out of poverty, the current epidemic, or fight. Don't be complacent when you yourself have a good life that you are thinking. Things are still happening and not everyone has enough awareness to get out of the spiraling problems in society. Who will be able to help with this? It doesn't just come from individuals, but everyone should be grateful for the lives. The poor, the rich, are all concrete examples to let us see if life is going well or not  . I myself have wasted many things in this life, even money, and I think it is like a tool to help us raise awareness, but it is never a goal need achieve. And now be prepared for the poverty that will come if people do not agree to overcome but keep their personal opinions.",

The legacy type of people will be the ones that end up being richer than everyone else. Because, those are the people who are looking at it so long term that they are not even including themselves. Imagine a scenario where you are holding a thing until you die, and telling your kids to keep holding it, and imagine how long that is.For most people that is at least 50+ years. We have seen what bitcoin has achieved in 10 years so far, so if you hold it for another 50+ years, it is obvious that it is going to worth so much, it will be a rare metal type of very valuable thing. This is why people who are willing to hold and never sell even until they die, will be the real rich people.",
