Good luck Aren't those personal badges only temporary? I recently observed one on PowerGlow; I'm guessing it has something to do with useful SMF patching work. Others, I know, are contest badges. Unless you wish to make something out of it, those are nothing. Those that won the pizza contest wear one as well. Don't lose sleep on it.",

Good luck Fortunately, the OP has plenty of time to move in that direction, although I doubt he would ever succeed in it, considering that he very often asks this kind of pointless type of question instead of looking for the answer himself.Quote from: Igebotz on August 24, 2023, 12:23:27 PMAren't those personal badges only temporary? If we talk about some forum contests, it seems to me that the winner keeps the badges permanently, and the others get them temporarily, while for some other badges the status is permanent. @gmaxwell has a badge called \"Bitcoin expert\" and there is no doubt that it is something permanent, although I have to admit that @achow101 seems to have had a badge in the past that I can't see now (Bitcoin-Qt core developer). It is possible that (like some other things) badges can be removed on request.",

Many of thr forum members have badges when they have done something for the forum and others got it from joining contest. As others have said, that's the only thing you can do which is to check each profile that has badge and then count it until you will no longer find a forum member that have badge.",

I am not aware that such a contest has ever existed, and the only logical explanation is that the admin made it as a small recognition for some members who deserve it for a certain contribution in the development of Bitcoin.The link to their list is in Forum ranks/positions/badges under Badges.",

Sometimes an old topic appears on the surface in which members with such badges can be found. One of the examples is this very topic -> NSA and ECC and this one -> Thoughts on type safety and crypto RNGs",
