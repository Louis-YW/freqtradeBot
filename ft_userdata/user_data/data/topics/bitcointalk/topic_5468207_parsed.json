Nai be say if them they experience flood like the way other state they experience am, enough things go spoil for the state.I been hear say those states way dey for hills, them they experience Earthquakes once in a while, abi nah watin dey cause most of these collapse?

      "body": "I hear the tori too say the bridge for Enugu collapse and till now nobody don hear anything like casualty but the truth be say for we country here our government no dey take road maintenance serious. Old roads and overhead bridge wey don last for at least 20 years suppose dey on steady maintenance because their life span and durability don drop. This maintenance culture and habits wey we dey lack for we country here naim dey result to all these hazards. Na to award contract for street road wey no get meaning just to embezzle funds forgetting the one wey dey need maintenance so as to avert any future occurrences. All wetin dem know Na to award road contract to dey do inferior roads then embezzle the rest. After some months roads don begin dagbaru.",

Know one thing certain in our country that a compromise must be there no matter how you try implore some predictive and preventive measures towards those contractors.Do not even think of that Eleme Uyo road as the road is in a camatose state.  That road is nothing to write home about or is it the trailer park road too. Ha that road is very frightening  to start with and the roads both lane are death trap. You can imagine driving in between two tankers or trailers and both are on potholes trying to maneuver their ways and you are at their  middle driving just imagine the scenario and how frightened you will be. What annoys me about the road is that the revenue generated from that quarters and the presence of multinationals, refinery, coupled with fact that the it is an oil producing local government yet see the nature of their road. It still baffles me that our country would still be battling with road matters of construction, durability, poor materials, contractors negligence and lots more at this stage of advancement. This nation ought to have gone beyond that level and be facing world standard production etc. After so many years of drilling oil and trading it yet these roads which are used to ply some of the federal and state equipment through land are still this way begging for attention with lots of leaders come and gone, the road is still the way it is.",

But the bridge for no collapse na even though e need maintenance why e go collapsed like that, me no get anything to shuck mouth on because anyhow we talk am na so e go still dey or remain because no be wetin me and you dey reason wey those government officials dey think their own na embezzlement to carry our money do wetin dey their eyes.Any way I go say make we limit this talk before e go stir up the other people wey from that state to dey think say we dey spoil their names because anything politics dey very sensitive and it's easily leads to personal beef and misunderstanding if not properly handled.Make we reason this matter well together o. E don get any time una hear say bridge fall for north? or una don hear any time wey the north complain for poor state of road condition for their place?. This thing con make me dey see the reasons why e be say things dey go well for north there compared to our south here. Dem award road contract for north there dem dey do am well to international standard. Their roads na clean one wey when you see am you go dey wonder weda our people here dey see the roads dem wey these people dey do for their place at all and funny enough the money wey dem dey use do these roads for north dem no reach 60 to 70% of the amount dem dey take do km roads for south here. Wetin I just see for this road matter for south be say as e be now road construction dey involve big money, these our top men them dey use am settle their boys and loyalist make dem use hold their side and as e be now say na dem get government them go just do the work any how carry money move and inmost cases, dem dey do budget padding nobody go talk anything based on say na chop i chop things when your turn reach you too chop carry go nobody go make pim.Like as I talk before I no go wan go dig things wey concern me or not related to things here wet my eyes dey because if you carry government matter put for head e go worry you like mad and like this nothing come out from them so I go better we just face here than to dey give ourselves high blood pressure based on say we get government and them no do anything or even wanting to take her citizens serious. This chop I chop or share the money don really set us backwards for long now I go like us to remain focused than wasting our resources.",
