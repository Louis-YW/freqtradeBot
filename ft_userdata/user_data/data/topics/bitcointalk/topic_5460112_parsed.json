  "content": "I received an email titled \"In re FTX Trading Ltd., et al, Case No. 22-11068, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\" from ftxnoticing@kroll.com.The email content is about the detailed instructions for the filing of proof of claims for customers. I still have balance in there and I'm not sure if this is a legit email since I don't know anymore what's the official email of FTX for the claim. Anyone received this email just in?",

The content of the thread is too long while the email is totally new to me. I already submitted to the official claim portal so I was surprised to received another email containing another set of instructions for claiming. I will disregard this email just to make sure my funds is safe.",
