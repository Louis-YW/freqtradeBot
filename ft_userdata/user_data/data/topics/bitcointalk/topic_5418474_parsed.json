I am thinking about Doge coin or a Hardware wallet? If you expect him to spend in the near future, then yes, hardware wallet is the way to go.But I expect the elderly are not interested in new hardware and may have difficulties with a hardware wallet. In such a case you can generate on your own HW (or a an air gapped live OS) a new seed which you give to him (at least 2 separate copies!), along with an address - so kind of paper wallet(s) he can import in his hardware wallet in the future. And of course, fund that address for a good start.Obviously, you will have to tell him about seed safety and about checking his address on a block explorer.",

It's better for you to give him some coins in order to make him actually a holder of that's coin, personally I don't really think Doge is really good coin to give, Bitcoin is better. This will make him feel excited about the coins you gave and surely he will hold for long time.",

I try to do this too to my parents when I'm on crypto but they just told me to convert the crypto gift to fiat so that they can use it since they are too old to learn crypto.",

But, if he already owns some cryptocurrencies, a hardware wallet would be my choice - if he doesn't have one already. For those new to the crypto game, a hardware wallet is the most secure way to store your coins, and it has some additional benefits over software wallets. Having a hardware wallet is just part of being a crypto holder. It's like getting a bike after you've learned how to ride a bike, it just makes sense.",

I am thinking about Doge coin or a Hardware wallet? It's amazing that a 64 year old man is interested in crypto currencies. Usually, at this age, they are concerned about other issues than money. Since your case is unusual, I think the best gift for your uncle would be a hardware wallet. Why? Because this device is easy to use and a good way to secure their crypto currencies. Exactly what can be useful for an elderly person, so as not to waste time studying and setting up crypto wallets. Which model to choose, you can see here - [BIG LIST] Hardware wallets (80+). Dogecoin I would not give. Bitcoin would be better. But between BTC and Hardware Wallet, I would prefer HW, because it will be a physical, material gift, and not something abstract and not tangible, like crypto currencies. I'm trying to take into account your uncle's age, and therefore the habits of the older generation, for whom tangible gifts may be the best option.",

I've taken the liberty of translating his list, putting together my own updated version here: [VELIKA LISTA] Hardverski novčanici, and I will continue to update this list as new hardware wallets are released. Although the post is in Croatian, it gives a broad overview of available devices, links to official websites and price information. The list also includes a few comments on each device, as well as a link to a review article where you can learn more about the security of each wallet.",
