  "content": "Certainly everyone is hoping for a time when bitcoin would achieve total mass adoption and utility. With every news concerning development of new technologies in the blockchain and bitcoin gaining ground in the world, even now big companies like Blackrock have now gained interest in bitcoin. Meaning that the big players have now seen the same glimpse of light that we saw in bitcoin either as a real valued asset or as a good replacement to fait currency and centralization. And I think that everyone is so hooked up on the next big news of mass adoption without even knowing that this news would only favour one set of bitcoin enthusiast the \"hodlers\". If I'm not mistaken the total supply of bitcoin cannot exceed a max of 21 million btc, which means that they can only be 21 million whole BTC for the entire world to compete for, this strategy is good because scarcity determines value, but as a bitcoin enthusiast you should also be worried and cautions not to be a mere viewer or commentator of bitcoin history. Just imagine all the total supply of BTC has been mined out even If not all maybe up to 98% of BTC how many of that amount would be in your wallet. Incase you don't know with every news of mass adoption bitcoin continues to gain ground and as many people continue to invest in btc it also adds value, and this would continue to a point where the entire world value is now beign put in bitcoin(this is just a possibility I see) and possibly the billionaires of the next generation would be those with the highest amount of bitcoin in their wallets, and in that same time people would struggle to get even scraps of bitcoin maybe 0.00001 bitcoin a simple satoshi that might even worth a thousand dollars, if you haven't thought so, I think you should start believing that bitcoin really has such potential. The reason I'm writing this post is to urge everyone and to remind everyone why we are really bitcoin enthusiast. There is no point in praying and speaking about mass adoption if you are not hodling bitcoin, because this same event that would bring huge success to some would also be a catastrophic event to others. And what I mean by catastrophic is the huge regret they are going to face not taking action towards acquiring bitcoin. I know many persons have a million excuses why they haven't started their bitcoin journey yet. But why would you be in this forum and still have such excuses, why are u interested in bitcoins latest news and not acquiring some for yourself?, how do you claim to have faith in bitcoin and not show your faith by taking steps to aquire bitcoin?. What I'm saying i simple don't just be a bitcoin talker also be a bitcoin holder, don't have a the information about bitcoin and there is none in your wallet, stop preaching bitcoin when you don't really believe in it cause if you did then u would have some. Let every bitcoin enthusiast change their mindset today and join the winning side the bitcoin hodlers.As for me I was once a bitcoin talker but right now I've taken my stand amongst the hodlers. I've taken my first step to aquire my first 10$ worth of bitcoin, I'm not earning much but I plan to consistently invest in Bitcoin so incase bitcoin enters its next phase of bull run, I would also run with it. Don't procrastinate this year. Start Hodling.I'm not saying anyone should go on start telling people about how much bitcoin they have accumulated, all I'm saying is start your own bitcoin journey if you haven't, stop praying for good things when your not planning on beign a partaker",

Of course there are people who don't still have the knowledge that investment of 10$ today could worth something very big when bitcoin becomes very scarce and the demand will be high as then, so the best is to hold not just for bull run but holding for decades.",

But right now, a little fiat can buy you some big, heavy bags of certain alts. Whether or not that makes you happy is up to you. Investing in cryptocurrency in general is a good business if you are on the right path and with the right platform. As much as possible you should try to look at the big picture when assessing the future of different coins a full year from now. My approach is first to consider what types or groups of coins hold potential for adoption in the near future. For example, I think privacy coins are a solid bet for future uptake. Another group of coins worth looking at are those involved in the integration of social media and blockchain technology. Such bridging projects — projects bridging conventional technology with blockchain and cryptocurrency — will be an important driver for blockchain adoption in the near future.   This is a risky game, and you only have to spend 30 seconds looking at a bitcoin chart to see the wild swings that have occurred in the last few years. This is a game not for the weak of heart and fortunes have been lost or made very quickly. You need to understand the risks before you get in this game, and I would recommend you do over 100 hours research before diving in the deep end.",

In as much as we all want Bitcoin to be adopted in the whole world, it should be more realistic to know that Bitcoin may never be accepted globally. Bitcoin in so many developing countries who have showed interest in it has proven to the world, the essence of making Bitcoin legally acceptable. Still, some countries has proven stubborn either because they are scared of Bitcoin increasing the rate of scam in their country or they don't want something they are unable to control or manipulate just like the fiat currency. For sure, as the rate of adoption of Bitcoin is increasing, so are the numbers of investors and an increase in the number of investors flooding the market, will give an equal rise in the value of Bitcoin.  Holding onto Bitcoin is a common strategy for long term investors aiming for profits. Despite fluctuations, the potential for Bitcoin to surpass expectations suggests it's wise for investors to hold and prepare for a future with significantly higher Bitcoin values. While selling some coins may be necessary, being able to replace them or hold for the long run is advisable.",
