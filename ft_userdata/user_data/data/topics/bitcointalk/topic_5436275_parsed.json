Or you have some kind of agreement with this service?Because if you link to PancakeSwap and your wallet is disconnected or on another network like ETH a direct link does not load the right pair.What's the problem with pointing directly to the swap on pancakeswap? Here's a link to buy your token for USDT. Instead of USDT you can choose any asset for swap without any problem. Note that the wallet is not connected. I don't understand why to use third party service.",

This is an anticipated update for dapp developers which will enable dapps to send a new event to the Vault that utilizes the user’s private key to sign a challenge. The dapp can then validate the signature to authenticate the user and enable specific dapp functions (as an example, unlock content on a webpage for only specific users).Lamden team is currently focused on streamlining the process so Arko nodes seamlessly and decentrally upgrade. Progress updates will continue to be shared as the network prepares to onboard community nodes.The new Rocketswap Leaderboard is offering up to $150 in rewards for traders. Compete with other traders to get to the top of the leaderboard and receive a larger portion of the token rewards.The contract for the new YETI token is currently in the testing phase and nearing completion.

The idea is to offer templates that anyone can use to deploy a new dApp with just a few clicks (with the option to customize in more detail if desired). It’s still in early stages and has been made open source for other developers to contribute to. As a reminder, developers can write and re-use contracts directly within the Lamden Vault wallet via the Smart Contracts tab!A new LUSD LP -> TAU farm will be available on the Rocketswap DEX starting Feb 26.The Lamden Bot continues to evolve in new and exciting ways.
