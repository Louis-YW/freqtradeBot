  "content": "Do you by any chance have old Nokia phone collecting dust in some box?Now you can think about giving it new life and converting this old phone into signing device for bitcoin, and make it similar like hardware wallets.Interesting open source code hobby project was released recently by BitcoinComfy on github (@BitcoinComfy on twitter), it is called BitcoinMRE wallet, and you can use with both for testnet and mainnet.This is app that can be installed on devices like Nokia 5310 from 2020 that can be purchased for around $20, and it has all that is needed for signing device, screen, keboard, battery, SD card reader and camera.Developer said that app should also work on Nokia 215, 216, 220, 222, 225, 230 and 3310 (2017) but it needs testing and confirmation.Other phones that could potentially work with this app:Code:Nokia 200Nokia 320Nokia 130Nokia 105Nokia 150Nokia 106Symphony D67Symphony D64iSymphony s100Symphony s100iSymphony FT60iSymphony FT540Symphony SL10Symphony d52jWinmax w678Winmax w102Micromax x445Zonda ZM340THAlcatel 3003GAlcatel 3041dWestern D32Explay tv240Fly e154Fly e157Phillips Xenium x1560Lenovo MA309Alcatel OT-2012DTexet TM-512RMaxvi (Nokia 225 clone/class-A)Source and more information with sintructions: https://github.com/BitcoinComfy/BitcoinMREIt's amazing what people can do with Bitcoin wallets, and I like the idea for this project, but I wouldn't use this for nothing more than experimentation and testing at this stage.This page is under construction, but you are free to post anything about this topic.",

Offcourse, as you said, not for serious use for now, more like for testing purpose.But I don't have any phones from that list. It's said that phone need to have screen, battery, keyboard, SD card reader and camera. So, interesting, would it workd with any other random Nokia phone which have all these things?",

Try to clean up, try to recycle and then this happens :-)Seriously, looks like a good project. But I have to question if using hardware that is that old is worth it, sooner or later something is going to die just due to the age of the phones. If it was just something you were playing with, and that is what I assume most people are going to be doing with this project, then no big deal. But, for the 1 person who was using it for real and did not do proper backup and was relying on it to sign......Yeah, I know people should know better. Looking at some of the posts here of people who are looking for help because they did something that we knew should not be done but they did it anyway.-Dave",

They are sold pre-paid in vending machines at airports with some minutes & texts & data for not much money for travelers who were either from other countries who had phones that did not work. Or people who just needed a 2nd phone while traveling with a US number. There are a lot of businesses here that use Cable / Fios for their internet & phones and only have the ability to dial North American numbers. Problem these phones from the airport is they are carrier locked / expensive to re-up on minutes. So they get tossed, and then they wind up in the server room e-waste piles.But yes, as with all things like this you should never have more funds on your phone then your phone is worth.The timing was just perfect with me doing the recycle run so recently. Going to have to try it.-Dave",

This old mobile phones are much more durable than most modern smartphones, you can drop them around and nothing will be broken easily.I remember their batteries could hold for a week, and new battery is very cheap and easy to replace, in case if old battery dies.Some of this phones can be found in local flea markets for few bucks, and after years of not using them battery works just fine.I like style of Nokia N97 with slide-out keyboard, and it would be cool if this could work with Bitcoin MRE.",

      "body": "I think that the idea of ​​using old nokia as a HW device is not just a good idea, but flawless. This is what decentralization should look like, when it will be possible to download software on any old phone (with restrictions, of course) and use it as a hardware wallet. Then you don't have to depend on HW manufacturers and there is more freedom. It will only take some time to optimize these ideas and turn them into reality. At the moment, I would not seriously count on BitcoinMRE and would rather wait until everything starts to work stably. But in general, I would like the developments in this direction to develop, including the list of available phone models on which this software can be installed. It seems to me that the future of cypherpunks lies precisely in such projects, providing freedom and independence.",

I am not sure what kind of hardware is available to the general public, but law enforcement certainly has interesting tools that can do all kinds of things. Even those located in shitty countries. I know an IT guy who works computer forensics. Part of his job is to inspect seized mobile phones in search for proof and clues. Assuming we are talking about the same type of \"boxes\", he takes a standard smartphone, connects it to the box, and he can access address books, SMS messages, 3rd-party software even with standard phone protections enabled. And he isn't working in a country known for the quality of their police and law enforcement. We probably can't even imagine what they have in the US, Israel, Germany, etc.",

I understand your point of view and recognize the correctness of what you said. That's right, at this stage, in BitcoinMRE project there is a dependency in both software and hardware. But technology doesn't stand still, and this direction, in my opinion, seems promising and preferable when viewed from the standpoint of privacy and anonymity. In the case of buying a hardware wallet, you leave your data, whether online or offline purchase. But when you buy an old nokia phone or take it out of your locker, it won't attract anyone's attention. The fact that the software is untested is a matter of time, and yet it is an open source app. The idea that you take almost any device, install software on it and get a hardware wallet seems flawless to me (how safe can be implemented from a technical point of view). Of course, now all this is in its infancy, but perhaps someday it will become a popular solution among crypto enthusiasts.",

Similarly, attackers don't care about old Nokia phones now, til the whole formula gets famous, and old phones starts getting demands again in the market because they can be used for hardware wallets. Additionally, these phones have got internet access and bluetooth which is not a nice criterion for a hardware wallet, though no one still utilizes such phones to an extent of downloading games with viruses, But never can we tell, they are different people who would jump on the DIY old phones hardware wallet if it gets popular, and attackers can easily build malwares targeting Java phones.
