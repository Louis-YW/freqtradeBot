  "content": "IntroductionWith the aftermath of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, which led to the collapse of the housing market, the need for everyone to start taking responsibility of their money became crucial. The usage of customers' savings by banks has limited the accessibility of personal funds in some parts of the world. Sadly, this is something customers can't address because it's officially backed by the government nationwide.With the smart thinking of Satoshi Nakamoto, a form of money that gives everyone the responsibility to handle their finances was created. Bitcoin operates solely on decentralization, thereby not involving a third party in every transaction process. Money is easily sent to others with no fear of reversibility as long as there is an appropriate medium of transaction.Over the years, Bitcoin has shown attributes of a commodity such as gold. The process by which they are acquired leads to a diminishing supply from the source, i.e, the more we acquire them, the more they are reduced from the source. A period of every four years is considered the halving event, where there is a cut in supply. Bitcoin's price gradually grows over the years through different halving seasons, marking the beginning of a new cycle in Bitcoin's ongoing price discovery.Interestingly, the primary aim of creating Bitcoin, which is to serve as a peer-to-peer mode of payment, has become overshadowed by its ability to create wealth. Due to Bitcoin's occasional price increases, it has become a source of wealth creation for millions of people globally. The profits that can be accumulated are solely due to long term of waiting. Though, there are certain conditions that Bitcoin offers in order to serve as a wealth creator for anyone. They are...1. Investment -Investment is a major key factor in creating wealth through Bitcoin. There are basically two forms of investment: Money and Time.Money: Certainly, Bitcoin itself represents digital money, so it requires another form of money to acquire it for personal use. With the volatility, we often buy it at different prices, which means that there is no stated price for it.Time: Time happens to be another form of investment, especially for those who apply the trading method. They try to buy and sell considering how good or bad the market price is. These methods help to make quick gain.2. Patience -Bitcoin is never a 'get rich quick' scheme, which means that it takes time to make a reasonable profit from it. In order to create good wealth through Bitcoin, patience is also a key factor, especially when it's a long-term investment. Certainly, we have some holders who have been holding their Bitcoin since 2014/15/17.3. Positive Emotions -In order to create wealth through Bitcoin, it is advisable to maintain positive emotions. Ideally, we can get too emotional, especially when the price drops very deep and it feels like it might crash. Positive emotions give the courage to keep on hodling or trading no matter the market condition.In conclusionThere is no such thing as free money. Creating wealth comes with a cost, which means creating wealth through Bitcoin also comes with conditions as mentioned above. There is no such thing as getting rich quick.Thanks for reading...",

People didn't see it as an asset, they just wanted to exchange stuff. Who'd have thought buying pizzas with Bitcoin would turn into a legendary story? Now, with the crazy price jumps, it's becoming more of an investment game than just a way to pay your buddy. More to discover with the bitcoin community really",

      "body": "QuoteFrom Satoshi's idea about Bitcoin, Bitcoin was not initially meant to become an asset for investments but rather a currency for p2P transactionsWell, we can't really blame them for having such opinion or ideology towards Bitcoin. The benefits of bitcoin seems to have override it's initial purpose. Everyone definitely wants something that would benefit them in one way or the other, but it's very important to keep educating everyone in our own way.QuoteMost AI detectors show that the OP generated the content with the help of AI - so I would advise everyone who sees a beginner with such \"quality\" posts to check the content before replying - because it makes no sense to have a discussion with bots, right?I guess you are wrong. It's seems you are not use to seeing newbies posting good content. Well thanks for reading through.It's great that we all identify our flops. I will also do my best in making my post as simple and direct as possible.QuoteThis is something that not a lot can understand hence why bitcoin gets a bad reputation in the eyes of the general publicMost people, when told about bitcoin, automatically assume that they can just invest and their money will double in size in no time and once this does not happen they brand bitcoin as a scam which will then be spread to other people we must learn how to properly educate other people about bitcoin if we want to make bitcoin more accessible to more peopleWho is to be blame?. Well, we don't need to start pointing fingers at those at fault. I have come to noticed that those who educate others about Bitcoin don't like to talk about the ugly side of it. They focus on the bright side making it look like it's 100% efficient.QuoteIt's really quite discouraging having to talk to bots, thanks for letting me know, I was almost responding to the OP and participating too.Here on the forum there are so many cool things, why do people insist on using this to interact? all for campaign money? this should only be a benefit, not the main interest.Did you bother carrying out your own research before coming to a conclusion?.

At least a source of income is the first consideration if anyone should intend to succeed from investments in Bitcoin. That's why the DCA strategy is often talked about as a way to HoDL few Sats for several years with hopes of its value being intact but with profit when liquidated.Ponzi schemes also require money but for those who know better, it holds no assurance of profit as imagined and for me, I can like it as a gamble that is way too risky with little promise of profit.",

The general conclusion that can be drawn is that earning money or profit is a very difficult thing to do and is full of risks. If we take the wrong step or investment, we must also be prepared to lose everything we have invested, especially since a truly profitable investment is an investment that requires time, so patience is the main key, and there is no investment that can provide huge profits in a short time.",

I'm referring to the corrupt people here. They can just sit and relax while the money is automatically flowing at them. There is no way to be jealous at them though since what they are doing is wrong. I don't mind struggling and earning less money but in an honest way because I can sleep better at it at night. Investing is risky so before we do it, we must already agree that we can lose. And a wrong step is inevitable as well no matter how much preparation we do but it should not discourage us as it is still possible to return on the right path again. An investment that is profitable can sometimes need a timing and luck. This allows us to earn easily or quickly.",

So, trading requires a person to have both time and money, and it's not just a type of time investment where you need to spend your time to earn Bitcoin or other assets.In order to create wealth using time, one needs to offer their services to people so that they get paid for what they do for their clients and customers, this is what we can call a pure form of investment of time to create wealth because it only requires your time and some skills that you acquire to earn you money in the market.",
