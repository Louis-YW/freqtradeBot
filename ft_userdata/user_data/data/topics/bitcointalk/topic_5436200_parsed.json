Because after I checked there were 3 coins with the name GXC.Apart from that, have you never read the thread about how to do a little research before choosing a coin to invest in?Is the altcoin like the gxc coin that you mentioned a promising project or just a trash coin left behind.Don't just be interested in the $100 million supply. the amount of supply cannot be a benchmark for whether a coin is good or not.my recommendation the top altcoins in the top 10 CMC could be an option instead of obscure coins. But still have to do research first. DWYOR",

Many tools are provided to do research in detail. You can learn about it in this forum. When you understand how to choose a good project, you will be more confident about entering the project you have chosen.",

And even if it just cap to $100 million, that is still not the only factors that investors are going to put their hard earn money on it, or for any project for that matter.It should have a solid use case, strong fundamentals to be able to get the consensus and keep this project afloat in the next bull run. So no one can answer you in my opinion, as we can't see what the future holds.",

Explorer shows no transactions. Homepage link on the CMC doesn't work.Little bit of googling tells me that they partnered with REI chain and there has been a token swap. Which makes me think that these tokens are not even tradeable nor you can swap them anymore. They are pointless. So your friends either don't know what they are talking about or are just lying to you.",

And that's why the other projects have built another meme coin because they have to keep in touch with it.That's why the fundamentals is important although it's a different matter if it's about the development. However, new projects should look at those points if they want to get noticed.",
