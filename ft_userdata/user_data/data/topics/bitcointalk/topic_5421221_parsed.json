It has 22 employees listed on LinkedIn.The No.3 crypto exchange globally, FTX filed for bankruptcy last week in the United States and could have up to 1 million individual creditors.source: https://www.sheppnews.com.au/aap-finance/aust-crypto-exchange-suspends-withdrawals/",

Thanks for sharing this very insightful and informative thread by the forum admin Sir \"Theymos\", as there was a whole lot to learn from it, knowing that exchanges are never the best place to save our funds. Because this shows that he/she truly cares about the well-being of every one of us here on this forum.

The suspension of FTX Australia’s AFS licence may have left them without this or other services that FTX may have been providing, leaving their ops crippled. That is besides the exposure they may have had.Possibly in a similar fashion, a popular, yet not very large, Argentinean Exchange call Quantia has frozen all withdrawals due to liquidity problems, stating that FTX was one of their service providers.

BlockFi, a lending platform that was also a victim of the FTX crash after blocking withdrawals, is also considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just like FTX. The death of FTX is so big, it's a lot bigger than Mt.gox or luna caused, I believe we will see many more incidents related to FTX crash generated in the near future. At the moment, withdrawing all assets to a non-custodial wallet is the only way we can do it.",

I checked the site and there are already lot of red flags1) It allows sign up on the exchange with a Facebook account. So if your Facebook account is compromised, your crypto is also gone.2) There is no such notice of suspension of deposit and withdrawal. It is still allowing new registrations. What for ? Getting their personal data and KYC ?Always do your research before making an account on an exchange. So far among the exchanges all over the world, I only have hopes left with Binance. They have even posted their proof of funds recently online which shows that they should not just fail all of sudden. I can understand that people like to use exchanges specific to countries but this should be done at the cost of security of funds and personal information.",

They seem to be strictly controlled by profits that's why they keep making costly financial blunders. Some of their investment and offers are very risky, making them operate like Ponzi schemes.I am predicting that more exchange companies that are financially connected to FTX would also have problems. If they have gone bankrupt, they must ensure that their customers get their funds back.  Currently, I don't think there is any reputable exchange that can be trusted, I might be wrong",
