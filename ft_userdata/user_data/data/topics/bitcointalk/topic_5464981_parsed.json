Thank you replying in loan thread even though you don't any slight intention of giving me a loan.Yes, I think you understand it right. No one will give you any loan due to your rank and even a $12 loan is a good amount for someone. Your account rank is newbie and with that rank you may not get any loan because many times lenders have been scammed by trusting a newbie and that's why there is no chance for you to get the loan.",
