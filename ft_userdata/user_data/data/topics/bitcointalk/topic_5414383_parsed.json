  "content": "Quote(Bloomberg) -- US firms that do most of their business at home will fare better than those exposed to Europe, where a recession is all but guaranteed, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists.A Goldman team led by David Kostin say that while the path of US growth may be “uncertain,” the economic situation in Europe is dire.“Despite concerns that investors have about the US equity market, we believe it offers greater absolute and risk-adjusted return potential than recession-plagued European markets,” they wrote in a note.Goldman’s preference for US exposure comes during what is turning out to be a particularly tough year for business in Europe amid a gas crisis, soaring inflation and tightening central-bank policy. In dollar terms, the Stoxx Europe 600 has lagged the S&P 500 this year and a Goldman basket of US firms with 100% domestic sales has outperformed one tracking those with high sales to Europe.The strategy is one of four that Kostin’s team has identified to drive equity performance through the end of the year, the others being stocks with high quality fundamentals, so-called value shares, and big dividend payers.“Investors concerned about economic contraction should own dividends -- either via futures or through individual stocks,” the strategists wrote. “Dividends offer investors exposure to S&P 500 fundamental growth while minimizing exposure to equity valuation risk.”Kostin and his team are keen on quality stocks that score highly on metrics including strong balance sheets as well as stable sales and earnings growth. They expect the S&P 500 to end 2022 at 4,300 points, or 5.7% higher than Friday’s close, assuming Federal Reserve tightening leads to a continued deceleration in US economic growth.Mirroring Goldman’s preference for cheaper stocks, Barclays Plc strategists including Matthew Joyce turned overweight on value stocks in Europe on Monday, saying that higher-for-longer rates aren’t yet reflected in value and growth.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-safer-bet-dire-082748483.html....It sounds as if analysts are labeling the european economy DOA (dead on arrival). While admitting there might yet be hope for the US economy.I can't imagine europeans will be overjoyed about this. But what can be done about it. The short term outlook is one of reduced productivity and spending. Market efficiency will decline. Leading to a more costly process for producing goods and services for the average consumer. All of these negative trends can be addressed and improved over time. But not with the same mentality and mental state that led to these issues developing initially. It is possible that the US economy should also be considered DOA. While america has silicon valley and many of the biggest, most wealthy and powerful corporations in the world. That won't necessarily be enough to save the country from a global downtrend. Interestingly enough finance google appears to recommend dividend based investments. Perhaps going as far as DRIP (dividend reinvestment plans). Does anyone have any other good ideas for fixing the global economy? Now would be a great time to voice them. Before the situation deteriorates in a way that might further limit our options.",

Most companies in the US seem to be trying to aim for global reach while a lot in Europe are more interested in more local endeavours imo.There's some larger tech firms in Europe though (like Spotify) but they seem to be more focused on one or two ideas than trying to invest in everything and grow monopolies.I doubt the US has a tesco and a Co op which essentially tried to become monopolies imo (but failed  ecause they were competing with each other and caused extra competition from companies focused on their one or two companies).Europe has banned the use of or run itself dry of the limited natural resources it already had.Also, if you're looking to make an investment, you're likely competing against France and the Netherlands for stocks (they buy a lot of their own utilities and infrastructure and, in doing so, also buy their neighbouring countries infrastructure too - to not invest in and downgrade to service their own).Companies that would be ibvestible seem too big and too risky. BP and Shell have business models that haven't been profitible for most of their lives. They've been extracting oil at a rate close to at cost for a moment like this when energy rates go high. They're also big and haven't been split up in a long time. Rapid growth, stable growth and stability are different things, there'll be better places to invest than the US if you're not investing trillions of dollars.As is often said here - there's almost a whole world outside of Europe and the US. That's only 1/7th of the population.",

The US can actually take advantage of this now and get whatever raw materials and other stuff that they need abroad and be a major manufacturer of goods just like what China is doing. But the US government has its own plans is invested in something else (Ukraine and Taiwan). Europe on the other hand already has the materials, the resources, the manpower, and the equipment to bounce back and get out there in the world stage. It's just that they are trying to be conservative on what they had and are expecting for a worse short-term situation for their own. They are still growing, though not at a rate in which the US is, and IMO that is not bad if it wants to be sustainable and solid in the long-term.",

The situation in EU is far from great, but it may not be as bad as some expect.EU has made huge and costly mistakes related to energy and especially the Russian gas, which makes some things very difficult. But they're going to the right direction now, from what I see.Somehow the war seems to be too close, but I still hope we'll not get to WW3. That would be awful for Europe, but will be worse than the expectations also for US.So again, EU doesn't seem to be as bad as the worse expectations and some may prefer the risky bet on Europe, which may give better rewards on medium term.Of course, a company from US (Goldman Sachs) will favor US  I will add a nice and somewhat related meme:Quote from: https://twitter.com/ImNotTheWolf/status/1572576450225778689",

Putin's decision to wage war and invade Ukraine has sent a huge economic shockwave to the rest of an otherwise peaceful region. As a matter of fact, the damaging effects of Russia's attempt to occupy Ukraine has reached all throughout the world. Naturally, as a result, investors and speculators would go somewhere else where uncertainty is not as high as Europe's. The US seems to be a good option.However, it seems the end is now in sight as far as the invasion is concerned. The attempt is now more apparent than ever that it has failed and it's just a matter of time before giving up is the only option left. So hopefully the crisis in Europe will soon end and rebuilding will commence.",

They always tell that criminals use bitcoin, that's a truth but they don't tell you that the percentage of them is so small that it is negligible compared to everyone else that is using bitcoin or even compared to the percentage using fiat! Same with the recent energy propaganda.This is the same too. At this point they can't hide the fact that Europe's economy is a lot worse than the same propaganda was telling you, so they start talking about part of the truth. Then they inject their own lies into it that US economy is \"fine\" whereas it is in a terrible shape itself even if it is not as worse as EU's.We saw this in early days of the war when the European politicians kept telling people that the economy abnd food situation is a lot worse in Africa while ignoring the fact that their own situation was also bad even if it weren't as bad as Africa! Now they are facing a cost of living crisis...In the end, the combination of recession and inflation in United States is going to have \"dire\" consequences for their economy whether they are admitting it right now or not.",
