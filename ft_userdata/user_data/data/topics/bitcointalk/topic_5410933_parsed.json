I have heard that Bitcoin Blockchain do not have central server then Where does blockchain run from ?  Is the Bitcoin Client run from beside Blockchain database in every Nodes ? Or Blockchain has a separate network in the back end from where the data is pulled when a transaction is made ? I need complete clarification about bitcoin Client and Blockchain ? Where those two software are run from ? Thank for your help.",

      "body": "Every Bitcoin client keeps the blockchain (or part of it) to validate blocks and transactions. Therefore, every computer running a Bitcoin client is a node that distributes blocks and transactions to the rest, forming a peer-to-peer network. Bitcoin Core is both a Bitcoin client and a wallet software.

      "body": "Bitcoin core stores and distributes the blockchain also as well as being able to manage wallets (if you open one/some on it).The blockchain is merely a database as said above that gets stored on many clients. Bitcoin's blockchain has no central authority as different bitcoin clients are able to interact with each other as well as other software (like servers for spv/light wallets which can process transactions without the need to download the blockchain themselves).",

It's wallet management, but also transaction and blockchain management. Bitcoin core is quite a complex software.However, the addresses are not actually stored anywhere. All the possible private keys are the integer numbers in a huge range. The addresses are derived mathematically from those private keys. So they don't have to be stored.The blockchain contains transactions. When a block is mined, a number of transactions are included into the block and the block is added into the blockchain.When one creates a transaction he needs to know (from the blockchain) exactly what inputs (yes, inputs, not coins) he can spend and will make a transaction off them, will sign it, broadcast it and wait for a miner to mine it.Blockchain is not a second software; it's just data. The data of all mined transactions until now.",
