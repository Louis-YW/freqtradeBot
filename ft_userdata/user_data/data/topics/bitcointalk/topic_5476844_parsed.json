I don't think Chase is a very friendly bank. To put someone through that. Imagine having your lifetime savings frozen and then your account closed and then you have to go to them on your hands and knees to get your money back. That's what happened to this guy ^^^I wonder if he knows about bitcoin. Because that's too much to trust a silly bank with. putting all your eggs in their customer-unfriendly hostile basket...",
