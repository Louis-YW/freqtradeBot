My argument is that this image is not possible unless the owner of SeeBiscuit1@proton.me made it. No, it can be made by anyone who would be able to use paint and the image posted here:Quote from: SeeBiscuit on January 30, 2023, 01:21:18 AMHere's a sketch I made using PowerPoint: Same hour and date, same battery life, same tabs....

I'll just put it here from now on.You get free art until you decide to not act like an idiot and answer the damn question the thread is asking. :3I found your sick arts are very disgusting, in fact, I assume you don't even make them yourself, these are just some cheap Ai art, not even well-optimized Ai art. First, learn how to interact with people on a forum then try to make some Ai-created artworks. QuoteBut I can make some sick art for you guys.
