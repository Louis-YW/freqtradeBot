  "content": "I took out my Ledger Nano S after years.This seems somehow not to work at all.When I connect it to the PC, the screen of the Ledger lights up very dimly. Can it be that he is broken? Or is it the connection from the ledger to the PC or something else?When I'm in Ledger Live, I can't connect and then I get the message websocket error. Restarting did not help. Of course I don't have the latest update on the ledger. I should repair the ledger but it does not work. Comes then again websocket error.Is it the cable or is the ledger defective? Screen shines just very weak and you can hardly see anything when you plug it in. Lights up then only briefly something very weak. I do not have a second cable in stock now.If I have to order a new hardwallet, does it matter from which manufacturer or does it have to be one from Ledger so that I can get back in with the 24 words?",

It is a BIP39 seed phrase and many other wallets are supporting it. For bitcoin-only wallet, go for PassportFor multicoins, go for TrezorEven many online wallets like Sparrow, Bluewallet and many others are BIP39 wallets. While Electrum is not BIP39 wallet but support BIP39 seed phrase. But importing the seed phrase into an online wallet is not secure but just for you to understand how most wallet support BIP39 seed phrase.",

If you can not go for Trezor, I will still advice you to go for open source hardware wallet, you can use this site to check the lists of hardware wallets: https://thebitcoinhole.com/Only open source wallets are recommended.",

Ledger Nano S has no battery inside it. I have disassembled my device several times and did not see any elements there which would resemble battery. The problem with screen dimming is more likely is in screen itself, it is well established that device has the screen of poor quality and the only way for OP is to buy new display on aliexpress and replace the old display with new one.

I think both Ledger Nano S and S Plus does not have a built-in battery. The only Ledger wallet with a built-in battery that I'm aware of is the Ledger Nano X.@OP regarding to your issue it seems that this issue is pretty common in Ledger Nano S. They fixed their issue by replacing the LCD but if you don't want to buy an LCD you can try to disassemble the unit and try to clean the board and LCD terminals.About the websocket error if the replacing cable does not work as suggested above you can try to clean the USB port with isopropyl alcohol.",

Since you have a backup seed and passphrase you can easily recover it to other wallets that support BIP39.If you don't know how to disassemble the unit check this video - https://youtu.be/388OaC_mClc?si=J2KWAMoN6olBdEWJ",

Does the error still relate to websocket error when you try to connect to other apps like Electrum? I searched through their social media and it seems some users encounter this error when they have a problem accessing the Ledger backend. Not sure how it would translate if you try to use other apps though. What OS are you running right now? Maybe you can diagnose it more if you can use another device to connect your Ledger.I guess the only option left is to export your seeds and move to another hardware wallet/air-gapped device if you can't fix your Ledger at all.

If you have the opportunity to buy another HW, then that Ledger definitely deserves to be broken into pieces and thrown in the trash - of course, only when you are sure that you have transferred your funds to safety. Considering everything that has been happening with that company in recent years, I believe that their devices are nothing but a potentially big risk.

You could restore your Ledger wallet in BitBox02, allthough I personally wouldn't want to do it as I barely ever trusted Ledger after all the shit they've allowed or planned to happen.If your Ledger wallet used legacy addresses (P2PKH, those that start with 1...), you may have trouble with BitBox02, because the latter doesn't support legacy address wallets (not sure if this is only a limitation of their wallet software that communicates with the BitBox02 hardware or if the BitBox02's firmware actually doesn't support legacy address wallets anymore).As I don't use Bitcoin legacy address wallets with my BitBox02, I haven't tested it with Electrum or Sparrow connected to a BitBox02 wallet in particular.",
