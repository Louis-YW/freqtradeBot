Bitcoin is a very ingenious \"invention\"!But behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto is most likely a large team.How likely is it that, Satoshi Nakamoto's identity is still under speculation we all thought he is an old man from Japan or Craig Wright, there was a thread I read he is from India and there's speculation that it's a NASA team but I support in greeting him a Happy Father's day because he is the founding father of Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency community, so every year we should greet our founding father a Happy Father's day, as a way of thanking of bringing Bitcoin.",

If you created the post out of compassion then that's a good thing, otherwise it's not needed to wish him as father of Bitcoin.I see what you mean, but I've seen several articles that also use the term \"father\" when talking about bitcoin, and I don't see anything wrong with calling Satoshi the father of bitcoin. He seems too rigid in this, sometimes, create or born can be understood as almost the same, and people call him the father of bitcoin just because he wants to create more friendliness, nothing else. Father's Day and bitcoin, they really have nothing to do with each other, and the topic is really unnecessary. But it shouldn't be too upset when people pay homage to Satoshi for creating something as amazing as bitcoin.",

I must confirm you my friend that Elon Musk rejected the people's claims who called him Satoshi Nakamoto, and somehow he pointed that Nick Szabo had the same ideas like Satoshi and he could be Satoshi Nakamoto. However, I'm very sure that Nick also rejected those people's claims who considered him Satoshi.Some people recently considered Steve Jobs as Satoshi Nakamoto, and that was done only because Apple included a copy of Bitcoin whitepaper in their operating system. So, these allegations and claims will remain the part of the game and I'm very sure that the original Satoshi Nakamoto will remain anonymous. I don't think he even needs to reappear to confirm that he's the real creator of Bitcoin. His idea behind creation of Bitcoin came into light of the day and that's more than enough for him.",

We don't know if Satoshi Nakamoto could actually be a Father he might actually have a son at some point, right? At this point all of this doesnt really matter anymore, in my opinion, it's better to be this way since claiming the Title Satoshi Nakamoto would affect Bitcoin, it might be difficult to prove this but it's surely possible I can see a lot of problems if that happened probably countless of cases, etc. But what really matters at this point is Bitcoin we all believe on it.",
