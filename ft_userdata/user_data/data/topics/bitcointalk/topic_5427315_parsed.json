  "content": "*Edited; repayment to be over 3 months*Hi all:I hereby open a loan request asking for 0.1BTC (equivalent to just over 1'600 EUR at current prices). Repayment would be made in tranches, 25% of loan value (denominated in BTC) each month for 3 months; meaning a total repayment of 0.125BTC. If situation permits, it can also be cleared in one go earlier. I have no collateral to offer. It would be sent to my forum-staked address: 12hYBWiPqfwdveGzpbRdGxeqnoMcNvGNSqThe use of this money would be for living expenses while I transition to a new employment role (in 1-2 months, realistically the start of February, would be the first salary payout). In the meantime, I am assured part-time employment earning me roughly 1'000 EUR monthly.Thank you for considering, and have a nice day.",

The best I could propose is 2.5 months - meaning the last tranche would be repaid end-Feb. This just means I pay larger tranches, which I could still do.",
