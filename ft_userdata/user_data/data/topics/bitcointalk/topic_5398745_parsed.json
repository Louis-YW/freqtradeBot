Iâ€™d simply emphasize the need to read a fair deal on the topics you are most interested in, which leads you to be in a better position to elaborated content. Rank should become a by-product of the time you spend on the forum reading and participating, and not a primary objective though.",

Be someone that is responsible here. Do your due diligence first as a newbie on how to be an active member without breaking any rules. Merits will follow if you did do interesting contributions. But beforr that pay attention to the beginners rules posted above.If you have knowledge on crypto, might share it and some might be dropping merits to you if your post is quite interesting.",

This is basically how it works:Over time, as you participate in the forum discussions, you gain activity points on your profile. Other forum members may reward you with merit points if your comments and replies are of good quality and/or valuable to them. These merit points are also recorded in your profile. Activity and merit points together comprise the basis of forum ranks.Check the following table for exact requirements for specific ranks:Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIn addition to activity, everyone now has a merit score, and you need both a certain activity level and a certain merit score in order to reach higher member ranks.

Dear Newcomer, congratulations on your joining to bitcointalk and welcome. Nothing prevents you from gaining new knowledge on this forum, so get started. Everyone can become a good member if they are willing to share their knowledge and experience (gained outside of this platform) with the rest of bitcointalk forum members and become useful to the community.It will take time to get to a high rank anyway (due to the need to accumulate activity and merit), so I can suggest being patient and not chasing your goals headlong. Being patient is the key to success.You have already been given a link to get acquainted with the requirements for increasing the rank. Study it.Quote from: Stalker22 on May 15, 2022, 04:54:42 PMCheck the following table for exact requirements for specific ranks:Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIn addition to activity, everyone now has a merit score, and you need both a certain activity level and a certain merit score in order to reach higher member ranks.
