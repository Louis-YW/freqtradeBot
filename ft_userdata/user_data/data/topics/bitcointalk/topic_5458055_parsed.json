  "content": "Hello, everyone. Todamant, and I have discovered, or maybe it was already known, an interesting issue regarding privnote. I sent him a btc address on privnote to make a payment for some cards. The address I sent is not the address he received. So I double checked and sent the same address to myself through privnote, and what I received is not what I entered. I have done this now with multiple wallet addresses, every time the decrypted privnote gives a different address than what you put in.  Todamont  has confirmed the same thing happens when he does it with a wallet address as well. I dont know why I sent Todamont my address on privnote, as I have never done that before. I may have just been tired. But the loss on this is minimal, and if I can keep someone else from making this mistake I’d be happy about it. Anyway you guys try it out and confirm, or let me know just how dumb I am for not already knowing this.",

These scammers are pretty decent. Have you checked any of the address just to see how much money they’ve stolen so far? I’d be curious to see those addresses.    I went ahead and used this site and gave the following addy.....see from pic below....you can see what I placed and what was give are not the same just as OP mentioned.      Here is the balance of the one they gave https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q50r0529jkml7hlswcfj5av2wgqc3efpc35c3wm      I tried another yesterday and it was zero balance....so I guess sometimes they generate a new address.                 Also years ago there was another site impersonating privnote.....here is an article.   https://www.hackread.com/fake-version-note-sharing-site-privnote-com-steale-bitcoin/    Again...I say....I would send the btc addy to the person using two different channels.....     Example....if you want to use privnote that is fine and send thru forum. But I would also use another service totally different and send thru an email...discord or twitter...email...etc etc etc. Then I would compare the addys.    Another way.....if for any high amount...send $10 in BTC...confirm it has arrived then once that is done, send the rest.",
