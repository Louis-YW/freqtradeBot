Indeed, I comprehend the three concepts (rules) that have been discussed. Additionally, if you have talents outside of this forum, you can bring them in and offer your services here. For instance, computer literates can advance quickly if they give the forum their best work; for instance, graphic designers can offer services such as campaign designs, project logo designs, etc. Another example is programmers. If they can offer services like website building and administration or handle certain code issues, it would aid in the growth of both the understanding of Bitcoin and other topics.",

And then you will become a person with valuable posts that you will write easily, and they will be interesting to others. But how to become such and what is needed for this? 1) subscribe on YouTube to channels on cryptocurrencies that you are interested in. The same is true in telegrams. Your horizons will expand. 2) On Twitter, subscribe to the exchange that you use - Binance, for example. This way you will be aware of all the current changes. 3) Learn about the ways of earning, such as Binance earn. There are more than 5 different ways to increase your deposit without doing anything. 4) Build a security wall around yourself, antiviruses, reliable wallets... after all, why do you need to earn money in the crypt if everyone can steal? 5) Find friends of cryptomans. It's easier to learn together!Follow these tips, and the forum will open to you from a new side. and everything will become even easier and more interesting!",

Hopefully one day I will be able to be giving advice about bitcoin too.The forum is very educative. I also like that it gives room to discuss other interesting topics that does not relate to crypto matters. It really helps members to relax, explore, share and learn about other unrelated topics.",

You offer helpfulÂ adviceÂ to newbies and junior members here, but it's shocking to see that after more than 4 months of participation in the forum, you haven't earned more than 2 merits yourself.

You should add that instead of posting on valuable topics that will help others, it's better to instruct users to make sure they're constructive in their posts anywhere they post and that they are on topic. I would not instruct people to just post on topics that are valuable.",

But sadly, a lot of members --I think OP included-- see the forum and signature as main source of income. That's why merits and ranks are important factors as it means bigger paycheck from campaigns. Ironically, I think this is one of the reason why merit system is being introduced to the forum on the first place, to deter people making pointless posts for the sake of ranking up and/or get paid",
