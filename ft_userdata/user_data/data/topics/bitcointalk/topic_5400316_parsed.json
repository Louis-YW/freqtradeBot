Just click the link to see the case study.What’s interesting is that there are companies working to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. I think what Uniswap did was genius. And really, this is only the beginning.What do you think? Would you buy a $160k pair of socks?",

I think what Uniswap did was genius. And really, this is only the beginning.I think with the advent or crypto and blockchain, every industry innovators are trying to bridge the gap already and we have witnessed int's boom in late 2017-2018. However, not sure how many of those projects succeeded though. Because it seems everyone is just copying once idea and claim to be the next tools to help companies, for example selling merchandizes.Quote from: alexcopper on May 26, 2022, 06:15:24 PMWhat do you think? Would you buy a $160k pair of socks?  Nah, I will rather bought other things with that huge amount of money unless you are a crypto millionaire.",

Would you buy a $160k pair of socks?  Another case of NFTs?No, thank you If you buy them at $160K, what's the guarantee that you will see them again at $160K and above?People think it's just a matter of buying and then selling them off at a higher price, but it isn't the case. I am waiting for a full-blown bear market to take place, that's when most people will open their eyes",

      "body": "Through my reading of this page ---> https://4k.com/unisocks, I got some negative indicators that will push me not to invest, for example, but not limited to: - Trying to rely on a successful name like Hayden Adams and the Uniswap team without real marketing of the idea. - Some common words like NFTs are exploited without really telling how to solve the problem. - An idea is not addressed, but ideas are put forward that may not be realized. - Socks does not bring about a new innovation or solve a previous problem, but rather it makes a lot of promises.Therefore, without delving into the details of the project, it is better to avoid it, or at least unless the developer team gives more convincing reasons. It is better not to invest in it.",

      "body": "Thanks for mentioning NFTs so I didn't have to click the link and see.I think Uniswap already made a mistake (to their profit of course but to the long-term detriment of crypto) when they did their Uni airdrop. Fine, it was a governance token but seriously, whoever used it to vote, show yourself, this governance token idea is never something people who use Uni or similar ever want. So that's false utility.They've gone on to milk NFTs, can't blame them, that's the industry for you.I get the point of physical collectibles, even digital representations of those. I don't get purely digital NFTs. I get they're a fad with dwindling, not increasing interest for the vast majority.",
