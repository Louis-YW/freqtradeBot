However, we can't deny that since Bitcoin still holds significant dominance (currently 55%), a major price movement in Bitcoin will significantly affect the altcoins as well.",

Before the era of Bitcoin/altcoin trading, you had to deal with the volatility of both coins. Typically, when there was demand for Bitcoin, altcoin values would decrease, and vice versa. Now, with fiat/USDT, you can focus more on your trading strategy since you're only dealing with the volatility of one asset, given that USDT, a stablecoin, has a stable value.",

It means that some people will use bitcoin in the past to buy altcoins, unlike now that stable coin has replaced that. I do not believe in something like this. I believe they are all somehow connected to fiat in the past. Many people may not be able to buy altcoins directly, but first convert to bitcoin and then buy altcoins. So if they do not buy bitcoin now but buy altcoins directly, there will still be no differences.",

More investors troop into the Altcoin market after the bull season not just on any Altcoin nor top ones, they prefer going into the new launched ones that has lots of potential of probably giving X100 or so from their invested capital. In the same way it probably would not matter, BTC/ALT or Stable or Fitat/ALT does not change the narrative of we experiencing the Altcoin season after the bull run.",

As far as I can see, the altcoin market is still following bitcoin's movements, every time bitcoin corrects, most altcoins fall. There are only a few altcoins that can move against like XRP, the rest I don't see any altcoins that can rally while bitcoin corrects. So it can be said that Bitcoin is still the one who decides the market trend. But can't completely deny OP's post. I also read Ki Young Ju's recent posts and have to admit that what he wrote may happen in the future. Since the bitcoin ETF was approved, most of the money flowing into bitcoin has been through ETFs and it is not easy to shift money from ETFs to the altcoin market. So if the altcoin market wants to survive, there needs to be new money unrelated to bitcoin ETFs.",

Yes their has been lots of money flowing into Bitcoin through ETFs. But what we talking about here is more that just ETFs alone. Logically to many Bitcoin is the safest Crypto-currency and this trend may not change. All eyes remains on Bitcoin, so Bitcoin determines the market Regardless of any other factor(they all still favours Bitcoin) most investors who are pushing altcoins especially the low cap alts are just investors trying to see if they can make 10x and above but right now more people are looking for the secured crypto and that's what Bitcoin is.",

It's either you keep your Bitcoin or sell it for altcoin, such that if Bitcoin's price falls, it signals that the money is moving into the altcoin market, and vice versa. Today, however, in the top 10 alone, there are already 2 stablecoins, powerful coins. Indeed, this has changed the playing field significantly. One can now get out of the Bitcoin market without necessarily going into the altcoin market, and vice versa. The signal is lost. People can park their funds on something stable and trade from there as well. That the largest volume in the entire cryptocurrency market belongs to a stablecoin is indicative of that.",

By less severity of corrections, dips, I implied that it is possibly less severe in percent, but in $ value, maybe it will not be small.

Yes, they add convenience to the process of crypto trading, but I don't think that selling BTC for stablecoins and selling BTC for fiat is that different. Altcoins were always bearish when BTC was bearish, so I don't think that selling BTC for altcoins would've increased the profits of the crypto traders.

This market cycle seems to be different a little, with memecoins began after Bitcoin, and Ripple is the next one. Ripple took over this role from Ethereum and made its new all time high. Many years ago, Ripple had short time of flippening against Ethereum, it's sweet memory for Ripple fans.Ethereum soon will have its show and I believe that it will lead a massive altcoin season next year. This year, it's year of Bitcoin, meme coins and Ripple, next year will belong to Ethereum, but it will be another bullish year for Bitcoin. Because if next year is bearish for Bitcoin, there will be no massive altcoin season in 2025.It shows very big role of Bitcoin in cryptocurrency market, as a leader, or someone call it as The king of cryptocurrency.",
