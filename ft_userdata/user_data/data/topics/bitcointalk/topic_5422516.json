      "body": "Short answer for you is no you will never ever get 1$ from anyone, You need a valid collateral that worth more than 1000$ in order to get the loan otherwise you won’t even get a penny, Plus just to prove that you’re just another scammer is that no trader can make 100% in a month since you are saying you will pay back with interest. You’re full of lies that’s not trading it called crazy gambling. Go find a real job",

Borrow money from your relatives, multiply it using your trading skills and pay them back. Isn't that easier. I am sure they won't ask you for any collateral or interest?",

I must say that there is a huge difference between demo and real, and the fact that you may be good now does not mean that you will be good with real money.Trading can be considered gambling, so you should approach it with the famous one, the stake is only how much you are ready to lose. taking other people's money in order to gamble/trade does not fit in there. maybe you are delighted that you have mastered some trading basics, but your satisfaction with that is not good enough collateral to get this loan",

After all you've not fully tried how psychic skills with just that.QuoteI can return 100% of the money lent with an additional 30% interest at the end of the monthBanks offer lower interest rates (max. only 10%), I think you should try your luck there.",
