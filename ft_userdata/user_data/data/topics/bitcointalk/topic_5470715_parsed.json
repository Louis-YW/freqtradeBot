There are dozens of topics that touched on Bitcoin ATMs, and as far as I remember, there were those who were offering the service of selling these machines to anyone who wanted to install them. I suggest that you work hard to collect links to these topics and add them to this current topic. I think, this would be more useful.I'm also wondering why you made the topic self-moderated. Do you intend to delete comments that you do not like? Usually there is not a lot of spam in this section.",

They are not so experienced for decentralized exchanges etc. We have the responsibility to give newbies the right information. I don't think anybody needs a special lecture to understand or use decentralised exchanges. It is even simpler to use Dex than Cex, therefore newbies should be encouraged to use decentralised exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs charge high transaction fees, they ask for KYC and they are not dependable. Just as normal bank ATMs suffer from network issues, bitcoin ATMs can also suffer from service problems. These ATMs can also negatively affect the privacy and security of users because everybody will know you own bitcoin if they see you use it.",
