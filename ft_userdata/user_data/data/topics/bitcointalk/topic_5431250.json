  "content": "HiIm writing a simple python script to connect to a local bitcoin node and list transactions but I cant get the thing working. I created a virtual environment with:    Code:virtualenv bitcoinenvAnd then activated:    Code:source bitcoinenv/bin/activateThe I installed python-bitcoinlib with:    Code:pip install python-bitcoinlibI have a simple script:Code:    import requests    import bitcoin.rpc    # Connect to the local Bitcoin node    connection = bitcoin.rpc.Proxy()    # Get a list of unspent transactions    unspent_transactions = connection.listunspent()    # Print the unspent transactions    print(unspent_transactions)And I run this with:    Code:python bitcoin.pyBut I get the error:Code:    import bitcoin.rpc    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bitcoin.rpc'; 'bitcoin' is not a packageHeres more information about my environment. When I run:    Code:which pythonI get:    /Users/me/Bitcoin/exchange/bitcoinenv/bin/pythonWhen I run:      Code:echo $VIRTUAL_ENVI get:    Code:/Users/me/Bitcoin/exchange/bitcoinenvWhen I go to `/Users/me/Bitcoin/exchange/bitcoinenv/lib/python3.8/site-packages` and list the contents I see python_bitcoinlib-0.11.2.dist-info amongst others listed (which I think is correct).When I run `pip --version` I get:    Code:pip 22.3.1 from /Users/me/Bitcoin/exchange/bitcoinenv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)And when I run `python --version` I get:    Code:Python 3.8.0Has anyone any idea why I cant import the python-bitcoinlib library?ThanksEDIT:I have changed the script to:Code:import bitcoinfrom bitcoin.rpc import Proxy# create a connection to the local bitcoin nodeconn = Proxy(    network='regtest'  # specify the network parameters as 'regtest')# list the transactions in the walletprint(conn.listtransactions())When I run with Code:python3 scripts.py I see the error:Code:    from bitcoin.rpc import ProxyModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bitcoin.rpc'This is VERY frustrating! Any ideas?",
