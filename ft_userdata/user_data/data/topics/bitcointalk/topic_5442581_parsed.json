  "content": "So this evening, I was thinking within myself, Businesses I could start if I made good money, I mean money large enough that I could start any business comfortably(no matter the cost) without going through any financial crises before, during or after starting the business.So one of the ideas of businesses to start that came to my mind was a gambling casino, online casino preferably for me, so as part of my research, I thought I should put this question out here to you guys …If you made a billion dollars or even more, as someone who love gambling/betting and have been doing this on several other casinos for many years now, would you rather start your own casino? Or would you prefer to keep gambling, doing your sports betting on other casinos even when you know you have more than enough money to start your own casinos and make the casino as big as you want it to be??Inputs are greatly appreciated.",

No everyone wants to build a casino, some people just like it and have fun with it. There are many millionaires in the world if compared to casinos, the casinos are few. It depends on you, but not everyone wants to build a casino.Lastly, you interchanged casino and sport betting, I hope you know that they are not the same, although a gambling site can have both.",

And I am not even mentioning the huge competence in the gambling sector!It comes to mind the case of Barings Back, a powerful back who disappeared because they did not know better and handle over much their capital to a single trader.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baringsbank.aspSo if a century old bank can fail because lack of knowledge or common sense, then it can happen to someone who just turned into a billionaire.",

I think that if one makes his own casino.. may spoil the fun of it. Or, at least, would not play at his casino (and then it's two unrelated things).Having/managing a casino is not necessarily for a gambler. It's for somebody who knows to handle all the legal things, all the software and security issues. Gambler(s) can be asked for opinion now and then in order to spice up the games. But the rest is more management than gambler-mind business.Even more, a gambler may take unnecessary risks with his business (eg start with too low bankroll and risk not having money to pay the winnings at start, especially as the start is more expensive due to increased advertising and bonuses), so he can doom the business before properly starting it. Not a good mix.",

But it never happened. I was lucky that my close people stepped in and helped me to give up the habit.Now when I gamble, I do it for fun. $100, $50 not more than that. And when I lose I do not regret. Never think to make money from gambling. So if I need to have my own casino for gambling then no, that's not the reason I will do.Having a casino needs high bankroll, so that you can pay one or two or even a few lucky guys who will hit large amount or you are done. If I have huge amount of money then I will not risk it in casino business rather I will have a business where the risk is lesser. Casino is still a risky business for the owners. We have seen a few successful casino to shut down. If they were in money, they would not decide to shut it down.Investment in startup are the best way to accumulate your money.",

There is a difference between loving something and managing something as a business. Even with plenty money, it does not still mean that you will be successful. With it as a business there will be a lot challenges to face and with you as the leader, you will be under a lot of stress with trying to manage a casino that you may even loose your love for gambling or betting.

      "body": "The thing is; it's one thing having the money for developing a gambling website or casino, but having the bankroll to make sure you can cover any winnings in the early days is also a requirement. The alternative is you can limit the amount your users can win, even fiat companies do this, but you have to make sure that you can handle the amount of money being wagered. If not, you've been rather irresponsible. The staff don't come cheap either. You need a security expert, you need developers, chat moderators, odds makers, and likely a legal team. Since, the average person isn't going to know the laws around delivering content to multiple countries around the world. Also, you have to store secure data, and you need both security, and the legal process to do so. You don't need a billion dollars though, that's a bit far fetched . Quote from: Oshosondy on March 04, 2023, 07:43:23 PMYou do not need a billion dollars to start a casino even if you want to build the casino from the scratch, less than a million dollar should even be enough to start. No everyone wants to build a casino, some people just like it and have fun with it. There are many millionaires in the world if compared to casinos, the casinos are few. Any sophisticated casino software is going to cost you quite bit. I once got quoted £20k for a project which was far less complicated than a full fledged casino. It wasn't related to gambling, but including a mini game of sort. So, you need quite a bit of money for the software development itself, you need to hire people to make sure it operates smoothly, you ideally need to advertise, and you need the bankroll to cover any potential winnings. It's very likely going to be above, and beyond a million dollars. Quote from: NeuroticFish on March 04, 2023, 08:02:14 PMEven more, a gambler may take unnecessary risks with his business (eg start with too low bankroll and risk not having money to pay the winnings at start, especially as the start is more expensive due to increased advertising and bonuses), so he can doom the business before properly starting it. Not a good mix.Right, which I believe a lot of the sites open today, and are well renowned actually risked their reputation in order to get started. Unless, you're operating a rather low wagering site, i.e restricting user registrations, as well as wagers, you basically need to be a multi millionaire.

Casinos always win or either breakeven in the long run if the games they provide are truly provably-fair and has a lot of regular customers returning. Generally, once they're large enough. However, quite a few casinos fail, and if you aren't careful it can get rather messy quick. I mean, definitely be prepared for law suits too which you should probably be factoring into your costs. I'm not saying you intend on getting sued, but if you've made any errors, then it can easily lead to a law suit. The big fiat companies have been sued multiple times, sometimes successfully.",
