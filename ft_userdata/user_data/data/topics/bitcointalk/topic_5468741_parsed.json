  "content": "Starting October 1 which is today, new GST rates are applied on earnings from online gaming, casino sites and horse racing.Earlier, tax was applied on net winnings from online gaming only if the winning amount was more than 10,000.But then later it was announced that TDS of 30% would be applied on all online gaming winnings.Now they have decided that it would be 28% GST on online gaming winnings which is a relief of 2% from previous tax rates.I had also made a post about it earlier 30% TDS on online gamingBut the question is that tax rate for crypto earnings is still 30%. So the earnings from crypto gambling sites would be taxed at 30% or 28% ?I personally think it would be 30% since crypto is involved and the government wouldn't leave a place where more tax can be collected.Source: Online gaming: 28% GST comes into effect from October 1, CBIC makes announcement",

You then convert your winning to INR. The taxable amount after the TDS deduction would be nil as it does not fall under capital gain if you did the conversion on the same day. You won't be paying 30 percent tax as per your earnings as it does not show you made a profit. The government cannot go after International crypto casinos that are based on a foreign soli regardless of you being a verified KYC user. The law only applies to those individuals who are using local casinos with fiat money. This is not quantum computing or something out of logic to understand. This is a simple loophole in which the Indian government cannot do anything. Unless they come up with a law that forces a user to verify their personal wallet.

      "body": "The 30% TDS is applicable, but since the casinos dont operate like that (on Indian soil) I guess that is waived off for now. But for exchanges that are running here, its pretty damn applicable.Now coming to gaming sites and that 28% tax, its like the capital gain from the games, like @Bitcoin Smith said.The confusion here would be if casinos running outside would have to undergo KYC document submission to the Indian government and the gov then tracks down how many of us are winning money there. Then the decision of 28% or 30% would come in, obviously this would not happen anytime soon.",

Then the decision of 28% or 30% would come in, obviously this would not happen anytime soon.Again most casinos are not based in India as gambling is illegal as per the law. These casinos are always located in locations that are tax heaven, it is not that easy for the government to get user data from them. Crypto Casino user data is harder to get hold of as they do not force every user to pass KYC, plus they are mostly anonymous. So it is out of the question for the Indian government to track those users using these casinos. If they do use Indian exchanges to convert their winnings to INR it won't fall under the 30% TAX slab as there is no way the government would know it is a capital gain. They would only see it coming from an online wallet to the exchange wallet on the same day. If the price of cryptocurrency that is being transferred on the same day does not change capital gain is not applicable.",

According to what I have read, casinos are still operated in India because different states have different rules for them.The government has given the authority to respective states to decide their rules for casinos.This is why goa has casinos which are not operated on land but on ships on water 😂",

Even I don't like the way these apps promote their platforms. They show as if people can earn easy money using their platform.But the hidden truth is that people actually get attracted towards gambling using such platforms.The major problem is that these ads are also displayed on TVs where even the kids watch it and get attracted to it.Government should ban such ads to be displayed on TVs.",

Porn is pretty dangerous too, and it has more psychological effect on an individual like creating an imaginary world of how these things happen is the reason people get divorced and feel not satisfied by their partner, but reality is completely different and for the reference we can even watch the interview of famous porn stars though.Another serious damage is it can make someone blunt if they consume excessive porn and its also same as any other addiction will have bad effect on the lifestyle.",

The ads are there to promote family planning not get people addicted to porn. It is how we take things, someone may get excited and wish to watch porn. Similarly someone may wish to make money and go into gambling. The correct thing is to know that gambling exists and people try their luck but also realize that gambling is a mode of entertainment and so is porn. It is not the actual method to make money.So take home message, Taxation on gambling (and condoms ) will continue to exist, but gambling and intimacy will continue under the tax officers noses like they always have.I think we have steered a lot offtopic, myself to blame (Sorry!)",
