  "content": "Pariz Metaverse is now ahead of Sandbox & Decentraland  in terms of daily transactions as reported by Dappradar.Developed by Trace Network Labs on the Polygon network, Pariz has revolutionized the way we experience fashion and lifestyle in the digital realm.In just two months since its launch, Pariz Metaverse has soared ahead, surpassing both Sandbox and Decentraland in terms of daily transaction counts. Dappradar, a renowned industry analytics platform, has verified the incredible growth of Pariz, highlighting its rising popularity and user engagement. Interestingly $TRACE, the native token of Trace Network on Huobi and Gate exchange has a market Capitalisation of $900k which i expect to soar to $10M considering the growth of Pariz Metaverse and the Upcoming launch of AR/VR devices by Apple. This is because Pariz Metaverse has strategically adopted a \"browser first and VR ready\" approach from day one.In conclusion, Pariz Metaverse stands tall as a superior metaverse platform, outshining Sandbox and Decentraland with its unrivaled features and remarkable growth.",

Is it only from Pariz Metaverse daily transaction reports that it exceeds daily transactions from Sandbox and Decentraland? LOL, that's so ridiculous, man. As you can see in the image above, even people are not very keen on trading $TRACE tokens, it can be seen that on Huobi it only has around $48K.",

That true, the data and facts speak despite the message the OP conveyed about simply informing the unrivaled features and being an extraordinary trajectory for users that Pariz Metaverse has initiated/offered beyond Sandbox's AR/VR device technology. this is what I read from the post above.",

Let's see where it ends up once these hyped investors move on to newer platforms for the sake of chasing profits.Decentraland is dead as far as I know.  Last I heard it had only a couple daily users and it's only become less popular since then.  I wouldn't be surprised if literally nobody is using it nowadays.  I've also never heard of Pariz so if it has any volume at all it's likely from the founders.  The Sandbox however is partnered with plenty of big brands and is constantly having play to earn events with celebrities endorsing the products that are continuously being minted by users.  Unless I'm completely out of touch here, the Sandbox is the only metaverse actively doing much of anything these days.",

It's not good for long term. OP wants only shilling his coin. He knew that if it's almost dead. that's why he was looking for the new buyers by shilling it here. About decentraland, the platform has no incentive for the players unlike sandbox which was always creating competition. Im still actively playing sandbox caused by i can still get decent amounts of reward from there. I never heard land players got incentive from active in the metaverse.Quote from: Yogee on May 24, 2023, 02:44:36 PMWhat's happening to Pariz looks like a sign to avoid since the hype will peak sooner or later hehe.

Even its parcent coin trace network coin already dead since it was dumping so hard and never recovered again. What i can take from this thread is as a promotional thread only.",

Let's see where it ends up once these hyped investors move on to newer platforms for the sake of chasing profits.It's a wise choice, mate. Not a few of us (people in crypto) are only concerned with a low MC in a project, with the aim of getting a lot of profit. Those people forget the most important thing in choosing an investment, which is the fundamentals of a project and big names. Instead of having to invest in $TRACE, like you, I would also choose proven projects like Decentraland or Sandbox.",
