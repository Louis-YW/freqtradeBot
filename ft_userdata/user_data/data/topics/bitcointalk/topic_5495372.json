Has not worked in the “favour” of the powers that be?Is this true?. There's already an ongoing frightening issues going on in my country that the federal government are trying to manipulate the process of Crypto blockchain to their control by disassociating our local from the crypto exchanges and penalizing fintech banks associating with transactions on the crypto P2P.Quote from: worldtraveller321 on May 05, 2024, 10:17:26 AMRegulations Not Working?Does this prove that the blockchain tech is a success?That BTC could work as a money system for the people and help people to devalue FIAT currency? Or am I wrong and the “powers that be” are winning  and people will lose in the crypto world?Your thoughts?Yes of course, crypto blockchains technology is a success and that's why the government are going mad over it since they can't break into it.The government has no impact that contributed to the development of bitcoin currency and doesn't have documentation about the origin of bitcoin and so they can't get into it.Bitcoinehas never tended to devalue the fiats but alternative means to make payments. Bitcoin isn't responsible for any outcome of devaluing the fiats rather the government in control of the centralized currencies does by which it depends on the countries economy growth which determines the value to the the fiats.Bitcoin as a digital currency also do have its economy challenges at its volatile potentiality of inflation and deflations.The government are only selfish and tasty to takeover a system which is designed to be non custodial because they could understand that potentials it's.The blockchain of bitcoin isn't projected to be one of those techs that would be folded and unfolds to the governance of the centralized authorities.But whichever way, bitcoin potentials of breaking the chain of poverty thats projected by the government against the poor masses can be contradicted.",

I think it will be just fine if both type of currencies can coexist and people can choose which one they want to use other than it being a battle (which Bitcoin isn’t battling against no one).",

Bitcoin was never intended to devalue fiat currencies, that's not the objective of the network.And regulations are working to a very large extent. Majority of Bitcoin users gain exposure to it through centralized channels which the government control and regulate. The pockets of users who are keen on privacy and decentralization grows smaller constantly and the government is already targeting privacy channels, making it difficult for users to stay under the radar.",

Since many central banks has failed to meet customer needs, the decentralized network has been seen as a salvation and as it is now being regulated, I still think it is just only some aspects of it that's controlled and it's working.",

What makes you think the governments don't understand cryptocurrencies or the blockchain system? Apart from a few third-world countries where government officials are chosen based on power and most of them are a bunch of illiterates, all other governments consist of people who are very well-educated and understand everything very clearly, they live in the same world as we do. So if we can understand everything, they can understand it too.There is no rocket science in it, everything is very clear and easily understandable, and anyone conducting a bit of research can understand everything. When we talk about regulations, they know very well what they need to do, and they have regulated platforms and things where they know most people would go at some point, such as centralized exchanges that we use to convert our cryptocurrencies into fiat through the P2P marketplaces.These platforms ask us to verify our identities before we use their services, why so? Because they are regulated. So, in a country where the government has regulations in place, a person within that country using a centralized P2P exchange is easily exposed to them.",

Governments and authorities are working to make BTC as centralized as they can. And they are doing every possible thing to eliminate all the tools and platforms that provide us anonymity. But still where is demand there is supply. One will be closed other will rise. The point is why they are against anonymity. Why they want to keep the track of our money? Well, answers to these questions are not so hard. Speaking of the fiat system it can't be devalued or eliminated. Because banks (fiat) is directly related to BTC. And most of the platforms which excluded the banks from the centre as middlemen and directly allowed people to deal with Crypto or BTC with fiat and vice versa are being used in bad usecases.Which is not good for the future of BTC therefore IMHO such rules and regulations are good to some extent as traditional people will only accept or adopt it until governments won't do something about it.
