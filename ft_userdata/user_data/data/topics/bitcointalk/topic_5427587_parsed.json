  "content": "Hi, I was wondering whether anyone had tried Nonce Reuse fault attack on SECP256K1.It seems so much easier to crack any wallet with this attack. Read here> https://asecuritysite.com/ecdsa/ecd7I had tried lattice attack on my wallet address for 5 weeks now. It works but really slow. I am considering starting a new attack for my research. Your inputs are greatly appreciated. How can i modify this script to accept my R,S,H and public keys ? Please help. Thank You so much.  Code is here.

Are you here to argue with me on what's the word used or would you like to blame the author for the word used?  Have you actually tried this method? I understand your meaning and the general meaning of fault attack.HOWEVER, that's what the author of this website claim it is.SO... despite of the choice of words used..What or how can I modify this script so that it accepts my r, s, h and public key inputs?
