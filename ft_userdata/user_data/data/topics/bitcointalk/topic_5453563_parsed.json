The government won't immediately adopt the concept of Bitcoin since it grants everyone financial freedom, whereas the government is only interested in the meager revenue it can raise through taxes.Crude oil and gold are traditional trading goods that are still in use, but the concept of Bitcoin has eliminated the notion of gold investment for young people since they now perceive it as being safer than investing in actual assets like gold.QuoteDo you think bitcoin will stay if government totally remove their hands or stand against it?I don't think Bitcoin is dependent on anything because governments were not aware of it when it was established, and the concept of Bitcoin is independent of any government policy; hence, Bitcoin will exist even if the government decides not to get involved.",

States such as China and Russia have already tried but they have given up and now it will be even more difficult because blockstreams and other services have sent the blockchain to the satellites so it will be even more difficult even if they were to cut the connection.",

      "body": "The primary issue between the government and Bitcoin revolves around decentralization. Governments operate as centralized organizations, while Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which means the government cannot exert control over it. Consequently, whether the government approves of it or not, Bitcoin will continue to exist. When Bitcoin first emerged, the government was unaware of its potential and did not provide any support. However, Bitcoin has now achieved considerable prominence. Although a collective decision by all governments to reject Bitcoin could impact its price, they would be unable to halt its existence.",

As highly respected as dollars not all countries have it but bitcoin is 14 years now, the world is aware of it. Do you think bitcoin will stay if government totally remove their hands or stand against it?Government rules and cultural acceptability are only two of the many elements that will affect the development and sustainability of bitcoin. Despite the fact that Bitcoin has become incredibly well-known and widely accepted, it is vital to remember that governments are very critical in determining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Governments might significantly affect Bitcoin's acceptance and use if they take a strong position against it and impose stringent rules. Government policies may have an impact on how investors feel, how stable the market is, and how people see cryptocurrencies in general. It is important to note that Bitcoin has some resistance to and independence from political control due to its decentralized structure. Transactions may take place on its peer-to-peer network without the involvement of middlemen or centralized authority. Due to this quality, Bitcoin has remained popular and has survived regulatory difficulties in the past.It is unclear if Bitcoin would continue to exist and thrive in the absence of government intervention. While it may retain its value and circulation, it may encounter difficulties in attaining widespread adoption and integration into established financial systems in the absence of government collaboration or acceptance.Bitcoin's future is determined by a complex interaction of elements such as technological improvements, legislative developments, societal acceptance, and market dynamics.",

However, unless the government is compelled to agree to its usage, this will be extremely difficult to achieve in practice.
