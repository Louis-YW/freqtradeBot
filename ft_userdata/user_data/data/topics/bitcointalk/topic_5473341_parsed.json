I've really learnt a lot from it. It's really good we consider our health while choosing what to eat. Some one the things we consume in excess can become a serious health issue, especially when we start growing older. One of the best ways to keep fit is to always exercise out on daily basis. Even if take a lot of bear or sugar, if you actually daily exercise, you will be on safer side.",

Only water can be taken every day, but some other drinkable liquors are not very recommended for consumption so often. Beer and alcohol are liquid I know can easily mess up one's digestive system, depending on the person's intake level. Mostly when one is getting older, if you constantly consume beers, it will affect the digestive system, and you will begin to have an oversized stomach. Also, if you eat some food, it will not go so well with your system again, and before you know it, you will begin to belch (burp) , releasing some very offensive gas from your mouth and also releasing some offensive gas through the anus.",

When you talk about the effects of Alcohol dem choke. Because of the nature of the drink, e dey cause plenty catacata for person body o. I go like categorize them into short term effects and long-term effects of Alcohol. Even the short term effects of Alcohol plenty but make we just delimit am to these ones wey we for easily understand or dey use to; when person take alcohol, he dey make the person get hangover, e fit make person get accidents either mild or severe, e fit make the person fall as e dey happen severally. You go see young person go take ogogoro come fall inside gutter or pit. Na so e dey end up kill some people, Lowered inhibitions, conflict or fight and risky behavior. You go see say some people take am e dey make them dey temperamental and for that reason dem no dey fit tolerate small thing or in most cases, dem go just dey aggressive unnecessarily. Na so me and my gateman dey battle sometimes if I come back and he's drunk. Him go just dey vex dey talk senselessly but since na very old man, I no dey send am.The long term effect na hin dangerous pass and scientists don attach over 200 different diseases and injuries to the effect of alcohol. Although like OP said, if you take am small small, the effect no dey plenty and the risk they reduce too but no level of alcohol consumption is safe. Whether the person consume small or na heavy or binge drinker.QuoteDiabetes no get cure, you can only manage it with life style changes till you go old die.

Na only to they manage am and in worse cases you fit face amputation of legs like many people out there faces. You see, our system wey u see get different endurance level if you may call it, as in, e get level way everybody fit take toxin or not before e begin affect am and the kind of disease wey dem fit get. So e go better make young people just ignore that aspect if lifestyle and there are still other 1001 ways dem fit enjoy themselves.Because of the addiction wey drinking of alcohol get, e no get anything like make person take small or not. Inasmuch as you dey take am dey go, e go dey eat your body up small small and you no go wan stop again. Na so, if you face small wahala, you go wan sip some drinks to cool of your mind. All these things na hin dey cause problem for people wey dey take alcohol. My advice still remain say make alcohol drinkers quit am.",

It can become toxic to our livers, in our blood stream, and kill brain cells. It's actually a depressant so why do people drink when they're sad only to become more sad? I get that every now and then it's funny to watch people mess up and do silly stuff but all the time? Doesn't it get boring after a while? I don't see the fun in it. I don't find it funny when people are acting stupid from the effects of alcohol. It's actually more annoying to me than humorous. Most people's idea of having fun is getting shit-faced on a Saturday night rather than just chilling with friends.   There are reasons behind the liking and disliking anything. Same is the case with alcohol. What we see we get inspired of that and like to do that either it is good or bad. Specially the youth are today more inspired by these all habits, and they don’t care about the taste. Just to follow the trend they can do anything without thinking about their health hazards. Its well known that “excess of anything is harmful” , if we try alcohol for once or twice, or we take it occasionally then it is not bad but if we start liking it and taking it n regular basis then it is harmful for us.",

When I come see all these things, I begin ask why then people choose to kill themselves all in the name of feeling among? I no even mention the long term effects of drinking o. Some if asked why dem dey consume much alcohol, you go hear things like \"e dey help me to forget my troubles\". This logic nah very funny and untrue one because after you come down from your high, those problems go still dey wait for you to solve am.My brother the society is kind of influential when it comes to these kind of things and that why many people actually do these things especially youth that fall under peer pressure, many people actually feel that getting high is a means of forgetting your sorrows which to me a just a big whole lie that is flaunted in the society while in the case of mature men drinking and getting on alcohol, they are revolving the circle of it's actually a means of getting along \"ENJOYMENT\" not knowing that abusing this habit is just bad.I really understand your points,,, but come to think of it \"what is the essence of drinking excessive alcohol and after everything the problems are still there waiting?\" So even if say pipo dey always do those things because of say others dey for am, that one me dey call am foolishness because 1, the person know go Kno if alcoholic drinks good for em health or not. 2, after the highness when the person brain settle, em go still remember em problems.So watin I dey try talk be say, excessive of everything no good at all.",
