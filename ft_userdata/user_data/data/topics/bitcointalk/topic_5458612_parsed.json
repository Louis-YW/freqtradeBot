It’s very early days in this bull market though so don’t expect miracles in 2023. We should end this year well though.",

So for the year, I don't see $60k happening; although Bitcoin price movement can be surprising most times, it's still not that easy to reach that level in the remaining 5 months of the year, but $40k looks like an achievable possibility.",

It'll end up with just assumptions and ranges because we don't know how the market will play at the end of this year.However, it's most likely that we'll see the price ending this year positively but we will never know if the ceiling could be back close to the last ATH that we have been before.",

      "body": "voted for 40k, but my prediction should be between 40k and 50k. We've seen the price goes up and down a little bit but did not really go down below 25k despite the SEC crackdown. So, we've got an upward momentum now while we're closing in from the bitcoin halving next year. People would start accumulating now, evidently with $30k price now it's still considered affordable as of this moment - so this might continue gradually with more than 5 months left this year, the most realistic range bitcoin could go would be around 40k I guess. It might go beyond 50k, but I doubt it would break the ATH, not until the halving takes place.",

Sure there are recession risks but most likely there won’t be a recession this year most likely next or year after. Economy is way too strong. The fed can raise a few more times and maybe then I’ll start some slowdown.So if they approve the SEC I think we might get like $45K and top out. If they don’t then we might hit a high of $35K this year and just trade sideways for the rest of the year. Horrible liquidity right now in the crypto markets.",

This is based on the Fed's median projection which estimates interest rates to be in the range of 5.5-5.75% in 2023 from 5-5.25% previously.However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell explained that interest rates are currently near their peak target so future increases could be slower.The impact of rising interest rates will definitely be felt, we must be careful because there are still two rate hikes. The rate hike will also be close to Bitcoin's halving. Quote from: adaseb on July 05, 2023, 04:34:08 AMSo if they approve the SEC I think we might get like $45K and top out.

Horrible liquidity right now in the crypto markets.$45k is a good price target even though it is now stuck at $30k and still sideways $30k-$31k. Waiting for some corrections to make the crypto market healthier. Currently, BTC.D dominance is still quite high, which stands at 51.23%.",

I chose $30k or maybe less if other options were available. While I still believe bitcoin's short term uptrend can hit 33k-35k, but I don't see a positive for the market at year end. I'm still waiting for history to repeat itself, I think there will still be dumping before the halving happens, like what happened in 2019.",

It is difficult to predict the price of Bitcoin during 6 months, a lot of water will run under the bridge and it is difficult to predict what will happen, 3 months is the longest period that an individual can predict about the price currently, during which there is a possibility of raising interest by 50 basis points and 25 basis points For each meeting, therefore, I expect that a health correction will occur between $25,000 and $29,000.Bitcoin maximum price will be $40,000 to $45,000",

      "body": "It is never easy to predict the price of Bitcoin, many have tried but were never correct. We all know the sudden jump in price is due to the ETF application submitted by various financial institution. The SEC has not yet approved it but most of us are speculating that a few ETFs will get approved. If they don't then we would see a sharp correction. The global economy is also struggling due to the war in Europe. Many small countries are struggling to survive at the moment. My analysis is that Bitcoin might see a sudden pump in its price if the SEC gives a green signal to the ETF. After the pump we would see again a correction. I feel the price of Bitcoin would be between 35k to 40k.",

      "body": "Bitcoin price forecast is similar to hoping and anticipating a fantasy existence. Only a few people in a million can get the price exactly right. Even people who have been invested in bitcoin from its inception cannot always predict what the price will be at a given moment or month of the year. They can produce a perfect range that sometimes coincides and sometimes fails. For now, one can only make projections, but market volatility always has its own way of determining the price in the end. My forecasts based on how the market is now performing are $40-$50K at most, while they may be an exception in the long run due to how the market tends to adjust. However, at the current market price and analysis of past month till now, my prediction will be $40K-$50K by the end of the year.",

We are still in the $30k'ish right now, so most likely the closest will be $40k. But who knows, maybe when we have more positive news in the next 5 months or so, we might see $50k or even higher.For now let's just put a conservative estimates at $40k, so that if we didn't get the price or top it, still a win-win for us as we are not expecting something big. Instead of hoping for a big price but it's so high that at the back of our minds, we might not achieved that price this 2023. Still a long way to go for us so let's just be positive and hope for the best.",
