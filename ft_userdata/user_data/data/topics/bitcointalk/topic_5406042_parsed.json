Axie has generated more than $1.3 million from selling NFTs over the last seven daysOne of the factors that contributed to the sudden increase seems to be investors' sudden love for the Axie Land NFTs, which give weekly rewards in Axie's AXS tokens.

      "body": "This increasement in volume hasn't impacted SLPs positively so far, since they are still pricing dust of cents of dollar (US$ 0,003). Actually SLP has hit its bottom today. Developers need to create new usages for SLP in order to boost its demand and price again. The last major update which removed rewards from adventure mode didn't help SLP price balance and stability in anyways. It seems it happened exactly the opposite, because many players don't like PVP mode, so they just lost interest for the game once they were forced to play against other players for rewards.But I can't blame Axie at all. It is the most successful NFT game of the industry, which has been efficient in fighting cheaters and keeping the environment sustainable for a long time already. And that is not too little for a limited game which doesn't offer many features, diferent from mmorpgs of the same NFT niche which could be on the top of the world, but aren't because they do nothing to stop bots, scammers and abusers in general.",
