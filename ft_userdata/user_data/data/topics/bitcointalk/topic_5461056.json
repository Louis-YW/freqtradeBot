You talk of the technical aspect of bitcoin and I put it to you that there is no bitcoin related forum that discuss about that aspect like Bitcointalk.org. There are many that have gained more technical knowledge of bitcoin from this forum and I can say I am one of them. Sometimes this things are not free outside but tech savvy guys here give us the knowledge for free. If you’re here for technical aspect then go straight to the appropriate boards and stop spreading negativity. Moreover I checked your post history and you haven’t even engage in there before so what’s the fuzz about",

Yes, there is lot of people on forum who promote such kind of business, and unfortunately, quite significant part of them are spammers or have no idea what they're talking about. But I wouldn't say that we don't have quality discussion here. And some of best forum users wear paid signatures too.Also, you want more discussion about technology (there is actually dedeicated board for such kind of discussion https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0), but you shouldn't be geek to use Bitcoin, there is lot of people who don't have deep knowledge about technology and they don't reallly need it.",

Was hoping for more discussions on the technology and its possibilities.A user has a mixer or gambling in their signature space does not automatically mean that all their posts have to be related to that signature space.If you were observant enough to note the way users post and what each boards are used for then you won’t have created this thread of yours. We have bitcoin discussion board which is for all topics related to the general aspect of bitcoin or any thing concerning bitcoin but if you’re interested in knowing how bitcoin works then you should locate the technical boards. While for gambling discussions it has its own board and sub-board for that. So I don’t see how the signature an user has on will affect their discussion here in the forum.",

Was hoping for more discussions on the technology and its possibilities. Nothing wrong with promoting businesses in the cryptocurrency space. If anything it drives more people to be involved in this industry even. Plus, 90% of the active members here who wears signatures like me and are promoting businesses provide relevant help and answers that are informed, so it's not like no one's getting anything good from this. And to top it all off moderators in this forum offer all-day surveillance to staunch shitposters so the whole site's clear from them. I don't see any problem about promoting a business, and getting paid at the same time while helping people get valuable information or advice with whatever crypto-related issue they are having. Maybe you're just salty?",

Was hoping for more discussions on the technology and its possibilities.Currently, the mixing and gambling industries have the largest turnover of money. New projects either do not have enough initial (real) capital for promotion here on the forum or they even think that it is not important to present them here. Compared to some earlier days when Bitcointalk was the starting point for all crypto businesses, now there are a lot of other platforms and in combination with social networks, they have reduced the influence of the forum.Nevertheless, the most precise information can still be obtained here, especially if we are talking about the technical side. Finally, does anyone expect a direct discussion in the advertising space?",

Mixers and gambling are discussed mainly in the Services sections, while the rest of the forum covers many other topics. Also, just because someone promotes mixers or gambling does not mean that is all they are interested in.So, do you have an interesting topic or question that you want to discuss? Find a suitable board and open a topic. I am sure many forum members will join you there.",

Was hoping for more discussions on the technology and its possibilities.Does a signature of any kind affect the kind of thing that I am to discuss on the forum? NO. My signature space is a hat on my head; the cap does not tell me what kind of discussion to enter. Those who have technical knowledge are active on those technical boards irrespective of what campaign signature they are wearing; they will still be active on their favorite board. Wearing a mixer signature code doesn't mean I will have to be discussing mixer in the entire forum. A signature campaign is different from a shilling campaign, where all your job is to promote whatever project you choose in whatever way you can.Op, I believe you have a wrong idea of how the signature campaign of a thing works. You can just go over to the technical board and gain any kind of technical knowledge that you need; the boards are always open.",

Wearing a signature whether you're promoting a mixer or a gambling company doesn't mean you can't join a healthy discussion besides, they aren't spamming the company that they promote.So wait for it that you can wear and get paid from signature and how does it feel?",

Since anyone is free to promote whatever they want. If worried to experience financial loss on those promotion then do your own diligence to research on what you are seeing and ignore if you don't like the services you see in this forum. There are proper threads to see what technologies like so better go there and you can get a proper discussion about things you like.",

As you've been told, if you want technical discussions, go to the technical boards and you'll get plenty of interesting discussions no matter the signatures. It is precisely the signatures that pay well, the ones that pay the best, that encourage quality content to be written. So don't complain so much, go for the technical boards and enjoy.",

If you are talking about Bitcoins technology and it's possibilities then you my friend have failed to go through the Bitcoin development and technical discussion board, you have also failed to look at the mining, technical support and project development board. Until you have done that which I think you haven't, you cannot conclude that discussion around Bitcoin technology isn't discussed here.",
