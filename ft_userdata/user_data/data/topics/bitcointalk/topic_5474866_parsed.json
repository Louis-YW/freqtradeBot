  "content": "Good day my country people, compliment of the season. I carry one ogbonga advise come board today to share with my fellow bitcoiners. Normally we know how things hard generally no be only for our country but na for everywhere, and to even see food chop sef na by the grace of God. But I still gat advise say make we no fail to remember or forget say next year na the halving event go take place, and based on history the halving dey prove to boost the price of bitcoin, and the sweet part na be say even for those wey dem just like to do trading and not long term holding, the halving still dey bless dem. So my advise na be say make we no fail to buy bitcoin before the halving so that, by the end of next year we go dey guaranteed of say small thing add for our bitcoin investment and anything wey you like to do with am na your choice, but e for still good make we continue to hold for long term.Just as I been talk before, the country hard, the country hard, but that one no mean say make we sitdown look this opportunity pass our eyes, normally Bitcoin no be do or die but for those wey fit make this sacrifice, I believe say we no go regret am most especially for those wey fit do small long term holding, like from now until January of 2025. Also as we dey hold for this period make we no let the happiness of the season allow us to loose focus to sell our precious coin any how oo, and make we no still keep our private key and seed phrase any how, because if you keep am anyhow or you fail to backup, your coins go loss for good.This advise na mostly for the newbies, please be carefully who you tell about your bitcoin investment or holding.",

This life itself is a risk and until someone take certain risk that will change his/her life, it will be difficult to achieve success. Some of us here plays gamble and loses huge amount of money yet we still move on and see it as fun, How much more investing on a project that has recorded huge success since it was introduced. What other evidence do we need to persuade us to keep buying bitcoins as against the upcoming halving, my people this risk is worth taking as I will keep on buying and Hodling bitcoin till the upcoming halving.",

People should not think that bitcoin price will start increasing immediately after halving. Although, we do not know the future, as anything is possible, but we should have it in mind to hold bitcoin for many months after halving for us to make more profit from it.",

I will also like to add that the bet way of securing your private keys and seed phrase is by keeping them in a water proof and fire proof safe. So that should in case we are being visited by any form of natural disaster like flood or earth quake we would still be assured that our seed phrase is still safe, even if its an accidental fire outbreak it would still be safe. I repeat now is the best time to buy coins before the halving.",

But I feel in order to be in the safe side, you that you are not an expert on trading should just avoid the whole process at once and rely on buying as much Bitcoin as you can so that after the halving you can earn some profits from the much expected and speculated bull season that comes after it.",
