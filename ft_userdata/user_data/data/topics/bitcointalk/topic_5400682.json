Right now, we don't see  lot of good projects and the gems can be so hard to find...and even if you can be certain that one can be good nobody can predict if the market will also like it. I stopped supporting many project in 2022 and I just select a very few that I am sure can be long-term and I just \"invest\" some amount of funds with them. Bear market is the time to retreat a little, do some good searching and yes prod many platforms to continue on building as this stage of the market will soon be gone, anyway.",

Of course, everyone should do own research, but it seems that the team and the community are very sensible about the market situation. In my opinion, this is a good time to buy just such a memcoin, because even if the prices on market will drop, the price of this token cannot, because it is only at the very beginning, and when the bull run starts, its price will certainly increase along with the entire market.https://www.pussdao.com/",

The visibility of good and bad projects does not rely on the current market situation. But yeah, I agree that we should focus more finding good projects with concrete plans and development team and not just memecoins or shitcoins because they suck during bear market. Plus it is not safe to invest amd gamble in shitcoins even in a bullish market. It is recommended by everyone I assume that we should rather invest on projects that has a real plan and can stay for more than years and not just days or weeks. We should spend searching and finding gems during this market situation even though it's quite hard to find them.",

That is certainly a clever way to make them look good to their investors.But bear market isn't just the time for building and development, its also time for teams to reveal their real intention to which if they  planned to scam from the start, they'd let the project die.",

Investing in a bear market is very risky due to the lack of trading volume. Likewise with projects that are being planned, launching them during a bear market is actually very difficult as a new project to survive. This opportunity can be used to research more in the next trend.",

Personally, during the bear market, I try to regularly buy tokens/coins from carefully selected projects in which I see potential, averaging down the purchase price. Good research and portfolio diversification is very important. And the most important: do not invest more than you can lose.",

For example, if the roadmap shown is around 75%, then I don't think there's anything wrong with investing in the project. It is true that doing simple research sometimes even beginners never thinks that far. They just follow the hype on social media without doing any analysis.",

Sometimes a day of research will be a waste of time because most of what you will find are trash. i.e. Obvious scam attempts, just in for the money, bad project, repeated features from wayback ICO. The same with new NFT's that is being created. Most of them are already made and just a copy of another or if not, it's not that amusing and won't be able to get the target audience in this era. I wish this will be the reason for them to just buy Bitcoin instead if they cannot find that gem.",

It's best to just buy the old coins if you cannot decide or detect one that may have a future. It's high-risk today buying them unlike before. Out of 100, you might find 1 and that's a low percentage considering how many projects are out there now. Plus, the time and effort exerted if it fails will be a big stress to the health of an individual seeking the best.I have given up on those kinds of ideas.

When it comes to altcoins, its really hard to end up investing in the right projects as most of the new projects coming out these days have turned into scams. They may sound perfect and profitable in the first place because of how the developers team plan it but the question is can those projects be sustainable in the long run? Most of them are only good in the start but disappear in the long run. Better stick with bitcoin, that way you will never be in the wrong track.",

Invest in good development teams.Yes, it would be foolish to sell the coins you have in your portfolio and buy dramatically cheaper altcoins. Right now, it's only wise to buy with the OWN money you have. I'm sure most don't and many young investors are making the same stupid mistake. No, two stupid mistakes. First, they don't lock in profits, but continue to hold on out of greed while the price is at highs and realizing that the moment has passed, they sell in a panic at whatever price, and the bulk of the profit quickly melts away. And the second mistake, if they still do not sell and continue to hold at a loss and see some cheap project, they realize that they do not have free money and begin to release it by unprofitable sales. Using a strategy of moving money from crypto to crypto, they are unlikely to make any money in the long run. That's why I recommend everyone in bull markets to always stock up on fiat and stablecoins, so they have something to buy out a bearish bottom later.",

Very few high demand projects make big and we don't get chances to invest on such projects. Good choice is to invest on proven altcoins. For example choose few coins that have survived the bear market of 2017-2018 and reached good market progress.

I reckon that would be the safest if we consider the other worthy choices in the market, which only are DAI and USDT. Also, Circle the company behind USDC has been funded by Blackrock and Fidelity recently in a $400 million funding round. USDC also has enough liquidity in Curve to transfer to other stablecoins or wBTC, wETH.",
