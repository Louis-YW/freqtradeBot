  "content": "Seoul Stars is the next big shift in K-Pop targeting an audience of 2 billion K-Pop fans. This project could quite literally 1000x if every K-Pop fan invested just 50 cents.$SSTAR’s IDO presale will be on June 17. The initial circulating market cap will be ONLY 500K making this an IDO you don’t want to miss. $SSTAR will be on Solana to accompany their 5000 NFTs that sold out on Magic Eden and FTX in minutes.The project is fully doxxed and is co-founded by a world renowned K-Pop artist agency called HUMAP contents. This is the competitive edge as HUMAP can secure A++ collabs with famous K-Pop idols to drive mass demand for Seoul Stars NFTs and tokens.Your best bet to buy is to get whitelisted for their IDO presale by completing a couple tasks which are easy in comparison to what you’re getting. All the info you need is in the Seoul Stars discord https://discord.gg/MmsS85hTzH (joining actually helps get me whitelisted).Thank me later and as always DYOR.",
