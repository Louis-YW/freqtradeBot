Then the centralized ones no matter how reputable they are defeats the purpose of anonymity and privacy through collection of KYC details, with also the risk of losing your funds when they get compromised. Exactly! Additionally, the few exchanges that permit trading without KYC may offer less liquidity and inefficient trading features that a trader need, which is why most traders prefer reputed exchanges that require KYC before trading on them. While good and reputable centralized exchanges have good trading features, KYC requirements make them a no-go option for traders that cherish their privacy due to trust issues.QuoteThe best way to beat this when trading on centralized exchanges would be using two or more of the top exchanges. This way one will be able diversify there funds into many different exchanges and as such minimizes the risk of closing everything when a particular exchange get compromised. Can this be the possible solution?I just feel it may minimize the risk of losing your money at once because anything can happen with centralized exchanges at any time; therefore, I will prefer to buy and hold Bitcoin for the long term rather than risk my funds on CEX.",

Still, if the person who heard about huge gains in the crypto market can invest a lot of money in his/her stupidity in greed, No matter how much we will explain to him/her about the risks he won't understand except the 1% of the total. Hmm for future trade I am with your view as this is the most common view so it isn't your view haha just kidding. Bu here again a person who is dreaming to make million by single trade won't understand your friendly advice still I think Op should consider risk management.",

If a trader who is new can handle the losses financially from not trading on a demo account or not having enough patience to demo trade, then they can start trading normally and then handle the losses and struggle to beat the disappointment that comes with the failure of not having the patience to learn.

Because in order to get knowledge we have to get TA and FA knowledge and we have to remain unbaised from all types of news and fuds created in the market.Using demo accounts is best tip and i think newbies should also read other charts too, for example many people on Tradingview share their opinions and predictions with chart analysis and if a newbie started to understand it slowly. He will be able to find his own personal trading strategy one day. And could make huge profits. But, as i said before these tips looks easy but they are not each tip contains other sub category tips.

Rather start with small money unless yoj have enough knowledge and experience to tackle wild fire of crypto trading against your capital. Demo accounts is good to gain experience but you get real time experience only when you put your capital on the line. Start with small money once you are done with Demo account.",

Every newbie is a potential experienced trader if they go through the learning process, acquire knowledge and skill.No offence, mate, but read again. I said that someone (a newbie trader, perhaps) who is not knowledgeable about trading (who doesn't have the primary knowledge) would not be able to derive their own strategy. E.g; Someone who is going to the farm must go with a spade, shovel, or cutlass, so someone who wants to become a real trader would need to learn the primary knowledge about trading before they can develop their own trading strategy.There are some by-force traders who are dealing in copy trading or using bot signals; such traders don't have their own strategy.I agree with you on that. Sure, learning and practising makes perfect, and any newbie that is consistent in learning how to trade will definitely become successful at it, despite the fact that trading is not just what always earns traders profit all the time.",
