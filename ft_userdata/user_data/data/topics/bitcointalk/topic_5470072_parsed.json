Sometimes wetin i noticed dey always cause this problems na impatient and tolerance onto say we dey see our junior brodas them dey do well we go think say na yahoo dem go do without knowing e get some people wey their hustle legit and for that we no supposed envy at any cost without us knowing their source of income.Then lastly, i go talk say ritual don dey for long and pipo dey do am coded without the next ear hearing it how knowing what is going on but we go see person don lose and dem go begin dey find am we no go see the person for long, then this prick wey people dey steal me never still get the update although we know say nothing dey hidden and for that we too make we try apply cautiousness because anytime or any day e fit happened to anybody. Na wetin make e no too good make we walka for night especially those in ph, ABJ, Asaba and Owerri because those cities na hot cities wey be say if you lose guard you go collect.Nothing we no go see for this country and also know say we dey endtime, at this point you would see many things and many stories of what you can neva believe of happening so the best na to exercise patient make our God blessed us then we go enjoy an unending wealth and Riches. Bicus dis mata don tie rappa and we no supos dey look like that rather na to join hands take stops some things onto say when you see where things no good you play your sincerity and correct things that are not going well. We know say country hard but we ourselves can make things better than our government, to shock you na me and you be the government oo incase you dey think say e get special people wey be the government we only get people we are follow while they are the leaders.",

Like believing this narrative to start with, is a funny thoughts then talk more of it turning to a news.I no believe in the stuff from the beginning but due to how frequently different videos are shared over the internet, you are meant to believe in the scenarios and story as a whole. Scientifically, I don't think there's anything like stealing another person's manhood because I don't understand the chemistry put together to achieve that.But again, why me self no go believe am small, na because say na for Naija I dey. This is Nigeria and there's literally nothing that doesn't happen here in Nigeria. All sort of mind blowing incidents have happened hence my believe system has been shifted tomorrow believing the stories.
