Maybe because no one is going to look for casinos that already disappear.  The list of casinos that disappeared already is up for users to discover but there are several threads listing casinos with different categories like the most trusted or the list of casinos to avoid.

Thanks in advance for anyones help  You will find the updated sites, at least on most review gambling sites. But since most of them are for money-making or some sort of referral purpose, you might encounter gambling sites at some review sites that seem don't to have a good review here in the forum.I suggest referring to this review site that is managed by our own @efialtis;ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5262141.0Website: https://www.btcgosu.com/",

Thanks in advance for anyones help  Are you looking for a specific timeline on when the casino created & disappeared because there’s a lot of crypto casino disappeared for a span of 13 years. There’s no list for this since it’s very to collect it and there’s no demand for it. It will be easier if you can give as a timeline so that we can help you to collect it manually.Quote from: cabron on January 13, 2023, 04:04:38 PMThis one is updated AFAIK. The list to avoid.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5283832.0List to avoid means the casino is still exist or else there will no warning to avoid it. I believe he is looking on casino like Directbet.eu that already closed many years ago.",

I haven't found a comprehensive list yet, so I may have to make one myself. I am aware that there are a lot of fake crypto casinos out there and I want to make sure that the casinos that I am listing are legitimate and have a good reputation. I will keep an eye on this thread for any useful information.",

Thanks in advance for anyones help  A lost casino will never be on the list of trusted casinos, even if you get tired of searching the internet you won't find results either.If you want to find a list of trusted casinos for reference, you can choose the right casino, there are several lists you can visit.However, there is actually no need to bother looking for a list of these casinos because in this forum there is also a lot of information about the most trusted and most popular casinos, you can also see or learn from several member accounts of this forum promoting a crypto casino site.",

Thanks in advance for anyones help  In addition to the few lists posted above, there is this one dealing with the licenses and KYC requirements of several crypto casinos, from Mahdirakibhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381143and this one about bonuses offered by them  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405581Unfortunately I don't think a comprehensive one is existing as for now because I don't find some old and famous casinos like nitrobetting in those lists for example.",

It's worth mentioning that many new casinos are missing from my collection because I don't add them for the first couple of months after their introduction on this forum. I feel like it's necessary they establish some reputation first and create a history of paying players. My list also doesn't contain scam casinos that have received negative feedback from DT members for valid reasons. I have also removed some names from there because they scammed players on this forum irrespective of DT ratings. If OP is looking for newer gambling platforms that have gone live in the last 6-12 months, he won't find many of those in my thread because I haven't added new names to it for a long time.",
