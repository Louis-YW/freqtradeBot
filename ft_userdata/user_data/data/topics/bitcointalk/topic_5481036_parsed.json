You and your account are well now with conditions that you did not use leverage or futures in trading. Doing nothing can make things work normally compared to trying to enter amounts in a leveraged or futures trade. It's about who can survive, not about how to produce and it's more about the basics of not being provoked by existing deceptions.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on January 10, 2024, 02:06:43 AMWithin several minutes, SEC. and their hoax triggered both Long liquidation and Short liquidation in Bitcoin market.

That's why we are more comfortable holding compared to engaging in trading, because perhaps not everyone understands the pattern and overall it can be learned. This is the closest case that might be an illustration of how prices can change so quickly without starting a deeper correction and if someone moves based on slightly wrong knowledge then there is a break in losses by selling on the decline process.Though this need not be the case if one understands how the price fluctuation rate and the ESC give approval to a bitcoin ETF and everyone can say as a lie now and perhaps this is more of a ploy to stimulate some people. I don't care about that now because holding would be much more profitable and much safer.",

Definitely you are not a trader if you are just noticing this.I can say that holding is better than trading, but the volatility that you are talking about was not that much. Bitcoin did not fall more than $2300. It only dropped to $44700.Can you remember the volatility before that time that occur like a week or two weeks ago? Bitcoin decreased by $4500 to $4600 when it fall from $45700 to $40200. Also in the past, we have seen much volatility before several time.

      "body": "From the onset, holding has always been the conservative way of trading/investing, you do not leverage anything so the risk is minimal. This is unlike futures trading which could be traded on the leverage, thereby increasing the risk involved so as the potential gains. Future trading is not so bad either, it only depends on the plan of the trader towards it, and even without much trading experience, since we are in the bullish season of Bitcoin now, those who want to use the option of futures trading should plan it better. If you open a trade and your liquidation risk is reasonable, you will be good to go and a situation like the one we experienced yesterday will not affect you. The market itself is risky, so it is all about your good plan and also factors of safety.I can't imagine myself trading Bitcoin in futures and not having at least a $5000 liquidation gap. This is the mistake many people make, they are too careless about these liquidation plans due to greed of wanting to make more money. For instance, I can buy Bitcoin at $40,000 easily in futures trading and plan my liquidation price to be $35,000. If you are not even a good trader, such has been planned in such a way that the risk of liquidation is very little, and with a little trading experience, you can continue to make money more than as though you traded with spots trading. The main thing is for you to get the trend right. This is smartness to me.",

Also in futures, yes doing futures will give you a big reward or profit, if only you've done it right or your analysis is correct but also as they say, greatest reward cones with a big risk so if you don't know how to do futures better stay out of it or your money will be burn instantly. I once done this, trading with high leverage because I don't know what is it for and tries once futures and didn't go well so I learned in the hard way, That's why here I am more on holding coins especially bitcoin, I do trading sometimes if I'm very sure with my analysis and decision, while in futures I stay out of it for good.
