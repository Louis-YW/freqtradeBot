      "body": "6700XT @$300 seems like a good deal since the guy above has said 47Mhs with less than 100W (power on the wall will be higher since the PSU efficiency). But one more thing you should consider: nvidia cards usually have a higher hash for nearly the rest of PoW coins other than ETH. This is why some rather invest in nvidia cards like the 3060 (@$350-400 price range now) for better future-proof. Especially when The Merge for ETH PoS estimates at September of this year so most speculate that if ETH can't be mineable with PoW then other coins will have to take its place.",

What about buying 6700XT at 300$ The price is very good for both video cards. But there are about 2 months left until the end of mining. Read about the announcement date of the POS algorithm.How long will it take to deliver video cards and start mining?In 2 months it can be cheaper in your market.",

What about buying 6700XT at 300$ The 1660 can be considered an old generation compared to newer cards like the Rx 6700 Xt so that is a really great deal to get it at 300 dollars and I doubt it can go further down,for a card of 12 GB in memory can be considered a very good price as beside of mining this card performs really well also in gaming.This makes it to be the better card between the two as it has also better resale value to gamers if you want to sell it in the future.If I can call it a \"downside\" is that the AMD cards are better mostly on Ethash algorithm compared to Nvidia cards who can mine more algorithms.",

A large amount of memory allows you to mine 2 coins in dual mode.Perhaps AMD and Nvidia will want to increase sales of video cards and come up with a new coin that needs video cards with more than 8 GB of memory.",
