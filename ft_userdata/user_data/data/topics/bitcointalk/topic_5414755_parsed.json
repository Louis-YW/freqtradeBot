  "content": "I got an old MEW on cold storage. Probably 2-3 years old. I rarely do any ETH transactions. I just use the MyEtherWallet Offline helper and made transactions like that. All my transactions are Legacy transactions.Wondering if after the merge this will still work? Is it backwards compatible or will I have to update my MEW on cold storage?",

      "body": "The Merge does not change any underlying of how Ethereum transaction works, in the user senses. So, there is nothing to worry about, it will still work. The concern you raise is also addressed on the Ethereum misconception website, the Ethereum team explain it thoroughly:Quote from: https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#users-holdersUsers and holdersThe Merge did not change anything for holders/users.This bears repeating: As a user or holder of ETH or any other digital asset on Ethereum, as well as non-node-operating stakers, you do not need to do anything with your funds or wallet to account for The Merge. ETH is just ETH. There is no such thing as \"old ETH\"/\"new ETH\" or \"ETH1\"/\"ETH2\" and wallets work exactly the same after The Merge as they did before—people telling you otherwise are likely scammers.Despite swapping out proof-of-work, the entire history of Ethereum since genesis remained intact and unaltered by the transition to proof-of-stake. Any funds held in your wallet before The Merge are still accessible after The Merge. No action is required to upgrade on your part",

Can’t remember sending a erc20 transaction for less than $1 in fees.Its a great news for the token holders because they are paying insane fees for every token transaction for years and finally they can breathe and also erc projects will back into the action. But PoS is technically not secured as PoW and also the control power may concentrate on fewer hands which may become a negative side for the future of ETH.",

Can’t remember sending a erc20 transaction for less than $1 in fees.Yeah, fees are not so low, just like the pre-2017 bull run times. I personally stopped making transactions on ETH network a couple of years back, but I think I will start using the network again soon. Meanwhile, exchanges like Binance are still charging fees above $1 for Ethereum so that they can promote their shitty chains (BSC and BNB Beacon chain)",

Can’t remember sending a erc20 transaction for less than $1 in fees.I have also seen many people comment that ethereum gas fees have dropped significantly, although still not the cheapest. Although the developers also mentioned earlier that the merger will not reduce gas fees and we will have to wait for the sharding update in 2023 when gas fees are at their lowest.It is not clear if the reduction in gas fees is due to a merger or a bear market that causes transactions to decrease, so transaction fees will also decrease. But this is good news for ETH and will be bad news for ETH competitors.",
