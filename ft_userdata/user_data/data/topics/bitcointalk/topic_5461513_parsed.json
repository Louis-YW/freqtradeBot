Your argument is riddled with baseless claims and a lack of understanding of basic economic principles. First, Europe adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or stablecoins as the primary currencies is highly unlikely and unrealistic. The euro is a well-established currency and it has proven its resilience over the years. Furthermore, your claim that Binance, or any other private company, holds enough power to replace national currencies in Europe is complete nonsense. On what facts are you basing that?Quote from: Shortmaster on July 30, 2023, 06:48:05 PMYou see i know everything ~Only a complete fool can claim to know EVERYTHING!",

The European Union is not looking for an alternative to the euro, as there is no need for it. Moreover, they will not replace the euro with cryptocurrency or stablecoins. Difficulties sometimes arise with all the currencies of the world, but this phenomenon is temporary.Due to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine and the need to impose various economic sanctions against the aggressor, the costs of the EU countries have increased. However, this is a working moment and they are compensated by other introduced measures and mechanisms. Therefore, I see no reason to panic.",

They will always fight tooth and nail to keep that control. Which means they are not willing to accept a decentralized currency like bitcoin which they can never exert any form of control over its price, its network or to apply any form of censorship like they do in centralized fiat system.When it comes to cryptocurrencies (specifically altcoins) they are too useless, flawed and with a short life to be accepted by any government least of which Europe that needs that authoritarian rule over civilian's money.This is even more true when it comes to stablecoins that are centralized but in the control of a company that is usually not under a jurisdiction that they can control.QuoteBecouse euro can not survive any longer it's impossible and soon only legit currencies in Europe Will be btc eth or usdc usdt or busd becouse binance have enourmous power in Europe.LOLEurope's economy is facing a crisis for sure but it is not yet as big as the last one's like the one in the 70's and even when it grows to be just as big or even bigger, it still won't \"kill euro\", it will just weaken it.And the solution is not to use bitcoin or any of the shitcoins you listed here.QuoteI give euro about life time few months maximum time then it Will be replaced first with USDT Europe's economy is dumping but it won't be a few months.QuoteNOW you asking how it could be happening? What's the trigger? It's war off course ... But actually main reason is that euro don't have backer. It's not the war, the war is just he catalyst. The real reason is US milking Europe for all its worth so that US can survive.QuoteYou see i know everything with me you guys are smart Also i Will make my School and start teach the real knowledge about everything becouse there is barerly things what existing what i dont know.LOLYour whole comment sounds like someone who is bag-holding the shitcoins you listed here and are too shy to only list them as the replacement for euro so you also included bitcoin",

That doesn't mean USD is in bad position at the moment. I doubt Europe will come into such a situation wherein they have to be dependent in cryptocurrency.

It is the second largest in terms of reserve and the most traded currency next to USD. European countries were facing bad economic situation, just on that we can't be conclusive on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies getting adopted as the primary currency. The strength of currency is determined by the purchasing power and it is not than down as OP had compared with Zimbabwe currency.",

First, you have a baseless claim and seem to only post according to your personal perception and feelings regarding the Euro. Second, please do not expect a fruitful smart discussion by posting something like this without being backed up or citing credible sources as most of us will only find your post ridiculous, if this is an opinion on your end then it would have been better to revise your words and use proper terms to deliver your message or opinion more accurately as opposed to what your post is doing now, as if you are claiming that what you have stated is true and credible. In fact, to backed my own answer as to why I disagree with your baseless claim, that Euro is doing just fine here is an article by the European Central Bank: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/ire/html/ecb.ire202306~d334007ede.en.htmlIn this article it was stated that despite the effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the effects of inflation, the Euro remains the second most important currency in the international monetary system. Moreover, according to the same article the share of Euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased from 0.5% to 20.5%.

The dynamics fluctuate in accordance with the present and future realities, making it impossible to foresee the fiat currency's future at this time.Whilst it's true that cryptos are becoming more and more popular across the globe, especially in Europe, it's vital to keep in mind that adopting any currency includes a number of complex factors, including governmental policy decisions, economic stability, and public acceptability. It's interesting that you suggest war as a potential catalyst, but I think it's challenging to forecast how the currencies will evolve in the future.",
