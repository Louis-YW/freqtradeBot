A meme coin based on an IRL character who makes videos and interacts with celebrities. There is already a video with CZ from Binance and Jesse from Kraken. Check it out. I'll try to answer any questions here. Marketcap is 5 mil. IRL event 5/20/23 after BTC Miami.",

And also the title of this topic is misleading,  you may try to change it to portray the right message you are trying to pass.",
