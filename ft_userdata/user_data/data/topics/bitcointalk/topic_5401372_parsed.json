You cannot just burn tokens for the sake of it. If i may ask, which token was burnt. Is it the tokens from the total supply that was burnt? or tokens were bought back from the circulating supply to be burnt? There are more strategic ways to push up token price and this comes with building valuable products and value. Burning tokens from the total supply will make zero effect.Also, why are you shilling here ? lol",

The question is, will we see massive burning? of course not. $LUNC and $USTC are failed projects, the team from Luna itself will of course prioritize their V2 project. Don't expect too much from failed projects like $LUNC and $USTC.",

And specially with the way the market is moving right now, I seriously doubt that they can back from its glory days. I mean the investors lost a lot of money on them, and you can't fool this investors twice. In the first place, why do they go with this kind of strategy anyways, it's not the first time that we've seen coins even though billions have been burn, the tokens is still not worth to their projected price.",

But no one can guarantee the price to increase to $1. The price is purely determined by the market, so the price is difficult to predict. However, with the current price $0.017, it won't be easy to increase to $1. And USTC needs a bigger thing to make people more interested to buy it. Not only about burning, but USTC must also have another reason to value $1. The current situation seems not proper to support $1 as the value of USTC.",

They really need to back it up 1:1 to USDT and it's obvious that they don't have the capital right now and I doubt that they can recover what they've lost here.And on the contrary, I think it just makes things complicated, maybe they are using other models like like Evergrow Coin (https://evergrowegc.com/), but for Luna it might be different because they just came from a big disaster and again, this might not restore to it's peg of $1.00. And if it ever does, there could be more questions going to be raised as this might be some entities manipulating the price. So it's a lose-lose situation for them.",

I hope that if you shall not be so stupid to believe the burn will bring the price of USTC back to go up. This will never happen. The main thing is if you are watching it correctly and then you may need to understand how it works. 1. It's not backed by anything.2. The supply is still huge and that's why this become another shit token. 3. All of reserved funds to back this already drowned by the developers. No chance for this scam token to go up again.",

Obviously, there will be no such growth, everyone has switched to Terra 2.0. There is no point in pumping liquidity into an old project. If it were that simple, the developers would just burn a huge amount of coins to spur the project into insane growth. Why the whole Terra 2.0 campaign then?",
