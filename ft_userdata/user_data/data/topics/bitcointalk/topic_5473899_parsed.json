  "content": "I have been thinking about this for days but decided to talk about it after I saw a newbie who said who is already outside the matrix . Are we already outside the matrix because we're into cryptocurrency? No, we're so far if we're still using the Android phone Gboard and iPhone iOS keyboard.I always see people talking about living a privacy life while in real life they are still using Gboard or iOS keyboard and if you're not using it you're still not outside the matrix if you're using Android and iPhone even when not using the keyboard because this keyboard is closed source, and technically they sending your keystrokes to a centralized server.I don't know if you guys have heard about Apple's version 20-19 of iOS 13 bug which allows third-party keyboards to gain full access to the iPhone even if the user has mutilated it, Sogou keyboard breached, and iOS keyboard Swift Key data breach. What is the solution? For maximum privacy and security get Graphene OS or one of the open-source privacy-supported phones whose code is verified but you can also disable iPhone analytics on your iPhone (this reduces the amount of data tracked) and for Android phone users disable the Gboard federated learning in the Gboard privacy setting area.For more privacy and security now that Google Play store and Apple store are not doing a good job with their app verification and examing very well lately. I will advise you to check all the applications you have on your phone on the Exodus Privacy website to know which is a handful for your phone or collecting data.Note: You may use the best crypto mixing or tumbler websites for privacy reasons but your privacy still be compromised if you are sure about the data collected by the app you're using, your keyboard, and the website you visit.",

      "body": "You have created a good topic and we all should avoid the usage of third-party keyboards as they have millions of downloads. Sogou was a Chinese keyboard and it mainly affected the Chinese and Swift Keyboard is a product of Microsoft and they said they don't save our passwords or private information. They must not be thinking straight because obviously when they have to filter passwords and other credentials out they have to see them and once they saw them they are stored haha. Well, we are using a lot of Microsoft products, Apple products, applications on these products and all of them are storing our data.For example, Facebook, it is even listening to our voices, If you want to test then, speak about some product near your phone and it will automatically show you ads of those products, leave FB there are hundreds of applications we use daily without knowing how much data they store.And yeah, I agree with your words about the Apple app store and Google play store, the standards are not that great because people are coming around them, but we can't blame them we are totally in the matrix and we can't get out of it until we start using our own product, our own compiler, our own programming language, our own server, our own satellite, etc. etc. haha. Well, we are in the matrix but in my opinion, that's not what that OP's meant, he is financially outside the box, which means he is not depending on the banks anymore.",

Let us say, for example, that you have done everything necessary to hide your identity at the software level. You were using an open source keyboard or a “secure” operating system, but the main privacy vulnerability is in the hardware, where it can easily be opened. Many side doors spy on you, even if the operating system is open source, since this software may work at the kernel level and start working before the operating system starts working.It is true that open source solutions will make it difficult to easily track your privacy, but they are still the starting point.",

Until their shady data collection through the so-called 'bug' is detected by community and security experts, they simply said sorry and it is a bug, we will fix it. That statement does not make any sense if their users already lost personal data, privacy because of whatever the bug is.QuoteFor more privacy and security now that Google Play store and Apple store are not doing a good job with their app verification and examing very well lately.

We all are in the matrix but we can achieve some level of privacy if we start to avoid third-party platforms like these keyboards you have mentioned all of them were third party. I was not expecting Apple to use someone else's keyboard I am not an Apple user instead I use Gboard which works fine for me.We should not trust third parties like to trust on the website you have provided, because we don't know what matrices and what company and what loopholes they have and they follow. We have to be our own savior we have to look out for red flags as we search in our GFs   Technically speaking we can never escape the matrix until we start using our own mind, until we trust our methods, until we take the responsibilities that we have to take, we can't escape the matrix like in the matrix movie we have to choose a way either by eating blue or red pill.",

You want to stay off the grid, then shut off the your internet. It’s not so easy when you look at it this way, big tech companies have made their products a essential part of society that people cannot do without it even if they know it may cost them. For example, Twitter X is now regarded as a centre of information, people trust tweets by random users than what they see on 7’o clock tv news. In today’s world, how many do you think can boycott a social media platform because of censorship and privacy concerns? People really don’t care.",

I'm just asking for a link sir if you made that thread, some people are already aware like you, is the damage theft, manipulation of hardware with control or what?There are some people who argue about the opposite, a privacy between experts and enthusiasts, if people can survive with their security I'm sure they don't think more, just regular habits and care about themselves, your answer is interesting sir.I once wondered if the database that people share, whether in forums, digital media, social media, blogs, websites etc., then accommodated is made into a 3rd party source, chat AI for example?",
