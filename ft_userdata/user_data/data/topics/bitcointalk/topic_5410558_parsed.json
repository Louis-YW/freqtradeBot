They have performed very well in the last tournaments they have competed in.  I also like to see how Reso is blending in with his new team, Team Secret. They have outrageous plays when he stand-in on Riyadh Masters. I want to see if they continue to perform well. This is a good opportunity for them to refine their strategies before TI 11 qualifiers.What team do you think will win it all?",

They have performed very well in the last tournaments they have competed in.  I agree with you, OG looked really strong in the last few tournaments. Getting 4th place in the Arlington Major was a good performance, and their loss for 3rd place against Team Aster was very close. The final might between the two teams again in Malaysia and at the moment it feels like a coin toss. Before placing any bets on who wins the tournament I would wait for the first few games to see who performance better. As for Team Secret I am not so convinced if they will pull through, I am rather rooting for Nigma Galaxy.  Looking at the groups I think that OG will be first in Group B and Nigma Galaxy second, in Group A it will be Team Aster first and Team Secret second.",

Yup, it will be a long group stage but these times will also be a good time to bet. Maybe after a day or the opening day of this tournament would be the best time or by the playoffs to bet.",

The play style is very different from Europe teams. They will be having a harder time adjusting to each others game play. If it is another player from EU, it could have been easier. And they have very little time to adjust too. This is very tough for team Nigma but hopefully they can still perform at top level even with these challenges and handicap.",

Looks like NGX didn't have enough time to choose for their carry because they resorted to someone who is already in SEA and is a viable option. Hopefully though Dreamocel won't be too much of a burden for Gh who always looks for open opportunities to get kills on the safe lane. Dreamocel is a conservative carry, and that may be a problem for NGX who is always wanting to get active on the map.",

I only take handicap match because I am not yet sure how the teams are performing in this tournament.What a game 2 between FNATIC and BOOM Esports. FNATIC was with a large lead but slowly BOOM was able to come back. When PL got farmed, FNATIC was not able to do anything about him. Even with a large lead, FNATIC was not able to win a team fight. So, FNATIC did the unthinkable, they avoided the fight and went straight to the throne and won. What a game.I thought this match will easily go to Boom since they are fresh from their win in Gamers Galaxy but FNATIC was able to pull one from them getting 2-0.",

So far, he is showing good performance against liquid and TSM. Nigma is still lucky to get a good pos1 in absence of Miracle. I am not familiar with Dreamocel but he needs to have a deeper pool of heroes as the tournament moves forward. So, far he has just used Druid and Void successfully. He used Bristle but lose in game 1 vs Liquid.Quote from: sunsilk on August 23, 2022, 05:08:37 PM4 teams will be out and the playoffs comes in.Yes, the bottom 2 of each bracket is out of the tournament.

Alliance, Talon, and Thunder Awaken got swept so  I think these three are just fighting for the 4th spot to continue in the tournament.

I thought FNATIC was able to pull it off in Game 2 when they are giving OG a hard time in the laning phase but sand king and arc warden switched lanes and the favor went back to them.
