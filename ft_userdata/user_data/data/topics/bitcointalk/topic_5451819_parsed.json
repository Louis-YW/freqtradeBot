  "content": "To recover passwords for other accounts, such as your social media account or bank account, you will likely be able to reset these online, or at least contact customer support to resolve the issue. This is not the case with crypto wallets.MetaMask, for example, is one of the most prominent online crypto wallets. It does not store your password, nor can it decrypt or reset it.The first step in attempting to find your crypto wallet password is to enter every possible password combination. This may seem obvious, but in many cases, trying different combinations - whether that's with capitalization or spelling mistakes - may lead you to the correct password.If this not help the second option is use letter combination suggestion tool, although it will requirefast CPU with multiple cores to be able find password in reasonable amount of time.Used this technique before and confirm it possible to recover 8 symbol and more password with some luck.I charge 2% from wallet balance although fixed fee possible. Supported wallet type any crypto wallet with symbol password.",

      "body": "The influence of passwords in such a crypto wallet can be non-existent if you have basically backed up the wallet security master, it's a mnemonic phrase and a privatekey.Maybe you should give a better example where a password is actually required to access the wallet. For example, one of the MEW wallet backup methods uses a password to decrypt the privkey in the json file.",

Can you clarify what are you trying to offer?",
