  "content": "Hello dear community! I'd like to briefly introduce myself. My name is Dave and I have been actively involved with cryptocurrencies for about 1.5 years. So I'm still a newbie  That's why I'm happy about any learning that can be given to me!I recently came across the REAL-TOK project (https://real-tok.io/en). In my opinion, it looks very promising if the team keeps all its promises.Since I personally also have a certain affinity for real estate - they would have won me over as an investor. It also seems that the token will be tradable from December. What does the community here think of the project?I would be very happy to hear your answers!",

      "body": "In the past many years, there had been similar projects - involved with real estate industry - unfortunately most of them are now six feet under the ground and those who are still alive are already lifeless and may not have a bright future ahead. Now, I am advising that project to get involved with real estate via tokenization of real world assets (RWA) because here you are adding real value and there is that proven revenue model at placed. Let's stop supporting and promoting \"dreamy\" projects which are just good in words but not in the real world.",
