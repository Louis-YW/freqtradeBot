With that being said, take your time to go through pinned messages both in Beginner & Help to learn dos and don'ts and Meta section and generally don't rush anywhere. Let all the info sink and when/if in doubt, simply ask and someone will answer.",

      "body": "The Bitcointalk forum will seem complicated to newcomers, we also felt the same way when we first encountered the forum. I can only advise you to continue to exist here, never get tired of reading, by reading you will gain more knowledge here.Education from Seniors can also give you knowledge, Seniors never tire of answering questions from you and then explaining at length without expecting anything from you. Respect for each other is also very important, especially seniors who have knowledge about forums because you don't necessarily get guidance outside the forum with detailed explanations from A to Z. And the most important thing is patience, with patience you will be able to develop more and be able to achieve anything what do you want.",

Please help out guys So what is the best place to start learning in the forum This is always the case of all newbie or beginner but dont get scared. Its normal to be confuse on what to do and what to say.First welcome in the forum. For your own benefit, try to read the links attached by others which will help you in journey here. Dont worry, you might get used to this when your pace started to move step by step. Start by reading rules, familiarizing it and then set up on how to post properly. Some are self taught by the way, and the only things you learn a lot here are everything related to bitcoin and blockchain concepts.

      "body": "If we talk about how people get to this or that place, then surely everyone has a reason. If you become interested in bitcoin and you register on this forum, you have already done quite a lot.Then do what most people do when they arrive in a strange place. You just need to look around. Start reading; do not rush to create topics with questions. Most likely, if you use the search, you can find everything yourself. Do not show yourself as a person who must always be led by the hand. The one who has a zeal for knowledge and who considers himself an adult and not a helpless child always achieves more.",

Just in case you don't know what a pinned post or thread is, they're mostly at the top of the threads that you see upon clicking the section like here in Beginners and Help. You don't have to rush, just do it one step at a time and soon, it won't be confusing anymore to you.",
