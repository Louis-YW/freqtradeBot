If there's a way to leverage SegWit with 0.96.5 then I'd like to direct him to do so.0.96.5 can: - generate and pay to P2SH-P2WPKH addresses (nested segwit).- pay to bech32 addresses (native segwit).Your client cannot choose what address type he pays to. The recipient generates the address, and therefor the recipient has control over the type, not the payer. It is the payer who covers the network fees however.If your client has to pay people and wants to cut on network fees, he has to ask the recipients to provide a bech32 or a P2SH-P2WPKH address instead of a legacy P2PKH. If you client is receiving payments, he can use Armory to generate P2SH-P2WPKH addresses to reduce the fees his counterparties have to pay.",
