  "content": "I think it should simply be someone who is not qualified to be in a country/society mainly due to the possibility of that person becoming a problem to the country or society. There should checkpoints for migrants but things like high cost of obtaining a clearance for migration, unnecessary requirements to qualify for a clearance, etc should never limit people from migrating to wherever they want even if they migrate through natural paths. It is not a fair or reasonable method.By the way, humans tend to admire migratory birds and other animals that tend to migrate long distances, through natural paths but we frown at fellow humans who do thesame, why?There should be legal checkpoints to screen migrants from any direction and to filter out those who will be problems rather than solutions to the countries they are migrating to",

      "body": "The only thing that makes anybody an illegal alien in the US is, when he doesn't properly defend against the accusation that he is an illegal alien.Stand as a man/woman in court, unrepresented by anyone, even yourself, and maintain the continual question for the judge, prosecutor, and anyone else accusing, \"I, man/woman, 'named', require that you show me the harm or damage you think I did to you, and prove that I was the one who did it, with at least one other witness besides yourself.\"They can't answer this point, except if the man/woman did damage or harm to the judge, prosecutor, accuser... that can be shown and proven.If that is your stance throughout court, no matter who you are, you win, except if you did harm or damage that they can show and prove. Why? Because once you are in, you are in. You are no longer an illegal alien. US and State law apply to you. If they catch you right on the border, and don't immediately repel you back into whatever country you were crossing the border from, but rather drag you into their holding pen, you are in. You might be termed an illegal alien. But as long as you maintain that you are a man/woman only, unrepresented, and requiring that they show what harm or damage you did, you are in.If the judge or prosecutor ignore your stance, you have the right and duty to file a court case against them requiring an answer to your question of harm or damage, and to sue them if they hinder your right to travel that is protected by the 1st Amendment, when harm or damage isn't shown.",

Only the laws and regulations governing the status of a foreigner keep people from disadvantaged countries from mass migrating to countries with a high level of living. And a huge influx of population will reduce it very quickly. So first of all, the status of an illegal immigrant and the consequences that it entails are the protection of the country's population.",

      "body": "They are men and women. They are only illegal aliens during the short time it takes them to cross the actual border line. Once they are in, they are men and women - like they were before they started crossing - and should be treated that way. There are only two ways in this common law based United States to turn people into illegal aliens once they are in:1. Convince them that they are so that they admit it;2. Break the law yourself, and illegally pronounce them illegal aliens... if you have the authority and can get away with it.The best way is an effective border wall, but it has to be built precisely at the border, on your side. Or you need to make an agreement with the country on the other side of the border, that you can build the wall partly on their side of the border.====================You don't have a civil court case against anyone until you have these 4 things:Quote from: http://voidjudgments.com/fdcpa.htmA civil suit is a table with four legs: two opposing parties (2 legs), Subject Matter Jurisdiction (1 leg), and a Competent Fact Witness (1 leg). If any one of the Legs is missing, the pleading fails to make the prima facie case. It may surprise you that there is almost always one leg missing; more often it’s two legs missing. What is also amazing is that Attorney’s have been doing this for so long, they think it’s legal.",

Once he is inside the US, he is a man or woman just like anybody else. It doesn't matter who in government assumes that he is an illegal alien. If he responds to accusations properly, or forms his own proper paperwork if they don't accuse but only act, he can win... especially if he has legal help.Of course, if he harms somebody or damages property, he can expect punishment just the same as anyone else.",
