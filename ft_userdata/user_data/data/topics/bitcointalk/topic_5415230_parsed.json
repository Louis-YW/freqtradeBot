After that just find \"Services\" on the list.After all, you are looking for someone to provide you with a service.Be advised though, that you are required to pay your partners in Bitcoin for the thread to be in the Services board. If that's not the case, the thread needs to go to the Altcoin board.But you never mentioned in the OP if your future assistant will earn something from helping you?",

I think you misunderstood. I didn't say you should publish a list of channels or any other type of lists. I suggested how you can find an assistant to help you with your project. That's what you are trying to do. The services board is the place to post various gigs, and if someone is interested in what you are offering, they can apply and contact you to become part of the project.",

How do you see through the fake followers and scam groups? I see many such groups posting nonsense memes with absolutely no useful substance with a few thousand views while having many hundred thousand followers. The math does not seem to add up on those groups.Perhaps if you used a method of prediction correlation from all those groups, you might develop your own system of forecasting?",
