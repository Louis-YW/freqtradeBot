Anyways welcome to the bitcointalk platform. Be rest assured that your complaint would be looked into and do not pannic as I believe their representative would respond to you. It is very disappointing when yo out find out that you have been banned, blocked or suspended from a platform for which you have been a member for a long time being. It is very bad that they failed to put this in cognizance while looking into your complaint and observation. Even if the errors are from them, there is always a way to solve a problem without taking such drastic measures on you. It is so so dissatisfying to hear and see such happen. They failed to know that the customer care service is the major pillar of every organization and if they fail to put up to standard and start neglecting their customers, there is every possibility that the customer may leave their services and not only that if the customer has more followership, they would all leave as well which means a loss to the organization.I think it is high time casinos customer care service be looked into as most of the complaint coming in do not portray them in good fate.",

You have done way more than any average player to collect data on the problem, so they should actually be grateful that you did most of the leg work to show the problem. I also think you should fire up a thread on the Stake community forum about this and hope that it is not deleted by the mods there. (Some of them can be difficult, if you give some attitude or negativity in your posts) Hopefully this will get picked up by someone with the correct knowledge to assist you, but I do not know if the support guys actually have contact with the developer of the Sport book or the bookmakers.¬† Good Luck...

Since it basically doubles for every level it should be around 100000$ for diamond 4 actually. Platinum 4 gave me 1600$, you can calculate up from there.Where my doubts are, wager requirement for diamond 4 are $250,000,000 . So unless he has 99.99$ of the next level (where he still has to wager 15000$ to get these 0.01%) I have serious doubt he can do any meaningful wagering with a small loan like yours.",
