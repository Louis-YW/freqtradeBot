Great job, OP!Maybe you can add on how frequently a \"moon\" happens on the websites supported by your site. With that, I would decide where I would play crash games.  Based on your screenshot, it's good to play in Roobet, and thankfully I do, lol. Hoping for that moon.",

Looking forward to see other site that offers crash game, this is a good game actually and one of my favorite to play in stake.

      "body": "It's a nice website to monitor real-time crash game results on many casinos.At the left and right side, you have casino names and their brand logos. I noticed that you did not have it in the middle for tabs in the Filter Websites area. I would like to see brand logo of each casino attached on each tab.Reasons for my suggestionNot all people are familiar and remember about each casino brand logo. Therefore if you don't attach it in Filter Websites tab, it's hard for people to differentiate crash game results on the left and right columns belong to what casino.Attaching brand logo for each casino tab will help better differentiation for website visitors.Bug?Click on each casino tab in Filter Website, at the Top 20 Moons, results are not filtered for that specific casino.In contrast, at the left side, results are filtered only for that chosen casino.Is it a bug for Top 20 Moons?",

I don't know if it's only me but I currently can't choose what time frame do I want to view from all of the listed casino. I also wish to have the bar chart enlarged, I have a small to average monitor and it's pretty difficult for me to see all of the casino current crashes. Overall I like the whole design and the idea of it, This is certainly helpful for crash game lovers! I'm pretty sure you will add other crash game providers such as bustabit which is the first and current crash game provider that I'm using.",

I have also said this in other threads on this forum.Hopefully in the future more and more gamblers will realize that self-control and financial control in gambling are very important.",

Mostly x1000 doesn't come that often, and x10k or more comes maybe once a day... with the help of these statistics, we can see how long it has been since the last big crash, in case it has been a long time, we start chasing some higher payouts. I like the idea, but the site could be much better arranged. It's a bit slow for me (I am not sure cause of me or your site), but I will bookmark it. I like to chase high payouts from time to time, and this site looks like a perfect start... before playing I would like to know the highest crashes in the last hours.Good luck Stakefast.

But as a newly-launched crash stat site, this is nice. For sure, some crash players will get motivated to play if they see the top 20 moons on the other side.But lets admit that when such thousands multiplier comes, usually we already cash even before that like at least getting the 100x payout.I usually play this in manual mode so I can skip some rounds that I feel I will crash very early. You can already see that when you start getting the 50x, the frequency is getting low, almost flat like in the range of 1-5x.",
