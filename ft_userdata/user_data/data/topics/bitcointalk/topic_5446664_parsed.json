Those who bought early have their advantages since they could sell at any time due to multiplier and those who sold late arent gonna sell it and instead holding to break the price of their negative asset.

Before I begin investing in bitcoin many predicting and people said its easy buy on lower price then sell later after price pump. But in the reality I faced many complicated problem from coins drop drastically after investing although have entry on lower price and another dip price coming later. Actually to consistent with profit have been patience and spent several kinds price order buy not all in for the same price. You need spent fund each 30% for getting difference buy order how to manage later if price drop drastically.",

This type of scenario can be seen in two or three times in year and its not good for those traders who want daily earning. i think the better strategy is to buy some specific coins in every dip because if you wait long for bug dip , may be you miss ship and And you didn't get a chance to buy low Trading is more beneficial than holding. suppose you buy one coin when there extreme fear in market. this tokens can give you 2x in two months but at the same time if you buy low and sell high multiple times then you will make 4x in two months because we know that any token doesn't rises straight but reached high price after creating multiple up and down charts.",

So, the timings of different traders, buyers and sellers, always differ but eventually, they are reach their desired destinations, some with higher profits and some with less.Timing the market is definitely not easy, at the times of panic, one may go for buying more looking at the price dropping, but you never know, the price can drop even more. So, there's never really an exact bottom to buy nor there is an exact top to sell. It all depends on what you aim for as a trader.",

This could be seen as unethical but thats basically what memecoins are.If you have an innovative coin with an innovative blockchain then thats a different thing.And if you have a business model pumping profits into the coin then thats where the profits come from. And if that coin is combined with an innovative technology then thats a solid altcoin which could very well be worth investing in.But a lot of altcoins lack innovation and just copy the original top coins.",

However, if we are talking about bitcoin trading, and if you buy at the top, then all you gotta do is buy more and DCA your way out of it.
