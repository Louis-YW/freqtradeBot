  "content": "Binance has recently halted the trading for NEBL tokens and they have also delisted them from their exchange.However, when we try to withdraw them to the bitget Exchange, we are unable to do it because it says that BNB Smart Chain (Bep 20) and ERC 20 networks are suspended.Binance Will Delist QLC, NEBL and AUTO on 2023-04-18Now how can one move the NEBL out of the Binance?The last date to withdraw them is 2023-07-18 but how can we withdraw them when the withdrawal is disabled???",

About suspending withdrawal, NEBL has its own chain, you can withdraw your tokens to the chain but not to Binance and Ethereum chain, this is not the first time Binance is implementing something like this, it has done it for other tokens before.",

Since it's still 3 months away, I doubt it that they'll never enable that. Neblio's fee isn't that much so I think that Binance is also forcing you guys to withdraw through its own network. But then, if you'll ask the support it will just answer you with uncertain period of time until it reopens the withdrawal on the other two networks.",

Haven’t heard this project before but getting delisted from a top exchange is something that is not good, better to sell now.",

Finally it is a sign of relief.Now my action plan would be to transfer my NEBL from Binance to MEXC through NEBL Network and then move my NBEL from MEXC to Bidget through BSC network and keep them there for long term until the next bull cycle.The reason i cant sell my NEBL token is that I am in 75% loss from my purchasing price, so I hope the price of NEBL will recover and give me a chance to sell in break even  The price of NEBL is now 0.11$ and my buying price is 0.15$.  Do you think NEBL will reach again to this price ?",

Actually, this has happened to me years before and the problem occurred when we cannot withdraw not just a single coin but the entire crypto assets we had on that exchange and we wait for nearly about 2 months until they finally allowed us to freely withdraw. That's why it's really recommended to have your own wallet when you decide to hold huge amount of cryptocurrencies in order to have the full control by yourself.",
