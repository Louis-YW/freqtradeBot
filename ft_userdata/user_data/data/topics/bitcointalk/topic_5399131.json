I don't see Bitcoin at all. So where's the Bitcoin use case there? (because if it's missing, then this may suit altcoin discussion)* The use of SEC acronym can be greatly misleading.Some things are not well explained, some others may be overly explained and made me skip parts. It does have the potential to work, but with modifications and only if you get actual data consumers ask for specific data they need (and actually pay for it), i.e. by request. Unless you do that, you'll end up with a huge pile of useless data. You also either avoided, or missed the part of data storage. The huge amount of data will have to be stored somewhere and it's unclear who will store that data and who will pay for that storage (I hope that you don't expect the data be stored on the blockchain). And the storage may have to be on a reliable high availability servers (i.e. expensive).",

      "body": "Thank you for you feedback. I really appreciate your comments.The smart contract described here is just intended to launch the project, and not for the actual project use case.The project may rely on multiple blockchains, Bitcoin will of course be an important integral part.The data usage usecases will be evaluated. Data will also be aggragated in the mining process. Data will have a limited retention time, based on a usage score. Important Data (based on usage score) will be stored also on professional storage founded by the liquidity pools . In general data will be stored on P2P distributed storage. This was a first draft and I will elaborate further.Thank you again for your comments.",

      "body": "Thank you for your feedback.Bitcoin iself will be used in the Liquidity Pools and for data transactions (data encryption key exchange).Data mining will be similar to the concept of bitcoin, a decentralized network of nodes, but instead of performing PoW, the nodes will perform data validation and aggregation. The quality of data will be an important driver.This was just a first draft and I'll describe the whole process in more detail soon. I belive that data will become more and more important in future.Would be great if you can help me for the shitcoin:) This will help me to start.Thanks again for your comments",
