  "content": "This is a scammer app. Please avoid it if the app is still working in your country but in my country the trading platform has collapsed. When the instructor came to our city to make advertisement for the trading platform, many of us key into the trading and learned itÂ  and the instructor told us that the best way for us to register with him with sum of $75 which most of us did and really the trading was going well. Every day he, the instructor would tell us the signal to trade. That is when to open the trade and when to close the trade. So every week those of us that were trading were making small change from the trading for about two months. Suddenly, the instructor refused to gave us signal again and before we know the trading app and platform is not working again. Everything stopped function, the instructor numbers stopped going through, all his contacts were malfunctioning. And we were asked to pay extra $20 for the next level of the trading and that was how he scammed us and go away with our money. So if this is still working in you country. Stay Away from them. They are scammers.https://www.nigeriabitcoincommunity.com/delhi-blue-review/. As it is the app is no where to be found in the Google play store, but before we downloaded it from the play store but it has disappeared.",
