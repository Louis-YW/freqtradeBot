  "content": "Hey fellow Satoshi followers,I've been reflecting on Bitcoin's journey and despite our dreams, mass adoption hasn't happened (yet), and I'd love to get your feedback on this matter. Here's what I've observed, using El Salvador as an example, but I might be missing something, so I'd love some feedback.1. Complexity Bitcoin is complex; I think most of us will agree on that. Complexity has been reduced with new standards and protocols, a magical threshold of simplicity is unlikely without trusting a third party. 2. Advantage-seeking players - Are They Holding Us Back?Some players might seem like they're supporting Bitcoin but might actually be slowing things down. Thay act as Bitcoiners but they don't have incentives for other players to come. Example: If I am a salvadorean that make money by recieving and offering service in BTC to tourist, should I keep the business to me or do I share my good luck to others?  I'm not blaming them; they have the right to act that way. But should we, as a community, try to promote more others new and small player to join the party?3. What's Going on in El Salvador?Having spoken to many people, and from my intuition:Bitcoin Circles: There's this illusion of adoption, but it's often confined to small circles. Bitcoin tourist being guide with same people who take them to the same places. There is no incentive for this local community to open.Merchant Compliance: Many merchants don't accept Bitcoin mainly out of ignorance or lack of economic incentive. They are not feeling the lost and the presure (yet)People use Dolar instead of Pesos, Bolivares or Lebanese Pound. That's why people can't value the big present they've been given (Obviously any goberment with a currency they can manipulate would't be so willing to make Bitcoin legal tender)4. What Can We All Do?Incentivize Adoption in El Salvador and other local places: If a place doesn't accept Bitcoin, walk away and do not touch your FIAT. If you dealt with an employee , make sure the owner finally knows about the loose. Tourist are not numerous enought to put a pressure here, let's onboard salvadoreans in this. Educate and Engage: Let's  step out of the comfort zone and educate, give, and promote the entry of new local actors.Circular economy: It's great to embrace the HODL philosophy, but I believe a portion of our BTC should be used exclusively for consumption. Again, economic incentives drive adoption.I know these are obvious points, and there's no magical solution, but it seems to be forgotten, and an attitude of \"they will come when they have no other choice\" or \"just HODL and wait\" prevails. This is not true. The future is not set in stone, and the collective result of all our individual actions will significantly determine Bitcoin's fate. If Bitcoin dies, we will lose the greatest hope for change we've had in centuries.If you think Bitcoin is perfect, immortal, inevitable, etc., and that you can just HODL and wait, it's respectable that you do so, but it's not a thought that benefits the system, and I don't believe it should be reinforced or applauded.Any thoughts?

Maybe now most people keep bitcoin as an asset and expect to profit from the increase in bitcoin prices. But on the way, when many people already have bitcoin then using bitcoin will be the next step. Mass adoption will occur. I think it's still in the introduction stage of bitcoin, there are still many people who don't understand about bitcoin. When the introduction phase is complete, the next phase is transactions using bitcoins, and the final phase is the mass adoption of bitcoins.I think when the Fiat ecosystem was introduced, many people rejected and did not believe in fiat. You can imagine, gold was replaced with paper, it looks like nonsense. But after a long journey, everyone now believes in fiat and it has been adopted en masse. It's the same with bitcoin, fiat is paper that can be seen and touched whereas bitcoin is digital money that can only be seen on digital devices, that sounds like crap too. So just wait for bitcoin to become a new financial ecosystem, and bitcoin needs \"time\" to get there",

Hmm, I like some of the policies of El Salvador but at the same time, I think some of their policies are extreme whereas others can do better by learning from El Salvador. Also, I'm not sure about which type of players you are talking about and monopolies of what kind. For the sake of new players joining the party, I think most the people are aware of it they are waiting for something and I don't know what that thing is and for the wrong narrative against Bitcoin is actually in the favour of Bitcoin as it can be considered as free marketing by the central players like media and institutes (Governments).",

      "body": "I really liked your points about why BTC is not being adopted on a mass level even in the country (El Salvador) where it is made a legal tender. The thing is I read some articles and the main point there government used to accept BTC as a legal tender as they were already on the verge of chaos in Financial status, and many local hesitate to send money from abroad due to high taxes and fees. So, in some articles I read the president or PM said that, one of the reasons is easy and cost-effective transactions.But still, many merchants like you aforementioned, hesitate because the fee is more than the overall cost of the product. The thing is, El Salvador is just facing the worst crisis but it will turn into big profits and the economy of El Salvador will be stable again when the Price of BTC will reach $100k.Another big reason is, BTC can not process millions of Transactions in shorter period of time. Let's say even if the whole people of El Salvador started to make transaction on BTC blockchain then the transaction will be so much in a day that BTC blockchain will take more than 10 days to process all of them. I talked on this issue like 2 to 5 times. But, the thing is mass adoption is only possible when the BTC could process transaction more fast than now.",

Complexity has been reduced with new standards and protocols, a magical threshold of simplicity is unlikely without trusting a third party.  Bitcoin isn't inherently complex, in fact it's so easy to use and setup even as a beginner in the industry. What's complicated though is the cryptocurrency industry and it only gets more difficult the more you invest your time and effort into it. Contrary to what the bitcoin maximalists wish, bitcoin is not the endgame for crypto, it's the gateway to the industry and this is what paints the illusion of bitcoin being a complex subject.

I'm not blaming them; they have the right to act that way. But should we, as a community, try to promote more others new and small player to join the party? I don't think the problem's with the adopters. The problem is with the people itself. A number of us here are content with how the industry works, cyclical and all that, and sometimes people even gatekeep this industry for some reason, not to mention large companies taking huge amounts of bitcoins for themselves and holding it without returning into the circulation, which inflates the price of bitcoin but at the same time discourages newbies who wish to invest on bitcoin.

It was a drastic process that blindsided a lot of people and now they hate bitcoin in there, which drives the notion that good things come slow. In that regard we still got a long way before bitcoin becomes truly for the people, so perhaps pushing for adoption now wouldn't be the best idea. [/list]",

Is it Because Nayib Bukele said on Twitter that El Salvador will be buying BTC's regularly, even if what he said is true and they have been buying BTC frequently, it does not mean their economy will be stable because there was a pump in the price of BTC, things don't work that way in economics.Quote from: Faisal2202 on August 04, 2023, 05:28:22 PMLet's say even if the whole people of El Salvador started to make transaction on BTC blockchain then the transaction will be so much in a day that BTC blockchain will take more than 10 days to process all of them.

People don't just start making transactions, they are either making payments, sending funds to people or liquidating BTC to fiat, this is exactly how people use fiat, their bank's mobile app or any other payment option. I agree that BTC transactions are not instant, but miners don't care who is making the tx's or from where, what matters is the fee attached to it and with a fee of high or medium priority, your tx will be confirmed fast, though if the mempool is congested, the fee for high priority will increase.",

Is the system heading towards the utopia that this logic suggests if we don't correct and influence some behaviors that do not favor that outcome? The ones who are highly motivated to react and influence are the advantage-seeking actors. In the FIAT world, it's evident; in the altcoin world, it's also very evident in most cases, but in Bitcoin, it's more subtle because they camouflage themselves within the philosophy of Bitcoin.Quote from: piercekieran99 on August 04, 2023, 05:32:48 PMYou raise a valid concern here.

We should always look at the incentives of the actors involved. It's often more reliable to observe where their incentives lie rather than what they defend in words. I don't believe there is ill will or a conscious effort to harm Bitcoin in the majority of these individuals. Sometimes, it could be mere self-deception. I think some people (contents creators for instance) take on the role of a believer who positions themselves to \"judge\" and announce divine punishments for the others, I don't think is beneficial for the system, but for them to engage more followers.",
