You earn good from your salary job. Set out like 10% to 20% of your salary to upgrade your trading skills so that you can make profits on the long run.Quote from: JULIA2023 on October 15, 2023, 06:08:27 AM1: invest in one coin also multiple coinIt doesn't matter if you are investing on one coin or multiple coins, invest only on the coins you understand its movement.Quote from: JULIA2023 on October 15, 2023, 06:08:27 AM2: trading was at spot also futuresIt will be nice if you avoid futures.

Unfortunately, that's true. Especially for newcomers to the market, it sounds so simple: you buy an asset (e.g. BTC) and simply wait until it is worth more than the price at which you bought it. In reality, you panic and try to save what can be saved as soon as the trade turns negative and you incur losses. Often these rescue attempts lead to the fact that you spend much more money than you actually intended and in the end, like the OP, you are left with a high loss. Even successful traders are 49% wrong with their trades ... however, 51% of their trades are successful. Exactly this difference then decides about profit and loss of the trades. A few hints for you OP:Trade only in markets you know. Analyze the market as good as you can and take advantage of news and trends (e.g. it was already known in advance that the SEC will not raise an objection because of Grayscale. The market turned significantly positive with the release of the news).Stick to your plan: Set limits and stick to them (both stop-loss and take-profit).and very important: don't follow signals or \"successful\" traders, you will definitely only lose money. Being successful as a trader involves having a lot of experience. All of us had to pay a (often high) price to gain this experience.",

Build your investment plan better. Always let your goal be to increase the amount of Bitcoin and dollars you have. Invest wisely and do not let greed chase you. Invest in the decision to buy more than to sell, meaning that you buy when the price is low, provided that you know that it will return to a normal level, and from there you achieve Profits, and stay away from emotional investment and feelings.",

This is a usual scenario in a bear market the price keeps crashing. Your first point is right that we should not put all our eggs in one basket. We should diversify our portfolio but this should be done in a sideways market. If your investment was only in bitcoin and if you really invested in a regular interval like you have said then your average would be much lower than bitcoin's ATH. This could have been a good investment even if your investment would have been 50% down because bitcoin is an asset and most of the altcoin is just securities 99% time if an altcoin performs well in a bull market then it doesn't in the next one.",

And then he will post it on a nearby person or here. But in your case it is completely opposite.Anyway, I don't know if what happened to you is true or false. If true then I would say you are too late to come here. When you're about to make the same mistake a second time, that time come here.",

Actually, there is a lot you have to learn first before you just spend your money. it is an expensive experience that you have to pay for with your ignorance.Your next mistake is choosing the wrong asset you want to invest in. I don't know how you choose assets, but when you follow an asset that makes a pump, obviously it is very risky when you buy it at the top.If you want to focus on investing, then choose Bitcoin. If you want to trade, then try to understand spot trading first.I hope you will never have an experience like that again. Once again this is a valuable lesson. you've already paid a heavy price for a bad start. but as you learn more, hopefully you will become a good trader or investor in the future.",

I think what he is doing is that he is chasing his losses thinking he could revive his wallet in a day, but it turns out wrong. Keep in mind that trading is a waiting game and also a timing game, if you could have invested your time learning and researching about the coins you are investing if could have lessen your losses, or else you even make a profit out of it. Then wait for the perfect market, tho you can spot it but you can always have analysis and gain insight from the indicators.",
