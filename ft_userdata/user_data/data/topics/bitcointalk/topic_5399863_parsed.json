  "content": "When buying crypto on Binance P2P and a seller has either bank transfer or the name of their bank as payment method, and you opt for either one of them, is it possible to deposit the money to their account directly at their bank branch over the counter through the teller? Or do you have to send it to their bank electronically?",

      "body": "I'm not 100% sure, but I think you can. It's just that bank transfers are obviously faster (pretty much instant), as manual bank transfers can take time because of queues and stuff. You could have potential problems with all those delays. Take note that Binance P2P transactions has a 15 minute window.",

      "body": "If you are buying through P2P it depends on the seller there are sellers who do not accept OTC but few of them accept them, make sure that the surname from the bank you use should be the same as your account on Binance. Why not just go directly on Binance OTC trading here https://www.binance.com/en/OTC-TradingIt will be much fit to your needs than looking for someone on P2P.",

      "body": "You need to first inquire from your bank how quick the money reflect in an account once a deposit is made over the counter, but both over the counter and electronic transfers are accepted so long as the payment is done within the time limit of your counterparty.I prefer electronic transfer since it's much more convinient. Imagine the time you have to waste to go to the bank and then queue up if it's a busy bank. By the time you make a deposit, you counterparty's payment time limit could have already expired.",
