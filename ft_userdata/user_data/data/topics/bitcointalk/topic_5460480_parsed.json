  "content": "Every Bitcoin holder has to learn about cyber security. There are so many phrases like not your keys not your coins. There are topics covering how to secure your private keys, how to be careful and watch out for phishing emails, links, scams, keylogger and many others. For me the two most important reasons why every bitcoiners should take a personal course on cyber security are because crypto wallets are attractive to hackers and cybercriminals. Secondly, malwares and keyloggers ...there are too many malwares that try to record our details from the backend without our knowledge. Lastly, if the keys is yours, then the coins are yours, it lies on you take a cybersecurity course to learn sophisticated ways to protect your non-custodial wallet that has your coins.I think that there has never been a time when bitcoiners should take personal Cyber security courses not for commercial purposes but for personal reasons for them to learn how to stay protected and secure their crypto assets.What do you think?",

      "body": "I couldn't agree more in fact I think every individual on this planet has to be aware of cyber security but taking the course is not really necessary for everyone, it will be better if we aware of its basics and striking the right balance between convenience and security. Advanced security measures may involve longer and more complex processes, which can be cumbersome for everyday use. Even if we are completely educated about all the things involved still no security system is foolproof and human errs can lead to vulnerabilities and further complications.And your statement be like everyone has to become a doctor because they are at the risk of getting sick anytime, Am I wrong?",

Personally I think the items you mentioned are a good way of securing ones bitcoin but there people who do not take these things seriously and may be getting trained on cyber security will really help to sharpen their security awareness because they always come up with scam issues which mostly have been as a result of lack of cyber security. Spending funds to gain proper guidance on good ways to secure not just bitcoin but other personal information about them will help to keep them from harm and scams so if it is worth spending on to get knowledge then it is not bad to talk about it in fact I will really support the op again and again.From your expression @ Obari you know so much on the possible ways to secure your funds but what about people who are new to bitcoin and those who feel less concerned about their privacy and security do you think they don't need to spend time and money to get trained?",

Precisely speaking, if any individual is handling voluminous amounts of bitcoin regularly, I think they should be having a great knowledge or background in security related aspects since a minor mistake would cost them hundreds or thousands of $$$ easily.After the failure of FTX, Self-custody has been of utmost importance in cryptocurrency world as any crypto company large enough can fail all of a sudden within a few days if they are not run properly. If the individual's assets in bitcoin are relatively lower, then purchasing a simple hardware wallet such as Trezor would suffice provided they are not randomly clicking onto any malicious link but OTOH if the individual is rich in fiat world and would like to convert their fiat into bitcoin by adding multiple bitcoins to their non-custodial wallet, then a security course would be of utmost importance in safeguarding their assets in long term.Furthermore, closely monitoring CT can provide us an edge onto the various hacks happening in the bitcoin/crypto world regularly but doing that alone on a regular scale can never help us in saving from the rug pulls or hacks happening every now and then. A minor knowledge of any programming language such as python can be helpful for anyone involved in Bitcoin as we will be able to verify the source codes of multiple software applications where we store our coins.",

I agree on you because this will give you an advantage on how to easily secure your account despite of the rampant scams happening online. However, I should also say that this is not actually compulsory for everyone as we can always protect our account as long as we are responsible enough to secure them and not to easily fall on the traps of scammers. But yes, if given a chance, then why not go and grab the opportunity.",

All this big talk gets them frightened and confused as to how to handle things that they have no knowledge about. What I  think you should have done or said is just to learn the basics of securing wallets properly at least that would help cool off the tension than raising dust.

Bitcoiners are not the only ones vulnerable to hacker attacks and fraud schemes, and they may be the least vulnerable to fraud and hacking given the number of attacks that occur almost daily.According to my estimation, taking lessons in CyberSecurity alone is not enough. Rather, daily practice and constantly asking questions is what motivates the search for answers and knowledge of the methods used by hackers, especially since these methods develop with the development of the tools used. Major platforms and companies hack operations succeed even though they allocate a whole section of human resources specialists in CyberSecurity for protection.",
