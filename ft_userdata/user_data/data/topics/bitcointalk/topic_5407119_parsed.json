Thanks tho.Anyone can do that as a hobby,hopefully you will have a core i5 CPU which is extremely common nowadays and you can try to mine Raptoreum,a CPU mineable coin which is really low in value and the difficulty of the network is also low,a 3rd gen Core i5 should make like 7-8 such coins per day.That is as a hobby,I do it in a much larger scale,I mine with 5 CPU-s and am mining near 40 coins per day because who knows if this is not the second Bitcoin or the second Monero and increases a lot in price,right now is 0.003 so extremely cheap and extremely easy to mine.",

No one knows your electricity price and other factors like - how long you will run your miner daily - will it run daily? Calculate by yourself. First hand experiences - we speak about 1 gpu for mining. Everyone has another definition of worth. If 0,2$ after electricity is enough for you - fire up - if it to less for you - don´t start mining. You have the intention to get rich with mining - not worth to mine with 1gpu/cpu i don´t know. you don´t define it.DYOR",

This coin is for asics. If you plan to mine it on a video card or processor in the background, then the profit will be minimal.Try to install nicehash miner and see your profit. They pay with bitcoins. It's better than altcoins.https://www.nicehash.com/cpu-gpu-mining?",
