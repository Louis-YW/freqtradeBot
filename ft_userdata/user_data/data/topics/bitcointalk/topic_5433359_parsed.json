And the price will be expensive, so in this case it depends on your decision.",

You did not make any loan, you did not sell anything you are using and needing for your life to invest in Bitcoin.It is a good and so safe plan.Before buying Bitcoin, you must plan to store it in your wallet, not on exchange, not in custodial wallets.Hardware wallets are best but they are not best for you because you won't get much money from a motorbike sale so it is unrealistic to buy a hardware wallet at this moment.Electrum wallet is free to use and it is good.[GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum [Guide]Download it for iOS, Windows, Android and Portable versions too: https://electrum.org/#downloadIt has multisig wallets and cold storagehttps://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multisig.htmlhttps://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",

But not caused by inflation, don't blame it for inflation, your property is old, second-hand. It's funny when people always blame inflation or fiat when the value of their assets falls. You can't expect motorbikes that have been used for many years to sell for like new, LOL.To get a return on your investment in bitcoin you need a plan and a goal, and a strategy, bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick asset.",

Bitcoin price will definitely go up if not today tomorrow will but if you don't buy bitcoin in the current bearish market you may miss the chance to buy at cheaper price.You have taken the right decision in my opinion and now don't take time to implement your plan.

Investing in bitcoin is not in a hurry because just one small mistake can lose all the money you have which cannot be reverted. My sincere advice, since you are inexperienced in the market, after selling your motorbikes, you should only invest in bitcoin. Refrain from being curious or greedy to invest in altcoins, it will make you lose heavily.",

It's not like easy as that for an speculation, price valuation may take longer than expected and I hope you're prepared if it declines even more in this stage.I'm not discouraging you not to but this scenario is likely to happen and it may disrupt your mind if you want to sell it for a loss or hold it until you're in profit. It will be wrong if you buy then sold it for a huge loss and it will be the right decision if you hold onto it the longer.",

Some people would sell what is necessary because of their impression towards something which is profitable, perhaps Bitcoin, which is not a good thing to do. Always check your necessities and only invest an amount you can afford losing, as being mentioned endlessly. Inspite of the potential for this technology, investors should still measure the risks involved and it won't be smart to loan (in some instances as mentioned by other users in this forum) just to invest. Any form of investment won't guarantee profit especially with this blockchain wherein the market prices are too volatile.",

Actually, no, I would not buy 2nd motorcycles and immediately buy btc. Don't wait for approval or condemnation of your actions, but do what you think is right. Your life, your rules. But first, weigh all the possible risks and losses, and only then act.In general, it is a good idea to get rid of unnecessary things and buy bitcoin with this money and I support your decision.",

I'm sure that there will be a confusion or possible danger of losing your cryptocurrency after you sold your motorbike. Basic knowledge such as storing your crypto on wallets is needed to secure your investment. I know that your motorbike is valuable to you that's why you need to gain knowledge first before entering crypto because the last thing we want to happen is when your cryptocurrency has been stolen because of lack of security. But overall I think it's a good choice to sell unusable liabilities especially if it depreciates overtime. Putting it on bitcoin as an investment isn't a wrong decision, I believe it is how you manage it since most of us here in this forum has bitcoin and knows what could might happen in the future when the bull market arrives.",

If I were in your situation, I would repair and clean it first before selling it so that you can price it higher and ensure that there will be buyers. I own a motorcycle too, but I won't be selling it even if I buy a new one, as it has sentimental value to me. After selling it, you can invest it in bitcoin because there is a high chance of profit but also some risk.Â  Just be careful and make sure your bitcoin is secure, like storing it in your own wallet and not in an exchange.",
