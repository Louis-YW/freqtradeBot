  "content": "As the title says, Twitter partnered with eToro and starting tomorrow (April 14th) users will be able to trade crypto and stocks directly on the platform. Quote from: https://watcher.guru/news/twitter-to-enable-crypto-stock-trading-after-etoro-partnershipTwitter users will soon be able to trade stocks, crypto, and other assets directly via the social media platform, thanks to a partnership with eToro. According to a CNBC report, the new feature will roll out on the Twitter application on Thursday, April 14.It is interesting to note that Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk, began his quest to acquire the social media platform on April 14, 2022. A year later he is rolling out one of the biggest updates in the platform’s history. Twitter currently has a “cashtag” feature that allows users to view real-time trading data from various platforms. However, with the Twitter-eToro partnership, the “cashtag” feature will expand to include more instruments and asset classes, including trading crypto. The social media platform will also have a “View on eToro” button, which will take users to the eToro site.eToro CEO, Yoni Assia told CNBC that they see a lot of their users interacting on Twitter and educating themselves about the market. Assia further added that Twitter has high-quality, real-time content about financial happenings around the world. Assia stated,“This partnership will enable us to reach those new audiences [and] connect better the brands of Twitter and eToro.”",

Regulations on financial services are very strict in the USA. and if Twitter ignore compliance stuffs, they will be in troubles with regulatory authorities.",

Its probably eToro doing the trading part because if it isn't, what's the point of that partnership?I know eToro will play main role with trading feature but does this partnership exclude the necessary that Twitter have to register a license for operating a platform with trading services?Like casinos buy games from game providers but casinos themselves have to register valid licenses to operate gambling activities. It's my thinking.Quote from: Oshosondy on April 13, 2023, 11:21:00 AMElon Musk is only looking for ways to make more money and not thinking about Twitter users. I wonder if anyone on Twitter will not want to try to trade and start losing money, I hope they will know that trading is not for everyone.If you are a trader and you can have a super big X-app to trade and do other things, will you use it? I don't like to do everything in a single application as it is like I put all risk and one bag. I can not control my capital by doing this.I don't see what is wrong if Elon Musk deployed it for Twitter, if you see benefit, let's use it. If not, don't use it. This partnership is good for Twitter to earn more income from a kind of affiliate income from eToro and eToro will have massive advertisement on Twitter.",

OK they are human just like us but they are also highly skilled in many areas. To use an app as a 50+ years old is no issue in China. Open an email is an Issue in most western countries. India as a twitter loving folk has severe Restrictions specially in Crypto. There is a reason why wechat works in China, it does not work outside of China. Only Chinese banks accept wechat.

You arent forced to trade if you are a user of Twitter, it would be still your choice and its true thatnot all are really into trading but at least having that add up do give out some options later on which it might be that beneficial or convenient for us later on.",

Later did what we expected as he accepted doge. I still do not see alternative social media that crypto people are using as news are directing us to tweets, I hope there is a better and less centralized or decentralized one in the future.

You guessed it - network congestion, higher DOGE prices, higher block difficulty and higher energy use.In short, DOGE will become twitter fuel and will certainly cause network congestion. Having to build a stronger DOGE network, elon Musk has a lot of money and he will also benefit a lot from what he does with DOGE. It seems that DOGE is no longer a memecoin, but a speculation coin for elon. Unlimited supply and high prices, it will be perfect for growing elon musk's wealth. DOGE is also still using the POW Network and this will make energy consumption even higher, is Elon not worried about that, about higher energy consumption.eToro might just be a starter, but I've never traded on eToro, it's quite foreign to me. Is this just going to be an experiment? Twitter recently became a testing ground for Eon Musk when he became the legal owner of Twitter.",
