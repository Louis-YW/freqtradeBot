So is it apprised to gift a friend bitcoin at his birthday party? That's a great idea. At a time when bitcoin was worth $100, my friend asked me to install a bitcoin wallet on my device. When he came to visit me, he said that he would now give ina 0.01 btc. And he made a transfer from his wallet. So he made a gift, and showed how simple cryptocurrencies are. So I advise you to do the same. You will make a gift and show the process of sending cryptocurrency. That's exactly how another crypto enthusiast will appear.",

So is it apprised to gift a friend bitcoin at his birthday party? That will be great to be honest. But at first your friend should be taught on how to use the Bitcoins. Also if possible try to gift him something which he will appreciate more. Bitcoins can be a good gift, but he might be expecting something more or else from you as a gift. I may also recommend you that gifting these valuable Bitcoins won’t be great, as in future Bitcoins will become more valuable and you will yourself sell these 200$ worth of Bitcoins at 1000$. So gift him something physical worth 200$ and save the Bitcoins for yourself.",

So is it apprised to gift a friend bitcoin at his birthday party? If indeed he is a bitcoin lover of course that's pretty cool as a gift, even though bitcoin is only worth $ 200 of course it will be an investment for him in the long term rather than just giving gifts that he might use temporarily, giving him bitcoin is the same as you teach him to save and I think, as a bitcoin lover of course he will be very happy and happy to receive gifts that he might not have expected at all.",

Surely you can but something you must think$200 is high, are you sure you want to give him a $200 gift?Have you ever known how to use Bitcoin?It's important. If he have never used it, likely after receiving your gift, he will throw it away, ask someone who can steal that bitcoin, or ask you for more tutorial from you. But you are not sure what he will do after he receives it from you.You will likely teach him how to import seed/ key, how to make a transaction, how to sell it on exchanges. Are you ready?To deliver gift, youGiftcard trading is risky too but if you deliver giftcard to your friend, tell him that he can sell it on Paxful",

So is it apprised to gift a friend bitcoin at his birthday party? How can I register to become your friend?  A 200$ is always good to send as a gift even if it’s not Bitcoin but since your friend is already interested then it’s 100% cool because it’s his interest. New user will always be happy on new things that they like especially if it send as gift since they are interested on it. I think he will appreciate more if you include hardware wallet on your gift since the amount is already greater than the price of the hardware wallet to make it safe for him since he is just new to crypto.",

I heard that Steve Wozniak and Keanu Reeves received bitcoin as a gift from their friends. Can't tell if it's birthday related or not, but as you can see, you're not the first to use bitcoin in this capacity. According to them, they have since kept bitcoin, essentially being holders. Let them serve as an example for you. So, don't be shy - act. I'm sure your friend will appreciate it, since he's interested in your telling about bitcoin.",

Of course, bitcoins as a birthday present is a great and beautiful thing. I've often given bitcoin as a birthday gift and people were always happy about it. I have even given them away at a wedding and the couple who received them kept the bitcoins for a very long time and only sold them last year. As a result, they received a lot of fiat money and were able to fulfill one or the other dream.Therefore, in my opinion, bitcoins are always a great gift and suddenly people who have had nothing to do with bitcoins are suddenly interested in them.",

So is it apprised to gift a friend bitcoin at his birthday party? Unlike majority in this topic I think bitcoin is not a good gift, especially for newbie.What if he is not experienced enough not to lose his private key or seed phrase? Imagine how stressful can it be to lose your present because of not understanding how to deal with it.What if he is not planning investing at the moment? Is there enough places to spend bitcoin directly around? Or has he to exchange them first? Will he be satisfied with an additional difficulty with a present?What if he would prefer to get a more personal gift? If money are okay as a present for him then okay.

For someone who doesn't know, look out a few good YouTube videos and give them a good warning, that he not believe everything. I wouldn't give away an external paperwallet, it can be manipulated with criminal energy. So if someone wants to own Bitcoin, he should have some time and inform himself.
