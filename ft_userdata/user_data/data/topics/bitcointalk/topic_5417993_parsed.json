That just means that this user will now create 67 other newbie accounts and continue the cycle. I am not getting on you @lovesmayfamilis, i'm just saying this stops nothing. Bounty managers are going to have to implement a rule of no newbies to start making a difference. Once jr member and above accounts get tagged it might slow them down. It also might not, but IMO tagging newbies doesn't do much. @Bounty managers!!! You need to stop allowing newbies to join period! Also, no neg trusted accounts allowed. Yea your numbers will go down, but at least you are trying to make a difference. As are you lovemayfamilis, i'm not saying you're doing anything wrong here at all. I'm just saying it's a waste for any of us to chase newbie farms. If managers fall in line and use the no newbie rule, newbies become a little more irrelevant.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 22, 2022, 07:06:49 PMQuote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 22, 2022, 02:24:32 PM+67 Accounts Connected Accounts Connected: (Note: Banned shown in red / Inactive in Blue)Very good research on finding this farm cheaters @lovesmayfamilis.I just don't have the nerve myself to dig and investigate things like this anymore.Agreed, very good job on the research and finding all these cheaters. Really not trying to make you feel like what you have done here is irrelevant. I'm on a rant about these cheaters and how can we combat them. Keep finding these morons and tagging them until we can devise a way to stop them.",

Usernames like; kwibeen, khagwwm, ghoset, mikeq, norkeeb, slamewn etc I am just realising that some of these usernames are random alphabets on the keyboard, chosen by account farmers when creating large number of accounts. Even if this type of catch won't stop subsequent account farming, it will surely slow down their efforts. They might even be discouraged from creating more accounts because there is every possibility that they would be caught again when they haven't earned some rewards. Creating another farm will mean creating new social media accounts, new emails and new btt accounts. This will be tedious for anyone to do twice a year",

It’s incredible that one person would be able to manage 67 accounts on the forum, all participating in bounties. They probably have an office where they go to everyday to do their “job”. I think bounty managers should adopt the same merit rules they use for signature campaigns for bounty application, I doubt if any of the busted account has up to 20 merits in 120 days.",

A few more accounts, which I tagged after I posted this accusation, are visible in my feedback. The same action pattern. Old social networks are used in other accounts. And YOSHIE is right; there are many more, and even more than 10, as you can imagine. If you check them by registrations with telegram contacts, it will be seen that many are not active. I just marked the accounts that are active today. And to be honest, I was looking at your company. I did not find in the rules a ban on the participation of alternative accounts, so I did not mention your bounty in the lists of those where cheaters cheated. Thanks for tagging everyone.",
