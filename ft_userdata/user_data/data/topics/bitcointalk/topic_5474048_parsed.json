  "content": "While browsing the forum and¬† listening to the song below..It's been a long time coming by Tom Jones(YouTube link embedded)I somehow realized that today, I made it to 100 days in office¬† .Politically, \"100 days in office\" is a very remarkable day, as it is a day that officials, and people who care about the country sit down to access; and to evaluate how much progress the governor or president or chancellor, or whoever involved, has made so far since he or she assumed office. I don't know about other countries, but this is how it's done here in my country.But fortunate enough, Bitcointalk is not an office¬† , but every serious member of this forum still strive to do great things and achieve a good reputation overall, so today marking my 100 days online on this forum, I decided to access and evaluate my overall performance on the forum so far.I discovered and joined this great forum in the year 2016 through a search about bitcoin on Google, I started my journey here as a newbie, focused 100 percent on the Altcoin board since I was very much into altcoins because as a poor newbie back then, I always felt bitcoin was already too expensive to buy and hold, so I gave all my attention to altcoins alone, I needless say that I was a victim to alot of scams, rug pulls, phishing scams and so on, eventually by the ending of 2017, I became very frustrated and left crypto, as well as left the forum.Somewhere in-between 2017 and 2020, I remember visiting the forum from time to time and maybe making a few comments here and there, but 2020 was the year I became active on the forum again (can't remember the month exactly), when I came back, I still focused on altcoins believing that I will get lucky somehow, but I learnt the hard way that altcoins aren't asset to hold for the long term, I started buying and selling them by trading, and also started paying attention to bitcoin little by little, and by this, I mean that I started moving away from Altcoin discussion board and start participating in Bitcoin Discussions, while I started buying holdling bitcoin.Long story short..Today, I am happy with my life and how far I've come, investment wise, I now believe in bitcoin 100 percent more than I ever did when I started new on this forum, and hold an amount of bitcoin I myself consider as significant.Forum achievements... Well, I honestly can not tell how I've done in this area, I mean, we still need others to tell us we've done well to indeed know that we have done well, but going over to bpip.org, I have the stats belowThis is nothing, absolutely nothing to compare with the kind of achievements I've seen from my bosses here, but I personally feel happy that, out of over 51,000 active profile on this forum, I am ranked at 655th most recognized.I do not know what I did that placed me on this spot, I am not a technical person when it comes to bitcoin discussions and cryptocurrencies at large, I also don't have a vast knowledge when it comes to anything that involves technology, but all the same, I am very happy that this forum accepted me, and that some of you find my contents valuable, which is why I am where I am today, and will get to where I hope for tomorrow.All I can promise is, to always put in all the best effort i can in every post I make, to always learn from everyone, be you a newbie or an OG,¬† and to also teach the best I know to as many willing to learn to know what I know, so that the next 100 days in office¬†  coming will be worth celebrating as well.This is my pledge. And special thanks to everyone that have helped me in one way or the other so far, directly or indirectly, I owe every one of you üôè.",

This shows that you are happy to be part of this great community.When I see forum members celebrating 100+ days in the forum, I begin to ask myself if I can also achieve this because I still have a long journey ahead of me to reach this milestone. You are a motivation to newbies and other users who are yet to give their time to the forum just like you did and I must applaud you for this.I celebrate with you, and I hope that someday, you will celebrate your 200 days in the forum.",

To me this is a nice milestone to celebrate although I agree that it would be great if you considered posting it in the thread provided by BitcoinGirl.Club. But it's always possible - having your own achievements thread is fine even though many other users expect it to be well organized in one thread only.100 days for total login time proves that you have dedication to the forum. You're certainly not the first user to celebrate - but your dedication to this forum is also amazing. I'm not sure when I'll reach the same milestone - but I really hope to be able to post it and celebrate with you guys too.Quote from: hugeblack on November 14, 2023, 02:24:52 PMUnfortunately, you missed the activity number for the legendary member, which is often random, but you are close to reaching that rank.Fivestar4everMVP only needs less than 50 merit to get Legendary rank.
