I've mentioned before ASIC miners should use the GPU model with commodity add-in cards.Maybe others will follow.The efficiency depends on the ASIC chips and there aren't many companies capable of doing that. It shouldn't be too hardto track down if the chips are real.The scam part maybe in the timing. The big guys will likely be first in line so by late 2024 they may already be uncompetitive.PS: ASIC is Application Specific Integrated Circuit and can only mine one algorithm, FPGA is Field Programmable Gate Arrayand can be reprogrammed to mine different algos. This device is an ASIC mining board, the only way to change algos is tochange the HW. ASICS are inherently more efficient and cheaper, the flexibility of FPGA has a cost.",

I'm more concerned about the chips they will use.I doubt they design their own so what will they be using and who will get them first?With PCIe ASIC hash boards we can talk about mixing ASICS with GPU, not just different brands of GPUs.It could also revive the mining mobo market, a rig with 18 ASIC boards would be pretty sweet. I think the form factor is their biggest potential advantage. I don't lnow about licensing fees for PCIe butusing it would cut costs by eliminating the need for peripherals like a controller, chassis or case.",

If it is an ASIC with a consumption of several kilowatts, then enthusiasts will refuse to buy, but any miner can buy a board with a consumption of 145 watts.",

It also depends on how they market them and whetherthey build boards that draw less than 500W and cost less that USD1000, ie in the same range as GPUs. If they don't it won't help hobbyists.",
