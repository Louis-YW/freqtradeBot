Trading is trading. Know that scalping is also still very risky. Some traders may want to scalp, if the market go against their opened position, they can tun it to day trading and they may later even lose. You can think it is what some people are saying it is and profitable, but very risky.If you scalp rightly, you will make money though, especially if you use averaging and not going more than 5x leverage for bitcoin. Not more than 1x leverage for altcoins.",

By virtue of this, successful scalpers will always make more money than regular traders.The greed now depends on the trading plan of the trader. If such renege from the plan to earn more, then you can call it greed.",

Trading is trading. Okay noted , I was just trying to differentiate can you please give me a better way to thatScalping, day trading or swing are all types of trading but it all depends what works for you based on your strategy. The difference between them is the time on the market. Scalpers don't stay longer in the market, they desire to go out within 15 minutes but most times they end up staying longer and doing day trading and sometimes swing because the market is going against them. Trading is not easy, you have to learn, use stop loss and stick to what works for you. Therefore, a scalpe can become a day trader while day trader can become scalper or swinger because of the challenges of trading. One challenge that scalping face is that it is difficult to apply stop loss immediately while making the order because of the lower time frame, the market may bounce of the stop loss and it may not trigger except you want to use buy stop, buy limit, sell stop, sell limit etc.",

This is what I have learn with one of my batch, he sacrifices his job for trading because he thinks that trading can sustain his daily needs. Scalping is the most riskiest type of trading since you only use lower time frame (1m, 3m, or 5m) for entry. You only have a couple of minutes to close the trade.

If I should help you rephrase the statement, you mean that there are a lot of people who make a lot of money using the scalping strategy than those who don't. I think this is a better way to put it. To be successful at scalping it requires a lot of experience as the trader needs to be in and out of a trade quickly and efficiently as possible profit from small price movements. It is very high risk too as you are trying to make a lot of money within like a 15 - 1 minute timeframe and the right trading pair.",

This will be a full time category trade.Someone is not mandatorily going to stay as a scalper on all the trade. Some trade can be clearly a profitable one and that person known as a scalp trader could decide to allow it run longer to maximize the profit from it but scalping itself has duration of time not more than 15-30 minutes and that is the reason it is known in trading as scalping. Anyway, in such a time that the trade is allowed to run into more profit, the scalp trader can adjust his stop loss to entry position and by doing that he is certain of not losing any money on that trade until he close his trade and he can further adjust or use trailing stop to pick profit as the trade is running.",

Scalping is also full trading like day trading and hour trading. We know scalping is not too easy it is also very risky trading. When market will go your Against then it will create big loss for you. And it will be long trade there has no doubt. Many people want short time trade for profit. Scalper follow technical analysis and candlestick analysis maximum 15/30 minutes get time to complete trading. But many scalper complete trade within 1 minute to 5 minutes with 1%-2% profit. And i think future trading is best for scalping. In future trade within short time more than 5% profit possible. So most scalper like this future trade.",

Scalping is very good trading strategy if the price of crypto moves along the range for certain period of time. The only time scalping become super risky is if there’s a trend on the token that will cause a sudden price movement on unknown direction since you might be caught off guard if you place a position against the thread when the news release.Scalping in general is not bad strategy. The application is what make it looks bad because newbie trader don’t know how to properly use it.",

And scalping is not an easy task it requires a lot of experience and analysis and once the thing goes wrong like the recent dip.Scalper will be exhausted by such sudden dips so to decrease the loss ratio many use stop loss and you could also use stop loss to decrease the lose. And there is one more thing that most of the scalpers are trading in Future while lesser in Spot. And if you are scalping in future then there will be more risk as there is a fear of liquidation while if you are in spot then there is lesser risk. As in spot you could hold for longer period of time unlike future. Although If one is newbie and just started there journey in crypto or trading they they should avoid scalping as it is now for newbies.",

In scalping a trader basically finds a cryptocurrency or a stock that can give some profit to a trader when its price gets higher. In this type of trading a trader basically follows the charts of a cryptocurrency or stock and whenever he/she finds a good dip then he/she buys some amount of the cryptocurrency or stock and waits for sometime to see a higher price. Once the stock or cryptocurrency gains some price the trader sell of the cryptocurrency or stock and earns some profit because of such trades. A scalper often opens and closes many positions per day and those type of traders often do so many trades in a day to earn some profit. The scalpers are basically the ones who follow a certain group of technical indicators and when they finds a good price of an asset they purchase it at that price and sell it for a very low %age profit. There are some scalpers who often face huge losses because their main target is to gain profits in short amount of time and sometimes when market faces huge crashes the scalpers lose a lot during those times.",

Sacpling is the game for the Big Capitals, I would generally advise in words that \"Avoid\".Keep in mind and spend a peaceful life with the Motto Slow and Steady wins the race.. choose a better time frame and trade with peace of mind without any pressure and make millions.   . It never means that those who trade on scalping are greedy buddy their nature and their typo is different ... they like adventure and like to play because they have a lot (Funds / Money).",
