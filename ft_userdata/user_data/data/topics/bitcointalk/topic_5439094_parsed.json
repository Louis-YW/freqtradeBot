  "content": "The Scientists should figure out how the dang thing works.The Mechanics should test the emissions before and after a few hours of run time.The EPA should test the mileage of multiple vehicles.I have already been using it for months now and it's been saving me some sweet moo-la. Exhaust seems visibly cleaner... even on the vehicles! Everyone is invited to try it out for themselves as only takes about an hour to build. It doesn't have to be perfectly symmetric to work, either. So suspend disbelief for a day and maybe end up in sweet moo-la land. Even makes the treated engines sound cooler, clunk...clunk..clunk... never mind that was just my full pockets.  Instructions are here. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403404.0Maybe get that You tuber guy on Project Farm to test it?Feel free to post your results, questions and pics of your fuel saver etc. I'm planning on building an orange one in the future but for now I use college ruled paper. The lines help with the cutting, 3 wide... just like...You can speed up your build by stacking the paper up to 5 pieces thick. A good pair of scissors should handle that. Then take off the top piece of paper and fold it three times, making eight sections. Unfold and place back on the pile and cut along the crease lines.",

      "body": "The full title is in the link provided. I left out the word \"blockchain\" to save space on the subject line. Maybe the finished device looked like a blockchain to the inventor and they just used the number one cryptocurrency (BTC) for a marketing edge? Either way the name is not that important, just that the device works is all that matters but don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.As for mining with your car, it doesn't make much sense unless you are using solar power or cheap power to run a miner. Maybe use a cheap miner to heat the vehicle while it's plugged in during the winter months in order to avoid scraping the windows or heat the engine block? If you have a garage this idea doesn't help that much. A USB stick miner is what I would use.Aptera's come with solar panels and you could set up a miner to run once the main battery is fully charged.If ICE vehicles came with Sterling engines and they ran off the heat from the exhaust, then there might be some excess energy to run a miner once a smaller battery pack is fully charged (plug-in-hybrid). Right now Sterling engines are too inefficient to merit the work, but it could be a fun project for someone to try out?",

Then wrap the whole thing like you're wrapping a present and with the same kind of paper. Then you are done. One device will treat almost unlimited tanks of fuel. Just keep it clean and replace outer wrapper when needed. Store inside a plastic container when not in use!Making this diagram took about the same time as to build a real one. Unfortunately I can't post pictures yet or I am doing something wrong?",
