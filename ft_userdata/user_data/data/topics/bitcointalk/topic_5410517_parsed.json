That means we are in a very risky position. But it all began with the launch of the dogechain. And this network makes memes into coins. And we already saw that there have been so many coins launched where some people make a profit, while most people lose everything. I will invest a little bit to check if I can survive with that trend . But I am not sure at all. And all of the effects occur only on Dogecoin.",

I still believe that Elon musk gave it and it's like the boost and they also worked on it to get to this stage.",

Some whales are the cause of that and as far as I can tell, the price of dogecoin within 24h decreased about 11.55% from its price before. It's just an indication that it may pump or dump of the price but the truth is we can't predict the price of cryptocurrency.",

So for sure, it has a trickle even on DOGE and SHIB and then the usual suspects, pumpers going to work and uses. these two as their vehicles to make money by pumping it early and then waiting for the whole crypto market to catch up, unsuspecting noobs joining, and maybe they think they can make a quick buck out of it. But then again, massive sell-off, DOGE for example is down -12% already. So this is going to repeat itself again and again.",

The bearish trend can't be determined. Doge was getting pumped due to the some reasons along with shiba inu as well with its burn mechanism. I think that must not become a reason why that article was taking doge as an indicator to signal for bearish trend",

Despite what the analyst may say i don't think there is a connection, the market is already in bear market.Of course, Dogecoin, with its capitalization of $9 billion, cannot significantly influence the prices of other cryptocurrencies in this market. Prices can be influenced by such giants as bitcoin with a capitalization of $405 billion and partially ethereum with a capitalization of $200 billion. The price of dogecoin may change slightly under the influence of Musk's tweets, but we can hardly expect a similar surge in its price again, like last year.",

IMO, I think the reason why Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are rallying artificially is because of the intervention of the whales who pumped it nothing more nothing less. don't think much it's just a normal market price correction.",
