Trust is the most important factor in any lending situation, especially in a forum like this where there are no guarantees. It is essential to establish yourself as a reliable and trustworthy member of the community before you even think about asking for a loan. Remember, lenders on this forum are taking a risk by offering non collateral loans, so it is important to show them that you are a trustworthy borrower.Quote from: zephin on April 02, 2023, 12:15:26 PMI need 0.004 BTC as my wallet won't let me transfer unless I deposit 0.004 from another wallet but I am unable to create a second wallet.That sounds like an outright scam. How can you be certain that you will be able to withdraw funds from that wallet, even if you deposit 0.004 BTC from another wallet? What sort of service operates in this way?",
