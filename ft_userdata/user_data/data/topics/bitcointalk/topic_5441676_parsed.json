Though of course NFTs are still a good investment because it is still new and for sure they can improve more, all you have to do is to do your own research and be sure that you understand its risk before investing.",

All of the new projects out there are just hyped stuff, and all the good ones (whether by the result of hype or not) are already priced at sky-high prices and aren't really worth the investment. Ofc, if you were legitimately buying NFT's as a collection owner then go ahead and buy whatever you want then.",

Pictures of paintings sold as NFT have no real value and you will probably lose your money.That's right, NFT is a very high risk investment instrument. The fundamentals of NFT are almost non-existent, only speculation. The use case is the value, if there is no other use for the NFT other than as a digital object, the hype that is happening right now can just disappear. It's the same with tokens, without a use case, these tokens slowly have no value, because they have no fundamentals that can drive buyer interest except for speculation.",
