  "content": "Hi! I'm looking urgent for a 0.0005-1 BTC loan for personal gaming. I'm willing to pay 10-20 USDT back a 4 weeks. I don't have collateral, but I do have my freebitco.in account. You can view my entire account history and see that I have won very large sums before. I am ready to go to a lawyer to sign all the necessary documents, if I don't repay the loan, you will recover the loan from me in court. I will gladly go through KYC and any other information here. I promise you that these BTC will not be lost in the gamble. Thanks you!",

Therefore, urgently! At the moment, I am no longer looking for a loan of 0.005-1 BTC because I am no longer playing on this site from today.I started looking for Angel Investors to buy a secret coin (not a token) that will give up to x30 profit - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5408545.0",
