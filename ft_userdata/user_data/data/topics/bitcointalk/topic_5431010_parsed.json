They have finally decided to join the moving train because the government has discovered that Bitcoin has many opportunities that would benefit the country. Recognizing Bitcoin as a currency that can be used for the payment of goods and services and an investment instrument is only second to making Bitcoin a legal tender. This would lead to massive Bitcoin awareness and adoption in that South American country. Although the government would do everything possible to regulate Bitcoin transactions so that they would be able to collect tax and monitor the sector, I am still confident that Bitcoin education would still liberate most of the citizens from government control. Teaching them how to use decentralized exchanges and encouraging the to embrace P2P transactions might be one of the means of escaping from government regulations.",

I think they did it to be able to tax and track every bitcoin transaction not only crypto/fiat trades.Although Brazil still not declare Bitcoin as legal tender, but you need to read it twice since they're accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, not only about investment instrument! it's just only valid for the next 180 days, so this is a temporary to know how good does Bitcoin can give an affect to their country. After all it's still a good news, Brazil is still give a chance to their citizens to use Bitcoin as payment, not ban it.Quote from: https://www.btctimes.com/news/brazil-passes-bill-to-recognize-bitcoin-and-digital-assets-as-paymentThe bill was passed by Congress in November and was enacted today by President Bolsonaro without any changes. The new regulations acknowledge Bitcoin as a digital representation of value that can be used in the South American country as a means of payment and as an investment instrument.The bill defines a virtual asset as ‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be negotiated or transferred electronically and used for payments or as an investment.‚ÄùThe new law takes effect 180 days from the day it is signed, but does not declare Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal tender within the country.",

My BTC is my private business and I spend/trade it every day without Brazil.Conclusively, visiting Brazil will not change anything in this regard.",

And yes this is very good news. because fortunately this policy can be completed and legalized before the president's term of office ends. Although this is different from what El Salvador is doing. But at least bitcoin transactions in Brazil have become Legal. and I think the impact will be quite good for the current bitcoin market. In fact, I think many countries will pay attention to this and maybe follow the steps taken by Brazil.",

That can be seen if you read the content of the link you provided to noticed that, or read the quote below:Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-president-signs-crypto-bill-into-lawAccording to the text of the bill, Brazil‚Äôs residents will not be able to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in the country, as is the case in El Salvador. However, the newly passed law includes many digital currencies under the definition of legal payment methods in Brazil. It also establishes a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers and sets penalties for fraud using digital assets.It is a good news, but I am surprised that other cryptocurrencies are allowed too as centralized as they are. Only well decentralized cryptocurrency, like bitcoin would have been better.Quote from: Plaguedeath on December 23, 2022, 03:26:51 AMit's just only valid for the next 180 days, so this is a temporary to know how good does Bitcoin can give an affect to their country. After all It is not only for 180 days, but it was reported that the new law takes 180 days from the day it was signed.Quote from: https://www.btctimes.com/news/brazil-passes-bill-to-recognize-bitcoin-and-digital-assets-as-paymentThe new law takes effect 180 days from the day it is signed, but does not declare Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal tender within the country.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on December 23, 2022, 07:48:35 AMI am no more new in the crypto environment, and for Brazil to recognize BTC is though a welcome development but will not change anything about how I feel about the coin and how I send the one in my possession.But there is possibility that some people will like to visit Brazil and use bitcoin for paying for goods and services. The more countries support cryptocurrencies, the adoption continues. Although, bitcoin does not depend on countries to accept it as a payment method or legal tender before its adoption can continue, its valuation has continues even before El Salvador made it a legal tender, followed by CAR and an island in Honduras, and also before some countries made it a payment method.",

I think we hate the government so much that whatever they do to us makes us uncomfortable, when they don't accept bitcoin, we say they are selfish, but when they accept and legitimize bitcoin, we say they are trying to control and tax us. Anyway, we still need the government to run this society, otherwise, it will be chaos before you are free.",

Despite they didn't made it legal tender to their citizens in this present government, at least it will give crypto users free access to operate but they will not too enjoy it like other countries that made it legal tender to their countries.",
