How to become a billionaires by trading a shitcoin worth 80k$ (Fully Diluted Market Cap - $80,000) with \"-2% Depth\" eqaul 137$? All you can do is to change 2$ into 5$ if you are lucky enough and this pattern wont stop, this no name exchange wont exit scam or, much more likely, nothing can be earned here, and this pattern is only due to the total lack of liquidity, huge spread and fake volume that generates trades randomly between bid and ask, regardless of how far apart these prices are.",

      "body": "Vindax is one of the worst centralized exchange I have ever used then, I don't know of now if they have changed some certain things. Most especially their withdrawal fee was like mad and withdrawal through ERC20 is a no go area for them because they will make mess of your funds. However, since I limits my attention on altcoin I never pay much interest to study about new coin or even heard about this.I think for a coin or a token like this that decreases and increased again, you need to be very careful because at first they don't even list in reputable exchange were you will have hope that it won't die just like. It's not advisable to hold for long as trader or investor what you do is to target and project your price whenever it bounces to your required price then it triggers off then take your profits and leave, otherwise same money made from it would crash again.",
