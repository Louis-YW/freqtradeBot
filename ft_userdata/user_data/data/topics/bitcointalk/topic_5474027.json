So there is a price increase for altcoin but not a established one like Bitcoin, because we have not seen dump in the value of Bitcoin for over an month now but Altcoins has been pumping and dumping and in my opinion it's not worth to make entery for long term as of now it's good only for quick profit whole being very active. What's your opinion ? Shall we invest or just involve in quick trades ?",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing your overview of the current market situation. Many have taken advantage of this momentum and gain profit. But some are waiting still for a dip. But I think they should invest but with their own research. But as you mentioned the top gainers today may become the top losers in the comind. This volatility in altcoins can give you profit and loss both. But if you are a good holder so you will get profit one day.And I will suggest that you should learn some fundamentals of trading and you can get quick profits by getting entry and exit at certain time. In my point of this is also a good method to earn much as you can.",

I would even feel it is risky to try to especulate using coins within the top 50. One needs to be a very well developed sense of economical intuition so one won't get scammed in the wild and obviously scammers take advantage of the bull cycles to try to steal as much as possible from gullible investors, using all kinds of tricks. If I decided to put some money in altcoins, I would only do so in projects which have already been time-proof, like Monero, Litecoin, Ethereum. Nothing with tokens based on food or Dogs. Those are basically shitcoins and a way to  gamble to anyone daring getting money in.",

Those are basically shitcoins and a way to  gamble to anyone daring getting money in.You hold my thoughts in terms of investment in altcoins, because many of them are not worth putting your money into. If I must invest in altcoins, it has to be the these ones that you have mentioned and a few more that have been time tested and proven to be reliable. If I decide to invest in an altcoin now, it'll have to be Ethereum, because I believe that it's the one of the top altcoins that nears bitcoin, in being reliable and time tested, where their investors have complete trust in them. Shitcoins have made investors to categorize altcoins as worthless, but truth remains that there are few of them that are worth inventing in. I've been enticed a couple of times to double my profits by investing in some new altcoin, but in the end I'm always skeptical about them, i feel more comfortable in bitcoin investment. There'll be less risk for me to invest in Ethereum, when I'm ready for altcoins.",

They are like stable coins and their movement is very slow and their value is not encouraging to invest. Op I must tell you the truth that trading is must more better than investing in altcoins because their some altcoins that you will invest for like three to four years yet the value is nothing and not even up to a dollar and if you learn trading and you become a successful trader for a year, you will make enough profit from the trading. So I choose trading to altcoins.",

Nevertheless, it depends on the project if they are still active in their development and updates because if they are not, their coins are not worthy of our time and money.",

Don't be scared to get involved, especially in alts. Just make sure they're alts with vision and utility. We never can be too careful as not to risk anything at all. This is business. It's populated with risk. Only those who risk it will profit from the eventual bull run. Yesterday, all the tokens on the Bluezilla launchpad pumped very hard that they all doubled up on price and some did more than half of their prices, just because BZ announced there would be an IDO soon across all its launchpads.So, position yourself now if you aim to get a nice ROI.",

Choosing the right coin among the many altcoins that most altcoins are risky in the market is the most important. Currently some special altcoin cases have gone public, and this has made the exchange attractive. But we need to support ourselves to acquire proper research and information before investing. We can take appropriate action based on the way we want to gain. Long-term investments are generally based on strong capital appreciation and social change, to maximize potential returns. On the other hand, to maintain rapid transaction price fluctuations, it carries high risk for potential short-term gains. For me the best investment option from altcoins is Bitcoin.",

It's less than 6 months before the bitcoin halving. And we already know what happens to the crypto market every halving and its following year. So for me, the time to start accumulating altcoins is now. I also started already accumulating altcoins but bitcoin remains my main priority which is around 70% of my portfolio. It is hard to catch the lowest time buying altcoins so for me doing a DCA is highly recommended just like with bitcoin.",

The more risky it is, the more potential profits (and losses) it has. If you are a risk taker go on, buy some alts.

      "body": "For someone with a deep pocket, I'd say the risks might not be much compared to someone who is only going to do a one-time buy in with a lump sum. Take Microstrategy for instance, they bought bitcoin around $35K+ at first and they kept buying at different prices (even when bitvoin leveled at $16K at the face of the FTX collapse). They kept buying and that averaged out their average buy in price to subb$20K. Which is why they're in net positive for profits.We can't say the same for someone that will just enter with a lump sum with no more capital to buyback if the price goes lower. The best bet for anyone investing now is to DCA it out because there's a high probability that we might see a market downturn before the mega bull run that everyone is hoping for.",

Eth, Litecoin, XRP are all low risk coins. Medium level altcoins are also good for midterm. The volatility of these coins are better than low level coins but at the same time risk is also hige such as Matic, Arb, OP. High risk coins have very high volatility and we couldn't hold it for long term. In short term if we make proper entry we can make a nice profit. Meme coins, low cap coins and mostly new coins are all high risk coins. I think we should use some money to make quick profit and then use it for buying btc and low risk coins.",

It is also important to keep in mind your financial circumstances and risk tolerance level. Moreover, It is essential to recognize that no investment is 100% free, all investments have some risks, by being careful and managing risk smartly, you can turn it into profit. during the last two months altscoin market has performed well, particularly Solana, Chain Link and many mores.

That logic in itself is crooked, if you KNOW that it's a terrible token, and you just want to get in and make a profit and get out before everyone else, that is a wrong move. There are people who invest into literally scams that they are aware that it's a scam.Because they know that scams will look good before it turns out to be a scam, so they invest into scam projects who will rug pull, with the aims that they will get out before it turns out to be a scam, or before it rug pulls people. These type of moves will never be good moves, people need to be careful about what they are doing and should be careful about what they are doing. I know that it may sound or look like a good quick profit that can get you richer, and maybe some people can achieve it, but usually this is a way that people will lose their money.",
