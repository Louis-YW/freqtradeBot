      "body": "For a very long time, crypto payment gateways like coin payments, go coin, and bit pay served as a way for businesses to get paid for transactions without having to go through numerous payment processes or even have a crypto wallet.These days, most businesses employ this payment option because it's quicker, less expensive, more secure, and also gives them a means to connect with their customers. The gateway providers provide a special address to which the cryptocurrency is deposited. The address recipient converts the cryptocurrency to the desired currency for the merchant. Next, this money is deposited into that person's bank account.",

One big advantage of open source is that anyone can review the code and make sure it's secure. Plus, when you host the payment gateway yourself, you have more control over how it works and can customize it to fit your needs. And the best part? Self-hosted payment gateways are more affordable in the long run, since you don't have to pay ongoing fees or transaction charges to a third-party service.",

Not only that, but businesses usually don't hold crypto. Their payment processors immediately converts it into fiat. If you run a business where you have certain costs (employer salaries, taxes, store rent, bills, etc.) you can't speculate what the future price of a volatile asset will be. 30 days in the future, your crypto could be worth 10% more or 10% less than what it was at the time you received it. You can't tell your employees and the taxman that you will pay them 10% less this month.Quote from: mk4 on March 03, 2023, 06:31:28 PMI'm assuming that the likes of BitPay are far easier to implement to your storefront compared to something like BTCPay. Yeah, and that's why people grab that convenience and easier set up process instead of greater security, better service and no fees. BTCPay Server being self-hosted requires the clients to do most of the work when setting it up. Bitpay is a few clicks and exchanged messages with their support.",

I think it's just the beloved third party. Merchants --and people generally-- want a third party to complain when something goes off track. It doesn't really matter if the third party will help them in the end; what matters is the feeling that you have a brother company seemingly willing to help. Both BTCPay and BitPay are roughly of the same difficulty to setup.",

So, imagine you are shopping online and you want to pay for your items with cryptocurrency. The merchant you are buying from needs a way to accept that payment and that is where the crypto payment gateway comes in. It is like a middleman between you and the merchant, making sure the payment goes through smoothly and securely, and converting the cryptocurrency into the merchant's preferred currency if necessary. Unlike a crypto gateway, which is primarily focused on accessing and interacting with cryptocurrencies, a crypto payment gateway is specifically designed to enable cryptocurrency payments for e-commerce and other types of transactions. As already mentioned above, payment gateways are usually provided by a third party, but in the case of cryptocurrencies, there are also open-source solutions available. These solutions allow merchants to build their own payment gateway systems, which can provide greater control over the payment process and reduce reliance on third-party providers.",
