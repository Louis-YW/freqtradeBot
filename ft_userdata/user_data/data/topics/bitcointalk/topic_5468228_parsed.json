      "body": "For countries where gambling is banned and the citizens are still using other means possible to get their way to the gambling platform and start their gambling activities, this is just a means of making the casino owners richer because when they are caught, their accounts are frozen, their assets are deposited, and winnings can be seized, and the user will be refused withdrawal. So those who choose to part are really doing themselves and taking a double risk, not their government. I don't think the reason why most countries ban gambling is because their citizens lack knowledge, but this is a result of their citizens being overly ignorant, or they are turning into addicts, or maybe the country just sees it as something bad that can't help their people; instead, it will lead them to lose their money, and they also see it as a means of promoting gangsterlism. Although having a gambling education might be a little helpful, as they will use that means to educate many on the things they need to know about gambling, how to deal with it, and how to have self-control,  those can only be taught; it's now left to the citizen to decide if they are to do it, take the advice, or do their own part.",

You said gambling is banned in a country. How will the country have gambling education? If you take a look at the countries that ban gambling, their religion ban it. Example of religion that ban gambling are Islamic and Buddhism and some other religions. If such religions are common in a nation and they have political power, gambling is banned. Will they be the one that will introduce gambling education? No.",

      "body": "Education on Sex is something necessary and it is all connected with our living. When it comes to gambling it is something that is connected with the materialistic life. There arises a question why can't a person live without having sex??? It is possible and the education is to give him the clarification on need of sex and how this has to be performed and the after effects if you go wrong.When it comes to gambling, there is no reason to give a description why gambling is required in life. If we were able to point a clear picture on it, then it is fair to add gambling education on syllabus. It is purely entertainment based and educating on gambling could serve as a reason for students to try gambling.Maybe it can be done as part of the moral class and it isn't necessary to be included in the school syllabus. Maybe at the university level it can be included, because in some part of the world children aren't much aware of gambling. Maybe educating things related to gambling could trigger them why don't we give a try.",

This is not a bad idea if there’s really a way to have an edge against casino. The problem is most gambling games is just based on luck while only few games that is skill based which typically very hard to master even with proper education.Banning the gambling in the country is still the best thing to do so that they can control the general public. Only few people keep gambling even with the restrictions and risk of freezing account while the majority is still avoiding it due to the law. I believe having few violators is still success compared with a general public that has a gambling problem that will affect the output of their economy due to the manpower problem.",

Engaging to sex is not prohibited ‘coz it is necessary to human race unlike with gambling which is not. But I do get the idea; teach gambling to avoid addiction and such but that’s not how it works as we all know. With your comparison between sex and gambling; both are addictive in many instances but with sex, there’s safe sex procedures and gambling does not. Once you are addicted into it, there’ll be no contraceptives to stop your losses (to quite relate what being taught with your chosen comparison). This is also why I think it won’t be possible to happen not to mention moral issues against gambling.Indeed not everyone has the discipline to control oneself especially when it comes to addiction but gambling is just different ‘coz you are prone to be consumed in all aspects; mental, emotional, and financial. Another issue is with taxation; why are lotteries legal to some countries where restriction in gambling exist? Not all platforms are registered to governments especially with web 3.0 which I think is another factor.",

Hmm gambling education, I don't know but something tells me this is completely a crazy idea because it's doesn't match up. Gambling is an habit that everyone who loves it do it and like the circle of life state not everything is actually handled the way it's supposed and that's the same case with gambling even if this so called gambling education is put in place, humans will still tend to break it because it's something they do at their own will.",

I think it's not right to compare it to sex education given that the primary point of sex education is not to avoid doing sex but to control it to a manner that they are in the proper mind and has a preparedness to do it. Gambling will not be taught to the extent that the government or school are expecting us to do it in the near future. Sex education is being taught so that we won't have a sexual problems in the future but teaching gambling to students will literally make a problem in the future. This is why no one really teach gambling in secondary level of education.",

I believe it's not about encouraging children to gamble, but rather educating them about the dangers of gambling. This could involve direct guidance from teachers to help children avoid gambling and provide an understanding of the potential risks associated with it.Sharing stories of individuals who have gone bankrupt due to gambling can also serve as a valuable lesson for children to steer clear of such activities. As these children mature into adulthood, their minds will naturally open, allowing them to make wiser decisions. It's possible that they may choose never to gamble at all, or if they do decide to engage in gambling at some point, they will do so as responsible adults, abiding by the law.",

And I don't think it would require an extensive syllabus either. For someone who understands basic statistics, it doesn't even take an entire course to understand the mathematics behind gambling.",

Although bypassing protocol to gaining access to the casino site is prohibited but one would have no option than to doing the needful  just to survive.Gambling education is good though but do you not think introducing it to the students would make them curious about the gambling and would want to put it into trial or practices. If they win, it becomes a problem taking a step backward because they have seen the rewards and deem it good for their liking so in that case it would be nice gambling education is done outside school.",

I think that education is very important when it comes to addictive or otherwise harmful things. A blank ban and demanding the people stay ignorant and avoidant of the subject is a one-way road towards a massive failure. And when that failure happens, there will be a lot of psychological and physical loss which could have been avoided, with mere education.Look at what a full sex ban does in certain countries: pregnant teenagers who get thrown out of the house. And why? Social stigma and bad education from both the school and the parents. Gambling risks need to be taught, at least as a one-time, half hour course.",
