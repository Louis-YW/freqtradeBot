Not like in my country where CZ itself visited, committed to some charity programs, and offered willingness for Binance to apply and comply with regulatory laws but was denied. My country stated that it will not accept new VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) applications in the next 3 years. A group is also actively calling to ban and imposed penalties on Binance. So it is either my country's government officials were paid by our current VASP providers or they believe that giving Binance a license might dominate the market that our current VASP providers are enjoying.",

I very much doubt whether the Government was really thinking of the citizen when they decided to go this new route in partnering with Binance. From a Similar topic over in the Bitcoin section linked below, I kinda agree with the different doubt about why the Nigerian Government is doing this, after all, we know what their stand is with cryptocurrency trading in the country and they are yet to announce a reversal of that law that prohibited crypto transactions through direct personal bank account and yet they want to partner with the Biggest Crypto Exchange.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412452.0",

If Nigerian government plants to dominate one day among the countries in Africa,  Nigeria might just be successful in doing so. The country will probably adopt crypto as well while they have CBDC. CBDC is sort of a back up in the region I guess if the crypto adoption will fail. Its an experimentation phase still but no other time so far in history where African countries are fighting back vocally the ones who suppressed their development, I guess they find more freedom in crypto.",

The move is for the sake of the Nigerians when it comes to crypto market.So it is now on the hands of their politicians if they will utilize it for good or not.Corruption is rampant in this country, so we can't do anything about it when politicians decide what to do with their income.But setting aside this thought, I believe, the initiative of binance is great. Reaching out to these people to offer their services and the chance to connect with all the other people in this world.",

Nigeria just ranked highest amongst the major influencers and users of Cryptocurrency in Africa and amongst other leaders,  this is after launching its digital currency, the e-naira. Sincerely, this adoption of Binance for trade or other cryptocurrencies at large will do greater good than evil. The Nigerian populace will have an expanded economic frontier in that the opportunities inbound with cryptos, such as elevation of poverty and unemployment, will help ease down on current economic, political, and religious sentiments ongoing. This establishment of an economic zone that is crypto-friendly with Binance, is with an open arm, a step in the right direction.",

We are not from Nigeria but we feel great about this news so how much more you guys that are from this country? I think that feeling is going to be superb. Not sure if this step is considered as a lift to the ban but I think this is just an alternative since they know that crypto is mostly ban on this country. They make a crypto friendly zone instead for the people that has an interest on crypto to go there and do all the crypto activities without having a fear of being restricted or anything.Let us hope that bitcoin will soon be unbanned again on this country and once it happens then I think many big names in the crypto field are going to do the same thing as binance.",
