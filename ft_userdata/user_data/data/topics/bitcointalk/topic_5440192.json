It literally wouldn't be the same without you!As some of you might know, Cryptios pledged to sponsor the event with a physical prize consisting in a special edition of the Open Mic Forum artwork. The original piece was commissioned by us from likehiro of Hard Fork Studio, which you might remember from his awesome entry in the 10th anniversary art contest.This thread serves as a reference and a way to present the print before contacting the winners to ask if they want to claim this prize. Thank you Fillippone for letting us showcase your print here.Click the image for high res.The Bitcointalk forum, as Bitcoin itself, is a very open place where each of us has a voice. the Open Mic Forum is a visual representation example of that statement.This edition is a limited run of at most 12 prints, one for each category of the BCA22 (a digital high res file is available if for privacy or whatever reason you decline the physical prize, it's fine, we understand!)DetailsGiclée fine art print on Hahnemuehle PhotoRag Bright White, 310 gsm.Size: 60cm/24'' wide, unframed.Due to the cost of these prints, we will print them based on confirmation from the winners.This item is not for sale, it is a 1 of 1 print for the winners of Bitcointalk Community Awards 2022. Another edition of this artwork will be available for purchase later + a surprize item.",

Then, AFAIK, your address and name aren't leaked to anyone but the company that will receive it and (re-)ship it to you.",

Yes, it does! Would love create and send you the Event of the Year print.I don't think anybody would claim Fail of the Year print, but this is  Bitcointalk after all Quote from: cygan on February 18, 2023, 08:17:09 AMa very nice idea you have with the bca22 fine print and gives us the opportunity to also secure this artwork.some questions i still have and that is, from which region is the artwork sent and would there be the possibility to order directly also a matching frame (i know, it is offered here an unframed version but you can ask ) and the whole fine art print then framed to send?It's sent from the EU. Framing is possible and we've worked with with a great framing service in the past. This of course will increase the shipping cost.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on February 18, 2023, 09:18:18 AMQuote from: ChiBitCTy on February 17, 2023, 04:55:36 PMNot sure if Event of the Year qualifies, but would be honored to have one of these.Can I donate the cost of printing/shipping my print to making one for ChiBitCTy instead?We're creating these on a confirmation basis, so if someone refuses (which is totally understandable!), there is no added cost to us. But we could consider that you donated yours to ChiBitCTy if it makes you happy",
