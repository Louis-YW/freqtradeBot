  "content": "Over the past few weeks, all cryptocurrency prices have gone through a new round of ups and downs. As always, the altcoin prices have followed Bitcoin price's fluctuation closely and as of today, all prices have dropped: Bitcoin price now is $27,000, ETH $1,700 , BNB $310 and other new altcoin like ARB at $1.14. I know that volatility like this is quite normal and for most long term crypto holders, this means no big deal. However, for those short-term players, they would definitely have sold a lot of them when they reached a relative high and if the prices continue to drop, they will probably buy a lot and wait for the next ATH. Too realistic, huh ? Yes. I have come to understand that no matter how you seem to be loyal to one particular cryptocurrency, as long as there seems to be a huge profit, you will sell to gain profit instead of holding a pipe dream. I have no judgement here and try to tell the truth. Personally, if I had that chance to cash for profits, I would do the same. What about you ?",

      "body": "The truth is that the more often you buy/sell, the less profit you make in the end. It has long been a well-known fact that speculators will never make as much profit as long-term holders can, so the more often you enter the market, the more risk you expose yourself to. The greater the risk, the more likely you are to make a mistake and lose money. In altcoins, making a mistake is easy, which is why many short-term strategies almost always end up in the negative yield zone.",

The problem with a lot of retailers is that they invested all their funds into crypto thinking it is a get-rich scheme but when the price goes south they panic and dump their tokens, if you have funds set aside to take care of your need for like a year or you have a job to take care of your immediate need, your decision making would be better instead of going in and out of the market everything. Bitcoin moved from $3k to $69k, this is what people see forgetting the price dumped several times during this move.",

Too realistic, huh ? It is due to the diverse nature of users in the market. Long Term Hodl and Cumulative Buy are experienced players and analyze conditions and believe in bitcoin and market cycles. Retailers often panic or take profits according to their plans. That is the reality of the market. Personally, I still believe in the long-term race ahead based on bitcoin's halving cycle and the looming macroeconomic downturn. Bitcoin may return to be the best path left for trust.If you trade commercially, sometimes you won't get big profits. If you think that bitcoin and crypto are the short-term path to profit and get rich quick - relying on traditional buying/selling, you are mistaken.",

What about you ?Number 1 rule of crypto investment, don't fall in love with the project, you are there to make money because you put money to support them and the return of been loyal investors is profits but by the time you become too comfortable, you will end up losing everything you have invested in the project. There are plenty of opportunties in crypto, there is no way staying in one project and been loyal for many years will do you good, as long as they are altcoin, the dump will come and when it does, you will regret why you never sold them earlier when the price was high.",

But when it comes to altcoins, you have different stories because most of them may or may not recover after the price will crash and the only thing you can do when that happened, is to sell the remaining altcoins so that you can still get some of your money because most of those people who wait for the price to recover, ended up regretting their decisions.",

Investment must be realistic otherwise you will only become a speculator and participate in pump and dump groups is the choice.
