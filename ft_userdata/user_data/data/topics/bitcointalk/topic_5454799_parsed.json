But if true, is it not surprising that CBN is thinking that creating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is like printing fiat, naira to be specific. I am still surprised to see this online.

Or am I not getting what is on the news correctly? Because I am surprised that an official from CBN can say something like that.Or is he right?",

I am suspecting that bloggers published the news on the national newspaper site. Well I don't know how of much of adoption was going on in this country when it comes to the private sector and crypto currency use but my own take on the crypto ban was as a result of the inability of the CBN to trace or track crypto transaction that was going on with the fiat banks and the high level of fraudulent activities it was used for during that period in the nation. I don't know, but thats my take on this whole issue.",

And he said they kicked out cryptocurrency because of the banking system in d country, if i may ask d banking system in ur country is it working since you people banned BTC and cryptocurrency from d country? D answer is no. I don't think, obiora have anything meaningful to tell ur business men in Nigeria, because many countries in d world are using dis cryptocurrency to eliminate inflation for deflation to take over in their land.",

It may not be a fake news because sometimes you will discover that the government are taking some actions and decisions they couldn't explain to themselves as to why? We cant blame them sometimes because they have the power and it tussles alot especially when in the place of authorities,if they banned cryptocurrency we will still be engaged with bitcoin, what i expects from them is to allow the banks continue with the transaction of bitcoin and disabled any other cryptocurrencies to be performed by thier banks except for exchanges and at our own risk.",

I just wish to see likebtwo more prominent countries join in bitcoin adoption as a legal tender just to unveil others eyes to believe and adopt bitcoin as well, the fear the government have is the threat bitcoin could serve them because they were unable to make law or regulate it, then what has it profit them when they are not milking revenue from bitcoin because it's decentralized than for them to attack the network.",

The only known means they have to curtail inflation is to print more money and printing more money will in the long run push the country on a very bigger inflation and recession. That was exactly what played out, because the Nigerian government and the Central Bank wanted to print more money as it seems to be the only way to solve the inflation problem. Since what they know is only to print money, they equally thought that cryptocurrency is something you can print unlimited and maybe get rich overnight without any kind of regulation.",

But if true, is it not surprising that CBN is thinking that creating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is like printing fiat, naira to be specific. Let overlook the legitimacy of the news wether or not is fake or not,  but let discuss the topics as regards CBN's reaction to cryptocurrency within the Nigeria economy and the financial system,  the truth of the matter is that,  the rise of cryptocurrency has weakened the straight of fiat currency and even the strongest can't currency is affected by this and the US dollar have suffered a lot of value lost as against bitcoin and the naira was worst hit since it own value against the dollar is already weakening and the inflation rate in Nigeria is already high. What I think with the CBN stand as regards cryptocurrencies is that the CBN governor now suspended lacks the basic understanding of currency development, value and calculations,  and this can be seen in his policy initiatives,  first instead banning the bank from banks vs crypto transactions,  what he should have initiated is for a policy framework that seeks to protect the Nigeria investors and users of cryptocurrencies within Nigeria and also make for ways to get the tax,  I know this may be hard to achieve most especially with decentralized coins like bitcoin which is not possible to be regulated but the governor shouldn't have kicked against bitcoin advantages individual level and seeking for it ban only to be replaced with a failed projects call e-naira.",
