  "content": "Feel free to add a technique you were able to discover and let everyone aware to avoid being scammed. When you add yours, I encourage to share a little bit of the background of how you discovered it.My whole campaign management business runs in Telegram and Bitcointalk PM and it's very easy for me to get trapped by the scammers. It requires me to stay alert always. But scammers try their everything to take their unethical share. They don't just try to fool me but they try to fool my clients too.Other day Sinbad Management was telling me:QuoteI think someone is trying to scam me with supposedly your accountMy response was as usual, that's not me. Sinbad management is smart enough to understand the environment too. We both were aware so no harm happened but if one of us was not good enough to realize the attempt then there could be some financial loss.Later the same guys (I don't think it could be anyone else, because both happened in the same day in a difference of few hours) PMed me pretending he is Sinbad. He failed though however it took me half an hour to understand the trick.Let me share two screenshots (real username removed and conversation with real Sinbad also removed).1. Original Sinbad 2. Fake SinbadÂ  The thing that struggled me to find both username were the same. I checked letter by letter, both same. Nothing was there to differentiate the two accounts by username. But I knew there were something that I was missing and I did not give up until I found it.When I was clicking on the original Sinbad username it was copying in the clipboard but when I was clicking on the fake Sinbad username it was showing the Sinbad profile and SEND MESSAGE link was taking me to original Sinbad chat (I was lost there and started to think Telegram have this error and the fake one is the real guy).What the scammer did is:Check image 1 and 2. The scammer updated his bio with the same exact letters and symbol that Sinbad username has in Telegram. By default Telegram set your bio information in the same place where they display your username if you do not set up a username. The scammer discovered this little trick and utilized it with hope to scam either me or the Sinbad management.Next time when you are receiving message then check twice. Under the username what does it say: Username or Bio?Version used: Telegram Desktop",

      "body": "I think the thing that could help people from getting scammed is your privacy settings:1. Don't allow anyone to add you to groups/channels except for your own contacts, or nobody at all. I have been in real groups before, only to get added later to another one that looks exactly the same as the first one (with the same picture, and almost the same number of subscribers).2. If possible, don't set a username. AFAIK, if you don't have one set, no one can message you.I would also imagine that scammers don't want to spend any money, so maybe an animated avatar + custom emoji using Telegram Premium would help you protect the users of your channel to a certain degree.",

If I am not wrong, one member was affected by this scam attempt. Telegram should forbid writing another telegram handle in the bio. People are getting fooled because of this. The first thing that should be noticed is that you will see the account is not in your contact. The 2nd thing is you have to check why there are no old messages. If they have cleared, why did they have to? If you see new messages, double-check the handle.",

Royse777, whenever you come across such accounts trying to scam you, I advise you to report for unsolicited PM spam and also scam.You can also encourage your business partners to report the accounts. Telegram will block them from sending messages after a few reports. I have also seen cases where telegram leaves a banner near the username of an account showing the word \"SCAM\" though I don't know the required threshold of reports before they decide to label it scam.",

I am afraid there is no other way than to pay close attention to the username and Bio field whenever we receive a message as a new chat.Reporting those scammers has no use because they will simply come up with new accounts and repeat the same thing again and again so reporting imposters is just a waste of our time.",

That's why it is not just for the ICO projects, exchanges, airdrops, etc. But also you guys, Royse, they're targeted by these scammers knowing that you guys are popular in the forum and now a public figure. They're going to try any tactic that they can to at least fool someone using your publicity and identity. I think Telegram should do better and when there's a duplicate @ for each user, they shouldn't allow that to be put in the bio of a new person that tries to copy details of the orig identities.Nice catch Royse but still be careful and the same goes to the other popular managers out there.",

Another common scamming technique that is aimed at telegram admins is when scammers pretend to be employer of the said admin, asking him for quick loan that he will later return. Years ago I was TG admin for some shitcoin and \"CEOs\" contacted me, asking me for some money as they needed it asap and they would return it to me in a few hours. What they obviously forgot (or hoped that I will forget) is that I already had the chat with the CEO so it was easy to realize that those are not the real accounts (beside obviously not having the same username).Another trick that scammers use is when they pretend to be someone who has small \"L\" or capital \"I\" in their username as those letters look very similar on Telegram.",

Well, I am not a person who needs TG for business things because here in my country TG is banned, so we have to use proxies at first hand, and most of the people are not using TG. I, as a freelancer, was told to deal with a lot of agencies on TG, but my experience was bad with them as they want work to be submitted first, then the amount will be sent to me.And in my field, I have seen such cases a lot, and I knew this was just scammers trying hard to trick me into doing their work for free. So, I have other ways to contact my clients, and TG is not one of them.But thanks for sharing this useful piece of information, as it really adds a lot to the knowledge base.",

There could be a few things I'm thinking that you can do to keep your clients informed which has been mentioned but I'll try to merge them and as well as the members in your channel.- Make a bot that consistently posts a reminder on what's your official account and to beware of your impostors.- Hire someone if you still haven't it or a couple of people to monitor the influx of your new members in a daily basis since it's easy to change names and that's what they're doing against you.- Lastly, avail the telegram premium or what it is to give you the blue badge as the official you.I know you'll win over these impostors and scammers that are riding on your popularity as a manager these days.",
