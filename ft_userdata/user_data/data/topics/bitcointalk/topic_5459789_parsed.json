What percentage of weekly income do you think is right for gambling?If I'm not mistaken, this year there has already been such (or just a similar) topic and the majority agreed that 5-10% of spending from the total budget is normal (provided that the rest of the funds are enough for ordinary life without a financial deficit).On my own behalf, I would add that the normality of the percentage that is spent on gambling depends on the size of the budget - if we are talking about millionaires, then even 50% can be normal. Someone being rich spends millions on yachts or something like that, but someone on gambling. This is a matter of personal choice.",

This is not a problem if you gamble once a week and keep a weekly gambling budget limit and if you can afford to lose this money. Good luck to you.  But keep one thing in mind that gradually do not sink into the deep addiction of gambling",

Good luck to you.  But keep one thing in mind that gradually do not sink into the deep addiction of gamblingYou did not get me correctly. I did not say that I am making profit every week from gambling, what I meant is that if I win, I will not put next week 5% on gambling, it will be on my wallet or bank account, and that I would withdraw my profit for that week. But not that I win all weeks. That is not possible. I may lose all the 5% or I may lose part of it, which means I have to deposit another 5% the following week, or to deposit more to make it 5% in total. Gambling is not for profit making.",

However, I understand that everyone's financial situation and attitude towards gambling and risk-taking may be different. What might be reasonable for one person may not be for another. In any case, we should all be aware of our financial circumstances and limitations.",

If you receive money weekly, the percentage of that money that you do not need for any expenses or budget can be used in gambling. I do not think a fixed percentage should be adopted, because some weeks or months depending on how you earn, you will need more money than some other weeks for some other important expenses that will come up and will need attending to. At the end, the percentage you use for gambling should not exceed a certain amount.",

What percentage of weekly income do you think is right for gambling?Well honestly I have not been ever thinking about this but usually my weekly income without signature which is my payroll is about 500 dollars and I only play like 30-50 dollars or max 100 dollars,this 100 dollars happens very rarely so my percentage is like 7-20% with average being about 10% and I don't think this is high,is something I can afford to lose,as otherwise I would spend this money to get to the movies or buying a new online course,of course online courses teach you things but they never give you the adrenaline you have while gambling so for me that percentage spent in gambling is money well spent.",

That's why whether it is 5% and you afford to lose that amount then in your own term, that's good.What you're doing is a good strategy and if that works for you perfectly, you just have to keep working on it. Some may afford to lose 10%-20% of their income. And I even saw a few from us here that can gamble their entire week profit to gamble and they afford to lose it.",

What percentage of weekly income do you think is right for gambling?Instead of being greedy and spending a large portion of your income or all of your cash to gamble and putting all of your faith in it to multiply your income, it is a very good idea to develop the habit of spending a certain amount of your weekly income on gambling. People who gamble a larger percentage of their weekly income typically have other sources of income that they can fall back on if things don't work out. Though i have taken a break currently from gambling but i plan to spend 7% of my income on gambling because since I started earning on the forum i have not really participated in any gambling activities. Maybe when i have another source of income i may increase the percentage i take into gambling.

He also always tries to set boundaries; if he was unable to gamble one week, he would transfer the money to the following week's budget.",

In any case, we should all be aware of our financial circumstances and limitations.It is in percentage, not amount. In trading and gambling that are very risky, percentage is used to know someone's threshold in amount of money to be used to gamble. The money should be small in percentage to the extent that if the person lose the amount, there will not be any problem. 5 to 6% is good but I prefer 5% or less. Sometimes I go for less percentage like 2%, but I go most for 5%.Quote from: Solosanz on July 14, 2023, 12:24:28 PMI don't think you should use appropriate term when it's come to each gambler opinion, someone can say less than 2% is appropriate, someone can say less than 30% is appropriate, or someone can say as long as it will not harm his life, gamble all the money is appropriate because you only live once.Anyone that choose gamble all the money is appropriate is only encouraging addiction because it is very inappropriate and anyone that think like that does not like himself or herself.",

What percentage of weekly income do you think is right for gambling?12% for me is already high but if you have other sources of income or business that can sustain your family's needs then it's justifiable, higher than 30% can be considered risky gambling and you are considered addicted to gambling, and there are people who do this, they work to satisfy their gambling addiction.",

Usually, it's just depositing around $10-$20 into my gambling account, and it's enough to stay there for a week or even up to 3 weeks I never spend the money I deposit into gambling accounts because I don't have a large fund set up for gambling and only the money I can afford. Perhaps, other people have bigger percentage limits than I do, and I understand because it's an amount they can afford, and everyone who often gambles will use the money they can afford to gamble.",

My wife has no comment on my gambling this way since I’m not spending money that should be allocated for my family.I think the percentage is very subjective. For me, Only the money that I consider as disposable no matter what is the size is what can I afford to gamble.",

There's no right or wrong on how much you can give onto gambling it depends on your level of perception if you're ready to lose it or not since that weigh more compare to what we can actually win.

Because when you say percentage it will be adjustable and you can lose more depending on the allocation. So I think make it as an exact number so that it would not be a problem soon. You will be more disciplined if you have exact number rather than thinking like oh i am not yet at my limit percentage something like that.",
