They are the ones who caused the loss of American life by bringing down the Twin Towers.If Trump gets in as the President, he will bring down the perpetrators... the evil dark/deep state people.Welcome to the 2022 9/11 Truth Film Festival! Quote from: https://richardgage911.org/9-11-truth-film-festival-september-11-2022/A Fundraiser for the film series 9/11: Crime Scene to CourtroomWe are focusing on 2 important people in this film festival.The most important could be called the the grandfather of the 9/11 Truth Movement, our own David Ray Griffin who has recently provided a statement to us, his friends in the 9/11 Truth Movement, regarding his rapidly declining health. Please keep David in your prayers as we celebrate him with a few videos from the numerous excellent works with which he has inspired all of us. Elizabeth Woodworth will be with us to highlight his key writings.On the other side of the tracks we have Osama Bin Ladin – our other major area of focus for the film festival. He is the most complex character in this drama, and we have none other than James Corbett, the filmmaker of the 3-part documentary, \"False Flags: The Secret History of Al Qaeda\" to hone in on and reveal the most pertinent act of this multi-act player in Part 3. James will be premiering his latest documentary work, right here at our Film Festival....",

We will never know, I think, but it is wrong that something like this happened. All the people should never have gone like that, no matter in which country. From negative usually arises even more negative and small children know that. The problem may be greed?",

All the countries they invaded with the aim of fighting terrorism are currently going through greater security challenges. Libya, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq are all suffering from the effects of the so-called war against terrorism. Nigeria is gradually becoming a terrorist hub where they carry out their terrorist activities without any stiff opposition. Yet funds that have been marked to buy weapons a siphoned by corrupt government officials and kept in European and American banks or used to buy choice properties. Thereby giving these terrorists the impetus to keep on carrying out their criminal activities. Instead of waiting till they become a threat to the world, these developed nations should assist these nations to counter terrorism and help curb corruption and money laundering.   Notwithstanding, we remember these innocent citizens that lost their lives in the 9/11 terrorist attack and we also acknowledge the sacrifices of many selfless servicemen that died in the cause of saving lives. We remember all those that have also died as a direct or indirect result of terrorist activities around the world.",

      "body": "Respect for what happened...  However, from a financial point of view (this is a finance related website) the most astonishing thing about this event to me is that 20 years later we're still trying to normalize rates and stabilize the economy and failing horribly at it.  The effects of Greenspan's lowering of the overnight bank rate in the aftermath of this tragedy are still being digested.  The housing market boom and bust that nearly destroyed out country, then the massive inflation as a result of cheap money to try and fix Greenspan's overreaction, and now the housing market boom and bust part two, where they hope the massive inflation wave will help for a soft landing...  I'm not sure most people realize this is actually the third housing boom bust (I didn't mention the one in 2003) as a result of post 9/11 interest rates.  If they get it wrong this time (seems likely, although they're failing in all new ways this time) we could still be dealing with this in another 10-20 years...Looking back, you have to wonder how much better off we all would have been if Greenspan hadn't overreacted.",
