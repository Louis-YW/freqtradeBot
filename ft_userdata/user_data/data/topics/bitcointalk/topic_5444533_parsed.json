But in gambling, the high risk does not always mean big wins, especially if you don't have an analysis that says your bet can win or you don't have high skills in playing gambling. We have often seen many people who use a lot of money to gamble but it turns out they lose because of a lack of experience, analysis, or other things but what is clear is that they are not lucky.And if they want to recover from previous losses, it won't be easy because you will experience several defeats before getting a big win. But those big wins are no bigger than your previous losses. So you better not gamble with an amount of money you can't afford to prevent losing a lot.",

But in gambling, the high risk does not always mean big wins, Many gamblers forget this fact: with high risk, the chances of getting a loss also increase. More is the risk involved, more will be the payout for that bet, and a huge amount of risk will also be involved for that specific bet. But sometimes some people are lucky in that they are able to hit big and make it to the high rollers list, but before that, the number of times they would have made loss bets is uncountable. Moreover, I have often seen that these types of bets are always made by players with large bankrolls. So for them betting 1000$ with 5% chance is nothing.   They just auto-bet sometimes, and when they hit a big amount, they just recover all the lost funds. It’s absolutely correct that high risk and big wins are always partners.",

If anyone can risk higher amount then winning amount will be too high at the same time if the odd is too high then winning amount also will be high.",

      "body": "Depends on your style. I mostly like to play a lot of stuff in my sessions back then so I often spend low amounts on each bet instead of going big (though I have bet big a few times) so that I can extend the time I can play. As for trying to win back, well, if possible I'd want to but in general, it doesn't really matter to me. I'd only ever say a bet can win \"big\" if they were to bet low but due to the odds, were able to receive a pretty sizeable amount of winnings. If chances were 50/50 (or somewhere pretty close), then a bet of $100 vs a bet of $1000 wouldn't really win big since the chances of losing big are also the same.",

There are many gamblers who gamble with small amounts and subsequently lose that is why some gamblers who are interested in big wins and know that big wins usually involve taking big risks. Basically a gambler's financial status depends on his risk taking style. If the risk can be taken with good analysis then there will be big gain opportunities as well as risk. But in my perspective that should not be taken consistently.",

I do not recommend high risk games unless the analysis has been done perfectly to know that there is high chance that you can win it.Quote from: michellee on March 12, 2023, 02:31:45 AMYes, that's true.

But those big wins are no bigger than your previous losses. So you better not gamble with an amount of money you can't afford to prevent losing a lot.Most of the time, it means big losses. If you make analyses, you will prefer to go for low risk matches unless you sometimes just use very low amount of money on a high risk game which you think you can win, but this type of games are not common but can happen like that sometimes. The time of trying to recover from losses is the time gamblers are most prone to more losses, not even advisable for gamblers to chase losses. If they lose, they should stop gambling for that day or even not gambling for 1 week is better.Quote from: Mr. Magkaisa on March 12, 2023, 06:26:17 AM  -   It does not mean that we bet a large amount and we will win a large amount, that is not the concept or system of gambling.

I think that the strategy of moderate risks in the beginning is good, and then to allow yourself to take higher risks in gambling with the profits from these moderate risks profits (if there are profits of course).If from the beginning you only play and bet money you are willing to lose, a bit like with cryptos the famous \"only buy what you can afford to lose\", limiting the risks at the beginning could allow you to have more chances to win profit, and thus increase the \"free\" amount you can then gamble on high risk / high potential reward.After, we all have our own notion of risks, and some will prefer a multitude of small rewards while others (like me) prefer to lose everything but have life changing amount in case of lucky day",

I only care about the expected value of an individual bet. If the odds are reasonable, then it's a sensible bet to make. Casino games are all negative EV and there shouldn't be any expectation to win, but for my own preferences I aim to play games with the lowest house edge. Individual wagers set aside, at least I mathematically know what the risks are instead of convincing myself of an unattainable large win that has astronomical odds.Bet small with better odds.
