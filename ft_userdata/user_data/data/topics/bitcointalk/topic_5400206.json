If it is a BIP39 mnemonic then all you have to do is to try to guess some of the letters and then go through the word-list that is available here[1] to find out what those words are.For example the middle word on first line seems to end in \"uid\" and the closest word in the list is \"liquid\".[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt",

I believe that isn't a key phrase, it could be a note that a doctor grandpa dropped  ,  perhaps any kind of code you could understand. Trying to decipher the text is difficult because the writing is very much ineligible and also the camera used in taking the picture is not sharp, these two factors made it impossible to understand the whole text.I am just able to decipher four words, which  are; Candle, Liquid, Tea and Load. There is a word looking like PAVA or PANA, the Uf2 and the last word looking like a signatory.",

You should know that, you must have 12-word secret recovery phrase for import any cryptocurrency wallet. But I can see only seven words in your picture. You can never recover a wallet with only seven words even if it is correct. It will only be tried in vain",

But No recovery face will work less than 12 words. That's it I meant.  Here OP has shown only seven words. Which will not work in any way. I think that now.  Here OP is a newbie is and he/she just made 3 post including this one. OP just playing or jocking with us he he",

Since it was a way older image, it's probably a low-quality cam and awful lighting that caused that shitty photo you have. Anyway, I think that something is missing from your image.

If seen, your wallet would be compromised, your coin would be stolen. Your seed phrase and private key must remain only known by you.Is it up to 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words? If so, you can do as pooya87 posted up there. That link consists of all the words existing in BIP39 seed phrase words. If it does not work, you can try it also on Electrum wallet, maybe it is Electrum seed phrase. The word shown on your image did not look like seed phrase though.",
