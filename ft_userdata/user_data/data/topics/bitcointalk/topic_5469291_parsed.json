I read online it depends how much income I make but is that from my own job outside of crypto or do they mean income made purely from crypto? I know we have plenty of time still until the bull run but just want to be clear in my mind so when it comes to it I understand how and when to pay tax.",

I thought that this forum couldn't have two jerry's, but you are the obvious proof that this is not the case. You've already asked the same thing several times, so I wonder how hard it is to look at your own post history and read all the answers you've already received?Cashing out fiat in UK?

      "body": "You have to pay taxes AKA capital gain Taxes (CGT) which are comprised of crypto profits and the income you earn from an outside job (other than crypto). Now, how much tax you have to pay depends on your taxpayer level, I mean for basic you have to pay 10% and for higher you have to pay 20% CGT tax. The calculations are easy but first, you need to relax. I am shocked to see how many topics you have created in this same discussion. I know sometimes, people become skeptical but, if you do not trust others or members of this forum then DYOR. Well, in short, if you are a basic taxpayer then according to the formula you have to pay £9,000 tax on your £90,000 profit.",

As you have said, you have received different opinions and from the looks of it, you are still doubting what to do. doing taxes can be complicated, though it doesn't hurt to ask the community but if you doubt what is being said to you or are still unsure what to do after everything that has been said or explainedl to you, it would best to just hire or consult an accountant.",

I'm still not sure what kind of support/help you are looking for, as a fellow above said consider hiring a consultant, Can you mention the options you've got to clarify the whole context, so in this way, you might get a better suggestion as you'll be able to get rid of all these recurrent questions.Enjoy   also, stick to the tips, don't create redundant topics frequently.",
