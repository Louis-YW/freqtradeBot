So far I had no problems with it except for some lags on its UI but I am not yet claiming that it is their fault. Probably it has something to do with my internet connection. But I got used to it. But I am hoping that it will be more efficient as its development continues. But to somehow share other gambling sites that I have ran ito before; one is Primedice, others are  Roobet, Duelbits and more. Been gambling more than 3 years by the way. I am moving from one site to other platforms depending on my mood; but most of the time, it is based on what I am enjoying to play.",

Also there's an interesting promotion based on where you live, if you live in Asian countries there's many promotion in this site.I think the other casino that has an outstanding customer service is Roobet, Freebitco, Fortunejack, Duelbits, and Rollbit. As long as you're not did anything wrong, the customer service wouldn't refuse to answer your question or attacking you.",

Having good ccustomer support is one of the qualities a good gambling site should have, you can try livecasino.io, you will not be disappointed. I have preferred most of the time to just go with sport and I use Stake.com for that, I like their services too.As we are on this forum, there are many gambling site that will want to offer you good support, if they do not solve your problem, you can bring it up on this forum which would be a better way for them to respond to you in a way the public can also see. There are many issue that have been solved this way. Which means the gambling site activeness on this forum alone can help when you need help from the gambling site. But we should not leave the fact that some people do violate gambling site rules and still expecting something good.",

If the team decided not process your request, then a player should also know that is above his power.QuoteDo you think support should not attack the personality of the player and concentrate on the issue?Do you think casino management should get support with backgrounds in human relations and psychology to understand the action and behavior of the complainants and address it in a proper way?Do you think support can make or break the casino's reputation?Give me at least two or three casinos with outstanding support, that you wish other casinos should emulate. Being customer support for any company is a job that requires some level of patience and tolerance, it is their responsibility to satisfy the customer and make sure any complaint is brought to the help desk when there is any, the reaction or words of players shouldn't upset the customer care but as I have said we all human and any rude player can go over bad and it is not all supports will take some sh!t. Also, I don't think support can break a casino because most of the time, they are usually more than one person that often does the shifting as a customer support job.",

I get irritated when I go to ask something to the support of some site because I already know that there in support I will get an answer that looks like a robot wrote itQuote from: coin-investor on November 22, 2022, 06:25:54 AMDo you think casino management should get support with backgrounds in human relations and psychology to understand the action and behavior of the complainants and address it in a proper way?yes and I will add that casinos need to hire people who understand about casinos, people who are knowledgeable in programming and people who are knowledgeable in various common problems that a casino has and that is why I think that the owner of the casino should do a little course for all workers to be equipped with knowledge about the casino, and they should give some monthly bonus to the best support employee, if they do this every month, then we will see good support employees, because people always work well when they are motivatedQuote from: coin-investor on November 22, 2022, 06:25:54 AMDo you think support can make or break the casino's reputation?no, the support does not break the reputation of the casino, the casino breaks the reputation when it does not pay people, even if the support serves the customers badly, when some time passes and the problem gets worse then the reputation of the casino gets badQuote from: coin-investor on November 22, 2022, 06:25:54 AMGive me at least two or three casinos with outstanding support, that you wish other casinos should emulate. I only use stake.com and I'm very happy with their support",

As far as I know, they have an active thread here in the forum to address the problems and offer resolutions. Although there are certain instances wherein they weren't able to satisfy their players in the resolution provided. I guess there are really some circumstances such as that casino websites encounter. There are many other websites you can look up to that offer great quality of service and support. You just have to make a research to know which is which and to verify the suggestions you'll get here in the thread.",

This is a must. Casino support should focus on the problem first rather than making a problem the cause of the player. Unless there is strong evidence coming from the player, in the end it must be returned to the player.2. The support team is to support users and solve problems. A good company will have good support team for its customers/users. So management must instill this in their support team.3. Of course the support team will create a bad reputation for the company/casino. Because support is a party that deals directly with customers and if the customer is not satisfied with the support service, i believe company/casino will get a bad rating from users.",

The casino management is nothing but the most crucial aspect on the lifespan of an online gambling website. A proper functioning casino has at least a consistent customer support service that can inquire and inform you in case you encounter any issues playing (e.g. payment issues, bugs, etc.). Like what most casino support system that should have, they should not attack the personality of the player. Remember, this is a service industry where you should focus on the issue at hand. Without a proper customer support system, this can actually make/break the lifespan of a casino as they will definitely lose their trust among its players.",

I can't name a single casino with good support since I didn't need to contact them. But in general, I understand where problematic communication comes from - usually 90% of questions from users (this applies not only to casinos, but to all services) arise due to user errors and often these users are aggressive (and in the case of a casino, they are often scammers). This does not excuse the support team if they were unfair to you of course.And of course, the answer to all your questions is Yes. This is obvious and does not require proof.",
