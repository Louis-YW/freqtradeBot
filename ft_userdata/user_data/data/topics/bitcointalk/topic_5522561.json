  "content": "I was having an argument with my colleagues earlier about the possibility of Bitcoin surpassing Gold?Â Gold has been dominating the economy and markets for thousands of years as a means of exchange and holding wealth(even generational wealth). On the contrary, Bitcoin(which is now called digital gold) was launched in 2009 and has achieved widespread adoption and success. It has been growing rapidly ever since. Â I am not against hodling or buying bitcoin, infact i am an advocate for hodling bitcoin for the next couple of years because itâ€™s certain there will be a hugeÂ  increase in priceÂ  to about $200,000 or higher in the future. But Gold is widely utilized compared to Bitcoin. Gold is also stable even though its price may fluctuate due to geopolitical factors and economic events whereas Bitcoin can be highly volatile. Â  Gold can be more reliable, this has been proven over and over. In this digital era, Bitcoin has accessibility, portability, divisibilty advantages over Gold. Which team do you fall into Digital Gold or Traditional Gold?",

      "body": "There is a long way if bitcoin is to overtake gold in terms of market cap. But let's not forget that never generations and their investors will probably see more value in bitcoin than in gold. Things may change in a future when we are no longer here.Gold's market cap is over $18 trillion. Bitcoin's is around $2 trillion. Bitcoin would have to be worth around $1 million per coin to surpass gold. That's ten times its current value. We have already seen such predictions being made for the year 2050 or something like that. Usually when I am pessimistic about something, it happens. So I will be a pessimist and say that bitcoin won't overtake gold.",

I remember when I checked gold marketcap 3 years ago, it was $11 trillion but now $18.4 trillion. Gold marketcap is really increasing. Even as bitcoin added more in price than gold, gold added more in marketcap far more than bitcoin.",

Gold is being manipulated with paper and new deposits are found regularly. If it doesnâ€™t happen next year, it will happen in 2029.",

Because gold is not always used for extraordinary gains. It's mostly used for capital protection. It's not volatile as Bitcoin so Gold is always a preferred option in my portfolio. Bitcoin has a real long way to go before it can overtake gold's market cap. Considering Bitcoin's limited supply, it may be impossible as well. Let's not divide between gold and Bitcoin. Rather let's enjoy both assets.",

Yeah Bitcoin has the potential to surpass Bitcoin and like said Potential But just Potential wouldn't cut it. I trust in the failings of Fiat and this would increase the likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing Gold in the shortest time.",

But if we do the polls, we will see that the demand for bitcoin is not as big as we think and will not be enough to compare with gold, an asset that has been around for thousands of years and is in demand worldwide . Like in my area most people have heard and know about bitcoin but when I ask them if they want to invest or have invested in bitcoin they all seem hesitant and not ready. So expecting bitcoin to outperform gold in this bull cycle or the next is just hype and somewhat biased prediction.",

      "body": "Discussions like this have been stirred up multiple times here on this forum and the fact is people will still drop the same answers and owning to the rate at which bitcoin has grown in price over this short period of time, more people will definitely go for bitcoin order than gold. If you should compare both of them, bitcoin has the highest growth in both price and adoption over the last decade and is still topping the charts currently.There are many reasons why most people will go for bitcoin over gold and one of them is volatility. Bitcoin is far more volatile than gold and that's why it can create a huge price gap over a short period of time. Another thing is accessibility and storage, bitcoin is easier to get and also easier to store compared to gold that is high it weight and difficult to conceal or move around.",

That number may have changed.It is reasonable if Gold as an asset with that capitalization is compared to Bitcoin which is very far from Gold when Bitcoin was created. We must admit that Bitcoin is an asset that is in the top 10 with a limited amount.The potential for Bitcoin to rise in rank leaving the assets above it has a high possibility of happening if several influential countries in the world continue to realize the importance of Bitcoin.You know which side I am on.",
