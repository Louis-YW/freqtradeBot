It is probably a matter of time before the door to cryptocurrencies will be completely opened there, and considering the size of the porn market, it will be a significant step for everyone. Maybe something similar exists, but I'm not in it enough to know.

Most of them are people who can and are willing to pay something online.

As far as I have noticed, they have done much less damage to Bitcoin than various investment platforms, which put the shady \"pyramid scheme\" sticker on the crypto world.In conclusion, we definitely cannot limit who will use Bitcoin, certainly not if we consider it the future global currency. Limiting Bitcoin only to \"nice\" people seems to me to be completely opposite to the story of financial freedom.",

Very good view and there is a lot of truth what you write. Pornography is legal/normal in many countries. If we look to America, it is the strongest nation with VR-Pornography. There are big film producers in the \"normal\" world who are also dealing with it and increasing their business. So they are not a part of it, because they won an Oscar, but no one knows they make other movies? But there are people who dont see it that way. Often by sexually frustrated men or women, but this is not always the case.Pornography (Sex) is not perverse if both partners want it. So simple, there is nothing wrong with it. Revolutionary we want to have sex, men and also woman. Very much happens in the background, many do not want to share their preferences with everyone and that is okay. And who not like to have sex with a beautiful woman or man? I have seen over and over again in the many years how people behave discreetly. Thats why I understand that people write to me private and that I never show them publicly.",

      "body": "@examplensMaybe my post was a bit superficial and one can get an wrong impression because my post is not very elaborated, so a short explanation: Everyone can do in private what they want and it's not my business to interfere in this, even if they are really disgusting pervs, which is still a big shame, but my post is more about public appearance and that's also where it's getting tricky. While everyone can do in private, what they like, it's quite different in public, for example the worst pervs tend to spread their disgusting content everywhere and that's where it's starting to interfere with other people's rights. Just because a few pervs are disgusting and weird in private, it does not mean, everyone has to suffer from their actions. When they start to litter the forum (for example) with huge loads of disgusting perv stuff and attract more pervs, it will get very worrisome for everyone else. Because real pervs only stop, if we show them the red card. And even then, it might be too late already. That's why we should think very carefully, what we are doing. If we normalize, what OP is doing, it might backfire very quickly and very hard. Luckily, the forum is currently safe from most pervs, I don't believe it's worthwile to risk this position, especially since OP is pushing this stuff to line up his bags.

QuoteAnd we don't need crypto linked to such a bunch of shady actors, where potentially many abusers are involved.I would like to see any segment of society where abusers are completely excluded. There's no section where's no abuse. But the important thing is to keep the abuse at bay. Im Bitcointalk, we have scammers, spammers and shitposters as well, that's why the community is required to keep them at bay.

Any chance to share more about the ongoing scandal which you mention?Germany has quite some problems in that sector because some people like to play it down and I would not be surprised if these people are directly or indirectly involved in this perv stuff as well, at least financially. The perv scandal is really huge and it is extremely disgusting because everything happened, what pro pornography advocates always denied. There have been clear red flags before but pro pornography advocates played it down and mocked everyone, who brought it up - disgusting. It's a huge network of abuse, where employees got tricked systematically into getting abused, they were forced to keep quiet and the abusers even mocked them - until the scandal got too big to ignore, blow up and the pervs got exposed in addition to the whole pervs defending them. Right now, the only people still defending this, are our German fascists and the pervs itself.  The pervs seem to be busted but even yet, they are trying to sue the employees for speaking up.  I'm not sure if the abusers will find any lawyers for this disgusting move but mabye there are some perv lawyers in Germany as well.  Quote from: examplens on June 09, 2023, 11:02:38 AMQuoteThe forum has been very lucky so far, that there are not many pervs and I prefer it, if this stays like that. I guess you don't expect the invasion of these perverts on the forum, where all of a sudden they will exclusively present some sick and perverted suggestions here?How can we even be sure that some of them are already among us on this forum?Because it's not an issue right now. We can browse Bitcointalk easily and here's no issue of perv stuff. There have been a few incidents of promoting pornography in the past but the community is doing a good job to keep pervs ar bay. And yes, I don't expect an invasion but we should avoid taking it too easy because it can always happen, that a huge bunch of these morons will show up here and start their shady business, where everyone will be bothered unnecessarily.  There's a big danger, that these pervs will be encouraged to spread their weird and disgusting content everywhere here on the forum and there's a big danger that more perv scandals will happen if we don't discourage it, it's almost inevitable. Because like OP, all the pervs will feel emboldened. That's a very big issue if there's no pushback against them.  Quote from: examplens on June 09, 2023, 11:02:38 AMAs far as I have noticed, they have done much less damage to Bitcoin than various investment platforms, which put the shady \"pyramid scheme\" sticker on the crypto world.There are various abusers and I'm not a friend of shitcoin fraud, too. In my opinion, we should always try to minimize damage by shady actors by community efforts. Quote from: examplens on June 09, 2023, 11:02:38 AMIn conclusion, we definitely cannot limit who will use Bitcoin, certainly not if we consider it the future global currency. Limiting Bitcoin only to \"nice\" people seems to me to be completely opposite to the story of financial freedom.It's not possible to limit it 100% but it's our job, the job of the Bitcoin community, to call out abusers and to discourage them. That's why we expose scammers, even right here on the forum, in Scam Accusation. That's why we advocate to avoid scammers and avoid advertising scams (like 1xbit is a shady shit site). Yes, it happened in the past, that even Forum Officials defended known scammers, which is a shame, similar to defending pervs. It is as disgusting as it gets. That's why we should not push shady actors, like pervs, into Bitcoin. That's why we need to discourage pervs, like we discourage scammers.  Bitcoin relies on an active community to weed out scam and abuse and we can make a great contribution by giving scammers, hackers, shitcoin fraudsters and pervs a hard time. Right now, it's already a good thing to avoid emboldening such shady actors.  It's already enough shame, what happened in Germany, luckily that happened (not yet) on the forum. But still, it's really sad for the people affected by this scandal...",

Very good view and there is a lot of truth what you write. Pornography is legal/normal in many countries. Not everything what's legal is good at the same time. You can burn your garden down completely, it might be legal but still, it's not good.  Once again, I'll refer to what I've written above: It's not my business what people are doing in private. Yes, it might be a big shame, what some pervs are doing in private but as long as no other people's rights are affected, it's not my business. But it is a big issue, when other people's rights are affected and that's also about public impression. It is malicious to spread pornographic content publicly and it's a big shame that people want to do this. These are the real pervs!  That's disgusting, it's a shame. It should be possible for everyone, that they are safe from pervs in public and that applies to the forum as well. Do I want to browse Bitcointalk, where on every 2nd post disgusting stuff is included? No, definitely not.  Some people already complained against animated avatars back then, which hasn't been much of an issue in my opinion but disgusting perv stuff would be an unthinkable big shame!!! Downplaying the excessive spreading of pornography in public and normalizing of it is what dedicated pervs would do. We should not do this.
