If you dont then you should be at least having some time on checking out about some economics subject or even with the basics of it. I do agree into that earlier post that people do really love on relying their lives or really that dependent on what government could give onwithout even trying to think or finding out solutions for themselves in speaking about sustainability or survival. If you do find yourself on such struggle, then you should really be needing to actfast and wise on what are the things that you could really make it as an option.Good plan very soon? I dont think so.. They might really be that trying to maintain peace and order and some laws about controlling price of goods and providing some jobsbut it wont really be that be enough or something that would be sufficient considering that population is really that increasing yearly on which means that they wont really beable to cope up on what are those gaps that theyre missing. Therefore, the wisest thing to be done is to have your own ways on how you would be able to surviveor making your life way more better.",

While they may provide temporary relief for some individuals, they fail to address the underlying causes of poverty and can even lead to unintended negative consequences.The fundamental issue with relying on cash handouts as a poverty alleviation strategy is that it does not empower individuals to become self-sufficient. Without addressing the root causes of poverty, such as lack of education, limited job opportunities, and inadequate access to resources, individuals remain trapped in a cycle of dependency on external assistance.Moreover, cash handouts can exacerbate inflationary pressures, as an influx of money without a corresponding increase in goods and services can lead to rising prices. This can disproportionately impact low-income households, further straining their budgets and eroding the purchasing power of their limited resources.",

You still have to take responsibility for yourself to make something good happen in your life and determine how to make progress and prosper. However, I can't blame the criticisms against the government because of anomalies, especially in handling and using public funds, and most notably, corruption, which are cancers in society.There are existing financial assistance programs for those in need, but it seems like they are not sustainable, and beneficiaries end up relying on them as their only hope. However, this doesn't solve the problem as a whole. They should focus on long-term and permanent solutions instead of just short-term and temporary ones. The assistance they provide only lasts for a day or a few days, and it often falls short. What individuals can do is try to live within their budget and avoid spending more money than they can afford.",

Indeed, in terms of the social economy, the role of government is very important so that everyone can have their own welfare. but if we just stand idly by by other people, then don't hope that we can get out of this quite worrying condition. \"Sometimes we always demand the rights we have to get from the state, but never think about how we can contribute to the state.\"And if you can only depend on the help given by other people, this shows that you are someone who has no purpose in life and shows that you have no principles in life. Because if you have clear goals and life principles, then you will never allow yourself to be in trouble, you will always try to solve all problems and find solutions, even though it is something difficult. And if you have a sense of humanity, then you will never let other people get into trouble and always try to help other people even though you are experiencing difficulties.And the words of the day, \"If you don't care enough about yourself, how can anyone care about you\"",

I do not see the government as a source of income to rely on, giving free money because a person is unemployed then no body will want to work then as for the fact the government will pay me. This is a wrong idea, we are meant to go out there and start doing something for ourselves rather than being jobless and keep waiting for the government such a person will remain in abject poverty.

No one is coming to save you OP, how about you use that as a fuel and start some hustle. Wake up and come out of that imagination because money doesn’t grow on trees. One of the challenges I see with the idea of giving free money is that is subconsciously causes laziness, and 90% of the time, those who claim they need the money to start something will never do it but will come back tomorrow asking for more like they have all the right.

Peoples personal situation and perception can sometimes create a warped projection of what they think the world is like, but the reality does not align with what you think is happening in the world. You don't need to worry about people like landlords not being able to pay the mortgage, as they are often guilty of overstretching and they certainly aren't thinking about you.
