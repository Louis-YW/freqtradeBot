  "content": "Pool.Game Open Beta PlanDuration: 10-15 daysPurpose: Ensure an adequate testing periodThe Pool.Game open beta plan will last for 10-15 days to ensure a sufficient testing period. This will provide the development team with enough time to detect and resolve any potential issues with the pool interaction, while also allowing participants ample time to familiarize themselves with and explore the platform.Token Distribution:Purpose: Provide participants with currency for testing and interactionDistribution method: Fair distribution according to predetermined rulesDuring the open beta, participants will receive a certain amount of test tokens for interaction and testing on the Pool.Game platform. The distribution of test tokens will be done according to predetermined rules to ensure equal and fair opportunities for all participants.Self-Token Issuance:Purpose: Promote diversity and innovation in the pool ecosystemIssuance on the test chain: Participants can create their own personal poolsParticipants will have the opportunity to issue their own tokens on the test chain, in addition to using the test tokens. This empowers participants with more creativity and autonomy, as they can create their own pools and interact with other users. This helps test the scalability and compatibility of the system.Token Conversion:Purpose: Convert tokens earned during the testing phase to official Pool tokens upon launchConversion ratio: Evaluated and determined based on the open beta results and platform economic modelDuring the open beta, participants can interact using test tokens and earn tokens. These earned tokens can be converted to official Pool tokens upon the platform's official launch, based on a predetermined conversion ratio. The specific ratio will be evaluated and determined based on the open beta results and the platform's economic model.Activity Rewards:Purpose: Increase engagement and activity during the open betaReward content: USDT rewards for top-performing users who win with test tokensTo boost engagement and activity during the open beta, Pool.Game will organize various activities. One of these activities includes rewarding top-performing users with USDT based on their achievements using test tokens.

Mind filling those blanks for us here?",

The UI is also terrible with the fonts being too small, the default language being Chinese, and so on. Maybe you can fix those issues first before trying to promote your platform with AI-powered materials.",

      "body": "Today is your first day promoting this linktree site platform and yet it was under maintenance so far I think you didn't plan this well and thin of it as well. How can the engagement will increase if maintenance was happening at once at the beginning of your promotion.The community cannot interact also if the situation is like this now. Probably, you better fix those issue first before doing such a things like this dude.",

      "body": "I was looking at the site and the games are not clear at all... https://www.pool.game/gameAs we can see those games are skill-based and there is a problem with skill-based games, they can be automated increasing the odds of the user. So, I would recommend adding some provably fair games, that would be a better way for the users and for the house.Personally I don't like the project at all, it's obvious that the project has the main focus to bump the token and not to provide a nice experience to the users.",
