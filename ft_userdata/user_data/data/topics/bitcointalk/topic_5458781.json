  "content": "Exciting news! It seems that Twitter, the popular social media platform owned by Elon Musk, is exploring the possibility of entering the payments industry in the United States. They are currently in the process of seeking regulatory licenses to develop software that would eventually allow users to make payments directly on the platform.If this endeavor proves successful, it could open up a whole new realm of possibilities for Twitter and its users. Imagine being able to make payments using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin right from your Twitter account! These digital currencies would likely be among the first ones to be supported.This move towards enabling payments aligns with Elon Musk's vision of diversifying revenue streams for Twitter. By incorporating payment functionality into the platform, Twitter could potentially generate additional sources of income and offer users a seamless way to transact within the social media ecosystem.While we'll have to wait for further updates on the progress of this initiative, it's undoubtedly an exciting development that highlights the growing intersection between social media and digital payments.What are your thoughts on Twitter potentially enabling crypto payments? Do you think it would enhance the overall Twitter experience and provide new opportunities for businesses and users alike",

He is known to be a supporter of BTC in his past comments. It would certainly open up revenue streams in many different facets for twitter and crypto focused companies and even non-crypto focused companies alike. Elon has made it known that he intends to make twitter this \"everything app\" but that is still in the works, and with this new money transmitter license he has been granted in 3 states over the past week he is slowly making progress. He intends to turn twitter into this so called \"super app\" that would act similar to Chinese messaging app WeChat, which essentially lets you do everything like paying for your uber, paying for bills, really paying for anything. Even verifying your identity to use certain services, etc etc. I'm not sure how it will be received by the crypto community, but I have an inkling that it would not be ideal for remaining anonymous - IMO it seems to be a long term goal as a push for CBDC in the US once implemented. This type of app has helped China usher in their digital yuan so seamlessly to 1 billion plus people in their country.",

Hopefully, Twitter can make an important breakthrough on this aspect which can open up a huge market for this popular social media outfit. This is going to be a natural progression for Twitter and Elon...and I am looking forward to one day be able to transfer crypto funds within the platform. Good news to millions of Twitter users and to cryptocurrency in general.",

Here you go Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-receives-money-transmitter-licenses-three-us-statesTwitter Payments LLC, a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s Twitter social network, appears to have received its first money transmitter licenses after Michigan, New Hampshire and Missouri approved the company’s applications.A money transmitter license allows a company to provide transfer services or payment instruments. This differs from a license to conduct sales in that it’s meant to provide consumer protections for businesses that facilitate the transmission of money from one party to another, not just the purchase of products and services.It remains unclear at this time exactly what offerings will be on tap if and when Twitter Payments eventually rolls out. The company applied for licenses in all 50 U.S. states, and there’s no clear timeline for the approval process.Elon planning to integrate payments on Twitter is not a new thing really because he bought Twitter for the exactly that thing, to make it an \"everything app\" where you will be able to do all sorts of things, similar to how WeChat in China is being used. Quote from: mendace on July 06, 2023, 05:48:32 AMElon has always been a fan of Bitcoin If he was  a true Bitcoin fan he woulnd't remove it as a mean so payment for Tesla due those bs enviromental concerns. To me he is more of an opportunist when it comes to Bitcoin.",

I imagine that you would be able to tip people for their posts in BTC or namely DOGE- Elon's favorite crypto lol.DOGE is dogeshit (pun intended) for accepting payments. You cannot easily make an HD wallet of DOGE addresses and query the balances of each one, because Dogecoin Core is so ancient that they haven't even merged the multi-wallet support that has been present in Bitcoin/Litecoin/DASH for at least 7(!) years. The best you can hope for using current software - unless you want to waste 2 years of your life rewriting the DOGE full node - is to assign an address to each user, which kills privacy but you can at least do that.Knowing Elon's twitter, I wouldn't be surprised if they just partnered with some exchange to store their crypto payments in.Nobody is maintaining dogecoin nodes and software and jokers expect us to transact with it over Bitcoin and other alts like ETH?Quote from: slaman29 on July 06, 2023, 05:58:41 AMHmm.
