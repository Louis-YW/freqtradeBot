Buying meme coins? Buying some newly launched platforms on Base?The base network launched a mainnet now. The next step is to launch a token from the base network. but it will take some time. What you can do is interact with the apps in the base ecosystem and be eligible for the base airdrop. Then you can earn profits from the base network. Additionally, you will get dapps airdrops as well.",

Buying meme coins? Buying some newly launched platforms on Base?I've participated in their testnet before the mainnet launch. Right now, I have started engaging in their mainnet campaigns on Galxe like their OnChain summer campaign and other projects under Base mainnet.  Although they do deny about an airdrop to early adopters and users, I think that's the same style and strategy as the other big airdrops like Arbitrum, Optimism, Blur, Aptos and the recent Arkham. They just surprise their users about it with the final snapshot date. As for bridging other chains to Base, I did used Orbiter Finance. But for sure, I will try using their main bridge which can be a criteria for a surprise speculated airdrop later on.",

Yeah, Linea is also interesting as I saw some platform (more on DeFi platforms) on Base that already working that supports also Linea network.I think Base is still early, there are still no new platforms like DeFi platforms. DeFi platforms will boost this network, just like what happened on most layer-2 networks where they used as alternative on Ethereum.",

Instead of going in to buy some shitcoins in Base, I am more on interacting in their network. I’ve been doing interactions since May of this year both testnet and mainnet. Although Base hasn’t confirmed an airdrop or just “denying” it, that’s just a strategy. Big L1 and L2 projects does not announce airdrop in advance but rather surprising us along with the snapshot date. For their testnet I did minted their Base commemorative NFT. Now I am doing Base-related tasks in Galxe and hunting other projects using the Base network like Izumi Finance, etc.",

These days failure is not really the biggest problem but scammers are and most of the time scammers end up building a project that ends up stealing your money.Now, I do not want to get ahead of myself, but even if this fails and doesn't make anyone any money and goes to near zero prices, it looks like they are not scammers at least. And that is the biggest compliment I can give to anyone these days, that's the maximum that I could make at the moment. Yes, it's not that easy to handle and all that, but you could always come up with something that would be a lot better in the end, and consider it a success when you find some project that is not scammers.",

Like the Parallel for example, it cost us 0.05 Base ETH to mint their NFT. Looks like I cannot complete these quests on Base in Galxe because some mints like Parallel costs us a lot of money. Only those who can afford can mint that NFT. I may expect other NFTs that are having prices that I cannot really afford as of the moment. I only minted their Day 1 which is something that I can afford to lose.",

I'm apeing on the Defi projects and no I wouldn't risk it on the memecoins, there will be more than that when Base get bigger and bigger. Who's anticipating the BASE token airdrop? Well, they'll deny it of course but we can't deny the fact that Coinbase might do that and that will be an additional earnings for those who will be early in the network.",

But since I missed the NFT mint for the second day and it is no longer available, I decided to refuse to participate in Onchain Summer. Nevertheless, I will still perform minimal activity on the BASE network to receive airdrop, since the commission on the network is really low.",
