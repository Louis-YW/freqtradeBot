  "content": "As someone who has been day trading Bitcoin for the past 3 years usually successfully, I have learned some valuable lessons that have helped me become a successful trader. Here are five key things I've learned:1. Never trade against the market trend. The market trend is king, and attempting to trade against it is a recipe for disaster. Following the trend allows you to capture profits and avoid unnecessary losses.2. Stick to your strategy no matter what. A trading strategy is a roadmap to success, and it's crucial to stick to it regardless of market conditions. Deviating from your plan leads to impulsive decisions and missed opportunities.3. Use technology to your advantage. Emotions can hinder a trader's ability to make sound decisions, but technology can remove this obstacle. Using a crypto trading bot that operates on pre-set criteria ensures that trades are executed objectively and without emotions.4. Listen to industry influencers but form your own opinion on the long-term direction. Industry influencers can offer valuable insights, but blindly following their advice is a mistake. It's essential to conduct independent research and form your own opinions about the market's long-term direction.5. Risk management is critical. Managing risk is essential to a day trader's survival. I always set stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging my trades to limit losses and protect my capital.Bonus tip: Keep it simple, don't complicate your trading even if it looks cool. It's easy to get caught up in fancy indicators and complex trading strategies, but simplicity is often the key to success. Keeping your approach straightforward and easy to execute will lead to success.Questions?",

The market trend is king, and attempting to trade against it is a recipe for disaster. Following the trend allows you to capture profits and avoid unnecessary losses.We can still trade against the trend but we have to bear in mind that we have to exit immediately since the bias is in opposite direction. Trading against the trend has low probability for me than with following the trend but we can't deny that there are traders who are more profitable of trading against the trend.Quote3. Use technology to your advantage. Emotions can hinder a trader's ability to make sound decisions, but technology can remove this obstacle. Using a crypto trading bot that operates on pre-set criteria ensures that trades are executed objectively and without emotions.Don't let the bot trade for you because the market movement is always changing. So trading with the bots will only good for beginners and it only good at the beginning, it will not work in the long run. Learning to handle an emotion is a must, so if you're having a hard time try to read the book of \"Atomic Habits\". Quote4. Listen to industry influencers but form your own opinion on the long-term direction. Industry influencers can offer valuable insights, but blindly following their advice is a mistake. It's essential to conduct independent research and form your own opinions about the market's long-term direction.I agree with you. They're just getting paid to hype a project or maybe they have huge holdings with that coin that's why they are hyping. But even though we knew that he/she just hyping, but we can't deny that there's always have an effect to the price.",

Don't do Margin, Leverage, Future tradings and your life will become more easily and less stressful.Stop-loss orders can not protect your capital if there are lags on exchangers or Cascade effect on the market happens. With Spot trading, you can have loss too but you won't be forced liquidated and lose 50% or 75% of your capital by one liquidation.Another order to protect your capital in Spot trading (I don't advise to use Margin, Leverage, Futures Tradings).Stop-limit orderAwesome Crypto Trading",

We should be more open-minded to listen to those reliable crypto influencers as they may have also brilliant ideas that will be beneficial for us. But it does not mean that you will stick to whatever they say, still you have to DYOR and find the right strategies that will work on you. But it's already a different story if you end up listening from untrustworthy influencers. That's the reason why we also have to do our part so we won't be deceived from crypto influencers like them.",

I always set stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging my trades to limit losses and protect my capital.In the last couple of years of trading, the lesson that stood out the most for me is the principle of risk management and how crucial it is in trading. I specifically learned that, if done correctly the trader need not loss because on the flip side of it is profitability over a long period of time. I could remember instances where my risk management strategies have helped me to make better decisions like looking that the risk and reward inherent in every trade before jumping in. I cannot overemphasize how much my trading discipline and consistency has improved over the last couple of years because I have been able to adhere to the rules I set for myself.",

I can say this because I observe what they say and understand and then in the end I realize that most of what they said is not realistic.
