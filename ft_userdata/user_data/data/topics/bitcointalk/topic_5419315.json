This was asked before, in a way or another, so I will be short and directly to the questions.Quote from: a298b112 on November 03, 2022, 03:01:38 PM1. Do a CEX create a new BTC wallet for every client and keeps the keys with them? Or there is one wallet for the BTC/USDT pair?Not at all. They probably have one BTC wallet for the whole system (actually two, one hot wallet and one cold wallet, but let's keep it simple).And same goes for all currencies they allow to deposit and withdraw.The BTC address you think it's yours is just a deposit address. As soon as somebody else needs a withdrawal, \"your\" bitcoins may be used, while your account remains credited.Everything else happens in their internal database.Quote from: a298b112 on November 03, 2022, 03:01:38 PM2. What exactly happens when you buy/sell BTC? Where that BTC goes actually?In their internal database, somewhere related to your account, the numbers related one currency will decrease and for another currency they'll increase.Quote from: a298b112 on November 03, 2022, 03:01:38 PM3. How they know who has what amount of BTC?Their software checks their database.Quote from: a298b112 on November 03, 2022, 03:01:38 PM4. What about other pairs? Like ETH/USDT? SOL/USDT?Just in that same way, with the small side note that USDT may be a bit different because it can be sent on various chains, hence it may need multiple wallets, but let's not get confused by exceptions.",

The balance that you see inside user A account is not related to the blockchain, but an internal cex database.

It mostly only happens on withdrawals, or with them moving funds to a central hot/cold wallet in the back end.But yea, exchanges do cause a lot of on-chain transactions in it's entirety due to previously said reasons alone.",

The address is owned by the exchange and they give it to you, so you can make a deposit. You have no control over that address. So, when you sell your bitcoin to someone in the exchange, there is no need to make a transaction from your deposit address to someone else deposit address. All deposit addresses are owned by the exchange and they have full control over the funds, whether it's in your deposit address, another user deposit address or their hot wallet.",

In term of address just like few people already narrated here, your registration email is your authentic deposit address for any coin or token listed on that exchange for example big exchange like binance does it and once your account is being created all addresses is being assigned to you and it doesn't interacts with others nor associated with another users address.But there's something i don't like about cex is that whenever you made a mistake send token or coin to the wrong address they fails to help you retrieve your token why then they don't allow us own each private keys of those coin in the exchange?Yes because they believe everyone is liable to his mistake and for that no more request to retrieve funds mistakenly sent to the wrong.

However, what do you want to do with the private key in that situation? Transactions are generally cannot be canceled. There is also the possibility that users will import addresses in other wallets whose activities are not recorded.If you mean internal transactions, they just don't want to mess with user activity logs which may have an overall impact.Quote from: MainIbem on November 03, 2022, 11:27:06 PMThis is the place I don't like cex.

Do a CEX create a new BTC wallet for every client and keeps the keys with them?Centralized exchanges create wallets for their clients and they have private keys of client's wallets. That means they give you custodial wallets, not non-custodial wallets that are better ones.QuoteOr there is one wallet for the BTC/USDT pair?No, if there is such separate wallet for each trading pair, exchanges (centralized) will have to create so many wallets for their users because there are so many trading pairs for BTC, btc to stable coins, btc to altcoins. That will increase their cost to maintain wallets, consolidate inputs, proceed withdrawals and more technical things.Quote2. What exactly happens when you buy/sell BTC? Where that BTC goes actually?After you create your account, click on get an address, they will create a wallet and an address for you in Funding account. Then when you want to trade, you must move your fund to Spot or Trading account. The procedure from Funding to Spot/ Trading account (their names can be different by exchanges) is almost similar over exchanges.The amount you trade (buy or sell) is just a number that is credited by an exchange to your account. Only when you make a withdrawal request, they will approve it and broadcast that transaction for you from their 'hot wallet'. If you pay attention, you will see transactions broadcasted by exchanges usually have so many inputs. Those inputs are not from your deposit transactions but also from other users too.Quote3. How they know who has what amount of BTC?They credit that wallet, that address and the trading amount to your account, so they have full access to your trading history.Learning resourcesHow to transfer assets from spot wallet to funding wallet?
