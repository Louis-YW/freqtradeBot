      "body": "The search button at the top would be of help here as lots of posts have been made on that subject.In simple terms; Non Fungible Tokens are digital signatures on the blockchain which represents a digital art.Stuffs like Bitcoin, gold and fiat are fungible, meaning they are identical and can be exchanged for each other; 1BTC = 1BTC.NFTs on the other hand are not fungible and cannot be exchanged for one another. Each token is different and represented on the blockchain.NFTs can be minted on blockchain platforms like ethereum, solana, polygon etc, and sold on websites like opensea.Any art at all could be turned into an NFT; a video, gif, screenshot, painting etc.",

Thanks. @upgrade00 already said it all, there's is alot of discussions surrounding NFTs on this forum already, a simple search will bring up past discussions on this topic.NFTs are digital arts, just like we have paintings drawing, pictures, gifs, even short videos, etc, all of this can be minted on the blockchain, and when this happens, they are called NFTs, they are arts in digital form.NFTs have various uses, and some of them are --blockchain gaming-digital signatures-Real estate-voting-Ticketing-metaverse-Academic credentials.
