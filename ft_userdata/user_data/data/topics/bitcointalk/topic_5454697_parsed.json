  "content": "As a campaign manager local boards are as important as international boards of the forum. For the last three hours, I was browsing a local board to find some prominent members from the board to offer them a spot in one of my campaign. I would like to invite them in private but I discovered an unfortunate fate for some of the prominent members on that board.I don't speak the language but these days we have Google translator plus being in the community for the long time enabled me to understand (not very correctly but at least to some extend) what to get from a topic or the posts from members, no matter what language they write. I don't think these prominent members have any negative intentions, they are doing their best for their local board but in the international section it seems they are not welcome. They are left in a corner as it's (general boards) not their zone. I mean \"not welcome\" in a sense that they have negative feedback on their feedback page and the feedbacks were not for any reason such as they scammed. It looks more to me that the main board users simply misunderstand the culture and think they are not suitable for the community so they like to mark them red. It also give a sense that these main board members have some personal dislike towards the boards (or better to say this group of the local users)In a campaign accepting a red trusted member does not look good (maximum one red feedback I can ignore but having more than one looks too bad) but some of these members really deserve a good reward for their contribution to the community especially in their local boards.I could tell you the board name and also could tell you the members who left feedback (maybe from not understanding their culture) but situation is like that if I tell the names then others may think I am trying to get some attention to awaken some old bitter experience and maybe is trying to take some personal revenge. I don't want anyone to have such thinking in mind.If anyone (people who can make a difference when you enter in a discussion) wants to know the local board name then feel free to PM me.Cheers,",

Limiting it to a certain part of the forum, most often due to a language barrier, also limits the ability of such a member to influence or make a significant contribution to the forum. I don't know which specific local board you're talking about, but it's quite possible that the members you have in mind don't even know that they have the possibility to complain about negative feedback in the global part of the Forum.I believe that opening an additional local topic for applying in the campaign would definitely help, at least written in English.

But I don't think people hate those who are more into local boards. Thirty percent of my posts are on my local thread. But I didn't get any hate just because of that. If someone hates others just because he doesn't understand someone's local culture or doesn't understand their culture, it's his problem.Regarding the Red Tag, I wasn't going to ask who the person is. But I should know who the person is and who the one who left the tag is. I want to see the tag reference and evaluate it. We also have some members from our local thread who are more into local boards and did not post in the global section for a while. But since they are not in a signature campaign, it's not a problem for them.",

The way the trust system is now, and the way half don't know how to use it, will show a manager that they need to look at the reason for the tags before deciding to keep them out if a campaign. For example, OgNasty has like -8 from my view but he is in the top 10 most recognized names on the forum. Some of his tags stem from disagreements and others are there for other reasons, but overall he is still a respected person on the forum. We have 100 rotating spots on DT1 and then we have all the users on those users trust lists on DT2. There is going to be a red tag on everyone at some point IMO, so just check the feedback and let companies know that in your opinion a person is good for their brand. Just my opinion.",

However, I wouldn't go as far as to say that they are unwelcome. At least, that's not the vibe I got from this place. Besides, even with all those cultural differences and language barriers, nowadays people have got plenty of tools and stuff to help bridge those gaps and make understanding and communication easier.However, that doesn't give these members a free pass to disregard the basic etiquette of good community practice or violate forum rules. Regardless of their origin or activities, there are certain standards of behavior that apply to everyone. It's like a common code of conduct that we all should abide by, right? Now, I'm not sure what negative tags specifically we're referring to, but I haven't noticed a practice of labeling members negatively solely based on cultural diversity or misunderstandings. I could be mistaken, but I haven't come across any instances of this behavior from any DT members. So, it would probably help here if we knew which specific cases we are talking about.",

If a member conducts within a local board in accordance with local traditions which could be deemed appropriate/normal/acceptable it does not mean those patterns will be deemed appropriate/normal/acceptable in the global boards but having said that we are clutching at straws because the OP has not even made the issue fully known therefore almost impossible to comment upon.",

This means you should review negative feedback first and be sure you want to place it. You can view and review the signature campaign guidelines, it might be useful to you in managing your campaign. Even though it's just a guideline, but I think you can still consider something based on your own decisions, even accept one or more user recently woke up from a long period of inactivity, change email and password in your campaign.One of the most interesting quotes is:QuoteConsider not accepting users with negative feedback. It never looks good when users have negative feedback and 99% of the time the feedback is there for a good reason, but if you want to take this on a case by case basis then that's down to you.",

If negative tags from more than 1 DT member is overlooked, there will be a time in the forum where negative tag would not be considered again. In as much as you can make some quality posts, to hell with the negative tags. Even if it sounds funny, it will soon happen, especially now that number of campaigns have exceeded the number of good posters.2. Some negative tags are retaliatory, such as the one carried by Poker player, yourself,  BitcoinGirl.Club, JollyGood,  etc. Such tags can easily be overlooked by a campaign manager but seems like the ones you are talking about in Op is about ethics. Measuring a local ethics to that of international, I think the later takes precedence.3. You noted that you don't understand the language of that local board in question, and online translators can give you some connected ideas but it may fail at some points. How then were you able to know their culture. Or did you speak with the victims privately and they explained their culture to you.Quote from: Royse777 on May 31, 2023, 10:26:08 PMI could tell you the board name and also could tell you the members who left feedback (maybe from not understanding their culture) but situation is like that if I tell the names then others may think I am trying to get some attention to awaken some old bitter experience and maybe is trying to take some personal revenge. I don't want anyone to have such thinking in mind.4. I'll conclude this way;With your reputation in the forum, you can be the right third party to solicit for the victims. Pm the persons who left the tags, and they may consider to turn it neutral to enable you hire them. But if the tag giver is someone you cannot visit their pm, you may decide to bring up the matter here and the community will see to it.",
