      "body": "Do you simply want to have access to your addresses when you're away from your computer? If so, you have a couple of options:1. Import your master public key to Bluewallet (mobile wallet) so you can generate addresses.2. A lot of exchanges support whitelisting addresses. You can generate a few addresses in your wallet and add them to your exchange account and then use them whenever you want to withdraw your funds. This is obviously not the best way, especially if you're withdrawing on a regular basis, and you want to use a different address each time.",

All your addresses can be derived from your master public key and you can use that to create a watch-only wallet. If you are online, you can see your addresses, your balance and your transactions history. If you are offline, you can only see your addresses. Note that your password encrypts your wallet locally and it doesn't matter whether your wallet is encrypted or not.",

The last time I did this was a long time ago, so I forgot the exact procedure. I see Aikidoka has already provided a clear explanation with screenshots, so there's no need for me to repeat the steps. @unknowncustomer, you can follow the steps shared by Aikidoka to create a watch-only wallet using your Master Public Key.",

It is always best to exercise caution when sharing any information related to your wallet online. I recommend using the BIP32 calculator from bitaps.com, as this tool is usable even when you are not connected to the internet.https://bitaps.com/bip32",
