The best one can do is sort by \"to\" by clicking the header, and then find the pages related to the user being sought, scrolling through the posts which are then ordered by date (ascending).Note: quick snaps",

I could swear that I read somewhere many years ago that a full PM export is possible but only if theymos approves it. He also has to be the one to do it. It took me some time to find the post, but here is the proof that I haven't gone mad:Quote from: theymos on May 05, 2016, 03:39:35 AMI actually have code written for exporting PMs into an mbox file compatible with Thunderbird, but I haven't gotten around yet to figuring out how best to present this functionality to users. (It's unusual because it takes a bit of time to generate and the resulting file should maybe be encrypted.)If any established members have a strong need for it, I can manually create an export for you. For example, if you have so many PMs that the PM page is slow to load for you, you can get a PM export from me and then use the \"purge PMs\" feature. I'll probably only do this one time per person...Whether or not this offer is still available is another question.",
