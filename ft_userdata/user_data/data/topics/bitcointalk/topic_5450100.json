It’s normal that they will not send their balance on exchange directly because they knew how big their recovered Bitcoin.This user will obviously use mixers to maintain their privacy before they will send their token on exchange. I’m sure the owner of this wallet know the existence of whale alert bot and everyone is watching on their wallet movement.I will do the same if I will be an owner of this kind of huge BTC to stop the public eyes that looking on my asset. But this kind of transfer is nothing to be worried and we all know that there’s only wallet that can cause havoc in crypto once become active again and that is Satoshi.",

So What you're though?For reference sake, there was a larger dormant address that woke up near the lows at $16K, also to presumably dump Bitcoin. It's not uncommon to see this sort of activity in bear markets.Maybe it's not common knowledge here, but dormant addresses waking up to dump coins near the lows is also relatively common, for example the 2018 bear market lows with 5-7 year old addresses.Quote from: blue Snow on April 25, 2023, 09:22:00 AMwhy are they selling it now, and not on ATH acouple years ago?.If you consider that this whale bought 1K Bitcoin for $7 back in May 2011 for $7K, then they are still up 400,000% with it being worth $27.5m  Sure it was worth over $60m at ATH, but $27.5m is still a lot of money from a $7K investment, so I wouldn't say they are missing out on major gains here. 600 BTC was otherwise left in the wallet, so seems like someone wanted to cash out 40% after such incredible gains. Probably they thought they might as well retire with $10m if I had to guess, but also keep the majority of their holdings.",

Because if total trading volume in the last 24 hours is $15,759,266,859 which is considerably bigger than value of 1,000 BTC from that address.Is selling pressure of 1,000 BTC from old era (12 years ago) is bigger than selling pressure of 1,000 BTC in 2020 or 2023? They are the same amount of BTC and the same in value. Only mentally weak people think that it might create some big impacts on the market.",

This, if they held through the ath of nearly $70k, it's not very likely they'll be selling at sub $30k. Even if they were to do it, they'd probably do it slowly, to get the best value out of it.Of course, it's also possible that those bitcoins will end up on an exchange, but in the worst case scenario, it could only cause some dent in the price, but won't have any significant long-term impact.The only implication is that some of the analysts would have to re-consider how the bitcoin free float is calculated (bitcoins that are available for trade), maybe excluding coins that have been sitting idle for a few years is not the best approach.",

Besides, there can be many reasons as to why these investors are moving their Bitcoins only now after all this time like going for a more secured storage, dividing their coins on different wallets, getting prepared early for the upcoming halving, etc., etc. And even if one of the reasons is selling, it would be their loss in the long run. That is, if you aren't a trader that overleverages. Also, thinking about these hoarded Bitcoins being able to get circulated again is actually a great thing for Bitcoin.",
