  "content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-27/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-lines-up-jane-street-virtu-in-etf-bidGrayscale announced a deal Monday with Wall Street trading firms Jane Street and Virtu Financial (VIRT) to close the discount on its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC-USD) following potential ETF conversion. Since Grayscale submitted its application for ETF conversion in October 2021, the SEC has delayed approval three times.Now, as part of the regulatory process, the regulator can no longer delay the application and must make a final decision on July 6.In my opinion, this is not going to happen and SEC will likely reject it.  However, here is an interesting twist in this story. The firm’s global head of ETFs, David LaValle stated that if the SEC doesn’t approve GBTC’s conversion, the firm is prepared to appeal the decision by suing the regulator. I realize that any lawsuit is usually a long-term process but this might be a light at the end of tunnel... Given the potential importance of ETF for BTC in terms of mass adoption, I look forward to seeing updates concerning this situation.  Thanks for reading my post.",

A delay means they don't have to do anything and it will take more time before another application can be filed. They can't keep rejecting it forever because they approved a scam futures ETF and a spot ETF follows the same rules so the reason they are rejecting it is not because they want to protect investors or don't trust grayscale.

Unfortunately, store owners are encourage only to accept BTC when they see the government also adopts BTC.When you write it like that then it seems like something that makes sense, but in reality things are completely different. The average user does not want to pay with BTC, and even if at some point they want to do so, they will have problems with their transaction because they do not understand what the fee is and how to set it correctly, what is RBF or what is a mempool... If we were talking about transactions in physical stores, then the problem is even bigger because sometimes the time from payment to the first confirmation can be up to 60 minutes - the solution is to make the transaction without the RBF option, but who will educate people on this issue?Quote from: bittraffic on June 29, 2022, 04:12:51 AMWould they have the chance to win if they sue the regulator? Sounds like more trouble ahead.But didn't Gary Gensler already said BTC is a commodity? That see a green light to me for BTC to be approved ETF.I think that with a lawsuit they would just touch the nest of hornets because people in the SEC are not of those who experience such things lightly. Grayscale should have more patience and not act like a spoiled child who threatens to do this or that if he doesn’t get what he wants.In addition, we should be very careful with what we want, because although most believe that the spot BTC ETF will affect the price in a positive way, it could create big problems for us in the long run. One interesting reflection worth reading :Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97xa5s/andreas_antonopolous_etfs_are_not_good_for/theymos4 yr. agoAgreed, an ETF will almost certainly turn into a disaster at some point. The coins will be stolen, forks will be handled controversially, there will be issues with fungibility (eg. someone will \"trace stolen coins\" to the ETF's stash), the world will freak out when a bunch of retirees lose their life savings after doing the equivalent of buying BTC at $20k, etc. etc. It'll also get the sort of people who love regulation more into BTC, which is never good.But investors want it, so it'll probably happen eventually. In particular, I totally condemn trying to get regulators to interfere in the free market more than they already do by blocking any ETF. (When the SEC was last looking into this, I had actually written a long document that I was going to send to them in order to comment on many technical issues with their proposed Bitcoin ETF regulation, but I decided not to send it because I don't want to have even the slightest hand in regulations.)An ETF probably will increase the price a lot (until the ETF suffers its near-inevitable catastrophe), which has some pros and cons.Note that an ETF can't affect Bitcoin itself, just the ETF investors and the market. There is no voting of any sort in Bitcoin, so it's not as if holding a lot of BTC gives you any power over Bitcoin, for example. I do agree with Andreas that the creation of a \"corpo-Bitcoin\" seems probable, perhaps after the ETF loses a ton of BTC and wants to undo it.",

That see a green light to me for BTC to be approved ETF.the latest \"adoption\" game is not to have merchants adopt bitcoin. nor have people escape custodial exchanges to put bitcoin into their own independant wallet.. but now its instead to lock up bitcoin with a co-partner(stranger requiring their authorisation) for a few months and then go play with other units of account on another network and get merchants to adopt that other network instead. whereby they want to call that bitcoin2.0(this is the \"bitcoin layer 2\" and \"bitcoin LN\" brand stealing and user stealing of the other network pretending it is \"bitcoin\")...as for suing the regulators. i understand new financial tools require new regulations to fit its purpose. many new regulations are made, and each one comes with a process of calculating the \"cost to business\" effect of a regulation, where it has to minimise this cost/burden because yes businesses can sue the regulator if its an overburden. and most new regulations are made in like 120days. so it leaves regulators in a bad defence position to delay things for years for no reason. for this situation specifically.. it depends on the detailsif an application has a normal deadline. its normally only allowed to be postponed/extended if there is an error found on the application that needs to be corrected or that the application does not meet an acceptable threshold to be accepted. whereby more time is given to tweak the application and update it. or its just rejected and they have to apply again.. its not about suing them for not auto accepting an application and awarding it an ETF. its about not even giving reason about why its not even being processed!! even if that processing leads to an objection/rejectionjust leaving a company in limbo not explaining why they cant accept or reject it. costs businesses money. where the business cant do anything or help move the process along with updated edits. or change the business policies to fit the regulator needs.. simply a \"come back next year\" is not something that is free for the business.. and regulators should not put undue costs on a business due to regulator decisions. because as first said they can be suedso the regulator needs a good excuse as to why:they didnt simply reject it by saying what is wrong with the application. they didnt offer suggestive changes/hints/options to update the applicationthey didnt request business policy changes to fit the regulator needs.. because if they just delayed it for the sake of delay.. that is no defense(even during covid)",

They clearly bought and sold gold over timehttps://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/IAU/ishares-gold-trust/market-capnever look at a market capits NOT how much reserve is held(that changes) thats then divided down to discover a market priceits actually the opposite its the market order of how much is spent to buy just a few shares. multiplied by total shares.the factor you see moving on the chart is not the amount of shares total changing rapidly. its the per share price that is causing the movement.imagine it this way.. if the share price was fixed. you would see a straight line on the market cap. like in bitcoin.. we are pretty much at 19m circulation for a long time. not much growth monthly in comparison. yet the market cap shifts alot in the last month. not because lots of coin was created or destroyed. but because the per coin price manipulated the market cap. ..that said yes some portfolio managers might drop one share asset backed share and pick up another. but long term the trust holding the collateral of bitcoin offering shares to the portfolio market is not going to play to the whims of the short term markets. most of the time it is a thing of selling shares from one portfolio manager to another where the trust does not need to \"buy back\" allotments of shares. its like most businesses they are more likely to dilute the shares by making more by having more collateral. rather than having to compulsory buy-back sharesalso they wont over leverage themselves by locking up too many coin. because that just dilutes their shares before they even begin... my example was not about them buying up 1mill of coins when an ETF application gets certified to operate. i said 250k as thats an easy number to lock. like i said its only 1mill people out of 8 billion not even (0.02% of the market)so safe numbers to assume are long hoards.",

This proves that bitocins or gold are not locked when a new etf shows up.Manager can just sell the bitcoin and burn shares  , dropping the marketcap. There are no locked btc.",

      "body": "taking coins out of a lock. drops a etf market cap. but.. then they have less coins meaning it increases the price.. same is true for the opposite.same goes for any share based company market. adding more shares dilutes the price and removing shares consolidates the price. as thats the point of doing it in most cases. dont look at market cap to calculate how many shares/coins there are.. instead actually look for the stat behind it that actually shows how many shares/coins there are.take that market cap link you shown. just that chart nothing else. just that wiggly line chart. can you tell me without using any other information you found elsewhere. can you tell me how many assets are actually held. nope you cant. and thats the point. you need further calculation of another stat to subtract the market price to get to the actual asset held. or you need the asset held stat to verify the market cap calculation. but that chart alone is not meaningful. take the bitcoin networkthe market cap is not a measure of the coins in circulation alone. its a current price X coins in circulation..if you want to know how many coins in circulation get the source data. yep i mean the actual coins in circulation stat... but in general.. speaking about market caps in crypto. they are meaninglessi can make an altcoin today. with 1trill coins premined. and selling just one.. yep just one for just $1.. it instantly creates a $1trillion market cap.but that market cap does not represent that there is $1trill stored somewhere holding my altcoin up. its a meaningless stat...im looking at greyscales page whilst posting this.. for example. im not looking at the price or the market cap. nor am i looking at the shares issued or the shares/btc stat.. heck i am not even looking at the AUM$ (assets under management in dollars)instead.. i am looking for the assets under managed before its then valued in dollar. yep im actually looking for the coin hoarded amount. i am not interested in reports and stats after things get adjusted/tweaked misrepresented, blown up or soften down by market numbers of other variables",

The SEC seem determined to keep rejecting every application so why is this one any different. I think possibly big banks & or government are filling their bags & or suppressing the price with every ounce of their being. The economy is screwed at the moment, the last thing the government wants is the little people controlling their own money & flowing out of the failing USD.",
