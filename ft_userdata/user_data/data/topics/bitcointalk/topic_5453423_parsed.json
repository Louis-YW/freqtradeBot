  "content": "Hello guysI am the founder of RarityCheck. We are thrilled to announce that we have some amazing products in the pipeline, and we can't wait to unveil them to the community next month.Unfortunately, I recently encountered some issues with the Mint (example instead of a hole they created a bump in the coin with two different designs) regarding a batch of coins that I had purchased. Mint has been supportive and actively trying to rectify the issue. As a result, I am currently awaiting the release of the corrected coins, which is expected to happen by mid-June. This has tied up a significant portion of my personal funds, as I had already made the payment to the Mint for minting those coins.During this time, the market has become increasingly volatile, and the cost of living has been rising steadily. Despite working full-time, my regular salary has not kept up with the increasing expenses. I finally found a small flat I like and my offer was accepted last week (can provide proof if some needs it or just to MJ or some other forum member), but the deposit is really high (I live in London). In order to raise the necessary funds for a down payment on the home, I find myself in the position of needing to sell some of my personal collectible coins as well as a few rare coins from RarityCheck.To achieve this, I will be hosting multiple auctions to generate the required funds. It would mean a lot to me if you could help by sharing these auctions with your friends and acquaintances.Â  I was thinking of selling the 0.1 Cas but that's the only priced possession which I don't want to lose.Â  I will use this topic to add links to those auction. Thank you for your support.RegardsFounder",
