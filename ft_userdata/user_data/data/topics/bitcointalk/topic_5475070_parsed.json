This is because centralized banking system can be of a major risk to the masses whereby giving the power to those who already are in control of the financial system in the country more power to control the system. Currently what can we do if our government implement this, because some universities in my country are not making use of this system when it's not fully implemented. Am very realistic at things ill make sure to take precautions.This is a very good thing that you are making people who are not aware of what would happen they might not even know is happening.",

CBDC is not the best solution for citizens, the best solution for citizens is a decentralized asset, whose amount cannot be manipulated like bitcoin.  Certainly in the next few years, transactions with cryptocurrencies and blockchain will become something that is adopted by the majority of people in the world, cryptocurrencies are already embedded in the lives of many people and cannot be avoided.",

When you are younger you may get a lot of offers to do various jobs or start new ventures, you need to analyze them careful but be aware that because the world is so fast moving that opportunity might soon be gone never to return. If you get offered a chance at an interview for a job via a friend who thinks you might be a good fit and you've been lazy in life up to that point, you should go for it because you don't know if it will lead you to much better things in life. On the flip side, if you're doing a job for a while and it becomes too much of a chore, maybe you should start to look elsewhere because it might not be what you want to do with your life and you'll be happier chasing the thing you actually want.",

Your perspective on staying updated and adapting to the latest developments is spot on. It's exciting to see how the wealth and asset environment is changing, especially with the introduction of CBDCs and the integration of well-known blockchains. Those that fight change or ignore the relevance of blockchain and NFT tokenization, as you correctly pointed out, may find themselves on the wrong side of the wealth distribution shift. It's a changing world, and remaining educated is critical to effectively navigating the financial landscape's shifts.",

Well we can contain the changes in the environment, even without crypto we know that CBDCs are coming, it is just that crypto is being involved in CBDCs because they have the same nature but there are a lot of differences when it comes to application. Adoption is constant, if you don't adopt you'll get left behind. Now these 2, I believe, are in the same context but sitting far from each other.",
