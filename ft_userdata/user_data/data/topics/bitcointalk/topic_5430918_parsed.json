      "body": "Does this really reward the persons giving up a most wanted man? Hasn’t anyone seen any mafia movies, those that snitch end of dead. In all seriousness, this is absolutely a hefty bounty for the head of a criminal and there are so many things that can happen if he ever does get arrested. For those that do help, their lives are going to be destroyed, especially for those that give up on ‘El Tony Montana’s’ whereabouts.  When and if he is found, I certainly hope that this stops the fentanyl crisis. Even moving forward show that the world will stand on the fight against drugs and criminals should think twice to getting caught.",
