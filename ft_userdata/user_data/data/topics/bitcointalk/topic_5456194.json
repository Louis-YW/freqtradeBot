  "content": "According to coindesk a newly unsealed DHS investigation report (which I can't find) alleges that Charlie Shrem and Roger Ver laundered money for the hackers of MTgox (run by Bitcoin Foundation founder Mark Karpeles).I found the coindesk article after seeing the indictment mention a 2012 \"new york based bitcoin broker\" and figuring out someone else probably made that connection and googling for the hackers name and Shrem.  If it's true we now have:* Peter Vessenes   --  Stole $5 million dollars from MTGox by accepting deposits and not remitting funds, then tried to shake the insolvency down for billions alleging ludicrous contract breaches* Roger Ver -- According to the DHS laundered money for the mtgox thieves* Charlie Shrem -- According to the DHS laundered money for the mtgox thievesThere were only six founding members!Of course, there were red flags for anyone sensitive to them-- it's a big part of why many in the early community kept cautiously distant with the Bitcoin Foundation.  But those kinds of subtly are lost to history, because at the time they were more suspicions than allegations.",

All of the above, the operation was managed by the Russians, and they were helped by greedy Americans such as Roger Ver and Charlie Shrem, and there is no shortage of corrupt FBI agents who wanted to grab some of the loot for themselves.I hope that the investigation will produce some results and that those who have not yet been in prison will receive appropriate sentences, even though sleazebags like Reger Ver always somehow escape justice or get a minimum sentence.",

I know the arrest & warrants were just issued, and the evidence is concrete...though does this really mean justice is about to be served against the shitcoin cash creator or will this fly under the radar/will their power keep them away from consequence?It does make it a lot more difficult due to the year of all of this occurring in comparison to when it's coming to light from a legal perspective...the settlement of Mt Gox and their individual statuses (especially Ver). Though that doesn't seem relevant after reading the filing. I'm curious to see how this plays out (whether they manage to evade justice or if they will serve, and how long if so)",

Ver was known to recommend MtGox though, even though he did admit later on that he regretted doing that, alleging that he also lost funds there -- I can't find the posts but I remember reading them. So it's plausible he had to be personally connected to have been handling the wealth he did and needing and exchange to liquidate. Whether that also makes it plausible for him to be involved directly, can't say.But if MD did wire that much money to a shell company, well, to answer \"who wires 2.5M to a shell company\", usually, people who know what they're doing with a lot of money. But odolvlobo is right. Not attributable to criminal intent. Likely incompetence.*Not defending Ver at all.",

If a co-founder can do such a thing then other members can do that as well. His contribution for Bitcoin and its promotion is truly appreciated, but his sinister act of his company CoinLab's converting of $5 million dollar from the deposits of user funds shows that the guy wasn't truly a Bitcoin enthusiast. Quote* Roger Ver -- According to the DHS laundered money for the mtgox thievesThat guy is expected to do such things because he did his best to promote so-called BCH which proves the mindset of the guy. He has already spent sometime in prison for his past crimes like selling of fireworks on Ebay even long before the existence of Bitcoin. I feel strange that how the guy remained the CEO of bitcoin.com for so long. The guy is truly an evil genius and he knows the tricks to manipulate others. I hope that soon authorities will take action against his supporting of money laundering for the Mtgox thieves.Quote* Charlie Shrem -- According to the DHS laundered money for the mtgox thievesThe guy has also remained in prison for 2 years because of \"Silk Road marketplace\" case because of transmitting unlicensed money related issues. Although, all of them have been prominent members of Bitcoin foundation and all of them were somehow involved in the criminal activities in the Mtgox exchange case. I hope that the authorities may get enough evidence to take proper action against those culprits of the crime.",
