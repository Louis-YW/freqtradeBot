Quote from: olympick on July 22, 2023, 12:01:58 PMPlease help me protect others from this professional scammer.To avoid another scam, you should not deal with newbie members because they can create new accounts with ease. They did not build their accounts and reputation for years just overnight, and if someone's service is attractive to you, khaled0111's advice would be ideal as you deal through the escrow service so as not to fall into their traps and send your money first and then receive the block.",

But if he's with the same tactic and scheme, we'll still see these offers and gonna give us an idea that it's still him.Thanks to your concern and keep on doing this and busting the same and other types of scams that you might encounter. We all want to have a clean community but despite doing that, they also keep on coming.And that's why we need to inform each other about their tactics, so if you see one, don't hesitate to post them again.",
