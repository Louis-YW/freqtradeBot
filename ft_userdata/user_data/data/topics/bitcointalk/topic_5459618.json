It's even in dark mode, so everything is exactly as I want it.I don't really agree with the comment below, OP's site is much more pleasant and exhaustive than coinmarketcap's BTC page.

It's  with everything and even the conversion from different currencies. And since it's fully loaded with Bitcoin resources and data, I guess that's one reason why it's not quick to load.Just a noob question. We knew that 21 million is the maximum supply of Bitcoin and I've seen that there's 20,999,999.97 on your website's supply. Is there an explanation technically why it's not whole 21 million?",

The color codes you have used are orange, blue, green and grey. I am not sure but I might be reading it incorrectly but for various pools the colors are getting repeated. Like Foundry USA, ViaBTC andLuxor are of same color. In similar ways F2 and BTCcom are also of same color. Is this correct or something should be read in different way than I am doing. Similar confusion happened when I was reading the graph of Lightening Node. But in that one I it was cleared after seeing you have divided the color codes into four different categories that is: Orange is Tor, Green is Clearnet, Blue is Unannounced, and Grey is Clearnet Tor. But for mining something isn't adding up for me? Good to see Stock vs Btc comparison. At least it can be analyzed to see how it is better or not better than X stocks. The overall experience is very good on your site. Good luck mate.",

I hope you don't expect donations to be enough. Some ads are perfectly fine if they will help maintain the service.Speaking of ads, maybe OP can reach out to some of the services that are doing signature campaign in the forum to do ads there, OP can probably hit up the DMs of the services like my signature campaign Sinbad Mixer to do an advertisement there. If ads isn't really a thing for OP, I think that donation is the closest thing that OP can use to maintain the website and I checked it, without the ads, it's actually refreshing to look at so in my opinion, donations work the best but hey, compromise is always on the table.",
