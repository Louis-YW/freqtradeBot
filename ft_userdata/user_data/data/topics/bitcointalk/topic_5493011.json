But people just like what is centralized because of their ignorance. Some people will argue with you that the centralized exchanges are regulated, unlike the opposite ones. They will not care about privacy. Most people of this world have ignorant thinking until they fall into a problem. Some people will even be ignorant because of lack of information about how it should be. Quote from: Jet Cash on April 16, 2024, 08:29:25 AMNow, what about crypto-to-crypto exchanges?

Similar to what happened in my country Nigeria months ago, when our currency had depreciated alot towards the dollar. The government started raising fingers and began a race and fought back against crypto and crypto exchanges claiming that they were the cause of sudden fall of naira. Few months before all those drama, they had said to have removed the restrictions they placed on banks as regards crypto then suddenly they had another reason to fight against it. From what we saw just few weeks after the fight against crypto exchanges, our local currency gained a lot of value once more. So we can't actually blame the government of such countries, they might be right to some extent. But if they are able to regulate crypto and probably assume to work together,  It will cause a major flaw in the main idea about decentralization which many crypto like Bitcoin was initially created for.",

The government baned banks from directly getting involved with Crypto transactions, so you could not fund your exchange wallet directly from the bank of withdraw directly to it as you could do before. After banks were restricted there was a sharp rise in P2P transactions and the Nigerian market quickly became one of the largest for P2P services.Same scenario will play out anywhere else that has ardent Bitcoin users. Only the threat of government intervention in many places already grows the P2P market.",

From the point of view of the “purity” of the transaction without traces, “cash payments in a face-to-face meeting” looks the best, but there are concerns about who might come to the deal? An armed robber out to pick your pockets, or a peace officer out to arrest you (if crypto is illegal in your country). In some cases, this may be the same person.A \"bank transfer to a trusted person's personal account\" can also be blocked, right?Quote from: Jet Cash on April 16, 2024, 08:29:25 AMWill this be the future of Bitcoin for us mere mortals, or will sanity prevail and allow us to return to using exchanges?I would prefer exchangers, but without KYC.

Will government oversight and intervention restrict those. It seems to me that this cannot be regulated: an anonymous address (token #1) sent to another anonymous address (token #2). But what’s the point of this if you can’t buy much in the physical world with either token #1 or token #2? This will require money from the traditional monetary system.Quote from: Jet Cash on April 16, 2024, 08:29:25 AMThis could lead to decentralised swop services, and surely this is contrary to the wishes of the banking puppet masters?Decentralization is wonderful and any problem that arises always forces us to look for solutions. I would like it to be the same in this case. Because of this, the problem that has arisen will push the crypto community to create new (or improve old) convenient P2P exchange platforms.",

As we all know centralized exchanges usually asks for their clients’ kyc and they have actual access on to your funds. This means that if they deem something suspicious they can prevent you from making any transactions.This goes of course with banks. You can never expect decentralization with banks no matter what hoops and loops you go through.
