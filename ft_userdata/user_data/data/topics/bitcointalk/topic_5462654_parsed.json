If yes then what methods you are using and how do you manage your risk?It depends on your total invested amount and your ability to make good trades. Don't take trading as a primary income source. It is not what you think it is. And trading is not for everyone. Just because some other people are making profits from trading does not mean that you can do the same as well. One's loss is another's profit. So as long as people are making losses, people on the other side will make profits. And those who are making profits today will also lose someday. So keep in mind that anything could happen in the market at any time. And the amount you are talking about daily and weekly can be achieved by future trading or a huge amount if you want it from the spot trading.",

If yes then what methods you are using and how do you manage your risk?There's always a possible but there's no guarantee since we are talking about here a short timeframe trading on a volatile asset. You will need a huge capital in able to have this kind of target profit with minimal risk or else use futures trading with increase leverage if you want low capital but high risk.Indicators is not that helpful when use on short time frame because the signal it gives can be easily invalidate once someone sell or buy in huge amount. Using candle stick pattern works for me on scalping but It's very hard to be consistent on this kind of trade. Just stick your current strategy since it's already working to you. Just increase your capital if you want more gain on your long term investment.",

If yes then what methods you are using and how do you manage your risk?Daily income from day trading is possible if you know how to analyze the market and become an expert in trading. But to make $50-$100 daily profit from spot you need to trade at least with $5000. Otherwise you will not be able to make such earning daily but crypto trading never guarantees profit so no one can guarantee that you will make profit every day.Â  You can lose a single day and the losses can be big. However, crypto trading requires the ability to take risks",

You are a hodler and obviously you don't know anything in trading like you didn't say that. Asking what method is a misplaced question because it is assumed that you don't know any method yourself. So the first you need to do is to learn a bit of trading and come back to ask questions.

Remember 1% to 3% can be higher if you are in aggressive bull rally up to 5%. To make 100$ to 50$ you need to have enough capital investment to meet your requirement in the 2% or 3% profit = to the 50$ t 100$.There is no need for rocket science or unknown strategies simply follow your analysis keep an eye on the market development and be careful while taking trades with prevention measures.",

We haven't seen OP say what his capital is, but if we are talking about like a million dollars then of course its possible and if we are talking about 100 dollars then its of course not possible. Yes the amount per day matters, but what matters most is the capital. Someone who has 100 dollars will not double it per day, and someone who has 1 million dollars could make one investment, and can make 36.5k a year, just hold bitcoin, even in a few days with a bit of increase that can happen easily.

If yes then what methods you are using and how do you manage your risk?It's possible, but it's very risky, and it will require a huge amount of capital for you to be able to achieve that with minimum risk. If you have a huge amount of capital, then there is a possibility for you to earn up to $50, at least, by day trading. Let's say you have up to $100,000 in stable coins. You can choose a few coins from the market, either BTC, Eth, or BNB.With the current market condition, you can see the price is floating constantly, which means you can take the risk of buying every single hour and selling back even if it's $1â$5 added to your purchase. Before you can do that for about 3 times on different coins, you will be able to raise that. But there is also the possibility that if you purchase and wait for the price to go up a bit, it might turn against you, so you will definitely have to be considerate when you choose to enter the market.",

I used to make approximately $40 to $50 per trade with a capital of approximately $500 to $600, which is about 8% to 10% profit depending on the amount I invested and the occasion, of course. See the keyword I used, per trade. I wasn't conducting transactions on a daily basis; it depended on the market situation and how everything was performing. I'd usually buy BTC, ETH, XLM, or some other coin, hold it for a few hours to a few days at most, and then proceed to sell it. Most of my trades were successful and I never suffered any major losses, but I decided to stop because it was way too time-consuming and stressful.",

If yes then what methods you are using and how do you manage your risk?@OP, Yes, it is very possible; you can even earn more than that, just up to the amount that @MK4 stated, but what you must know is that in trading, your profit is not always certain because the crypto market can really be very volatile and could go against your predicted price, which can result in a loss on your investment. Another thing to consider is how much you are willing to risk, because that will actually also determine the level of your profit, because in Investment, the higher your Invested amount, the higher your profit. Since you said you want to trade sports on CEX, let me give you an example.Example: Yesterday, Bitcoin went from $29,300 to $30k+, so let's assume you had $58,600 in fiat and you bought two pieces of Bitcoin at $29,300 each, held it for some hours until it got to $30,120, and sold at that price. Your profit would have been $1,640 just yesterday.Assuming you had $117,200 and invested in 4 bitcoins, your profit would have been double what is stated above in one day.Also, if you are dealing with an altcoin, perhaps the price for one of those coins is just $0.21, and you bought 60,000 pieces of the coin for $12,600. Then, let's say the price of the coin just moved from $0.21 to $0.23, then your profit would be $1200; that's just one day's profit.I have only calculated the profit side of the market, but assuming the market goes against you, then you would have some loss on your investment.So, my point is that you can make even more than $50 in a day, depending on how much you are willing to risk.",

You can say i am a holder.I am very surprising if you only got profit from holding altcoins so far and did not get any loss with them.Not all altcoins even they are top altcoins will help you gaining profit by holding. Many top altcoins lost their prices from all time highs and never recovered to their all time highs, not yet mention that they failed to make new all time highs. More serious, they die with time so holding altcoins can cause losses, serious losses, not only profit.

Do you really think you can belong to minority of traders and will be able to get profit from trading?$50 or $100 profit from spot trading is possible but it depends on your trading capital. If you have a trading capital like $50,000, it is an easy target. If your trading capital is only $100 or $500, it is a very impossible target.",
