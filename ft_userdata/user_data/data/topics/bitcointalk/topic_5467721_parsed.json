Tottenham is now competing strongly with Man City.  But Arsenal is a very good team in the Premier League. Arsenal's position is after Man city. So no matter how well Tottenham play suddenly, it will be very difficult for them to win a match against Arsenal.  They will not be able to beat Arsenal very easily. Anyway there is already a topic to discuss about premier league by Trofo so it was not necessary to open this topicHere is the topic where you can discuss about Premier league Premier League Prediction Thread 2023/2024",

What if they played 90 minutes and the match ended as draw. Like 1:1 or 2:2. A match may not ended as draw and it may ended as draw. There are matches that can ended as no goal at all which is 0:0.

Arsenal is a very potential team to win. Tottenham is doing good But there are doubts whether they can win the match against Arsenal. However, Tottenham played well in the last matches and because of their good performance in the last 5 matches, they are in a better position than Arsenal in the points table. However, the match will be a tight game.  Because Tottenham's preparation is very good while Arsenal already has a very good playing record and they are considered as a good team.",

Their previous matches ended up Arsenal being victorious compared to the other.  Looking at to the comparative advantage of both teams, Arsenal is rated high in performance and actions coupled with the key players and their formation.",
