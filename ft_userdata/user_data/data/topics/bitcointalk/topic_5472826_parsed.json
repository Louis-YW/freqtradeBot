One of this plenty traps na to fall for misconception e mean say make we no get wrong idea on how we go take increase the gain wey we dey get from trading our Bitcoin for better way.Trade vs. HODLBitcoin's fundamentals make am not comparable to HODL because Bitcoin’s supply dey limited to 21M units itself. By HODLing, Bitcoin go fit increase likely in value long-term and HODLing na our safest way to dey make profit. Risk dey low and e go likely succeed.

When we dey HODLing, we de take advantage of Bitcoin scarcity. Bitcoin dey limited to 21 M BTC. and every 210,000 blocks, block rewards (for people wey de mine) e go con dey like say dey don cut away some parts, e go dey reduce new issued unit of Bitcoin go be like every 4 years. By HODLing, we just de take advantage from Bitcoin scarcity because Bitcoin na something wey dey good to dey save. E fit dey easy to disappear for Bitcoin price but as plenty people dey wey them get to hold, we go dey see say the price don dey better and e don dey more stable-Demand go dey increase for Bitcoin even more as a store of value. E fit take some years before we go fit see some better gain as per say Bitcoin price don de move for cycle for over 4years now but as e be like this HODLing don prove say e de reliable (and e go make Bitcoin no disappear like dat again). tl;dr: Better HODL, don't trade!",

But you know some people are good with this trading and again in as much as we know holding is good there other little things people can do to earn small small as they hold. What do I mean, some can try using Spot trading? Where you can buy low and sell high. This trading is very much ok for those who are not always available to trade and also if we talk about holding, we should know that buying at a low price is more advantageous than buying at the top when others are selling. I do all sha and most times use smart trend to help me know what I'm doing",

Some can use Spot trading yes, but it involves buying and selling which is mostly used by day traders but you will gain little profit, I will advise you to go for HODLing for you to benefit huge advantage wey bitcoin took to appreciate in future.",

Even if you comot the part say holding dey make Bitcoin scarce sef we need to understand something about actually holding and trading your coins for profits, the two things are different because with one there is probability and with the other there is certainty just that time is a major factor to the second one. If you are a trader then the chances of you actually losing coins is there because there is no guarantee that on your every try it will come out successful same thing as gamble, that's why many people actually tag it as an advance form of gambling while with holding there is certainty that your profits is going to come only that there is a time factor because holding of coins for profits is tied to how the market cap price value so it's depends on your patience to HODL till the market becomes favourable, for me HODLing is more preferable because the certainty is there already.",
