Seems to be wasting fees. Is it just an etherscan bug?I know that it didn't come out of my actual address because the next nonce doesn't include this transaction, which means it never came out of my wallet.",

I mean its more of a private wallet where you just hold your big money and no one knows about it. If this is just an old way to scam you then better not to look at it, or ignore it because many says if you make transaction about that specific token, then your details will be corrupted and you’ll get hacked.",

That is for preparation to make you make a mistake if somehow you copy-pasted an address from your history.  If you don't copy-paste an address from your transaction history, then you are safe.So this is like creating an opportunity for the sender to make a mistake and send the amount to the address that is created specifically for this attack.So to avoid being a victim of this Address Poisoning Attack, Make sure you don't copy the address from your transaction history.",

Getting scam tokens depossited into your wallet is nothing knew. Its been going on for years. Basically they deposit some fake token like USDT Coin and give you like 1,000,000 tokens and they list some scam website, in the same website you can exchange 1,000,000 of the token for $1,000,000 but the trick is to get your private key, this is obviously an old scam and not the same.This scam is different because it makes it seem like the token transfer came out of your wallet. At first you think your seed is compromised however when you look closer it seems like its some exploit, which it is.",

By mean developer the initial development made by the OpenZeppelin dev, do note that as an ecosystem everyone who comprehends code can see the implication of this flawed code, but, nobody bats an eye until this flaw mechanism is being used by a scammer. The code is also used by another developer, the one who made the smart contract implementation which used the OpenZeppelin library.
