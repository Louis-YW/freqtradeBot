Such as the moderators, support, developers and marketing.QuoteI think it would be great to add another rule about posting their work in progress (WIP) on a separate album if their entry is in a digital format just to avoid any issues about A.I generated artworks. Thanks for the contest.For that, I have already added the \"Submissions must be accompanied by each participant's 500 ID and Bitcointalk username (e.g. a piece of paper)\" rule so it would be much harder to use those tools.
