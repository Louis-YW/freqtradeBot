  "content": "There are many people who trade on BitcoinTalk forums. Those who trade must control their emotions. If not, you will have a huge loss in trading. Why emotion is needed while trading is as follows:1. Profitability: Profitability in the crypto market is very dynamic and variable. Traders' emotions create interest and excitement about their profits.2. Volatility: The crypto market is volatile, i.e. prices can change rapidly. Having emotion with this position can help traders as it is important to make timely diagnosis.Here are some ways to control these emotions:1. Don't expect much profit. For example: You think that you will become rich by investing in a coin.2. After you have invested in a coin, you find that for some reason it has gone down in the market. At this time, without being emotional, you first look at the condition of the token, what condition it is in, and then take a decision with a cool head.3. Avoid revisiting a coin after investing. You place a sell order with a specific target.4. Trade according to market conditions. Don't immediately invest in someone's words.5. Stay calm and try to control temporary emotions.",

Stay calm and try to control temporary emotions.I think the most crucial thing for a trader is to truly understand what you're doing. When you have a solid grasp of your strategy, your emotions are less likely to take the wheel. You're confident that your approach will lead to profits, which lets you stay calm while you work. Trading is a mental game, and once emotions get involved, they can cloud your judgment, leading to regrets later on.As you spend more time trading, you're bound to experience a full spectrum of emotions. The market's wild volatility can be like a roller coaster ride. But with knowledge and experience, you're more likely to maintain discipline.One last piece of advice: don't mix trading and drinking. Trust me on this based on my experience.",

Stay calm and try to control temporary emotions.You can add \"a profit is a profit,\" or, in short, don't be too greedy. I personally experienced this and learned my lesson in a hard way. What I mean is that in the past, when I started trading crypto, I couldn't get satisfied with a little earning; I wanted more, and because of that, I kept losing trades and still didn't stop because I wanted to chase my losses. Little do I know, I have become too greedy, resulting in more losses than earnings. That's why it's important to also control your greed; don't even think about being greedy. All you've stated is true and should be followed. Let's see more of the people in this forum to see what they will add to your list. I know many here experience a lot of stuff in terms of trading, and I'm talking about the negative happenings. But we are not perfect, so sometimes we still repeat the wrong deed. Maybe we just have to set boundaries to control ourselves.",

Occasionally talk to yourself and remind yourself that  emotions and trading do not pair well. A trader who is more aware of their emotional vulnerability will be a better at controlling it so that it does not affect them when they trade. A trader who has not accepted that they are prone to emotional mistakes will still be be vulnerable to it because of lack of acceptance. Accepting that you are emotionally vulnerable can help you take better control of it.",

We don’t need to worry ourselves too much, unlike other altcoins.",

But if you trade altcoins, you analyze the coins to find the right coin with good movements so you can enter the market and buy and sell them at the price you want.You really have to be able to control your emotions when trading. If you have good analytical skills in trading, you will know when to trade and when to exit the market. So in this case, you must be able to control yourself when trading and not be greedy by hoping for bigger profits. If the market continues to increase, you can expect big profits. But if not, you should take existing profits while continuing to trade if the situation allows.For this reason, you must continue to learn to analyze the market so that your abilities can improve according to market conditions. Everything takes time, even to make a profit. So keep learning and practicing so you can get benefits.",

That analysis before making a purchase or investment is the most important and first thing that an investor or trader must do. Don't let an investor/trader make a spontaneous purchase due to FOMO or other factors without detailed analysis, what happens instead of being a profit but a loss due to falling prices and then panic selling. At least the results of the analysis made can provide more rational choices in making all investment or trading decisions.Quote from: Spark22 on October 22, 2023, 05:39:02 AM5. Stay calm and try to control temporary emotions.I think many people know that emotions are a source of profit and loss. If someone is able to control their emotions most of them will get the benefits they have at least planned for. On the other hand, uncontrolled emotions usually have a worse impact on investing and trading, resulting in losses and even loss of investment/trading funds. Greed includes uncontrolled emotions.",

Cant really resist on not to look up on the coin you have invested, of course you would really be liking on checking its price every now and then.  4. Depends on what type or kind of investor or trader are you.There are ones who do actively deal up with the market but there are ones who do tend to hold for long term.It would really vary.5. Easy to say but would really be that hard to be done specially if you do see your portfolio is going down. then it is really that just impossiblethat you would really be making yourself that numb in speaking about emotions.It cant really just that possible but with due have that enough experiencethen it would really be that just giving you the idea on what are the things that must do.",

That's what is very dangerous, greed, therefore maybe before you enter the trade also surely you have heard that the role of greed is absolutely not recommended in this profession, none other than this will greatly endanger yourself, instead of getting profits but instead end up with losses. Although well as we know that greed must exist in every human being but it will always be a bad start for any field or any condition that you are experiencing. Therefore it is highly recommended for every trader especially for those beginners who just came to build their best plan, especially in terms of take profit and also stop los, it is very important in your trading journey, and also it will be able to prevent you from greed. It doesn't matter if you can only get a small profit on each of your trades, it's better to be small but consistent and also on the other hand your risk will not be too big instead of looking for a large profit which of course will be very difficult to get and also if you look in terms of risk it is very large, so it's better to be small but consistent, that's all because as you said if it is multiplied in a month or a year then it is quite large.",

You place a sell order with a specific target.4. Trade according to market conditions. Don't immediately invest in someone's words.5. Stay calm and try to control temporary emotions.First and most important, only invest in Bitcoin. If you can not control your emotion for your investment in Bitcoin, you will be more erratically emotional with altcoins.Because if Bitcoin drops 10%, altcoins will fall like 20% or 30% so I am sure you will face with more serious roller coasters with altcoins than with Bitcoin.Start with Bitcoin to minimize your loss by emotional panic and if you already succeed with investment in Bitcoin, already join the market a few years, you will understand this market and will be able to control your emotion better for investment in altcoins.With altcoins, risk is bigger, loss might be bigger too. Your emotion will be more fluctuating than with Bitcoin.",
