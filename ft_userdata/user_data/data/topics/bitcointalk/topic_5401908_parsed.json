      "body": "share of Mining experiences will be useless to build any planning or ideas on mining because they differ according to the most prominent factors.where you are and how much your electricity per W?Did you buy mining equipment and what is the price?Area, weather, and cooling process of mining equipment.Noise control (if you are in a remote village you may not care)Average mining yield and bitcoin price? Are you planning to hold coins for a long time and have enough cash to start?Opportunity cost (buying bitcoin instead of mining it)And many, many more factors that make storytelling useless.The only thing you can profit from is the mistakes of others",

Biomass energy is not cheap and diesel-powered generators are far more costly than grid and not designed to run 24/7/ all year long.Quote from: Skot on June 19, 2022, 10:04:18 PMOn the large-scale solar mining side of things, Blockstream and Block (Square) have an interesting project going; https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-and-block-inc-s-solar-mining-facility-now-powered-by-tesla-solar-pv-and-megapack/I'm looking forward to seeing some more information published about this projectThey are hosting 250 of their 60 000 miners on a small solar farm with a few tesla batteries, it was just a publicity stunt to show they could go green, nothing else meanwhile they are expanding their gas-powered data center in Adel by 100MW to 400MW, just the expansion is 25x times than of their solar patch.",
