If you don't have anything valuable in there, it will be in your best interest to abandon the wallet.",

If the wallet is usually drained once you make a transfer into it, then it is a case of Sweeper bot which is like a script assigned to your wallet and this code automatically transfers the coins on a certain blockchain that is affected, in this case it could be the BNB blockchain. MetaMask has recently provided a guide on how to Fighting back against sweeper bots, read through it maybe it could help solve your problem Quote from: GxSTxV on September 06, 2023, 12:28:47 PM- I didn’t access, login or leave my wallet in any place that has internet until last week to participate in ZenLand review Campaign.- That address where my BNB were sent to is no more than two months old and when last time I logged and used my wallet is mire than three months and that time my wallet wasn’t infected.- I don’t have any walletconnect attached to my wallet or token approval which i always revoke.I just went to search out the thread that I saw a similar post and when I found it, your reply there actually means that you have one way or the other actually connect your wallet before to a DApps maybe not the metamask but another wallet and probably you though disconnecting the Web3 DApps and moving to another wallet (from trustwallet to metamask) will solve the issue and as it is now it is still that same bot on that BNB blockchain that is still affecting you. The best thing is to forget that wallet and create an entire new one with a different keys and seeds and also read about the sweeper bots from the link provided up",

The scammer has hundreds of transactions containing the value of 777 wei, and this indicates that the scammer managed to inject his malicious bot into the victims' wallets, and he succeeded in this by stealing and accessing the private key/recovery phrases. Sad to lose GxSTxV, but lucky that he only deposited $2 of BNB from Binance and discovered this transaction; it's good that he didn't deposit hundreds of dollars; they would have been transferred directly to the scammer's wallet.Quote from: khaled0111 on September 06, 2023, 11:13:53 PMIt's clear your wallet is being cleared by a sweeper bot, as other members suggested, but the real question that only you can answer:is how your device got infected / seed exposed? This is an excellent question, and the OP should look into the main reason that led to his wallet security information being exposed, as computer cracks, torrent programs, fake browser extensions, and cracked mobile applications and interactions with Dapps are among the common reasons.",

If you all could see that my last transaction on my BNB address is 150 days long, and it’s the last time maybe even before i logged in to that Metamask wallet using a computer or android device since then i was using it on my IPAD device and not doing anything with it as i don’t receive or send funds with it. And all that time I’m sure i wasn’t hacked or however the funds get moved out from it just like a sweeper.The only thing I can think of is if it’s possible to get hacked on an IOS device and get your wallet Private keys stolen?Quote from: NotATether on September 07, 2023, 09:45:40 AMCan you get a copy of the smart contract inside any of the BNB transactions and paste it here?I don’t think that’s possible to get the transaction smart contract, it’s appears as a transfer transaction",

You can learn full about sweeper working process in Below articlehttps://blog.mycrypto.com/how-to-beat-an-ethereum-based-sweeper-and-recover-your-assetsIf you used your wallet in PC then I am pretty sure that all problem happened there because pc security is very low and installing any unknown publisher app/game will enter malware your pc. These malware leak your personal data ,keyboard key and copy text. Once hackers get your secret key than he use sweepers and we cannot send our tokens or do any action because gas fee automatically transfer to hacker address. I will recommend to use mobile wallet when you create new wallet and don't store cloudy, only save in hard copy. This is much better because possibility of risk is low in mobile.",

After looking everywhere for the exact reason my wallet keys were stolen I think before I stopped using it on my computer I downloaded a program called tool kit windows to activate office package. It’s not a certain thing but somehow the hack happened on my PC as it’s impossible to happen on a mobile device that I use only for surfing.I read that article you shared and even Metamask shared a similar article on how to beat these sweepers for people that have assets and tokens other than the main coins BTC,BNB,ETH….., for me I don’t have any tokens in my wallet so I don’t need to do these steps which are possible for people that want to withdraw their tokens but the sweeper eats instantly the gas fees they need to use for withdrawal.Best thing to do is to avoid opening any wallet on a computer device that is attached to internet that much and used for things.
