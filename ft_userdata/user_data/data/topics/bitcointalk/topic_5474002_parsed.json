All messages between me and pirate were also subject to subpoena, so this is a confirmed fact by law enforcement. That‚Äôs why nothing happened to me while others went to jail. Quote from: Vod on November 16, 2023, 12:33:24 AM- How many coins did you pay out of your emergency fund? (this is a number)All of them. Luckily, near the end of pirate‚Äôs run there were quite a few people offering better deals than myself, so everyone withdrew their deposits from my program before the collapse to deposit with other members who offered better deals. 2 people left their profits in knowing they would be covered by the ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù (your words), which they were. That is why you can‚Äôt find a victim from my deposit program. There are none.

As for the trust abuse, anyone can see that for themselves as well. You claim I‚Äôm gravitate (total nonsense) you claim I‚Äôm MrDove (that was a team of people I actually met in real life), you claim I stole from the forum (my title is Donator) which is not true or theymos wouldn‚Äôt trust me like he distrusts you. Not to mention all the other nonsense ratings you‚Äôve left me which I believe amount to libel and would get you in hot water if I felt like it mattered enough to care. As far as the current state of the DT network of course it bothers me. You can see in my trust settings that I don‚Äôt trust DT and haven‚Äôt for years, primarily because there are members there who trust you, even after the constant provable lies, harassment, and extortion attempts.I‚Äôve answered all your questions.
