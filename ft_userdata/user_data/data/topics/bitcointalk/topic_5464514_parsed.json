      "body": "Welcome to the forum Playbita.I really like the animation, although this kind game is nothing new and many casinos already have, but your idea are different and it's more exciting. What coins you accept? it's only tokens that run in Polygon? if you said yes, then this thread should be moved to altcoins discussion. You must accept Bitcoin if you want your thread to stay in this section.",

Any chance the team would explore other blockchains in the future? We have plenty of casino offering the same Bitcoin up & down games. Do you guys plan to add other games on your platform?Thanks.",

The nice part of this game is that the winner sure will get a huge prize every win than in binary game. Well, see how it will go whether many people will join.Its using Polygon though so the guy above must be right when he says the thread belong somewhere else. Nice looking site though and welcome to bitcointalk.",

It tends to fill my entire screen. It feels like it has been designed for mobile.This feels especially apparent in the different menus.Sometimes Polygon is slow so the bet does not register, happened quite a few times. Also Metamask can be slow to open, so that slows it down further.I also feel like the stat pages need some love, especially ones that show your wagered and should show your profits. Instead main detail seems to be put on affiliate systems and stats based on those.With all that sayd, the game itself is weirdly entertaining.",

This game is like the pancakeswap version of bears vs bulls but the difference is anyone can join while the games is still at play. Nice game but you should improve the UI that will fit larger screen device.",

I was curious about who was already playing on that site because I saw that several players were already playing.With the Wallet Connect option, we can connect the Trust wallet to be able to play. The site also has another option: Social Wallet, which will link with Google Pay and others. It's a great option for those who want to use Google Pay.",

      "body": "Welcome into this forum Playbita!As i have browsed in that this is really just only accepting MATIC.The game is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which allows players to make predictions on the price of Bitcoin. Players can join pools that predict whether the price will go up or down, and invest a certain amount of Polygon (MATIC) to participate. The game uses smart contracts to ensure the integrity and security of the game's results. The final outcome of each round is determined by the expiry rate, which is based on the live market rate of the asset at the time of the round's closing. Profits are distributed to players in the form of the Polygon (MATIC) token, which is automatically distributed to their digital wallet.Source: https://playbita.com/faqI do love the graphics and animation which everything is really that smooth and good looking.Checking out the game then it is really that pertaining about that like a binary options on which guessing out price movement and bet into it. I do love that decentralized way or method since you would be connecting your own wallet.",

I do love that decentralized way or method since you would be connecting your own wallet.^ Definitely right, the UI and the graphics look great because of the combination of golden yellow, red, and black.I visited the site which amazed me but there are some buttons that have not been finished yet there, is the tutorial option which ends up in a FAQ section. I think you need to address that problem once you have a video of tutorials. However, that is looking good it seems like you are fully oriented on making the ANN thread, so you should actively answer queries here. Welcome, and good luck in your future endeavors.",

But, I'm still curious that how the platform makes money with a game like that? Are there any fees that the platform cuts when the players place their bets or it takes some money from the winning players? It would be great if you explain that in detail because we all want to know that how it works.",

The animation and cartoon material used can somehow attract users to test the site. Since it's decentralized, no need for any registration, and players can bet right away, of course, if there is an available balance (Matic) on their respective wallet.Anyways, the minimum bet is 5 Matic which is around $2.7 as of the current exchange rate. Any chance of lowering the minimum bet? Since this is gambling, the minimum can kill right away anyone's wallet lol.",
