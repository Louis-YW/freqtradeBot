Because the OP here tells the story behind making his first Pizza. So even if it has something to do with a bitcoin pizza baking contest. But it seems the OP's intention was to tell the story behind making his first pizza that relates to his friend's curious interest in bitcoin.Quote from: Kaliandra on May 28, 2023, 05:16:50 AMÂ  ....I appreciate your efforts OP in making pizza. Even though it seems that what you said is true, namely that you are not good at cooking, your desire to participate and liven up the contest deserves a thumbs up.Actually I also intend to follow it. and actually I intend today to make it if I get off work. but sadly my job doesn't let it. because I have a target that must be completed quickly in my work. and indeed my type of work does not recognize red dates. if target has to be completed then i have to do it. A field that is fun but also makes me tired sometimes. but because I work in a field that is a hobby that I like, I enjoy it.I hope I can enter the pizza baking contest before the time ends.And about your friends who are interested in bitcoin, I hope you advise your friends to seek more insight regarding Bitcoin. Maybe you could even invite him to this forum to learn more. But with only $30 and it being used for investing in bitcoin then I think it's still a decent experiment step. as long as he uses money that is really ready if he has to suffer a loss.and don't forget to also remind your friends not to store their assets in a centralized Exchange. and teach him a lesson about personal Wallet.",

Introducing one person to Bitcoin is also not a small deal because that person can introduce more people. I also appreciate the fact that you informed your friend about the risks involved in investing. It is also good he invested a little money because he can afford to lose it.

Quote from: Kaliandra on May 28, 2023, 05:16:50 AMand he said he wanted to try with small money first so that the risk was not too big if he suffered a loss.and I said yes, it was a good decision.It is good decision to start investing in bitcoins with a small amount, but there is a better decision if you have not been informed. Bitcoin is not a ponzi were you put in a little money (in their terms \"invest\"), and get a very ridiculous return. That is why newbies to bitcoin after understanding what bitcoin is, it's benefits and what it is about are also encouraged the need need to develop a strategy to invest more often than once through a strategy called DCA (Dollar-cost averaging). Waiting for a very small investment in bitcoins to grow into some ridiculous amount is futile and a waste of time.",

Also, you can introduce him to the forum so he can learn and discover more about Bitcoin.As for your contest journey OP, I haven't tried baking or cooking for Bitcoin or any crypto related contest, but it would be interesting to join if I have a time cause that looks fun.

Investment usually provides stable income, while BTC can either bring money after a long period of time, or prevent from losing money in case of fiat inflation. So BTC is not an investment, it's better to be described as the purchase of a valuable digital asset.",
