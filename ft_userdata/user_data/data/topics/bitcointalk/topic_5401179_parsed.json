  "content": "I've been looking for an alternative to UST and Anchor Protocol (which have nearly killed me).I also have been trying to make profits out of trading on Binance - spot and future, but honestly I've been losing more money on trading.All DeFi platforms warns me with very small letters at the corner of the screen saying there's a possibility of impermanent loss and I'm sick of that after what happened to Anchor.I've been looking for another yield farming platforms but guarantee (kinda) the principle, without impermanent losses. So I would say no to DeFis.I checked out http://loanscan.io and figured that Delio and ICONFi give pretty nice yield rates but Delio wants me to use Bithumb exchange, a Korean exchange I don't wanna sign in.So I'm checking out www.ICON-Fi.com and it seems legit to me - anyone who has experiences with it? I also checked out on Google and found some articles like this (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iconfi-stop-losing-crypto-trading-024200675.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM3s8UePzsvkhQIC8SH1e4ffPtIS9iLQvcnwFUPvtUX3fh9Mg0s4VPbFkRHiI3Trvla3OcybYn8rH6QghGyrs3u_qOjYM-euMs9Kb0gSih-u9-YVt1TJTzxYryWFUtZwQz2Dxpg130-X2WbGN4UgljXIoSjGZ6gYFeW_skKSTt_h) and the app rating is pretty high on Appstore.Its Twitter account is pretty active and when I left a question on its Discord channel, the admin answered very quickly and most of all, I love compound interests and it doesn't have a tricky tier system like Blockfi. When I did the calculation if I deposit BTC on Blockfi, the interest rate plummets to 0.7%. It was a bummer. ICONFi suggests 8.33%, I think I would be satisfied with this considering the fact that I've made losses on trading by myself. 11.67% on USDT & USDC is much better than the stupid bank interests.If there's anyone who knows well about ICONFi or ICON community? I may try some deposits on ICONFi, but I just wanna be careful on this cuz LUNA and UST took nearly 70% of my savings for retirement.",

But, in case you are not shilling the shit service, My advice is avoiding it completely.This whole staking thing feels like Ponzi scheme 2.0. Sooner or later, you will not get the expected APY or lose all your funds when the market crashes.",

But with a long post, I find it easy to assume that you are just making up story, and trying to build something on iconfi as alternative which is a shilling style. You can do that but no need to reference a fake story, cause people here probably got lost a lot by Luna.",

Good job.Quote ICONFi suggests 8.33%If BlockFi which is pretty much famous among the centralized out there has shrunken their interest, this ICONFi will also come to that path too knowing that we hardly heard of it.",

Actually this kind of method is not convincing anymore and for sure people will not see this as cool stuff.Let the case of Do Kwon sentenced by legal authority because if they found that there's valid grounds to put him in jail then for sure we can see that to happen.",

I must admit that before I got to the advertisement part, the text I read was very convincing and I believed everything. However, as I started reading about the amazing stats and results it became clear that it is only promotional post.",

Why are you still trying to buy the garbage token like this. My first time to see that this company is exist. If you didn't wanna get another luna and you shall avoid to deal with this project. Your money will be wasted for nothing. I don't know whether you are really loosing a lot in luna but this will make sense if you were learning from your past experience.",
