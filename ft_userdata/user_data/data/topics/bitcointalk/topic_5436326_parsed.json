  "content": "I joined the futures trading platform a few months ago. There I buy 50 SOL 6x. After I participated, a bad news hit the market. And the bad news is that FTX is bankrupt. Then there was a huge loss on my futures trading platform. I continued to liquidation there without giving up. At one point while adding liquidation my total balance became very high and liquidation also came down and loss went to high level. The bloody year 2022 ends and in 2023 the market is slowly pumping and all my losses are recovered and I see profit.",

Please book profits or atleast start to have sl above your entry once it gets substantially above it. Do you have a target in mind ?Edit:Quote from: un_rank on January 22, 2023, 06:26:42 AMDo not reveal your trading or wallet balance here as it gives random people too much information about you.Agreed!, @OP you should remove those screenshots, you dont need to prove yourself to anyone, and neither any legit user is interested in seeing the screenshots of others' balance.",

Be clear, you continued to \"gamble\" without giving up.This is a common mistake for people who are new to trading. They always think that their trade will always go in a good way so they intend not to use any method of risk management like setting stop loss and target price.Another thing OP must learn is how much amount to allocate per trade, so you will still have some capital left once you need to trade again.",

This condition is not over yet because it looks like the market will shake and some coins can increase and give us profit. But we really have to be able to choose coins to trade futures because if we don't, we will incur losses. So be careful with your trading time and take your profit while you can.",

Lucky you got it back, that's good news of course. But if you don't get it back, then it's a bigger loss that will get.",

How can show the success if he didnât show balance itself. Although a percentage growth can be shared but showing the amount will give an easy overview about his share. Besides he will be safe as long as he didnât share personal information related to his login credentials. Thereâs a lot of whales on the collectibles section buying and selling premium items with insane amount same on lending section which lender has a list on how much other user borrowed them. @OP, nice trade with that future trading. I think your low leverage helps you to withstand more possible liquidation during the downtrend since SOL price swing is very strong that time.",

I hope I won't get tempted to use that trade feature again this year. Usually, I lost most of my futures trades. Maybe I am so tight with my stop loss so it is not fit to my trading style.
