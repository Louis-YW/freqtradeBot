  "content": "I am currently working on a crypto collectible and play-2-earn game Bit Fighters. Bit Fighters are 12 fighters with different level of rarity depending on the maximum number of times these can be minted. The rarer the fighter, the more power and morale it will carry, that will make it more likely to win fights and earn $BUCK - the in-game currency. $BUCK will be freely transferable among players and anyone with a BEP-20 wallet, and in the game will be used to recruit fighters, train fighters to upgrade them and to enter into fights / tournaments.Who are the Bit Fighters?Back stories of each fighters, along with detail of their rarity / mints, power and morale can be found at https://bitfighters.io. Power, morale, experience, and how well a fighter has been trained makes up the overall strength of the fighter.How will the Bit Fighters be minted?There are only a fixed number of bit fighters that can ever be minted, and each fighter can only be minted a certain number of times depending on its rarity. After all the fighters have been minted, they can be acquired through the open market. How will the fights happen?Two type of fights will be possible:Player vs Game: You will choose an \"evil\" fighter owned by the game to put up your fighter against, and the probability of you winning will depend upon your fighter, and the difficulty of the opponent you have chosen to fight against. Both you and the game will put up $BUCK for the fight that goes in the fight pool, and the winner gets the entirety of the fight pool.Player vs Player: Players can put up their fighter open to fights against other players that are up to a certain strength, and players can choose to fight against any of such opponents. They may choose to take on fighters that are much stronger, or take on weaker fighters as long as their fighter's strength fall within what the opponent chooses to fight against. Each fighter can only do a certain number of fights that will depend on the fighter's stamina and the damage taken during their last fight.How the fighters can be trained?Fighters can be trained by getting into a gym in exchange of $BUCK for each visit.Want to be a part of the project?Follow the project on Twitter and Discord.",
