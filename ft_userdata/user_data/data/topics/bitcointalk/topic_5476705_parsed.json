I think this is the first time this wojak will face the bull.  And if this is really the first time it participates in the bull run, I will not hesitate to invest in it because it has potential and neither do the exchanges that it belongs to, for example, BTSE, which is around 535k in daily trading volume, which is not bad at all for me.https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wojak",

We have seen this with doge and shiba INU the price of those meme coins was manipulated. The volume was so intense in shiba inu that binance could not resist listing it in their exchange. Also there was so much hype about the meme project in the last bull run that there is a nominal chance that there will be another one again as in the crypto market same trend never happens twice.",

Because they want to earn huge from it since some of meme coin get a huge price run that's why many of meme coin investor want to see something like that to happen so there investment from it will grow more. But they didn't realize how risky to invest on such projects especially on new one since we all know that this is just pure hype anytime investor or even its dev can abandon it then create a new meme coin for them to milk like a cow. Also expect more meme coin to come out when bull run came since they also want to ride up on the hype for people thinking that there's lot of thing that we can invest at this time that's why they go out and create a lot of tokens so that they can manipulate and make their wallet fat as hell.",

Looking at the chart of this meme token, it is currently pumped up, hence, the interest.However, traders should be very attentive to this market if they happen to buy some. Most meme tokens are driven by pump and dump scheme, so I would say, they are in the pumping period.High likely that couple of weeks or so, you will see a decline on its price. Let's see.",

Merely investing in memecoin, there's risks involved, we just have to sit down and examine the project and ensure we invest in it genuinely without having to get involved due to the overhyped trends in the market. Wojak is a memecoin that got peak in the market during memecoin season and it doesn't reach the require expectations of investors who have solemnly invested in the project, you know next thing they're hoping for? Though some early investors have smiled from the project because they have counted good profits from the memecoin.",

Investing in meme coins is very risky as these are nothing more than pump and dump projects. The coin pumped soon after its release, but it was short lived as it dumped just a few days after reaching its ATH and it has remained relatively stable since then, but for those that are interested in meme coins this should be an easy choice, since it is a given that many more meme coins will get created during the next months and people could forget about Wojak and it may never pump again, so if I was interested in those coins, which I am not, I will avoid this coin.",

This coin is still young and if it's a meme coin that has already a lot of market cap then good luck to all of you folks who have this. You'll never know if it's going to be back with that top line on the chart because for me, it's going to take time or maybe in the bull until you can make money from it.
