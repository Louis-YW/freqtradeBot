Bitcoin halving is fast approaching, giving many people hope of investment, and making reasonable profit at the end. Yet in some countries it is completely illegal. What will you do if you are a fan of bitcoin and your country did not legalize cryptocurrency?The main reason for government not accepting the Bitcoins is the decentralised nature of the coin. Due to this the government cannot control the Bitcoins or neither can impose tax on it. Hence they not making Bitcoins legal. If you are a crypto user, and government is setting up restrictions for you, then you can directly to P2P transactions to buy or sell the coins. You need not have to rely on the exchanges on your country, and no one can know how many Bitcoins you are holding in your wallet.",

Because one thing you must know is that if a government have decided not to legalize it simply because they want to remain in control over the people's money, I don't think there is anything any individual can do to, and as such the best thing any individual can do is to get a fraction of Bitcoin as an investment asset for the future, in as much as owing it is not regarded as a crime.",

An internet user however who is interested in BTC or other cryptocurrency will still be buying coins online despite the government making it illegal. There are lots of ways still to buy and earn BTC though, the P2P platforms are growing in numbers so a fan/investor will find ways just like the people who are from countries that banned BTC.",

Years back, Bitcoin was banned in my country and it doesn't bother me, at first it does but I found the right peer to peer exchange and I keep doing my thing with Bitcoin, the only way I will respect ban on Bitcoin is if there will be stop and search of every citizens in the country law, passed down by the government themselves. I believe that's never going to happen, so what will stop you from having Bitcoin even while it's banned in your country? The government hates what they can't conquer and Bitcoin is what gives me a head over the government control, I will choose Bitcoin over Banks every time.",

Bitcoin halving is fast approaching, giving many people hope of investment, and making reasonable profit at the end. Yet in some countries it is completely illegal. What will you do if you are a fan of bitcoin but your country did not legalize cryptocurrency?The problem is that when Bitcoin is prohibited in the country there is always a fine or jail term that violators of this ban will face. Since bitcoin is an international currency you can always bypass your country's restrictions and have access to the bitcoin market. You have some options of how you can still transact with bitcoin, Â but these options can be risky and untrustworthy. One way is through P2P but you have to be careful not to transact with an undercover police officer. Such country also have a large number of underground illegal exchanges but they are also risky because you can easily lose money. Using exchanges is not an option due to KYC issues and using a VPN can be detrimental. To avoid issues with law enforcement agents you can move to a neighboring country to carryout your transactions and come back. If you have the opportunity to move permanently to another friendly country, it could be an option. But if you are a long-term bitcoin investor, mastering privacy skills can help you keep your coin secret. But it will be better to be a law-abiding citizen of your country.",

For example, in our country, crypto is fully banned, but many people are openly showing and sharing the signals on their YouTube channels or different social media channels. Even the government has banned the use of crypto.But in some countries, they have banned the use of crypto and transactions directly into the banks, just like the recent news in the UK in which they banned the use of BTC, like, in p2p, directly through banks.The point is, even though crypto is banned, crypto enthusiasts could still buy BTC, but it became hard for them to buy hardware like hardware wallets, etc. They have to find alternative ways to summarise them in it.I am not suggesting or asking anyone to do it, I am just stating the facts and knowledge I have gathered through this forum. Aside from that, we can trade or hold BTC if we have relatives in another country where crypto is not banned. Or simply we can do it under the nose of the governments but that's of course risky.",

There are thousands of people in my country using Bitcoin this way. And there are no hopes for Bitcoin legalization soon. Maybe in the future but not at this moment. There's a saying that I heard somewhere but can't remember where. It goes like this. If your government is ruining your country, not allowing you to have freedom and you are lacking opportunity, leave your country where you can do business freely. When you become successful, come back to your country to take it all back even more powerfully. So if I ever get a chance to leave this country, I will take that opportunity and won't come back until BTC is legal here.",

It means currently government hasn't imposed any policy on Bitcoin as far as it's not illegal I'm standing with Bitcoin whenever they will try to Ban Bitcoin we will stand by adopting the Legal procedure to fight in court. There is a similar kind of confused scenario in many other countries where there is no ruling on the Bitcoin favor a side. But the technological development and the era of adoption there will definitely be definitely in future a ruling in favour of Bitcoin. The case of Never legalizing Bitcoin is not possible at least in those countries where democracy is taken in count even I do recognize that the democracy is just by name still, with that implementation s well there is right of freedom of speech and with that power Bitcoin will be recognized as the Worlds only asset.",

The term 'not legalized yet' and 'declared illegal' are two different things. The former can be considered somewhat positive, as there's still hope it will become legal in the future. However, if they declare it illegal, that means you should avoid violating the law, especially if the penalties are severe.You can still own Bitcoin, but do so at your own risk.Also, keep in mind that halving does not automatically present an investment opportunity. There's no guarantee that what we've witnessed in the past will be the same scenario in the future. The market is full of hype, making it riskier, so it's essential to exercise caution.",

What will you do if you are a fan of bitcoin but your country did not legalize cryptocurrency?You are right in saying that Bitcoin has provided so many opportunities, which include trading and also jobs for others who work and get paid in Bitcoin.Halving, on the other hand, is a time where we expect Bitcoin to attain a new all-time high due to the halve of the miners reward that will result in Bitcoin having more value compared to before. This is an opportunity for people that have strong capital to make money if they invest now and sell after halving, but this should not make you borrow money to invest due to fear of missing out because of the risk involved and how volatile the Bitcoin market is.One of the main reasons why most countries don't want to accept or legalize Bitcoin is because of its decentralization. The government always wants something they can control, and we all know that they cannot control bitcoin, which is why they don't want to accept it.",
