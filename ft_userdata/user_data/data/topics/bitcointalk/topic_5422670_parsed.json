From all indications this is a clear fraudulent scheme. From what I gathered they are offering to give investors daily profit from their investment. And they are using Warren Buffett’s company; Berkshire Hathaway to attract potential prey they might think that the Buffet owns this scam company. You would be shocked to later discover that many people have invested in this firm because of greed and lack of contentment. The issues with most of these firm is that law enforcement agencies would not start investigation and dismantle this scam site until people loose millions of dollars. Immediately people lose funds, anti-bitcoin forces would start their smear campaign with the failure of the scam scheme.",
