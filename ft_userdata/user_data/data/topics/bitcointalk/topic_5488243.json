It's a digital currency and not fiat. I don't understand what the use of this, when we have centralized exchanges that has same function like you have stated. But have to know that the best way to store your Bitcoins is by your self, in non custodial wallets and offline. Don't store your coins with third parties NOT YOUR KEY NOT YOUR COINS. With this idea you've stated, peoples funds might be at risk as it's not even secured or safe way to store for a long term.",

Seems pretty damn expensive. Pretty dang easy to safely store bitcoin yourself for free once you know what you are doing.Besides there have for a long time been services like this. I'm thinking of one that I think starts with an X, maybe its a Swiss company. I forget exactly, but its been around for like a decade for HNWI to store massive amounts of bitcoin for them. But really it's not hard to take a few precautions to safely secure your own bitcoin, no matter how much you own. That's one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin! Use secrecy, encryption, and redundancy. That's all you need.",

Op I must tell you, you brought a very wrong idea to the forum and that will not even included in the plan of bitcoin even in the future. Well what you saying is not far from centralized exchanges so you can save your coins in the central exchange platform but remember once you do that the coins will never be your custody again but the owners of the exchange will be in control of your coins. But if you are referring to bitcoin to be saved in bank then lock this thread because that will never happen in any day.",

Surely you understand how absurd that sounds?  What more security concerns could you possibly build into a system than requiring people to give up ownership of their money and entrust it in custody to some shady third party? Honestly, if someone wants long-term crypto storage, they have far better options - like hardware wallets. Your idea, frankly, creates more problems than it solves.",

So it doesn't make sense to store your bitcoin with banks and hand over ownership of your bitcoin to them. It's the same as when you are storing your bitcoin on an exchange or custodial wallet. Your funds aren't secured until you hold them in a non-custodial wallet. I don't like how the traditional banking system works. They always ask questions when you deposit and withdraw your funds there. Crypto is not the same as fiat; Bitcoin is decentralised, and that's why it's become much more popular.",

You will just end up with another variant of a crypto exchange. There's no innovation here. You obviously haven't done a needs assessment.

Wow! These ideas are very wrong, @OP. I am not surprised at all, because it's an idea from a real newbie. It shows how unaware you are of so many security and privacy factors of the Bitcoin technology. @OP, Have you read the Bitcoin white paper? Have you asked yourself why Bitcoin holds such great value? Have you asked yourself why the developer of Bitcoin decided to be anonymous? First, Bitcoin was developed to give individuals financial privacy regarding the management of their money and finances. In the past, people usually saved, stored, and managed their finances with the help of banks and other traditional financial systems, and by doing these, you exposed your identity to third parties, which in some cases led to insecurity and threatened the lives of some millionaires and billionaires. But after Bitcoin got developed, it created room for financial privacy. Users of Bitcoin can now peacefully store their Bitcoin in their own custodial wallet without the help of any third party or without revealing their identity. @OP, If we are going by your idea, it means we are still taking ourselves back to the old way of putting our money in the hands of a third party, with our identity being revealed to them. If the government decides to raid your bank, they can get all the information and identities of all the Bitcoiners, and that is really against the Bitcoin rule. Bitcoin is a private asset that you can have without letting anyone know about it, unless you just want to disclose the information to your family. Op, your idea is off, but stick around and you will learn a lot.",
