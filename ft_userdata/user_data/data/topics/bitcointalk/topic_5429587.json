How much of the losses you will cover 10%, 50%, 100%? Are you willing to use an escrow?Yes i accept escrow.It will be one month insurance plan.For example If you use 100$ margin for each trade.For margin used for each trade it will be 120$ for 1monthYour margin used for each trade + 20% = your 1 month insurance plan.And 20% coverage from each stop loss. Here is how:If stop loss occured with 100$ margin you get refunded 20% wich is 20$ from 100$.You get instant refund so no waiting money will come in your wallet instantly the 20$ If signal will hit the stop loss.If you use Margin 300$ for each trade then your 1 month insurance will be 360$ After every one month you need to pay insurance again.Your 1 months insurance plan price will be Equal with your Margin to be used with each trade + 20% your stop loss coverage.Let's explain again ....Trader John using Margin 100$ for each trade so his insurance fee will be 120$ for 1 month period of insurance contract. Every time when signal will hit the stop loss he get payed  20% of the margin in to his wallet instantly.The trading channel monthly fee period of 30 days would be 30 usd. You can use trading signals without insurance also but then it Will be 30 USD monthly fee.The trader who's using 100$ margin for each trade for one month period.Total payment for one month 30 days. Margin 100$ + insurance coverage per trade 20% +monthly fee 30$ 100+20+30= 150$  Someone who's trusted and well known can hold insurance funds maybe bitcointalk admin but then i have to give the list of wallets to admin wich ones need to be refunded by insurance funds.Also If here are some good traders who can give decent results then we want you in our team you have opportunity to join first time project like this but you have to be good becouse better results we get from our trading the less insurance we have to pay out. I been in crypto trading about 7 years so me as trader myself only knows best what the other traders need.",

The only one who can trade in this market will never lose, I think only CZ because he's the one behind the scenes who are watching our every trade, and he might be doing something that we don't know, but he knows  .If you are confident with your talents, I recommend that you do not need to contribute to the community but give it to your family and loved ones first, they will be very grateful to you.",

I'm backing this up. You could get trust by doing so. Maybe you will be able to really build a big community of traders with this. Refunding is a great offer, no one does this but OP.When testimonies flood in this thread telling OP made them richer in the time of recession, I'd bet my bottom dollar. But I'm still waiting for what OP is hoping to get in return, he hasn't said yet.",

Incase if I enter a trade and I lose, am I going to be paid back the amount I lose? Or do you mean if I can follow your trading signals then am not going to ever lose in any trade I enter? I think you should explain better because I don't know how my trades will be covered by insurance, I haven't seen this kind of offer before. If people are planning to join your signal group is it free or you are still going to ask people to pay? Or maybe you provided the offer just to encourage people to pay for your trading signal. I don't believe in trading signal and I won't encourage anyone to follow the signal.",
