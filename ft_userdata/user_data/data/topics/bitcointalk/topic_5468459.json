There are some basic facts that you should check when using a bitcoin ATM.1. Try not to use it on night or use it in a place where it's not solitary. Bitcoin ATM can be an easy target for criminals.2. Inspect the ATM that it's tempered or not. 3. Keep an eye on the transaction fees as well. Sometimes it can be insanely high.",

I just want to know if there's any heads up or I should avoid it and pay in Bitcoin without using an ATM? Thanks Both the methods of Bitcoin ATM or paying in Bitcoin are good and effective. But here are the security and privacy matters that come. In using Bitcoin security and privacy both matter and I think security more. How let's talk about it. When you use the Bitclon ATM one will be confirmed whether it will be located in public or separately. If you use it in public it may be possible that someone can easily scam you by saying 'I will help you use the ATM ' and in this way, they will keep all your access, in another case if it is located separately it may provide a good chance to criminals and theft to take your funds on gunpoint. However, this is not applicable everywhere as we are not aware of your location so that is why we giving you a general overview, Here I am giving you some tips when you are willing to use Bitcoin ATM please make sure of it.1-Sometimes bitcoin ATMs charge a higher fee so look at it before doing any transaction.2-As I told you Bitcoin ATMs are located in public places so do not let anyone to know your personal information.3-Take precautions while using Bitcoin ATMs.4-If you are using it at night take your friends with yourself.5-If you have any problems contact the ATM operators on an immediate basis.",

Even more, depending on the country/region, they may ask KYC details (some for any amounts, some for greater than x, some not at all)..Hmm, that's weird I've never heard of it before as even on the ATM they can ask for the KYC but does it matter where are you processing your transaction, already reveals your identity in some aspects.OP I think it better to check for the ATM's legitimacy by checking whether it's tempted or not.. As here in last week I had visited 2 3 cases of ATM scams where the ATM was tempered but that was obviously not a Bitcoin ATM. As per reports until now there was the involvement of the insider. I don't think still they will be able to take any sort of strict action against him due to his supporters back to him. I have never used any Bitcoin ATM still I think it would be interesting to use it at least once.BEcasue transaction fees are high according to most of the responses it really isn't worth transacting with ATH most of the time, there are some good alternatives.",

Thanks In some locations, Bitcoin ATM service providers are few and this has made the market less competitive. This has made most of these service providers charge high fees. Just as bank ATMs have technical or software issues, Bitcoin ATMs can also malfunction. So you can be disappointed by poor service. Don't forget that his service can expose you to scams. Your details can be recorded through your transaction. Using an ATM in an unsafe country might be dangerous. I will not use this service in my location because people see Bitcoin owners are millionaires.  Using the service in a public place might attract the attention of criminals.",

If the ATM is in a public place then it might not be a problem to use it. I hesitate to use ATMs at night because there is no security or active police. While the thieves are so much. Even on a bright day, thieves don't hesitate to loot people. In our country ATMs are near to banks and when a person goes there for any withdrawals the guards inform the thieves about the money the person carrying. Just to clarify, I am talking about fiat ATMs, not BTC ATMs because we don't have any BTC ATMs in our country. I have only one suggestion for the OP, if he is using the BTC ATM for the first time then just watch a tutorial on YT and you will be ready to use it, don't trust on friends or relatives with your money, and don't even take them with you, to withdraw the cash either its from BTC ATMs or Fiat ATMs.",

I just want to know if there's any heads up or I should avoid it and pay in Bitcoin without using an ATM? Thanks I recommend you to avoid Bitcoin ATM's for selling and buying of Bitcoin because they aren't secure at all and you can lose your money and other private information if someone has installed malware in those ATM machines. The fees of those Bitcoin ATM's are so high which range from 5% to 15% or even more sometimes. It's always better to pay directedly with Bitcoin instead of going through the route of Bitcoin ATM's. I don't think that it's smart enough to pay that higher percentage of fees if you have direct Bitcoin payment option.Some of those Bitcoin ATM's may require KYC information as well and that's not acceptable for many people who want to make transactions with privacy. Paying directly via Bitcoin wallet is the best choice in your case and I recommend you to pay directly with Bitcoin.",

In my place, they take a 7% commission when you're selling bitcoin. You become a target for criminals, and in case these two aren't discouraging enough, you're forced to submit KYC if you're going to cash out more than an upper limit.

I just want to know if there's any heads up or I should avoid it and pay in Bitcoin without using an ATM? Thanks The most concern about using Bitcoin ATMs really are the fees just as said by everyone. But if you're for the experience or just a one time thing, you do it. Because who knows if you're going to like that and you'll just ignore the fees from it. They're convenient to use and much pretty treat the fee just the way it is with that kind of service. But there is a solution to this, you have your cash so you enjoy your journey on that city and at the same time, prepare your wallet with a bitcoin so you can pay directly with those restaurants or shops by just scanning it without having to pay a fee. And again, if you're just like to enjoy the whole experience from doing so, you just have to consider the fee if it hurts you or not.",

I just want to know if there's any heads up or I should avoid it and pay in Bitcoin without using an ATM? Thanks Apart from the high fees, I think the major concern you should have is security and privacy. Since you’re new to the city, you should research the area to know if it’s safe. You can be too careful about safety, where there is money expect to find dangerous people may be lurking around with the intent to take it. Bitcoin ATMs ask for kyc and phone number verification, there is also the possibility that hidden cameras are installed in the machine so if you’re a person who has been working hard to keep his bitcoin history hidden and private, using a Bitcoin ATM may not be something you would want.",

I just want to know if there's any heads up or I should avoid it and pay in Bitcoin without using an ATM? It is not smart idea. You don't have to rely on Bitcoin ATMs for spending your bitcoin.A biggest reason is Bitcoin ATMs usually charge you very expensive fee that I am damn sure I will not use it if it is not my last option.Alternatively, why you don't make your life more easier by cashing out your bitcoin, having cash in hands and use them when you are traveling. If you can use bitcoin directly, it is good. If you can not use bitcoin directly, cash is your golden choice.[List] Where to spend Bitcoin?If you are still in love with Bitcoin ATMs, see.https://coinatmradar.com/",

As someone who used BATM for years, I would suggest you to only use them as a last resort, when you don't have any other way to get cash needed. In majorify of cases you will have to go through KYC, pay exorbitantly high fees and maybe even get yourself in danger, especially if you are in unknown city.BATM used to be more popular where we didn't have so many options to buy/sell bitcoin, but fortunately things changed, even though I have to say that I miss the experience if going to BATM, initiating transaction and then sitting in a nearby bar for a beer or two while waiting for transactions to get confirmed, it was sort of ritual for me. What I don't miss though are fees and KYC for higher amounts and those two things are the reason I didn't use one for ~3 years. Then again, you might wanna try it with smaller amount just for the experience of doing it if they don't ask for KYC.",
