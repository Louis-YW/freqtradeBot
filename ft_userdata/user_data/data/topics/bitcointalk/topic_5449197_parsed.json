I won't be surprised if the fed got the info from a close friend of his, because he took them more than 10 years so they must have gotten their info from someone who knew what the man did. But in the end, Evil deeds must yield evil results, since his deed was evil it's now time for him to reap the repercussion. QuoteCouldn't he have thought of something better than a Cheetos tin? LMAOAt the time he kept it there that must have been his best choice and also it did save him from getting caught for ten years so I'd say the Cheetos tin did his job well. Most times keeping things where others would never have taught you would keep it or the most obvious place where others would thing it's stupid becomes the safest place because of others underestimating it and not bothering to even check it.",

      "body": "If it wasn't for Bitcointalk, I would've missed this news, to be honest. I suppose the tin was chosen as something you would expect to be used to store scraps for food or small miscellaneous items, but not a digital currency in enormous amounts. But since the authorities were already onto the guy, they found what they were looking for. I wonder how they tracked the guy down after all those years, and I hope the money will go into the state budget or to a charity, considering that you can't really give it back to its owners. If, as NotATether says, he decided to report a robbery, it seems he made a stupid mistake. I mean, he had tons of other money, the risk was too high.",

Good one Chem lol that comment on how bad the flaming hot cheetos are, I honestly would have to agree. At least get some Takis !! but even those aren't even that great IMO. This guy had it coming to him, he had terrible avoidance measures for not getting caught by the FEDs too lol. Surely if you're going to try and pull off a stunt like this you would put a little more thought into it, but honestly if you're not doing anything wrong then theres no reason to be running from the FEDs! So do the right thing folks   Crypto mixer might have definitely helped him tho ngl lol",
