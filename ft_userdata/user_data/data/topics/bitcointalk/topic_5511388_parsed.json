  "content": "---Proof of Share (PoS): A Decentralized and Equitable Consensus Mechanism for Mining**AbstractThe **Proof of Share (PoS)** consensus mechanism introduces a decentralized approach to cryptocurrency mining, aiming to provide equitable rewards for miners of varying hash rates. By redistributing mining power between large and small miners, PoS ensures that all participants receive fair compensation. PoS leverages a decentralized node network for monitoring, re-calibrating, and enforcing penalties, creating a system that is resistant to centralization, manipulation, and attacks, including 51% attacks. This system supports **GPU**, **CPU**, and **ASIC** mining, and offers transparency and decentralization for a more inclusive mining ecosystem.IntroductionCryptocurrency mining has become increasingly centralized, with large miners dominating the rewards, making it difficult for smaller miners to compete. **Proof of Share (PoS)** addresses this issue by redistributing hash rate and block rewards to smaller miners, creating a fairer environment. PoS also incorporates **decentralized monitoring**, **cool-down re-calibration**, and **consensus-based enforcement**, ensuring the system remains transparent and resistant to manipulation. PoS is designed for integration with a wide range of hardware, including **GPU, CPU, and ASIC miners**, making it flexible and inclusive for all miners.Core Features of Proof of ShareDecentralized Hash Rate RedistributionAt the heart of PoS is the redistribution of hash rates:- **Large miners**: A portion of their hash rate is automatically shared with smaller miners. For example, a miner operating at 200,000 TH/s may share part of their power with a miner operating at 200 GH/s.- **Smaller miners**: Those meeting the minimum threshold (12 TH/s) benefit from this redistribution, receiving a boost in their mining power. Smaller miners that don’t meet the threshold can share power with other smaller miners.  This creates a balanced system where powerful miners still receive block rewards, but the system favors fairness, preventing domination by a single entity.Network of Decentralized NodesPoS operates through a **decentralized network of nodes** that handle core system operations like monitoring, recalibrating hash rates, and enforcing penalties. This decentralized structure removes the need for a central authority, ensuring transparency, security, and equitable decision-making across the network.Distributed Monitoring: Each node monitors mining activities within its network, logging data such as miner performance, hash rates, and behavior.- **Cross-Verification**: The data from each node is cross-verified by other nodes, ensuring consistency and preventing manipulation.- **Consensus-Based Enforcement**: Decisions regarding penalties, recalibration, and rewards are made through a consensus mechanism across multiple nodes, preventing any single entity from exerting undue influence.Re-calibration and Cool-down MechanismPoS includes a **15-minute cool-down** mechanism to maintain system stability without interrupting mining operations.- **Bot 1**: Re-calibrates hash rates after the cool-down, reviewing logs from **Bot 2** to detect any malicious behavior. Bot 1 can issue penalties, such as banning bad actors, based on consensus from other nodes.- **Bot 2**: During the cool-down, Bot 2 continues to monitor and log hash rates, ensuring mining power remains unaffected. If any irregularities are detected, Bot 2 can impose temporary hash rate limits on bad actors, but only Bot 1, with consensus from other nodes, can ban them.This dual-bot system allows for continuous monitoring and re calibration without affecting the miners’ productivity, ensuring smooth operation and error prevention.Decentralized Governance and PenaltiesThe decentralized nature of PoS extends to its governance and penalty system:- **Stake-Based Voting**: Miners and node operators can stake a portion of their mining power or rewards to participate in the governance of the system. Key decisions, such as policy changes or penalty enforcement, are made through voting, ensuring fairness and transparency.- **Consensus on Penalties**: Penalties for bad actors, such as banning or reducing hash rates, are not imposed by a single node. Multiple nodes must agree (consensus) before penalties are enforced, ensuring that no single entity can unjustly affect a miner’s earnings or status in the pool.Security Through DecentralizationPoS enhances security by decentralizing critical functions:- **Resistant to 51% Attacks**: By redistributing hash rates and enforcing consensus-based penalties, PoS prevents any single miner from gaining control of the network, reducing the risk of 51% attacks.- **Prevention of Manipulation**: The decentralized node network logs and cross-verifies all mining activity. Any attempt by a miner to manipulate their hash rate is quickly detected, flagged, and acted upon through the consensus mechanism.- **Fault Tolerance**: Since the system is run by multiple nodes, it is resilient to individual node failures. If one node goes offline, others can continue to operate without affecting the overall network stability.Transparent Logging and AuditingEvery action taken by a miner or node is logged and stored across multiple nodes. This decentralized ledger allows for full transparency, as the logs are accessible to the entire network and cannot be tampered with by a single party. Regular audits are performed through the decentralized node system, ensuring that miners and nodes adhere to the rules of the system.Integration with Mining HardwareThe Proof of Share system is designed to integrate seamlessly with various mining hardware:- **GPU, CPU, and ASIC miners** are all supported.- Re-calibration and optimization occur consistently across all hardware platforms, ensuring fairness in hash rate distribution regardless of the equipment being used.This multi-hardware integration enables a wide range of participants to contribute to the network, fostering inclusivity and expanding the pool of miners.Benefits of PoS and DecentralizationFair Mining EnvironmentPoS creates a fairer mining ecosystem by ensuring that smaller miners receive a portion of block rewards. This redistribution encourages broader participation and keeps mining competitive for miners of all sizes.Decentralization and Transparency- **No central authority**: All decisions are made through consensus, and no single entity can control the system. Transparency is built into the decentralized nodes and logging system, making all mining activities visible and verifiable.  Security and Resistance to AttacksThe decentralized nature of PoS, combined with its consensus mechanism, makes it difficult for bad actors to manipulate the system. The hash rate redistribution and constant re-calibration ensure that the network remains secure and resistant to centralization and attacks.Conclusion**Proof of Share (PoS)** introduces a new paradigm in cryptocurrency mining by decentralizing the distribution of mining power and rewards. Through a decentralized node network, PoS ensures that no single miner or authority can control the system, making it fairer, more secure, and transparent. The system’s integration with various mining hardware, combined with its decentralized governance and enforcement, positions PoS as a forward-thinking solution to the challenges of centralized mining.The PoS system offers a promising future for a **truly decentralized, transparent, and fair mining network** where all participants, regardless of their hash rate, can benefit from mining rewards.You can join here Discord if your interested to because i want this to be community based project where it developed by all of us plus i would love to hear user inputs i think it will be fun project https://discord.gg/eKzYCJmffE",

Thank you for your feedback on my Proof of Share proposal. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some points and demonstrate how my idea addresses key issues in the current mining landscape.Addressing Existing Fairness in Reward DistributionWhile current systems do offer rewards based on hashrate, they often favor larger operations that can afford high-hashrate equipment. Proof of Share aims to level the playing field by encouraging larger miners to share a portion of their resources with smaller miners. This collaborative approach allows smaller participants to compete more effectively and reap greater rewards without needing to invest heavily in expensive equipment.Competition Among MinersI understand the concern that my proposal may simply increase the number of smaller mining units. However, Proof of Share fundamentally alters competitive dynamics by fostering cooperation rather than competition. By allowing powerful miners to share their hashing power, we create a supportive environment where small miners can achieve better rewards through collaboration, leading to a more balanced mining ecosystem.Individual Treatment of MinersWhile each mining device is treated as an individual entity, Proof of Share emphasizes the power of collective effort. This system allows small miners to benefit from the resources of larger miners, promoting a network of shared success. The goal is to enhance community engagement and create opportunities for smaller miners to thrive alongside larger entities.Addressing Potential Diminishing ReturnsI recognize the concern that bonuses might diminish as more miners adopt the same strategy. However, Proof of Share promotes a sustainable model by encouraging ongoing collaboration. As small miners band together and form networks, they can adjust their strategies to ensure fair rewards. This adaptability fosters an ecosystem where small miners can continue to benefit over time.Clarifying My IntentionsI want to assure you that the intent behind Proof of Share is to create a more equitable mining environment, not to exploit it for personal gain. By empowering larger miners to assist smaller ones, we can cultivate a community that values shared success. The focus is on collaboration, mutual support, and promoting a culture that benefits all participants.I appreciate your insights and hope this response clarifies how Proof of Share addresses the current limitations in the mining space. I believe this concept can lead to a more equitable and inclusive future for all miners, and I’m excited to continue the conversation around it.",

I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some points and address your concerns about fairness and efficiency within the current mining ecosystem.    While the current Pay-Per-Share (PPS) system is effective, it often disproportionately rewards larger miners who can deploy significant hashing power. Your assertion that having 10,000 mini ASICs and 1,000 full ASICs yields equal results overlooks how share distribution works in practice. Larger miners typically receive more shares due to their capacity, which can lead to an imbalance that favors their investment, thereby limiting opportunities for smaller miners.    My proposal for the PoS system aims to create a more equitable environment where smaller miners can leverage the hashing power of larger miners. By allowing a redistribution of a portion of the hashing power from larger miners to smaller ones, we promote collaboration rather than competition. This approach seeks to level the playing field, enabling smaller miners to achieve a fairer share of the rewards that they might not attain independently.    You raise a valid point about devices working independently; however, the PoS system doesn’t intend for multiple devices to work on the same task simultaneously. Instead, it proposes a model where resources are shared in a manner that optimizes the contributions of all miners, ensuring that those who can contribute do so without feeling like they are at a permanent disadvantage.    My intention is not to exploit others' work for a free ride but to facilitate a cooperative ecosystem that recognizes the contributions of all participants, regardless of their hardware capabilities. The PoS system is designed to provide incentives for larger miners to support smaller miners, creating a community where everyone benefits rather than just a select few.      While you argue that my proposal is not new or beneficial, it introduces a unique perspective on cooperative mining that has not been widely explored. The idea of pooling resources to enhance collective earning potential offers potential benefits that traditional models have not fully harnessed, leading to a more diverse and resilient mining ecosystem.        You are correct that if a system like PoS were implemented, it would require careful management to ensure fairness and balance. However, any system, including the current PPS model, faces similar challenges. By addressing these concerns proactively, we can design a system that evolves with the changing dynamics of the mining community.",

Larger miners typically receive more shares due to their capacity, which can lead to an imbalance that favors their investment, thereby limiting opportunities for smaller miners.you really dont know how things work1000 asics of 230thash each is 230petahash10,000 asics of 23thash each is 230petahashi dont think you understand how mining works. how its a random number that needs to be found which has the same odds of finding if its a pool of230peta made of 1000 asics, or a pool of 230peta made of 10,000 asics  its the same amount of hashrate so the same odds of finding the winning hash and also the same rating of sharesyes a 23thash asic is 10x less than a 230thash asic, thus they get 10x less share per unit because they do FAIRLY 10x less of the jobif we were to say a fair system of lets say miners get EG 100sat per thash meaning a 230thash miner gets 23000sats in a fair system a 23thash asic would get 2300satshowever you want large miners to get 90sats per thash and mini asics to get 110sats per thashand i must emphasise this once againif this warped system ever occured. everyone would flip to using mini asics and just have 10 more units to stay on par of total hashpower, and suddenly the rating wont be 110sat per thash advantage. but diluted back to being the 100sat per thash because everyone is then taking the advantage and the share system goes back to normi dont think you fully understand the economics of how things play outin 2010 when cpu solo changed to GPU. the paradigm advantage change was short lived until everyone was GPU mining. and then short lived advantage of pool mining until everyone was pool mining..overall your only scheme/game/agenda is to pretend you are offering a better system(its not) just so you can hope you can be a unique jesus and the only recipient of an advantage.. not realising if the system was implemented the advantage is soon quashed by everyone doing the same and then when everyone is using small asics there is no bonus as they all are sharing from the same reward. and no, dont even try to suggest increasing the block reward as a compensatory route to the bonus, as that breaks the limited supply of the 21m coin rule..anyway when everyone takes advantage and quashes the advantage, then soon after the advantage is quashed the asic owners then just go back to using larger asics againIt's amusing how confidently you assert your position while missing fundamental aspects of mining. Let's break down your points with clarity and perhaps a dash of humor to highlight the gaps in your understanding.    Hashrate Equivalence: You claim that “1000 ASICs of 230 TH each is 230 petahash, and 10,000 ASICs of 23 TH each is also 230 petahash.” True, but let's not confuse quantity with quality. While both configurations produce the same hashrate, the distribution of shares is vastly different. The reality is that larger miners typically receive more shares simply due to their higher number of devices, giving them an edge in reward accumulation. This advantage doesn't just vanish because you say it does; it’s a fundamental aspect of how current mining pools operate.    Understanding Randomness in Mining: Your assertion that the odds of finding a winning hash are the same in both scenarios overlooks a critical detail: share distribution. More ASICs mean more shares being generated and awarded, thus skewing the rewards in favor of the miner with more devices. This is where your claim about equal odds falls flat; it’s not just about hashrate—it’s about how shares are allocated and how those shares translate into rewards.    Share Ratings and Fairness: You posit a scenario where a miner receives 100 sat per TH, leading to a fair distribution of rewards. However, if we entertain your flawed logic that larger miners receive a higher rate (90 sat per TH), while smaller miners receive 110 sat, we see a direct incentive for miners to switch to smaller units. This isn't a flaw in PoS; it's a feature designed to promote fairness and competition. Your argument effectively undermines itself!    Historical Context of Mining Shifts: When you reference the shift from CPU to GPU mining, you conveniently ignore how these transitions always create new equilibria. Just because a paradigm shift occurs doesn’t mean it’s permanent or unchangeable. The mining landscape is ever-evolving. In the case of PoS, if everyone adapts to smaller ASICs, new incentives will emerge, and the market will adjust accordingly, as it always does.    Misguided Economic Theories: You assert, “I don’t think you fully understand the economics.” Quite the contrary! PoS is designed to counteract the centralization of mining power by redistributing resources. By sharing a portion of their hashrate, larger miners can support smaller miners, creating a more sustainable and equitable mining environment. This isn’t just theory—it’s a practical response to the centralization that has plagued mining since its inception.    Temporary Advantages: Your suggestion that advantages will always revert to larger ASICs ignores the fluid nature of the market. Advantages are temporary in cryptocurrency mining; history shows us that as technology and strategies evolve, so do mining dynamics. The system PoS proposes aims to continuously level the playing field, not maintain a status quo that benefits a select few.    On Block Rewards and Supply Integrity: Your statement regarding block rewards and the “21 million coin rule” displays a lack of understanding of how PoS operates within these constraints. PoS can facilitate fairness without altering the fundamental supply limits, ensuring that incentives remain aligned with network health.In conclusion, while I appreciate your passionate critique, it’s clear that your grasp of mining mechanics is somewhat limited. I invite you to explore more about how PoS operates",

      "body": "This is not a completely new concept, Proof of Stake systems work somewhat in the same way, choosing validators based on how much they \"stake\". This reduces energy use from block creation drastically compared to Proof of Work systems, which have very high power consumption for mining. Hence, PoS is much greener compared to PoW. The most prevalent issue of PoS, though, is still centralization, given that larger participants in the network, with more coins, have greater control and may become an unfair advantage in the near future.On the other hand, it is great that PoS claims to solve such issues as 51% attacks and ultimately maintain decentralization; however, PoS systems are not failproof either. Although hash rate distribution would alleviate the pains of smaller miners, managing decentralization by an automated hash rate redistribution might be hard to keep at scale, especially when larger players still have huge control.I am very interesting if OP could gives details what can distinguish and what does Proof of Share offer that other system has not provide yet.",
