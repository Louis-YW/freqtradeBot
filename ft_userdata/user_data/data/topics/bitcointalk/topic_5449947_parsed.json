If it's hidden behind a button that you have to click so it'd reveal the code, \"YES\", it's a risky move but if it explicitly mentions the code, I don't think something bad can happen by typing it into the discount code field of Ledger.Quote from: jerry0 on April 24, 2023, 03:46:57 AMSaw these codes posted on reddit years ago.Then it's safe to say that all of them are already expired.Update: Changed can into can't!",

      "body": "You can just lurk around this sub since people will usually make a new thread if there is a new price cut or something similar. Not limited to Nano S or any Ledger product too. AFAIK you can also browse around their website since they don't really hide/make their discount a secret thing. Btw, why are you looking for a Nano S plus? IIRC, you already have a Nano S. Have you considered using other wallets or building your own?",
